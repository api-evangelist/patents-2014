This invention was made under a CRADA SC11 01780.00 between CARBO Ceramics Inc. and Sandia National Laboratories operated for the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to hydraulic fracturing of geological formations and more particularly to electrically conductive proppants used in the hydraulic fracture stimulation of gas oil or geothermal reservoirs. Methods described herein involve making the electrically conductive proppants for use in electromagnetic methods for detecting locating and characterizing such proppants.

In order to stimulate and more effectively produce hydrocarbons from downhole formations especially formations with low porosity and or low permeability induced fracturing called frac operations hydraulic fracturing or simply fracing of the hydrocarbon bearing formations has been a commonly used technique. In a typical frac operation fluids are pumped downhole under high pressure causing the formations to fracture around the borehole creating high permeability conduits that promote the flow of the hydrocarbons into the borehole. These frac operations can be conducted in horizontal and deviated as well as vertical boreholes and in either intervals of uncased wells or in cased wells through perforations.

In cased boreholes in vertical wells for example the high pressure fluids exit the borehole via perforations through the casing and surrounding cement and cause the formations to fracture usually in thin generally vertical sheet like fractures in the deeper formations in which oil and gas are commonly found. These induced fractures generally extend laterally a considerable distance out from the wellbore into the surrounding formations and extend vertically until the fracture reaches a formation that is not easily fractured above and or below the desired frac interval. The directions of maximum and minimum horizontal stress within the formation determine the azimuthal orientation of the induced fractures. Normally if the fluid sometimes called slurry pumped downhole does not contain solids that remain lodged in the fracture when the fluid pressure is relaxed then the fracture re closes and most of the permeability conduit gain is lost.

These solids called proppants are generally composed of sand grains or ceramic particles and the fluid used to pump these solids downhole is usually designed to be sufficiently viscous such that the proppant particles remain entrained in the fluid as it moves downhole and out into the induced fractures. Prior to producing the fractured formations materials called breakers which are also pumped downhole in the frac fluid slurry reduce the viscosity of the frac fluid after a desired time delay enabling these fluids to be easily removed from the fractures during production leaving the proppant particles in place in the induced fractures to keep them from closing and thereby substantially precluding production fluid flow there through.

The proppants can also be placed in the induced fractures with a low viscosity fluid in fracturing operations referred to as water fracs or slick water fracs . The fracturing fluid in water fracs is water with little or no polymer or other additives. Water fracs are advantageous because of the lower cost of the fluid used. Also when using cross linked polymers it is essential that the breakers be effective or the fluid cannot be recovered from the fracture effectively restricting flow of formation fluids. Water fracs because the fluid is not cross linked do not rely on the effectiveness of breakers.

Commonly used proppants include naturally occurring sands resin coated sands and ceramic proppants. Ceramic proppants are typically manufactured from naturally occurring materials such as kaolin and bauxitic clays and offer a number of advantages compared to sands or resin coated sands principally resulting from the compressive strength of the manufactured ceramics and their highly spherical particle shape.

Although induced fracturing has been a highly effective tool in the production of hydrocarbon reservoirs the amount of stimulation provided by this process depends to a large extent upon the ability to generate new fractures or to create or extend existing fractures as well as the ability to maintain connection to the fractures through appropriate placement of the proppant. Without appropriate placement of the proppant fractures generated during the hydraulic fracturing can tend to close thereby diminishing the benefits of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. However reliable methods for detecting locating and characterizing the placement of proppant within fractures at relatively far distances from the wellbore and thus confirming whether or not such placement has been appropriate are not available.

Current state of the art proppant identification techniques are limited to relatively short distances 12 inches to 18 inches maximum from the wellbore. Radioactive and non radioactive tracers and proppants are currently used to infer the presence of proppant in the near well bore region. A better understanding of proppant placement in the far field regions of a hydraulic fracture is needed.

Previous work for massive hydraulic fracture mapping is summarized in Bartel L. C. McCann R. P. and Keck L. J. Use of potential gradients in massive hydraulic fracture mapping and characterization prepared for the 51st Annual Fall Technical Conference and Exhibition of Society of Petroleum Engineers New Orleans Oct. 3 6 1976 paper SPE 6090. In this previous work the electric potential differences were measured between two concentric circles of voltage electrodes around a vertical fracture well at the earth s surface. The well was electrically energized at the top of the well casing or at the depth of the fracture. The electrical ground was established at a well located at a distance of approximately one mile from the fracture well. At that time the fact that the grounding wire acted as a transmitting antenna was not taken into account. The water used for the fracture process contained potassium chloride KCl to enhance its electrical conductivity and the fracture was propped using non conducting sand. A 1 Hz repetition rate square wave input current waveform was used and only the voltage difference amplitudes were measured. Voltages using an elementary theory based on current leakage from the well casing and the fracture into a homogeneous earth were used to produce expected responses. Comparing the field data to results from the elementary model showed that a fracture orientation could be inferred however since the model did not account for the details of the fracture other fracture properties could not be determined using the elementary model.

A method of detecting locating and characterizing the location of the proppant as placed in a hydraulic fracture at distances of more than several inches from the cased wellbore is currently unavailable and would be beneficial. A need exists therefore for a proppant particle that can be detected and located in a hydraulic fracture. It would be particular desirable to obtain a proppant particle that is suitable for propping open a fracture and being detected in the fracture after a period of time. It would also be desirable to obtain an economical method of making such a detectable proppant particle.

In the following description numerous specific details are set forth. However it is understood that embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.

Described herein are electromagnetic EM methods for detecting locating and characterizing electrically conductive proppants used in the hydraulic fracture stimulation of gas oil or geothermal reservoirs.

An electrically conductive material such as a metal a conductive polymer conductive carbonaceous material such as graphene or a conductive nanoparticle can be added at any suitable stage in the manufacturing process of any one of these proppants to result in proppant suitable for use according to certain embodiments of the present invention. The electrically conductive material can also be added to any one of these proppants after manufacturing of the proppants. Suitable metals include aluminum tin zinc copper silver nickel gold platinum palladium rhodium and the like and can be added to result in an electrically conductive proppant having any suitable metal content.

Suitable PEDOT PSS PANI and PYY conductive polymers are commercially available from Sigma Aldrich. Certain specific embodiments of processes for coating proppant with a conductive polymer are described below in Example 2.

Suitable conducting nanoparticles include graphite graphene single or double walled carbon nanotubes or other material that when present in the nanoscale particle size range exhibits sufficient electrical conductivity to permit detection in the present invention. Such conducting nanoparticles can be added to result in a proppant having a conducting nanoparticle content of from about 0.01 wt about 0.05 wt about 0.1 wt about 0.5 wt about 1 wt about 2 wt or about 5 wt to about 6 wt about 8 wt about 10 wt about 12 wt or about 14 wt based on the weight of the electrically conductive proppant.

Ceramic proppant may also be manufactured in a manner that creates porosity in the proppant grain. A process to manufacture a suitable porous ceramic proppant is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 036 591 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In this case the electrically conductive material can be impregnated into the pores of the proppant grains to a concentration of about 0.01 wt about 0.05 wt about 0.1 wt about 0.5 wt about 1 wt about 2 wt or about 5 wt to about 6 wt about 8 wt about 10 wt about 12 wt about 15 wt or about 20 wt based on the weight of the electrically conductive proppant. Water soluble coatings such as polylactic acid can be used to coat these particles to allow for delayed timed release of conducting nano particles for detection at different stages of the fracture treatment.

The ceramic proppants can have any suitable porosity. The ceramic proppants can include an internal interconnected porosity from about 1 about 2 about 4 about 6 about 8 about 10 about 12 or about 14 to about 18 about 20 about 22 about 24 about 26 about 28 about 30 about 34 about 38 or about 45 or more. In several exemplary embodiments the internal interconnected porosity of the ceramic proppants is from about 5 to about 35 about 5 to about 15 or about 15 to about 35 . According to several exemplary embodiments the ceramic proppants have any suitable average pore size. For example the ceramic proppant can have an average pore size from about 2 nm about 10 nm about 15 nm about 55 nm about 110 nm about 520 nm or about 1 100 nm to about 2 200 nm about 5 500 nm about 11 000 nm about 17 000 nm or about 25 000 nm or more in its largest dimension. For example the ceramic proppant can have an average pore size from about 3 nm to about 30 000 nm about 30 nm to about 18 000 nm about 200 nm to about 9 000 nm about 350 nm to about 4 500 nm or about 850 nm to about 1 800 nm in its largest dimension. According to certain embodiments described herein the sintered substantially round and spherical particles are made in a continuous process while in other embodiments the particles are made in a batch process.

In one or more exemplary embodiments the electrically conductive material can be added to a ceramic proppant in its method of manufacture. Referring now to an exemplary system for implementing a continuous process for preparing sintered substantially round and spherical particles from a slurry is illustrated. The exemplary system illustrated in is similar in configuration and operation to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 440 866 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The operations performed by the exemplary system illustrated in can also be used to make the particles according to a batch process as described in Example 1 below.

In the system illustrated in an alumina containing raw material having an alumina content of from about 40 to about 55 by weight on a calcined basis is passed through a shredder which slices and breaks apart the raw material into small chunks. In some embodiments when the raw material as mined or as received referred to herein as untreated raw material is of such consistency that it can be processed as described herein without shredding the shredder may be bypassed. Raw material fed through a shredder such as is illustrated in is referred to as treated raw material.

In certain embodiments the shredder breaks apart and slices the alumina containing raw material so as to yield pieces having a diameter of less than about five inches although pieces having smaller and larger diameters can be further processed into a slurry as described herein. Shredders and numerous other devices for slicing chopping or comminuting the alumina containing raw material as well as commercial sources for same such as the Gleason Foundry Company are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The treated or untreated alumina containing raw material and water are fed to a blunger which has a rotating blade that imparts a shear force to and further reduces the particle size of the raw material to form a slurry. In a continuous process the raw material and water are continuously fed to the blunger. Blungers and similar devices for making slurries of such materials as well as commercial sources for same are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In certain embodiments the electrically conductive material is added to the alumina containing raw material and water in the blunger to result in an electrically conductive material concentration of about 0.1 to about 10.0 or about 5.0 to about 10.0 by weight of the solids content in the slurry or just prior to the formation of pellets as described below.

A sufficient amount of water is added to the blunger to result in a slurry having a solids content in the range of from about 40 to about 60 by weight. In certain embodiments a sufficient amount of water is added to the slurry such that the solids content of the slurry is from about 45 to about 55 by weight. In still other embodiments a sufficient amount of water is added to the slurry such that the solids content of the slurry is about 50 by weight. The water added to the blunger can be fresh water or deionized water. In a continuous process for preparing the slurry the solids content of the slurry is periodically analyzed and the amount of water fed to the slurry adjusted to maintain the desired solids content. Methods for analyzing the solids content of a slurry and adjusting a feed of water are well known and understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.

In certain embodiments a dispersant is added to the slurry in the blunger to adjust the viscosity of the slurry to a target range as discussed further below. In other embodiments the viscosity of the slurry in the blunger is adjusted to the target range by the addition of a dispersant and a pH adjusting reagent.

A dispersant may be added to the slurry prior to the addition of the electrically conductive material or other additives. In certain embodiments the composition includes a dispersant in an amount of from about 0.15 to about 0.30 by weight based on the dry weight of the alumina containing raw material.

Exemplary materials suitable for use as a dispersant in the compositions and methods described herein include but are not limited to sodium polyacrylate ammonium polyacrylate ammonium polymethacrylate tetra sodium pyrophosphate tetra potassium pyrophosphate polyphosphate ammonium polyphosphate ammonium citrate ferric ammonium citrate and polyelectrolytes such as a composition of ammonium polymethacrylate and water commercially available from a variety of sources such as Kemira Chemicals under the trade name C 211 Phoenix Chemicals Bulk Chemical Systems under the trade name BCS 4020 and R.T. Vanderbilt Company Inc. under the trade name DARVAN C. Generally the dispersant can be any material that will adjust the viscosity of the slurry to a target viscosity such that the slurry can be subsequently processed through one or more pressure nozzles of a fluidizer. In certain embodiments the target viscosity is less than 150 centipoises cps as determined on a Brookfield Viscometer with a 61 spindle . In other embodiments the target viscosity is less than 100 cps.

According to embodiments in which a pH adjusting reagent is used a sufficient amount of a pH adjusting reagent is added to the slurry to adjust the pH of the slurry to a range of from about 8 to about 11. In certain embodiments a sufficient amount of the pH adjusting reagent is added to the slurry to adjust the pH to about 9 about 9.5 about 10 or about 10.5. The pH of the slurry can be periodically analyzed by a pH meter and the amount of pH adjusting reagent fed to the slurry adjusted to maintain a desired pH. Methods for analyzing the pH of a slurry and adjusting the feed of the pH adjusting reagent are within the ability of those of ordinary skill in the art. Exemplary materials suitable for use as a pH adjusting reagent in the compositions and methods described herein include but are not limited to ammonia and sodium carbonate.

Generally the target viscosity of the compositions is a viscosity that can be processed through a given type and size of pressure nozzle in a fluidizer without becoming clogged. Generally the lower the viscosity of the slurry the more easily it can be processed through a given fluidizer. However the addition of too much dispersant can cause the viscosity of the slurry to increase to a point that it cannot be satisfactorily processed through a given fluidizer. One of ordinary skill in the art can determine the target viscosity for given fluidizer types through routine experimentation.

The blunger mixes the alumina containing raw material electrically conductive material water dispersant and pH adjusting reagent until a slurry is formed. The length of time required to form a slurry is dependent on factors such as the size of the blunger the speed at which the blunger is operating and the amount of material in the blunger.

From the blunger the slurry is fed to a tank where the slurry is continuously stirred and a binder is added in an amount of from about 0.2 to about 5.0 by weight based on the total dry weight of the alumina containing raw material and the electrically conductive material. In certain embodiments the binder is added in an amount of from about 0.2 to about 3.0 by weight based on the total dry weight of the alumina containing raw material and the electrically conductive material. Suitable binders include but are not limited to polyvinyl acetate polyvinyl alcohol PVA methylcellulose dextrin and molasses. In certain embodiments the binder is PVA having a molecular weight of from about 20 000 to 100 000 M. M represents the number average molecular weight which is the total weight of the polymeric molecules in a sample divided by the total number of polymeric molecules in that sample.

The tank maintains the slurry created by the blunger . However the tank stirs the slurry with less agitation than the blunger so as to mix the binder with the slurry without causing excessive foaming of the slurry or increasing the viscosity of the slurry to an extent that would prevent the slurry from being fed through the pressurized nozzles of a fluidizer.

In another embodiment the binder can be added to the slurry while in the blunger. In this embodiment the blunger optionally has variable speeds including a high speed to achieve the high intensity mixing for breaking down the raw material into a slurry form and a low speed to mix the binder with the slurry without causing the above mentioned excessive foaming or increase in viscosity.

Referring again to the tank illustrated in the slurry is stirred in the tank after addition of the binder for a time sufficient to thoroughly mix the binder with the slurry. In certain embodiments the slurry is stirred in the tank for up to about 30 minutes following the addition of binder. In other embodiments the slurry is stirred in the tank for at least about 30 minutes. In still other embodiments the slurry is stirred in the tank for more than about 30 minutes after addition of the binder.

Tank can also be a tank system comprised of one two three or more tanks Any configuration or number of tanks that enables the thorough mixing of the binder with the slurry is sufficient. In a continuous process water and one or more of dust oversize particles or undersize particles from a subsequent fluidizer or other apparatus can be added to the slurry in the tank .

From the tank the slurry is fed to a heat exchanger which heats the slurry to a temperature of from about 25 C. to about 90 C. From the heat exchanger the slurry is fed to a pump system which feeds the slurry under pressure to a fluidizer .

A grinding mill s and or a screening system s not illustrated can be inserted at one or more places in the system illustrated in prior to feeding the slurry to the fluidizer to assist in breaking any larger sized alumina containing raw material down to a target size suitable for feeding to the fluidizer. In certain embodiments the target size is less than 230 mesh. In other embodiments the target size is less than 325 mesh less than 270 mesh less than 200 mesh or less than 170 mesh. The target size is influenced by the ability of the type and or size of the pressure nozzle in the subsequent fluidizer to atomize the slurry without becoming clogged.

If a grinding system is employed it is charged with a grinding media suitable to assist in breaking the raw material down to a target size suitable for subsequent feeding through one or more pressure nozzles of a fluidizer. If a screening system is employed the screening system is designed to remove particles larger than the target size from the slurry. For example the screening system can include one or more screens which are selected and positioned so as to screen the slurry to particles that are smaller than the target size.

Referring again to fluidizer is of conventional design such as described in for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 533 829 and U.K. Patent No. 1 401 303. Fluidizer includes at least one atomizing nozzle three atomizing nozzles being shown in which is a pressure nozzle of conventional design. In other embodiments one or more two fluid nozzles are suitable. The design of such nozzles is well known for example from K. Masters Spray Drying Handbook John Wiley and Sons New York 1979 .

Fluidizer further includes a particle bed which is supported by a plate such as a perforated straight or directional plate. Hot air flows through the plate . The particle bed comprises seeds from which green pellets of a target size can be grown. The term green pellets and related forms as used herein refers to substantially round and spherical particles which have been formed from the slurry but are not sintered. When a perforated or straight plate is used the seeds also serve to obtain plug flow in the fluidizer. Plug flow is a term known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can generally be described as a flow pattern where very little back mixing occurs. The seed particles are smaller than the target size for green pellets made according to the present methods. In certain embodiments the seed comprises from about 5 to about 20 of the total volume of a green pellet formed therefrom. Slurry is sprayed under pressure through the atomizing nozzles and the slurry spray coats the seeds to form green pellets that are substantially round and spherical.

External seeds can be placed on the perforated plate before atomization of the slurry by the fluidizer begins. If external seeds are used the seeds can be prepared in a slurry process similar to that illustrated in where the seeds are simply taken from the fluidizer at a target seed size. External seeds can also be prepared in a high intensity mixing process such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 879 181 the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

According to certain embodiments external seeds are made from either a raw material having at least the same alumina content as the raw material used to make the slurry or from a raw material having more or less alumina than the raw material used to make the slurry. In certain embodiments the slurry has an alumina content that is at least 10 at least 20 or at least 30 less than that of the seeds. In other embodiments the external seeds have an alumina content less than that of the slurry such as at least 10 at least 20 or at least 30 less than that of the slurry.

Alternatively seeds for the particle bed are formed by the atomization of the slurry thereby providing a method by which the slurry self germinates with its own seed. According to one such embodiment the slurry is fed through the fluidizer in the absence of a seeded particle bed . The slurry droplets exiting the nozzles solidify but are small enough initially that they get carried out of the fluidizer by air flow and caught as dust fine particles by a dust collector which may for instance be an electrostatic precipitator a cyclone a bag filter a wet scrubber or a combination thereof. The dust from the dust collector is then fed to the particle bed through dust inlet where it is sprayed with slurry exiting the nozzles . The dust may be recycled a sufficient number of times until it has grown to a point where it is too large to be carried out by the air flow and can serve as seed. The dust can also be recycled to another operation in the process for example the tank .

Referring again to hot air is introduced to the fluidizer by means of a fan and an air heater which are schematically represented at . The velocity of the hot air passing through the particle bed is from about 0.9 meters second to about 1.5 meters second and the depth of the particle bed is from about 2 centimeters to about 60 centimeters. The temperature of the hot air when introduced to the fluidizer is from about 250 C. to about 650 C. The temperature of the hot air as it exits from the fluidizer is less than about 250 C. and in some embodiments is less than about 100 C.

The distance between the atomizing nozzles and the plate is optimized to avoid the formation of dust which occurs when the nozzles are too far away from the plate and the formation of irregular coarse particles which occurs when the nozzles are too close to the plate . The position of the nozzles with respect to the plate is adjusted on the basis of an analysis of powder sampled from the fluidizer .

The green pellets formed by the fluidizer accumulate in the particle bed . In a continuous process the green pellets formed by the fluidizer are withdrawn through an outlet in response to the level of product in the particle bed in the fluidizer so as to maintain a given depth in the particle bed. A rotary valve conducts green pellets withdrawn from the fluidizer to an elevator which feeds the green pellets to a screening system where the green pellets are separated into one or more fractions for example an oversize fraction a product fraction and an undersize fraction.

The oversize fraction exiting the screening unit includes those green pellets that are larger than the desired product size. In a continuous process the oversize green pellets may be recycled to tank where at least some of the oversize green pellets can be broken down and blended with slurry in the tank. Alternatively oversize green pellets can be broken down and recycled to the particle bed in the fluidizer . The undersize fraction exiting the screening system includes those green pellets that are smaller than the desired product size. In a continuous process these green pellets may be recycled to the fluidizer where they can be fed through an inlet as seeds or as a secondary feed to the fluidizer .

The product fraction exiting the screening system includes those green pellets having the desired product size. These green pellets are sent to a pre sintering device for example a calciner where the green pellets are dried or calcined prior to sintering. In certain embodiments the green pellets are dried to a moisture content of less than about 18 by weight or less than about 15 by weight about 12 by weight about 10 by weight about 5 by weight or about 1 by weight.

After drying and or calcining the green pellets are fed to a sintering device in which the green pellets are sintered for a period of time sufficient to enable recovery of sintered substantially round and spherical particles having one or more of a desired apparent specific gravity bulk density and crush strength. Alternatively the pre sintering device can eliminated if the sintering device can provide sufficient calcining and or drying conditions i.e. drying times and temperatures that dry the green pellets to a target moisture content prior to sintering followed by sufficient sintering conditions.

The specific time and temperature to be employed for sintering is dependent on the starting ingredients and the desired density for the sintered particles. In some embodiments sintering device is a rotary kiln operating at a temperature of from about 1000 C. to about 1600 C. for a period of time from about 5 to about 90 minutes. In certain embodiments a rotary kiln is operated at a temperature of about 1000 C. about 1200 C. about 1300 C. about 1400 C. or about 1500 C. In certain embodiments the green pellets have a residence time in the sintering device of from about 50 minutes to about 70 minutes or from about 30 minutes to about 45 minutes. After the particles exit the sintering device they can be further screened for size and tested for quality control purposes. Inert atmosphere sintering can be used to limit or prevent the oxidation of the electrically conductive material. Techniques for replacing the oxygen rich atmosphere in the sintering device with an inert gas such as argon nitrogen or helium are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally oxygen is replaced with an inert gas such that 0.005 oxygen or less remains in the sintering atmosphere.

According to certain embodiments of the present invention the electrically conductive material is coated onto the proppants. For example the electrically conductive material can be coated onto ceramic proppant after the proppant particles exit sintering device and have been further screened for size and tested for quality control measures. The coating may be accomplished by any coating technique well known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as spraying sputtering vacuum deposition dip coating extrusion calendaring powder coating transfer coating air knife coating roller coating electroless plating such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 296 012 4 812 202 and 3 617 343 the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference electroplating and brush coating.

According to several exemplary embodiments the electrically conductive material is deposited as a coating on the ceramic proppant or natural sands. Processes for electrolytic and electroless coating are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example see U.S. Pat. No. 3 556 839 the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

According to several exemplary embodiments and in accordance with conventional autocatalytic plating methods a non conductive substrate such as a ceramic proppant sample is suitably cleaned and roughened then sensitized and activated by successive immersions in an aqueous solution of a reducing agent and solutions of catalytic metal such as stannous chloride and palladium chloride and rinsing in water following each such immersion. Thereafter the substrate can be immersed in the plating bath heated to a temperature of between 55 95 C. The bath can include for example an aqueous solution containing a salt of nickel and a phosphorous containing reducing agent such as sodium hypophosphite in the presence of salts such as sodium citrate and sodium acetate where the pH of the solution is adjusted to a value of between 4 and 6. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any conventional electroless nickel copper silver or gold plating bath solution may be utilized such as those that are commercially available from suppliers such as Uyemura Transene or Caswell. After immersion for a period of about 1 to about 30 minutes the bath is substantially exhausted and a film of nickel ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 microns in thickness is deposited on the surface of the substrate.

After immersion for a period of about 1 to about 30 minutes the bath is substantially exhausted and a film of copper ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 microns in thickness is deposited on the substrate.

The conventional autocatalytic plating methods however can use acidic palladium solutions that may oxidize active metal expressed in the native proppant surface and therefore can lead to poor deposition of metal onto the proppant surface. It has been found that incorporating a conditioning step into an electroless coating method can improve the deposition of metal onto the proppant surface.

Referring now to a flow chart is depicted showing steps of a process for electroless coating of the electrically conductive material onto proppant utilizing a conditioning step.

The second washing solution can be the same as or similar to the first washing solution and can include an aqueous solution such as water or an organic phase solution such as a liquid hydrocarbon. The second washing solution can also have a sensitizer which aids the activator in the subsequent step. The sensitizer can be any agent that reduces the activator such as tin chloride sodium borohydride or sodium hypophosphite or any other known reducing agent. In one or more exemplary embodiments the second washing solution does not contain the sensitizer. The sensitizer step would be followed by another rinse step but in some embodiments may be omitted.

Washed proppant via line can be withdrawn from the turbidity reduction unit and introduced to one or more catalyst reduction units where the washed proppant via line can be contacted with an activation solution.

The activation solution can have a pH of about 7.1 about 7.2 about 7.4 about 7.6 or about 7.8 to about 8 about 8.5 about 9 about 9.5 about 10 about 11 about 12 or about 13 or more.

Rinsed proppant via line can be withdrawn from the rinse unit and introduced to one more metallization units where the rinsed proppant via line can be subjected to metal plating. In the metallization unit the rinsed proppant via line can be immersed in a plating bath solution having a temperature of about 20 C. about 35 C. about 50 C. about 60 C. or about 70 C. to about 75 C. about 80 C. about 90 C. about 95 C. about 100 C. about 110 C. or about 120 C. or more under a residence time of about 1 min about 2 min about 4 min about 8 min about 12 min or about 14 min to about 16 min about 20 min about 25 min about 30 min about 45 min or about 60 min or more and or until the bath is substantially exhausted. After immersion a film of electrically conductive material ranging from about 10 nanometers nm about 50 nm about 100 nm about 250 nm or about 400 nm to about 500 nm about 600 nm about 700 nm about 800 nm about 900 nm about 1 000 nm or about 1 200 nm or more can be substantially uniformly coated onto the rinsed proppant to provide the electrically conductive proppant.

The plating bath solution can be an aqueous solution containing water or an organic phase solution containing one or more hydrocarbons. The plating bath solution can be basic or acidic and can include a metal salt a complexing agent a reducing agent and a buffer. For example the plating bath solution can include a salt of nickel such as nickel sulfate nickel sulphate hexahydrate and nickel chloride. The complexing agent can include acetate succinate aminoacetate malonate pyrophosphate malate or citrate or any combination thereof. The reducing agent can include sodium borohydride dimethylamine borane or hydrazine or any combination thereof. The buffer can include acetic acid propionic acid glutaric acid succinic acid or adipic acid or any combination thereof. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any conventional electroless nickel copper silver or gold plating bath solution can also be utilized such as those that are commercially available from suppliers such as Uyemura Transene Caswell and Metal Chem.

Additional and or alternative steps can be employed in the electroless plating process. Referring now to a flow chart is depicted showing steps of a process for electroless coating of the electrically conductive material onto proppant in which alternative activation and metal deposition steps are depicted. Proppant particles can be subjected to alkaline conditioning which can be the same as or similar to the alkaline conditioning in the pretreatment unit to provide conditioned proppant particles.

After being subjected to the alkaline conditioning step the conditioned proppant particles can be subjected to an activation step prior to electroless metal deposition . The conditioned particles can be sensitized using a sensitizer solution of tin II to produce sensitized particles. After subsequent exposure to palladium II activator solution palladium II is reduced to palladium metal Pd Pdon the surface of the sensitized particles and tin II is oxidized to tin IV Sn Sn . An accelerator solution can be used to remove oxidized tin IV after exposure to palladium II activator solution and prior to electroless metal deposition . Alternative embodiments involve a combined tin IV and palladium II activator and sensitizer colloidal suspension which can be followed by the accelerator solution . The accelerator solution can be an aqueous solution and can include one or more accelerator agents including but not limited to one or more organic sulfide compounds such as bis sodium sulfopropyl disulfide 3 mercapto 1 propanesulfonic acid sodium salt N N dimethyl dithiocarbamyl propylsulfonic acid sodium salt or 3 S isothiuronium propyl sulfonate and mixtures thereof. Other suitable accelerator agents can include but are not limited to thiourea allylthiourea acetylthiourea and pyridine and the like.

In certain embodiments specific to proppant particle surfaces the alkaline conditioning can enable activation using only the Pd activator as shown in step . The conditioned particles are activated using a solution of any suitable palladium salt such as palladium chloride or palladium ammonium chloride in a concentration of from about 0.1 about 0.5 about 1 about 5 about 10 about 15 or about 20 to about 25 about 30 about 35 about 40 or about 50 or more milligrams Pd per liter where the pH of the solution can be adjusted between 7 and 14 using any suitable bases such as for example sodium hydroxide.

In one or more exemplary embodiments intrinsic surface activation can be accomplished prior to electroless metal deposition . In this embodiment iron or any other suitable metal ion incorporated into the proppant particles during firing or sintering that are expressed at the surface of the proppant can serve to directly activate the particles. In one or more exemplary embodiments the surface of the particles is activated by soaking the particles in a reducing agent solution such as sodium borohydride sodium hypophosphite or sodium cyanoborohydride where this solution can be transferred directly to the electroless plating bath with the particles still wet from the solution or dried onto the particles prior to electroless metal plating or rinsed completely from the particles.

Ceramic proppant particles can contain a significant amount of oxidized iron. In one or more exemplary embodiments of intrinsic surface activation these iron moieties can be reduced to elemental iron or other reduced form iron II which is catalytically active to copper nickel and other noble metal electroless plating solutions. By utilizing the native iron content intrinsic to the particle it is possible to plate onto the particles without Pd activators. The reduction of surface iron ions to atomic iron can occur within a sintering device such as sintering device or subsequent to sintering by maintaining a reducing environment in the kiln which is characterized by the presence of carbon monoxide or other products of partial combustion. Iron on the surface of the proppant particles can also be reduced after manufacturing by exposing the surfaces of the proppant particles to carbon monoxide or hydrogen at any suitable temperatures such as for example about 200 C. about 300 C. about 400 C. about 500 C. or about 600 C. to about 750 C. about 900 C. about 1 100 C. or about 1 500 C.

After particle activation activated proppant can be converted into electrically conductive proppant by electroless metal deposition . Processes for electrolytic and electroless coating are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 556 839 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. According to several exemplary embodiments and in accordance with conventional autocatalytic or electroless plating methods the activated proppant sample can be coated with metal and metal alloys by various methods.

After activation the substrate can be immersed in submerged in or otherwise contacted with a plating bath of the electroless metal deposition to provide the electrically conductive proppant . The plating bath can be heated to a temperature of from about 35 C. about 45 C. about 55 C. about 65 C. or about 75 C. to about 85 C. about 95 C. about 105 C. or about 120 C. or more. In one or more embodiments the plating bath can be or include an acidic nickel containing bath with a high phosphorous content about 5 wt to about 12 wt phosphorous by weight of the resulting nickel phosphorous alloy film . The high phosphorous content bath can include for example an aqueous solution containing a salt of nickel and a phosphorous containing reducing agent such as sodium hypophosphite in the presence of salts such as sodium citrate and sodium acetate. The pH of the high phosphorous content bath solution can be from about 2 about 3 about 3.5 about 4 or about 4.5 to about 5 about 5.5 about 6 or about 6.5.

In one or more embodiments the plating bath can be an alkaline nickel containing bath with a low phosphorous content about 1 wt to about 4.9 wt phosphorous by weight of the resulting nickel phosphorous alloy film . The pH of the alkaline plating bath with a low phosphorous content can be from about 7 about 7.5 about 8 about 8.5 or about 9 to about 10 about 10.5 about 11 about 12 or about 13 or more. The alkaline plating bath can chelate free nickel ions to prevent solution reactivity with Pd as can occur with Pd solution drag out and therefore offer a preferred reaction environment for high surface area materials such as ceramic proppant. Alkaline plating solutions can require relatively longer periods of time to plate but can lead to thinner contiguous coatings with higher conductivity which may enhance electromagnetic detection. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that any conventional electroless nickel copper silver or gold plating bath solution may be utilized with any range of pH such as those that are commercially available from suppliers such as Metal Chem Enthone Uyemura Transene or Caswell. In one or more exemplary embodiments the plating bath can be or include alkaline electroless copper containing formaldehyde as a reducing agent. In one or more exemplary embodiments the plating bath can include electroless noble metals such as silver gold and platinum. For example the plating bath can be or include a silver nitrate solution.

The electrically conductive proppant can have any suitable film thickness of electrically conductive material disposed on the outer surfaces thereof. In one or more embodiments the film of electrically conductive material can be from about 10 nm about 50 nm about 100 nm about 250 nm or about 400 nm to about 500 nm about 600 nm about 700 nm about 800 nm about 900 nm about 1 000 nm about 1 200 nm about 1 500 nm about 2 500 nm or about 3 500 nm or more in thickness when substantially uniformly coated onto the proppant to provide the electrically conductive ceramic proppant . In one or more exemplary embodiments the thickness of the substantially uniform coating of electrically conductive material can be from about 50 nm to about 150 nm about 400 nm to about 600 nm about 500 nm to about 1 200 nm about 550 nm to about 700 nm about 750 nm to about 1 200 nm or about 750 nm to about 1 000 nm.

The electrically conductive material can also be incorporated into a resin material. Ceramic proppant or natural sands can be coated with the resin material containing the electrically conductive material such as metal clusters metal flake metal shot metal powder metalloids metal nanoparticles quantum dots carbon nanotubes buckminsterfullerenes and other suitable electrically conductive materials to provide electrically conductive material containing proppant that can be detected by electromagnetic means. Processes for resin coating proppants and natural sands are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example a suitable solvent coating process is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 929 191 to Graham et al. the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Another suitable process such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 3 492 147 to Young et al. the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference involves the coating of a particulate substrate with a liquid uncatalyzed resin composition characterized by its ability to extract a catalyst or curing agent from a non aqueous solution. Also a suitable hot melt coating procedure for utilizing phenol formaldehyde novolac resins is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 585 064 to Graham et al. the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be familiar with still other suitable methods for resin coating proppants and natural sands.

The electrically conductive proppant can have any suitable electrical conductivity. In one or more exemplary embodiments a pack of the electrically conductive proppant can have an electrical conductivity of at least about 1 Siemens per meter S m at least about 5 S m at least about 15 S m at least about 50 S m at least about 100 S m at least about 250 S m at least about 500 S m at least about 750 S m at least about 1 000 S m at least about 1 500 S m or at least about 2 000 S m. The electrical conductivity of the pack of the electrically conductive proppant can also be from about 10 S m about 50 S m about 100 S m about 500 S m about 1 000 S m or about 1 500 S m to about 2 000 S m about 3 000 S m about 4 000 S m about 5 000 S m or about 6 000 S m. The pack of the electrically conductive proppant can have any suitable resistivity. In one or more exemplary embodiments the pack of the electrically conductive proppant can have a resistivity of less than 100 Ohm cm less than 80 Ohm cm less than 50 Ohm cm less than 25 Ohm cm less than 15 Ohm cm less than 5 Ohm cm less than 2 Ohm cm less than 1 Ohm cm less than 0.5 Ohm cm or less than 0.1 Ohm cm.

In one or more exemplary embodiments increasing a load or pressure onto the pack of the electrically conductive proppant by a factor of 2 a factor of 5 or a factor of 10 can increase the electrical conductivity of the pack of the electrically conductive proppant by at least about 50 at least about 75 at least about 100 at least about 150 or at least about 200 . In one or more exemplary embodiments increasing a load or pressure onto the pack of the electrically conductive proppant by a factor of 2 a factor of 5 or a factor of 10 can decrease the resistivity of the pack of the electrically conductive proppant by from about 1 about 2 or about 5 to about 10 about 15 or about 25 .

The electromagnetic methods described herein involve electrically energizing the earth at or near a fracture at depth and measuring the electric and magnetic responses at the earth s surface or in adjacent wells boreholes. The electromagnetic methods described herein are typically used in connection with a cased wellbore such as well shown in . Specifically casing extends within well and well extends through geological strata in a manner that has three dimensional components.

Referring now to a partial cutaway view is shown with production well extending vertically downward through one or more geological layers and horizontally in layer . While wells are conventionally vertical the electromagnetic methods described herein are not limited to use with vertical wells. Thus the terms vertical and horizontal are used in a general sense in their reference to wells of various orientations.

The preparation of production well for hydraulic fracturing typically comprises drilling a bore to a desired depth and then in some cases extending the bore horizontally so that the bore has any desired degree of vertical and horizontal components. Casing is cemented into well to seal the bore from the geological layers in . The casing has a plurality of perforations . The perforations are shown in as being located in a horizontal portion of well but those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the perforations can be located at any desired depth or horizontal distance along the bore but are typically at the location of a hydrocarbon bearing zone in the geological layers which may be within one or more of the geological layers . The hydrocarbon bearing zone may contain oil and or gas as well as other fluids and materials that have fluid like properties. The hydrocarbon bearing zone in geological layers is hydraulically fractured by pumping a fluid into casing and through perforations at sufficient rates and pressures to create fractures and then incorporating into the fluid an electrically conductive proppant which will prop open the created fractures when the hydraulic pressure used to create the fractures is released.

The hydraulic fractures shown in are oriented radially away from the metallic well casing . This orientation is exemplary in nature. In practice hydraulically induced fractures may be oriented radially as in laterally or intermediate between the two. Various orientations are exemplary and not intended to restrict or limit the electromagnetic methods described herein in any way.

According to certain embodiments of the electromagnetic method of the present invention and as shown schematically in electric current is carried down wellbore to an energizing point which will generally be located within 10 meters or more above or below of perforations in casing via a seven strand wire line insulated cable such as those which are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are widely commercially available from Camesa Wire Rochester Wire and Cable Inc. WireLine Works Novametal Group and Quality Wireline Cable Inc. A sinker bar connected to the wire line cable contacts or is in close proximity to the well casing whereupon the well casing becomes a current line source that produces subsurface electric and magnetic fields. These fields interact with the fracture containing electrically conductive proppant to produce secondary electric and magnetic fields that will be used to detect locate and characterize the proppant filled fracture .

According to certain embodiments of the electromagnetic method of the present invention and as shown schematically in a power control box is connected to casing by a cable so that electric current is injected into the fracture well by directly energizing the casing at the well head. In one embodiment the power control box is connected wirelessly by a receiver transmitter to a receiver transmitter on equipment truck . Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other suitable means of carrying the current to the energizing point may also be employed.

As shown schematically in a plurality of electric and magnetic field sensors will be located on the earth s surface in a rectangular or other suitable array covering the area around the fracture well and above the anticipated fracture . In one embodiment the sensors are connected wirelessly to a receiver transmitter on equipment truck . The maximum dimension of the array aperture in general should be at least 80 percent of the depth to the fracture zone. The sensors will measure the x y and z component responses of the electric and magnetic fields. It is these responses that will be used to infer location and characterization of the electrically conductive proppant through comparison to numerical simulations and or inversion of the measured data to determine the source of the responses. The responses of the electric and magnetic field components will depend upon the orientation of the fracture well the orientation of the fracture the electrical conductivity magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of layers the electrical conductivity magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the proppant filled fracture and the volume of the proppant filled fracture . Moreover the electrical conductivity magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the geological layers residing between the surface and the target formation layers influence the recorded responses. From the field recorded responses details of the proppant filled fracture can be determined.

Depending upon the conductivity of the earth surrounding the well casing the current may or may not be uniform as the current flows back to the surface along the well casing . According to both embodiments shown in current leakage occurs along wellbore such as along path or and returns to the electrical ground which is established at the well head. As described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 206 041 filed Aug. 9 2011 and entitled Simulating Current Flow Through a Well Casing and an Induced Fracture the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference the well casing is represented as a leaky transmission line in data analysis and numerical modeling. Numerical simulations have shown that for a conducting earth conductivity greater than approximately 0.05 siemens per meter S m the current will leak out into the formation while if the conductivity is less than approximately 0.05 S m the current will be more or less uniform along the well casing . As shown in to localize the current in the well casing electrically insulating pipe joints or pipe collars may be installed. According to the embodiment shown in an insulating joint can be installed by coating the mating surfaces and of the joint with a material having a high dielectric strength such as any one of the well known and commercially available plastic or resin materials which have a high dielectric strength and which are of a tough and flexible character adapted to adhere to the joint surfaces so as to remain in place between the joint surfaces. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 940 787 the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference such plastic or resin materials include epoxies phenolics rubber compositions and alkyds and various combinations thereof. Additional materials include polyetherimide and modified polyphenylene oxide. According to the embodiment shown in the mating ends and of the joint are engaged with an electrically insulated casing collar . The transmission line representation is able to handle various well casing scenarios such as vertical only slant wells vertical and horizontal sections of casing and single or multiple insulating gaps.

The detection location and characterization of the electrically conductive proppant in a fracture will depend upon several factors including but not limited to the net electrical conductivity of the fracture fracture volume the electrical conductivity magnetic permeability and electric permittivity of the earth surrounding the fracture and between the fracture and surface mounted sensors. The net electrical conductivity of the fracture means the combination of the electrical conductivity of the fracture the proppant and the fluids when all are placed in the earth minus the electrical conductivity of the earth formation when the fracture proppant and fluids were not present. Also the total electrical conductivity of the proppant filled fracture is the combination of the electrical conductivity created by making a fracture plus the electrical conductivity of the new modified proppant plus the electrical conductivity of the fluids plus the electro kinetic effects of moving fluids through a porous body such as a proppant pack. The volume of an overly simplified fracture with the geometric form of a plane can be determined by multiplying the height length and width i.e. gap of the fracture. A three dimensional 3D finite difference electromagnetic algorithm that solves Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism can be used for numerical simulations. In order for the electromagnetic response of a proppant filled fracture at depth to be detectable at the Earth s surface the net fracture conductivity multiplied by the fracture volume within one computational cell of the finite difference FD grid must be larger than approximately 100 Smfor a Barnett shale like model where the total fracture volume is approximately 38 m. For the Barnett shale model the depth of the fracture is 2000 m. These requirements for the numerical simulations can be translated to properties in a field application for formations other than the Barnett shale.

The propagation and or diffusion of electromagnetic EM wavefields through three dimensional 3D geological media are governed by Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism.

According to one embodiment of the present invention the measured three dimensional components of the electric and magnetic field responses can be analyzed with imaging methods such as an inversion algorithm based on Maxwell s equations and electromagnetic migration and or holography to determine proppant pack location. Inversion of acquired data to determine proppant pack location involves adjusting the earth model parameters including but not limited to the proppant location within a fracture or fractures and the net electrical conductivity of the fracture to obtain the best fit to forward model calculations of responses for an assumed earth model. As described in Bartel L. C. Integral wave migration method applied to electromagnetic data Sandia National Laboratories 1994 the electromagnetic integral wave migration method utilizes Gauss s theorem where the data obtained over an aperture is projected into the subsurface to form an image of the proppant pack. Also as described in Bartel L. C. Application of EM Holographic Methods to Borehole Vertical Electric Source Data to Map a Fuel Oil Spill Sandia National Laboratories 1993 the electromagnetic holographic method is based on the seismic holographic method and relies on constructive and destructive interferences where the data and the source wave form are projected into an earth volume to form an image of the proppant pack. Due to the long wavelengths of the low frequency electromagnetic responses for the migration and holographic methods it may be necessary to transform the data into another domain where the wavelengths are shorter. As described in Lee K. H. et al. A new approach to modeling the electromagnetic response of conductive media Geophysics Vol. 54 No. 9 1989 this domain is referred to as the q domain. Further as described in Lee K. H. et al. Tomographic Imaging of Electrical Conductivity Using Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields Lawrence Berkeley Lab 1992 the wavelength changes when the transformation is applied.

Also combining Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism with constitutive relations appropriate for time independent isotropic media yields a system of six coupled first order partial differential equations referred to as the EH system. The name derives from the dependent variables contained therein namely the electric vector E and the magnetic vector H. Coefficients in the EH system are the three material properties namely electrical current conductivity magnetic permeability and electric permittivity. All of these parameters can vary with 3D spatial position. The inhomogeneous terms in the EH system represent various body sources of electromagnetic waves and include conduction current sources magnetic induction sources and displacement current sources. Conduction current sources representing current flow in wires cables and borehole casings are the most commonly used sources in field electromagnetic data acquisition experiments.

An explicit time domain finite difference FD numerical method is used to solve the EH system for the three components of the electric vector E and the three components of the magnetic vector H as functions of position and time. A three dimensional gridded representation of the electromagnetic medium parameters referred to as the earth model is required and can be constructed from available geophysical logs and geological information. A magnitude direction and waveform for the current source are also input to the algorithm. The waveform can have a pulse like shape as in a Gaussian pulse or can be a repeating square wave containing both positive and negative polarity portions but is not limited to these two particular options. Execution of the numerical algorithm generates electromagnetic responses in the form of time series recorded at receiver locations distributed on or within the gridded earth model. These responses represent the three components of the E or H vector or their time derivatives.

Repeated execution of the finite difference numerical algorithm enables a quantitative estimate of the magnitude and frequency content of electromagnetic responses measured on the earth s surface or in nearby boreholes to be made as important modeling parameters are varied. For example the depth of current source can be changed from shallow to deep. The current source can be localized at a point or can be a spatially extended transmission line as with an electrically charged borehole casing. The source waveform can be broad band or narrow band in spectral content. Finally changes to the electromagnetic earth model can be made perhaps to assess the shielding effect of shallow conductive layers. The goal of such a modeling campaign is to assess the sensitivity of recorded electromagnetic data to variations in pertinent parameters. In turn this information is used to design optimal field data acquisition geometries that have enhanced potential for imaging a proppant filled fracture at depth.

The electric and magnetic responses are scalable with the input current magnitude. In order to obtain responses above the background electromagnetic noise a large current on the order of 10 to 100 amps may be required. The impedance of the electric cable to the current contact point and the earth contact resistance will determine the voltage that is required to obtain a desired current. The contact resistance is expected to be small and will not dominate the required voltage. In addition it may be necessary to sum many repetitions of the measured data to obtain a measurable signal level over the noise level. In the field application and modeling scenarios a time domain current source waveform can be used. A typical time domain waveform consists of an on time of positive current followed by an off time followed by an on time of negative current. In other words current then off then current then off again. The repetition rate to be used would be determined by how long the current has to be on until a steady state is reached or alternatively how long the energizing current has to be off until the fields have died to nearly zero. In this exemplary method the measured responses would be analyzed using both the steady state values and the decaying fields following the current shut off. The advantage of analyzing the data when the energizing current is zero decaying fields is that the primary field contribution response from the transmitting conductor i.e. the well casing has been eliminated and only the earth responses are measured. In addition the off period of the time domain input signal permits analysis of the direct current electrical fields that can arise from electro kinetic effects including but not limited to flowing fluids and proppant during the fracturing process. Fracture properties orientation length volume height and asymmetry will be determined through inversion of the measured data and or a form of holographic reconstruction of that portion of the earth fracture that yielded the measured electrical responses or secondary fields. According to certain embodiments a pre fracture survey will be prepared to isolate the secondary fields due to the fracture. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other techniques for analyzing the recorded electromagnetic data such as use of a pulse like current source waveform and full waveform inversion of observed electromagnetic data can also be used.

A field data acquisition experiment was conducted to test the transmission line representation of a well casing current source. The calculated electric field and the measured electric field are in good agreement. This test demonstrates that the transmission line current source implementation in the 3D finite difference electromagnetic code gives accurate results. The agreement of course depends upon an accurate model describing the electromagnetic properties of the earth. In this field data acquisition experiment common electrical logs were used to characterize the electrical properties of the earth surrounding the test well bore and to construct the earth model.

The following examples are included to demonstrate illustrative embodiments of the present invention. It will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in these examples are merely illustrative and are not limiting. Indeed those of ordinary skill in the art should in light of the present disclosure appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

Conventional low density and medium density ceramic proppants which are commercially available from CARBO Ceramics Inc. of Houston Tex. under the trade names CARBOLITE CL 20 40 CARBOHYDROPROP HP or HYDROPROP 40 80 CARBOPROP 20 40 and CARBOPROP 40 70 were coated with thin layers of metals using RF magnetron sputtering. Three metal targets were used for the depositions namely aluminum copper and nickel. The depositions were performed in a sputter chamber using a 200 W RF power a deposition pressure of 5 mTorr and an argon background flow rate of 90 sccm. The sputter chamber had three articulating 2 inch target holders that can be used to coat complex shapes. The system also had a rotating water cooled sample stage that was used in a sputter down configuration. Prior to coating the proppants deposition rates for the three metals were determined by sputtering the metals onto silicon wafers and measuring the coating thickness by scanning electron microscope SEM cross sectional analysis with a Zeiss Neon 40 SEM.

The proppants were loaded into the sputter chamber in a 12 inch diameter aluminum pan with 1 inch tall sides. Approximately 130 g of proppant was used for each coating run. This amount of proppant provided roughly a single layer of proppant on the base of the pan. The proppant was stirred during the deposition using a 6 inch long fine wire metal that was suspended above the pan and placed into contact with the proppant in the pan. The coating deposition times were doubled compared to what was determined from the silicon wafer coating thickness measurements to account for roughly coating the proppants on one side rolling them over and then coating the other side. Coatings of approximately 100 nm and approximately 500 nm were deposited on each type of proppant with each of the three metals.

Following the coating process the proppant was inspected visually and by optical microscopy. The results indicated that the proppant having a thinner coating of approximately 100 nm had a generally non uniform coating while the proppant with the thicker coating of approximately 500 nm had a uniform coating.

Conventional low density and medium density ceramic proppants which are commercially available from CARBO Ceramics Inc. of Houston Tex. under the trade names CARBOLITE 20 40 CARBOHYDROPROP 40 80 CARBOPROP 20 40 and CARBOPROP 40 70 were sensitized and activated by immersing in a 2.0 stannous chloride solution for about 3 minutes rinsing in water immersing in a 0.01 palladium chloride solution for about 3 minutes and finally thoroughly rinsing in water.

An electroless nickel plating bath solution was prepared that included 25 g of nickel sulphate hexahydrate 20 g. of sodium hypophosphate 11 g. of sodium citrate dihydrate and 10 g. of sodium acetate per liter of distilled water. The pH of the plating bath was adjusted to 5 using sulfuric acid and the plating bath was then heated to a temperature of 90 C. The previously sensitized and activated proppant samples were then added to the bath and coated for 1 30 minutes to yield an electrically conductive nickel coated proppant. Following the coating process the coated proppant samples were inspected visually and by optical microscopy.

Conventional low density and medium density ceramic proppants which are commercially available from CARBO Ceramics Inc. of Houston Tex. under the trade names CARBOLITE 20 40 CARBOHYDROPROP 40 80 CARBOPROP 20 40 and CARBOPROP 40 70 were sensitized and activated by immersing in a 2.0 stannous chloride solution for about 3 minutes rinsing in water immersing in a 0.01 palladium chloride solution for about 3 minutes and finally thoroughly rinsing in water.

An electroless copper plating bath solution was prepared that included 53 g of potassium sodium tartrate 19 g of copper sulfate 13 g of sodium hydroxide and 21 g of sodium carbonate per liter of distilled water. The plating bath was then prepared by adding 10 40 ml of formaldehyde per liter of the concentrate. The plating bath was then heated to 45 C. The previously sensitized and activated proppants were then added to the bath and coated for 1 30 minutes to yield an electrically conductive copper coated proppant. Following the coating process the coated proppant samples were inspected visually and by optical microscopy.

In this example 57 grams of CARBOLITE 20 40 was immersed in 20 ml of deionized water containing 10 mg of sodium borohydride and 1 L of Tween 20 PEG 20 sorbitan monolaurate . This mixture was then evaporated onto the surface of the particles by drying in an 85 C. oven. These dried particles were then transferred to a bath formed from the Caswell Electroless Nickel Plating Kit which is commercially available from Caswell Inc. of Lyons N.Y. where plating initiated instantaneously. This example demonstrates that the surface of the ceramic particles can be activated without the use palladium or other precious metals. It was found that the surface of the particles can be activated by soaking the particles in a reducing agent solution such as sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride where this solution can either be dried onto the particles or the particles moistened with this solution can be transferred to an electroless plating bath both of which are sufficient to induce plating.

It was found that certain ceramic mixtures used to make proppants contain a significant amount of oxidized iron or iron moieties. These iron moieties can be reduced to elemental iron which is catalytically active to copper and nickel electroless plating solutions. In this example 57 grams of CARBOPROP 20 40 was placed into an alumina boat that was inserted into a tube furnace under an atmosphere of 5 hydrogen in argon. The temperature was raised to 700 C. over a period of two hours and the CARBOPROP 20 40 was permitted to soak for two hours. The furnace was permitted to cool naturally and the sample was in a condition to be plated after removal from the furnace.

This example shows that by utilizing native iron content proppant particles can be plated without the need for additional activators such as Pd. The reduction of surface iron ions to atomic iron can be induced near the end of a manufacturing process by maintaining a reducing environment in a kiln which can be characterized by the presence of carbon monoxide or other products of partial combustion. The iron on the surface of the proppant particles can also be reduced after manufacturing by exposure to carbon monoxide or hydrogen at elevated temperatures which can be from about 300 C. to about 1100 C. Finally the iron on the surface of the particles can be reduced by placing the particles in a solution of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. After reduction of these surface iron sites the particles can be plated using electroless plating solutions.

When used as a proppant the particles described herein can be handled in the same manner as conventional proppants. For example the particles can be delivered to the well site in bags or in bulk form along with the other materials used in fracturing treatment. Conventional equipment and techniques can be used to place the particles in the formation as a proppant. For example the particles are mixed with a fracture fluid which is then injected into a fracture in the formation.

Conventional low density ceramic proppants which are commercially available from CARBO Ceramics Inc. of Houston Tex. under the trade names of CARBOLITE 20 40 and CARBOHYDROPROP 40 80 were coated with thin layers of a conductive polymer using a planetary bench mixer with a B flat beater and a heating mantle. Approximately 500 g of proppant was used for each coating run. Coatings of 0.1 by weight and 0.4 by weight of the proppant were prepared as shown in Table I below 

In each case the proppant was heated to a temperature of 150 200 C. in an oven and was added to a steel mixing bowl. An adhesion promoter such as aminopropyl triethoxy silane an amino functional coupling agent and glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxy silane a functional organosilane coupling agent was added to the heated proppant to enhance the bond between the inorganic substrate and the organic polymer. The mixing bowl was set in an external heating mantle to allow the heat to remain in the system as additives were added. The B flat beater traveled along the side of the wall surfaces of the mixing bowl in circular orbits at an intermediate speed of approximately 280 rpm while the mixing bowl stayed in place thereby allowing complete mixing in a short time. A typical batch schedule is shown in Table II below 

Additionally 0.1 and 0.4 coatings were made by adding PEDOT PSS to a phenol formaldehyde Novolac coating using a planetary mixer with B flat beater and a heating mantle as described above. Approximately 500 g of proppant was used for each coating run. For a 0.1 and 0.4 by weight coating of the proppant approximately 42 g and 167 g of PEDOT PSS respectively were added to 500 g of proppant with 20 g of phenol formaldehyde Novolac resin cross linked with hexamine 13 hexamine based on phenol formaldehyde Novolac resin with and without adhesion promoters as mentioned above. A typical batch schedule is shown in Table III below 

Following the coating process the coated proppant samples were inspected visually and by optical microscopy.

The electrical conductivity of various proppant samples prepared according to Examples 1 3 and 6 as well as uncoated proppant samples was measured using the test device shown in . As shown in the test system included an insulating boron nitride die having an inside diameter of 0.5 inches and an outside diameter of 1.0 inches disposed in a bore in a steel die in which the bore had an inside diameter of 1.0 inches. Upper and lower steel plungers and having an outside diameter of 0.5 inches were inserted in the upper and lower ends respectively of the insulating boron nitride die such that a chamber is formed between the leading end of the upper plunger the leading end of the lower plunger and the inner wall of the boron nitride sleeve . Upper plunger was removed from the insulating boron nitride die and proppant was loaded into the chamber until the proppant bed reached a height of about 1 to 2 cm above the leading end of the lower plunger . The upper plunger was then reinstalled in the insulating boron nitride die until the leading end of the upper plunger engaged the proppant . A copper wire was connected to the upper plunger and one pole of each of a current source and a voltmeter . A second copper wire was connected to the lower plunger and the other pole of each of the current source and the voltmeter . The current source can be any suitable DC current source well known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as a Keithley 237 High Voltage Source Measurement Unit in the DC current source mode and the voltmeter can be any suitable voltmeter well known to those of ordinary skill in the art such as a Fluke 175 True RMS Multimeter which may be used in the DC mV mode for certain samples and in the ohmmeter mode for higher resistance samples.

The current source was powered on and the resistance of the test system with the proppant bed in the chamber was then determined. The resistance of the proppant was then measured with the Multimeter as a function of pressure using the upper plunger and lower plunger both as electrodes and to apply pressure to the proppant bed . Specifically R V I the resistance of the system with the plungers touching is subtracted from the values measured with the proppant bed in the chamber and the resistivity R A t where A is the area occupied by the proppant bed and t is the thickness of the proppant bed between the upper plunger and the lower plunger .

Electrical measurements of base proppants without the addition of any conductive material were conducted at 100 V DC on samples that were 50 volume proppant in wax that were pressed into discs nominally 1 inch in diameter and approximately 2 mm thick. Using these values to calculate the resistivity and using the measured resistivity for pure wax the values below were extrapolated by plotting log resistivity vs. volume fraction proppant and extrapolating to a volume fraction of one 

It should be noted that the resistivities of the samples measured above are very high and not suitable for detection in the present invention.

Electrical measurements of base proppants with coatings of aluminum in thicknesses of 100 nm and 500 nm prepared according to Example 1 and base proppants with coatings of 0.1 or 0.4 of poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene PEDOT with or without amino silane were conducted. The results are shown in Table IV below and .

As can be seen from the best results in terms of conductivity were obtained with CARBOLITE 20 40 and CARBOHYDROPROP 40 80 having a 500 nm thick coating of aluminum.

Electrical measurements of mixtures of base proppants with varying percentages of such base proppants with coatings of aluminum in thicknesses of 500 nm prepared according to Example 1 were conducted. The results are shown in Tables V and VI below and .

Table V shows data for mixtures of CARBOLITE 20 40 with a 500 nm coating of aluminum and CARBOLITE 20 40 with no added conductive material. For each sample shown in Table V 3 g. of the sample material was placed in the 0.5 inch die to provide an area of 0.196 square inches. The applied current for each test was 5 mA and the tests were conducted at room temperature.

Table VI shows data for mixtures of HYDROPROP 40 80 with a 500 nm coating of aluminum and HYDROPROP 40 80 with no added conductive material. For each sample shown in Table VI 3 g. of the sample material was placed in the 0.5 inch die to provide an area of 0.196 square inches. The applied current for each test was 5 mA and the tests were conducted at room temperature.

As can be seen from TABLES V and VI as well as the resistivity of the proppant packs regardless of the relative amounts of coated or un coated proppant tends to decrease with increasing closure pressure. In addition as the relative amount of uncoated proppant increases and the relative amount of coated proppant decreases the resistivity of the proppant packs increases dramatically. Lastly the lowest resistivity is achieved with 100 Al coated proppant. No mixture of coated and uncoated proppant results in a resistivity measurement less than 100 Al coated proppant.

Electrical measurements of proppants with coatings of nickel and copper were also conducted. The results are shown in TABLE VII below and . TABLE VII shows data for CARBOLITE 20 40 with a coating of nickel and CARBOLITE 20 40 with a coating of copper. For each sample shown in TABLE VII the sample material was placed in the 0.5 inch die. The applied voltage for each test was 0.005V.

Electrical measurements of proppants having coatings of varied thicknesses of nickel were also conducted. The results are shown in TABLE VIII below and . TABLE VIII shows data for CARBOLITE 20 40 with a coating of nickel at thicknesses of 0.27 microns 0.50 microns 0.96 microns 2.47 microns and 3.91 microns. One sample in became oxidized and because of this was not sufficiently conductive for purposes of this example. For each sample shown in TABLE VIII the sample material was placed in the 0.5 inch die. The applied voltage for each test was 0.01V.

Electrical measurements of proppants with coatings of nickel and copper were also conducted as a function of KCl exposure. The results are shown in TABLE IX below and . TABLE IX shows data for CARBOLITE 20 40 with a coating of nickel and CARBOLITE 20 40 with a coating of copper. Each sample was exposed to a 2 KCl solution having a pH of 10 and a temperature of 120 C. for 0 day 1 day 3 days and 7 days. For each sample shown in TABLE IX the sample material was placed in the 0.5 inch die under a pressure of 3560 psi.

As can be seen from TABLE VII and the copper coating provides a greater conductivity than the conductivity provided by the nickel. As can be seen from TABLE VIII and decreasing thicknesses of the nickel coating provide decreasing conductivity. And as can be seen from TABLES VII and VIII as well as the conductivity of the proppant packs regardless of the relative amounts of coated or un coated proppant tends to increase with increasing closure pressure. Lastly exposure to the KCl solution greatly reduces the conductivity of copper coated proppant but has little noticeable effect on the conductivity of the nickel coated proppant.

In an exemplary method of fracturing a subterranean formation a hydraulic fluid is injected into the formation at a rate and pressure sufficient to open a fracture therein and a fluid containing sintered substantially round and spherical particles prepared from a slurry as described herein and having one or more of the properties as described herein is injected into the fracture to prop the fracture in an open condition.

The foregoing description and embodiments are intended to illustrate the invention without limiting it thereby. It will be understood that various modifications can be made in the invention without departing from the spirit or scope thereof.
