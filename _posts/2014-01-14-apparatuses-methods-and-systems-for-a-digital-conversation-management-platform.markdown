This disclosure details an implementation of apparatuses methods and systems for a digital conversation value exchange platform hereinafter DCM Platform . The DCM Platform implements an application whereby virtual commodities such as digital conversation assets are created evaluated and traded. In one embodiment the DCM Platform may capture and examine conversations between individuals and artificial intelligence conversation agents. These agents may be viewed as assets. One can measure the value and performance of these agents by assessing their performance and ability to generate revenue from prolonging conversations and or ability to effect sales through conversations with individuals. In one implementation the DCM Platform may initiate an exchange procedure by collecting required information for the exchange and determine a pricing index for the digital conversation asset to be traded.

In one embodiment a Robot Operating System ROS may be employed for both consumer robots and other intelligent devices. For example in one implementation the DCM Platform may employ ROS as a platform to manage intelligence hardware abstraction consumer interfacing low level device control implementation of controlling and recording consumer conversations message passing between processes application package management and or the like.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may specify store and manage interactive voice dialogue between a consumer and an artificial intelligence agent in formats such as but not limited to VoiceXML VXML and or the like. For example in one implementation a VXML document may take a form similar to the following 

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may establish and manage consumer interactions via a virtual world platform.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may employ mobile operating systems Mobile OS to control mobile devices within embodiments of the DCM Platform operation. For example in one implementation Mobile OS such as but not limited to Google Android Windows Mobile iPhone OS Symbian OS and or the like may be employed.

It is to be understood that depending on the particular needs and or characteristics of a DCM Platform application associated security data sources associated operating system user interface object administrator server hardware configuration network framework and or the like various embodiments of the DCM Platform may be implemented that enable a great deal of flexibility and customization. The instant disclosure discusses embodiments of the DCM Platform primarily within the context of digital conversation value exchange. However it is to be understood that the system described herein may be readily configured customized for a wide range of other applications or implementations. For example aspects of the DCM Platform may be adapted for general virtual commodity management pricing and exchange and or the like.

In one embodiment a consumer may operate a variety of consumer devices such as but not limited to a cellular phone a smartphone a computer a telephone D and or the like to have a conversation with an AI agent . For example the consumer may talk to the AI agent over the phone or type texts in an instant messenger and or an online chatting platform to communicate with the AI agent.

In one implementation the AI agent may comprise an artificial intelligence ROS and or other intelligent devices. The AI agent may communicate with and or be monitored by the DCM Platform which may employ the AI agent to furnish intelligence hardware abstraction consumer interfacing low level device control implementation of controlling and recording consumer conversations message passing between processes application package management and or the like. For example in one implementation the DCM Platform may retrieve knowledge and dialogue scripts from the DCM Platform database to generate interactive dialogue steps and scripts and send it to the AI agent. In one implementation the DCM Platform may be implemented within a central server. In alternative implementations there may be distributed DCM Platforms to control a cluster of AI agents.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may receive interactive dialogues from the AI agents and encapsulate the digital dialogue scripts to generate tradable virtual assets for exchange on a virtual application exchange platform and or a financial trading platform . In one embodiment the digital conversation between a consumer and an AI agent may provide information indicating the consumer s preferences and thus useful for new advertising inventory and other forms of revenues for DCM Platform clients . Within embodiments the digital assets comprising digital dialogue assets may be purchased by DCM Platform clients and or knowledge agents . For example a DCM Platform client may purchase the digital asset to perform data mining to obtain knowledge and information from the digital conversations. In one implementation the DCM Platform clients may comprise an AI agent a DCM Platform an advertising company and or the like.

In another implementation a DCM Platform may devise marketing plans using AI agents for the DCM Platform clients and the DCM Platform clients may purchase virtual avatar AI advertising service from the DCM Platform from the virtual application exchange platform . For example a virtual advertising avatar may be employed to communicate with consumers for advertising purposes via a variety of media channels such as but not limited to print media television radio Internet and or the like.

In a further implementation the DCM Platform may generate tradable financial instruments backed by the virtual assets and facilitate transactions of the financial instruments. In one implementation the digital assets may be used to generate a variety of financial instruments such as but not limited to futures forwards options and or the like to be traded on a financial trading platform e.g. the New York Stock Exchange and or the like. For example investors of the digital assets may purchase stock shares of an AI agent e.g. a digital asset owner etc. via the financial trading platform as further illustrated in and A B.

Within implementations the AI agent may encapsulate one or more saved conversation between the consumer and the AI agent to generate a digital asset which is referred to as the conversation asset . When the digital conversation is owned by an AI Agent one or more conversation asset with related topic may be encapsulated as an AI Entity asset and the actual digital conversation component is referred to as a Conversation Asset . For example an AI entity may combine one or more conversations with regard to the same advertising project e.g. a new product promotion etc. as an AI entity asset.

Within various implementations the AI Entity assets may be sent to the DCM Platform wherein the DCM Platform may group the AI Entity assets to form a Portfolio asset . In one implementation the DCM Platform may group AI entity assets from AI agents employed by the same client and or the same advertising project as a Portfolio asset. For example a number of AI agents e.g. social media avatars robot messengers robot callers etc. may be employed for a new product s market promotion and the digital assets from all the AI agents with regard to the product campaign may be grouped as a Portfolio asset. In further implementations a collection of Portfolio assets may be traded within a trading platform and thus it is known as an Exchange asset . For example Portfolio assets related to similar products may be grouped and traded as an Exchange asset . Within implementations the DCM Platform may store the Portfolio asset and the Exchange asset and or the transaction record at the database . Examples of types of digital assets including the conversation assets AI entity assets portfolio assets exchange assets and or the like are further illustrate in .

In one implementation a DCM Platform client may purchase the digital asset in the form of exchange asset from the trading form which may be further illustrated in . In an alternative implementation exchange assets may be traded between AI entities as different asset owners as further illustrated in . In another implementation investors of the virtual assets may purchase stock shares from the financial trading platform wherein the stock shares are generated at the DCM Platform based on the asset information submitted by the asset owners .

In one implementation the conversation asset may be created to include the dialogue interactions between AI entities and humans and or amongst AI entities. In one implementation an AI entity asset may comprise one or more conversation and the means such as intelligence hardware abstraction consumer interfaces and or the like for conducting digital conversations included in the conversation asset . In one implementation the portfolio asset may include a plurality of AI entity assets and or the conversation assets wherein the portfolio asset provides a branded vehicle for the accreditation aggregation and performance of conversation assets and AI entity assets. In a further implementation the exchange asset may include one or more portfolio assets grouped together to be traded on a public trading platform wherein the exchange asset provides accreditation aggregation and performance of portfolio assets within a public or private domain.

For example in one implementation an intelligent messenger avatar may interact with consumers on the messaging platform to provide information with regard to hair styling. The conversation scripts between the avatar and one or more consumers may be encapsulated as a package which forms a conversation asset associated with the intelligent messenger avatar and the identification information such as the account information of the avatar account together with the conversation asset may form an AI entity asset. In one implementation similar conversations from different AI entities such as conversations related to a new hair styling product may be grouped by the DCM Platform to create a portfolio asset wherein the portfolio asset may be labeled and or associated with the new hair styling product. In one implementation the hair styling product portfolio asset may be traded with other portfolio assets e.g. portfolio assets related to other hair treatment products in a transaction which may be referred to as the exchange asset in the transaction.

Within embodiments various data structures objects and relational structures may be adopted for creation storage and implementations of the conversation asset AI entity assets portfolio assets and exchange assets . For example in one implementation an exemplar XML implementation of conversation assets may take a form similar to the following 

In one embodiment DCM Platform may generate tradable assets based on the digital conversations . Within implementations DCM Platform may determine dollar values of the digital assets monetize the conversation and determine conversation stock shares and conversation index for exchange as further illustrated in .

In one embodiment as digital conversations may be measurable at the lowest common denominator of a dialogue step a digital conversation may be commoditized as conversation stock which is a tradable instrument. The commoditization is based on encapsulation of the digital conversation script with a wrapper that contains all the means for the exchange of value which is represented as conversation monetization . Within implementations DCM Platform may generate a conversation index to monitor the conversation monetization together with the digital conversation interactions from an AI end.

Within implementations trading prices of conversation assets for exchange may be determined by market dynamics e.g. NYSE index etc. which may be affected by authorship ownership and monetization of digital conversation and by whether the conversation assets are accredited as part of a branded portfolio. The value may be also influenced by the brand of the exchange chosen for the trading of value. Included are past present and future digital conversation for valuation of conversation assets in context to individuals both in terms of human and artificial intelligence entities. In one embodiment DCM Platform may assess conversation liquidity and generate conversation index which includes the emergent patterns of conversational trends and evolution.

In one embodiment the methods that affect the pricing of digital conversation assets may further include but not limited to searches and matches of conversational needs conversation access rights conversation events conversation handoffs conversational learning loops conversational references and conversational transaction with the associated rules of engagements for conversation assets including reputational ownership transfers withdrawals or suspension from algorithmic trading and or the like.

In one implementation the AI agents may receive inquiries from the consumer during a dialogue. For example the consumer may submit a dialogue line where can I buy a hair dresser with the 30 cash back discount In one implementation the AI agents may then connect to an Internet search engine such as but not limited to Google Bing Yahoo and or the like to obtain search results from the search engines based on key words search hair dresser cash back and or the like.

In one implementation the AI agents may wrap the recorded digital dialogue scripts with consumers to generate digital assets and submit to the DCM Platform for trading on an exchange platform. In one implementation a client such as an advertising company etc. may interact with the DCM Platform to submit a marketing request to employ AI agent for advertising purposes. The DCM Platform may then devise marketing strategy for the client and deploy the strategy with AI agents.

For example in one implementation a hair dresser manufacturer may request the DCM Platform devise a marketing strategy for their new hair dresser product. The DCM Platform may analyze previously stored consumer dialogues e.g. to extract information related to consumer preferences of hair dressers etc. and then devise a dialogue application and select AI agents to implement the application as further illustrated in .

In one implementation the knowledge may be wrapped stored and or filtered through dialogue scripts from a knowledge bank database. In one implementation the knowledge bank database may be a central database maintained by the DCM Platform. In alternative implementations the knowledge bank database may comprise a plurality of mutually connected distributed databases.

In one embodiment knowledge providers may comprise the consumer brands advertising to disseminate their knowledge about their products or services. In one implementation the knowledge providers may convert their branded procedural knowledge and incorporate them into AI agent applications via the knowledge bank database . In another implementation the knowledge providers may obtain consumer feedbacks from the knowledge bank and or the AI agents via implementations of the AI agent applications.

In a further implementation the market may be seeded with AI agent applications containing high quality knowledge across a few consumer products brands and the DCM Platform may create and sell advertising tools for User Generated Virtual Agent Apps to accelerate the population of AI agent applications each containing specific knowledge. For example the knowledge provider may purchase AI agent application templates to imbue and update their latest product information for advertising with consumers.

Within embodiments knowledge distributers may comprise Internet search engines social media platforms such as but not limited to Apple Google Microsoft RIM and or the like which have channels to market and would benefit from new revenue streams driven by AI agents. In one implementation the knowledge distributors may obtain knowledge e.g. brand product information from the knowledge providers. For example the knowledge provider may post advertisements containing product information on the World Wide Web www indexed by the search engines. In another implementation AI agents may access the knowledge distributors to search and learn knowledge . For example the AI agents may conduct a key word search on a search engine platform to obtain knowledge for an on going conversation with a consumer.

In a further implementation DCM Platform may create AI agent application for exchange e.g. an AI application sold in the Apple iTunes Store etc. . . . . In one implementation the AI agent applications may be connected to the knowledge bank database and further distribution with social network providers such as Yahoo and Facebook ad or the like may be also linked to the knowledge bank database . In one implementation the knowledge distributors may facilitate knowledge providers to access the knowledge acquirers via knowledge learning by the AI agents.

In one implementation the AI agent may generate conversation assets by creating a wrapper encapsulating the conversation scripts with the consumer as further illustrated in . For example in one implementation the AI agent may convert one or more textual conversation scripts into a XML file with metadata of the conversation scripts such as but not limited to ownership information authorship information and or the like. In one implementation the AI agent may associate information such as the software implementation packages operating system information hardware abstraction information with the generated conversation assets to generate AI entity assets as further illustrated in . In an alternative implementation the conversation assets and AI entity assets may be generated at the DCM Platform.

Within implementations the DCM Platform may receive information of the generated conversation assets and AI entity assets and monetize the assets . For example in one implementation the DCM Platform may receive pricing information from the owner of the assets e.g. the AI agents etc. and price the assets accordingly.

In one implementation the DCM Platform may group AI entity assets to generate portfolio assets e.g. by combining AI entity assets based on related conversation topics related AI entity types and or the like. The generated portfolio assets may be monetized for exchange and or grouped to generate exchange assets . In one implementation the DCM Platform may present the generated asset wrappers including the conversation assets AI entity assets portfolio assets and or exchange assets to a financial trading platform for trade transactions . In one implementation the DCM Platform may obtain pricing information of the virtual assets on the market and generate a conversation index based on the supply demand market characteristics. For example conversation assets may be priced differently based on its content topics volume client demands and or the like.

In one implementation the DCM Platform may adjust the conversation monetization via monitoring the conversation index in a loop . For example the DCM Platform may feedback the market prices of conversation assets to an AI agent which is engaged in a conversation with a consumer and may determine a dollar value associated with a dialogue step. For example if the market information indicates conversation assets with regard to consumer preferences over colors of hair highlights are highly demanded then during the conversation a consumer dialogue line I like red hair highlights may be priced with a higher dollar value.

For example in one implementation the DCM Platform may determine a common denominator for the exchange of value relates to the establishment of a conversation asset e.g. a dollar value associated with a dialogue script a dialogue action line etc. In one implementation the DCM Platform may facilitate initiation of a conversation asset and the exchange of value between the conversation asset owner conversation script author s and conversation asset negotiator s including changes over time. Within implementations the conversation script author s may provide conversation scripts to the conversation asset owner s and the asset owner may then allocate conversation asset shares for negotiation while the conversation asset negotiator may negotiate the conversation stock transfers via the DCM Platform to an investor . The example initiation of conversation assets is further illustrated in .

For another example as further illustrated in the DCM Platform may facilitate initiation of an AI entity asset and the exchange of value between the AI entity asset owner AI entity designer s and AI entity asset negotiator s including changes over time. Within implementations the AI entity designers may provide AI entity icons to the AI entity asset owner s and the asset owner may then allocate AI asset shares for negotiation while the AI entity asset negotiator may negotiate the AI entity stock transfers via the DCM Platform to an investor .

For another example as further illustrated in the DCM Platform may facilitate initiation of a portfolio asset and the exchange of value between the portfolio asset owner portfolio script author s and portfolio asset negotiator s including changes over time. Within implementations the portfolio script author s may provide portfolio scripts to the portfolio asset owner s and the asset owner may then allocate portfolio asset shares for negotiation while the portfolio asset negotiator may negotiate the portfolio stock transfers via the DCM Platform to an investor .

For another example as further illustrated in the DCM Platform may facilitate initiation of a exchange asset and the exchange of value between the exchange asset owner exchange script author s and exchange asset negotiator s including changes over time. Within implementations the exchange script author s may provide exchange scripts to the exchange asset owner s and the asset owner may then allocate exchange asset shares for negotiation while the exchange asset negotiator may negotiate the exchange stock transfers via the DCM Platform to an investor .

In one embodiment the DCM Platform or the AI agent may create a conversation asset based on the captured conversation script. Within implementations conversation assets may be created and developed by the conversation asset owner e.g. an AI agent an advertising company etc. which may be a 1 1 relationship to the conversation asset. The conversation asset owner may be an individual or an organization or a named asset portfolio and the ownership may be transferred to another person organization or to a named portfolio. In one implementation an individual name may be required as the authoritative person to establish. Once the conversation asset owner identity and contact details have been established that person may create a conversation wrapper to establish the conversation asset.

In one embodiment upon establishment of the conversation asset ownership the DCM Platform may launch a conversation asset wrapper which may be a data package comprising the conversation asset and trade information with regard to the conversation asset which may have a 1 1 relationship to the conversation asset. Within embodiments a conversation wrapper may be governed by a set of methods covering all the different parts and interrelationships that are the basis for algorithmic trading for the creation of value of a conversation asset. For example in one implementation an exemplar XML implementation of a conversation asset wrapper is discussed in .

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may define a conversation asset title . The conversation wrapper may contain a title of the conversation asset which is a 1 1 relationship to the conversation asset. For example the conversation asset owner may be responsible for the conversation title.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may allocate a unique conversation asset global identifier to the conversation wrapper which is a 1 1 relationship to the conversation asset. The conversation asset global identifier may remain unchanged for the lifetime including archive of the conversational asset even if constitution ownership of the asset changes.

In one embodiment once the conversation asset global identity has been assigned the conversation asset status filed in the conversation wrapper may be set . For example if the conversation asset status is set to be draft which is a 1 1 relationship to the conversation asset the draft status may indicate the conversation asset is not ready for use in a digital conversation once the conversation asset status is set to be production then the digital conversations are ready to commence.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may update the conversation asset wrapper with a description of the conversation asset which is a 1 1 relationship. For example the conversation asset owner may compile and edit the conversation description. the person responsible for the conversation description is the conversation asset owner.

In one embodiment once the conversation description has been established the conversation asset ownership may be assigned to the conversation asset owner which is a 1 1 relationship between conversation asset and the conversation asset owner. In one implementation the establishment of ownership of the conversation asset may determine that the conversation asset having one share which is fully owned by the conversation asset owner. Alternative implementations of determining shares are further illustrated in .

In one embodiment the conversation wrapper references the primary script author for each conversation script which is a 1 1 relationship. For example the primary script may be the first component used by an AI entity for digital conversation.

In one implementation if the conversation asset owner is the author of this primary script then the primary script author identity and contact details are treated as the same. Otherwise in alternative implementations if the conversation asset owner is not the same as the primary script owner then the conversation asset owner may arrange for the following define the primary script author identification and contact details ascertain whether the primary script author will be given partial ownership of the conversation asset.

In one embodiment upon assigning a conversation asset negotiator the conversation asset negotiator may negotiate with the primary script author a percentage of shares to be sold and once determined the asset shares are assigned. The allocation may not be a whole unit and therefore the assignment of conversation shares can be fractional.

In one embodiment if both parties agree on the conversation shares then a conversation stock transfer is undertaken where an audit trail of the transaction is maintained as part of the conversation asset wrapper. In one embodiment a primary script author may be replaced by another primary script author and an audit trial is maintained of past primary script authors with the conversation wrapper. To change a primary script author the authority may be vested with the person with the conversation asset negotiator. If there was a prior agreement with the current primary script author to release their conversation shares in the case that they loose their primary script author status then the share allocation is removed. If there was no prior agreement the current primary script author may agree to release their shares in consultation with the conversation asset negotiator. In one implementation the shares withdrawn become part of the audit trail within the conversation asset wrapper. The primary script author may wish to retain all or part of their shares. The conversation asset negotiator may obtain prior agreement with the conversation asset owner to increase the number of conversation shares.

In one embodiment the conversation asset owner may ascertain whether a conversation asset negotiator is needed e.g. a third party to negotiate during a transaction on their behalf. In an alternative embodiment the conversation asset owner may be assigned the status of conversation asset negotiator which is a 1 1 relationship.

In alternative implementations the asset owner may define conversation asset negotiator identification and contact details. For example if the conversation asset owner wishes to assign proportional ownership to the conversation asset negotiator then a percentage is determined and the asset shares are assigned . The allocation may not be a whole unit and therefore the assignment of shares can be fractional e.g. a m m relationship between the conversation asset shares and the conversation asset negotiator.

In one embodiment upon negotiation the conversation asset share allocation with the primary script author and both parties agree the conversation shares then a conversation stock transfer is undertaken where an audit trail of the transaction is maintained as part of the conversation asset wrapper. When the stock transfer is finished the conversation asset shares are removed from the primary script author .

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may determine whether there are more than 1 primary authors. If there are other script authors e.g. a 1 m relationship between the conversation script and the conversation authors the conversation wrapper references the other authors for each conversation script. In one implementation if the conversation asset owner is an other script author the identity and contact details are treated as the same. If the conversation asset owner is not the same as one of the other script owners or if there are other script authors then the conversation asset owner may define for each other script author identification and contact details ascertain for each one whether the other script author will be given partial ownership of the conversation asset.

In one embodiment the conversation asset negotiator negotiates with the other script author a percentage and once determined the asset shares are assigned and removed from other authors . The allocation does not need to be a whole unit and therefore the assignment of conversation shares can be fractional. In one embodiment once both parties agree the conversation shares then a conversation stock transfer is undertaken where an audit trail of the transaction is maintained as part of the conversation asset wrapper.

In one embodiment conversation script rights may be assigned to other authors . An other script author may be replaced by another other script author and an audit trial is maintained of past other script authors with the conversation wrapper. To change an other script author the authority is vested with the person with the conversation asset negotiator. if there was a prior agreement with the current other script author to release their conversation shares in the case that they loose their other script author status then the share allocation is removed. if there was no prior agreement the current other script author may agree to release their shares in consultation with the conversation asset negotiator. The shares withdrawn become part of the audit trail within the conversation asset wrapper.

In one implementation the other script author may desire to retain all or part of their shares. The conversation asset negotiator may obtain prior agreement with the conversation asset owner to increase the number of conversation shares. In an alternative embodiment the other script authors may not be allowed to change a script unless they have been given temporary authority by the primary script author. The assignment may be time sensitive assignment and this status may be removed. In one implementation only one script author is allowed at a moment in time to change the script.

In one embodiment the conversation wrapper references the primary conversation script which is a 1 1 relationship wherein the primary conversation script contains identification information such as name and version and or the like.

In one embodiment the primary conversation script may link with other conversation scripts which is a 1 m relationship and in turn each other conversation script component may link with other conversation scripts. For example a conversation script wrapper may reference a specific link to another conversation script that is related to similar topics . These networks of conversation links are referenced from the conversation wrapper with associated creation details. The conversation script is produced and changed by the primary script author or as already mentioned an other script author that has been assigned the temporary status to perform script changes. Each conversation link is to a named conversation script which is a 1 1 relationship. Each conversation script is a conversation asset and therefore each has its own conversation asset owner wrappers. In one implementation the authorship amongst different conversation assets is likely to be different. The conversation assets may be triggered by conversation links that potentially increase the value of the conversation asset which is described within the conversation wrapper.

In one embodiment the conversation wrapper references for each script author their bio in context of the conversation script which is a 1 1 relationship.

In one embodiment the conversation may orchestrate one or more dialogue steps a conversation step may orchestrate one or more activities which is a 1 m relationship. Within implementations the conversation orchestration handles three primary activities which are events widgets and adverts.

In one implementation the conversational orchestration may trigger one or more events which is a 1 m relationship. These conversation events are in context to the conversation step and thus cover things such as an AI entity movement to the trigger of any digital medium such as an audio picture video or indeed any digital medium. Those digital mediums triggered by conversation assets that potentially increase the value of the conversation asset may be described within the conversation wrapper. For example a conversational event may comprise but not limited to transmission of a multimedia file e.g. an audio video etc. in a text based dialogue consumer s election to switch AI agents during a conversation and or the like.

In one embodiment the conversational orchestration may trigger one or more widgets which is a 1 m relationship. These conversation widgets are in context to the conversation step and thus cover any type of function that may be performed by a widget such as a diary appointment to a transaction e.g. a scheduled transfer of stock shares. Those conversation widgets triggered by conversation orchestration that potentially increase the value of the conversation asset may be described within the conversation wrapper.

In one embodiment the conversational orchestration may trigger one or more adverts which is a 1 m relationship. The advert may cover different forms such as a pictorial or video. These conversation adverts are in context to the conversation step and are governed by the methods for exchanging value for advertisements. These conversation adverts may be undertaken in conjunction with conversation events and conversation widgets. Those conversation adverts triggered by conversation orchestration that potentially increase the value of the conversation asset may be described within the conversation wrapper. For example the link to the conversational advert may be date and time sensitive and thus enabling different placements for different contexts.

In one embodiment the conversation wrapper may be used to recommend other conversation assets. For example the conversation wrapper may determine link references to other conversation through the file wrapper which may further involve the trading of conversation asset shares or the assignment of conversation asset shares new shares between the respective conversation asset negotiators .

Within implementations the AI entity asset may be treated in a similar way to a conversation asset. In one embodiment the conversation AI entity asset is created and developed by the conversation AI entity asset owner which is a 1 1 relationship . The conversation AI entity asset owner may be an individual or an organization or a named portfolio however if the latter two then an individual name may be required as the authoritative person. The ownership may change to another person organization or to a named portfolio. Once the conversation AI entity asset owner identity and contact details have been established that person may create a conversation AI entity wrapper to establish the conversation AI entity asset.

In one embodiment each conversation AI entity asset may launch an AI entity asset wrapper which has a 1 1 relationship. In one implementation a conversation AI entity wrapper is governed by a set of methods covering all the different parts and interrelationships that are the basis for algorithmic trading for the creation of value of a conversation AI entity asset which may be traded as a tangible and measurable financial instrument.

In one embodiment the conversation AI entity wrapper may contain a name of the conversation AI entity asset which is a 1 1 relationship. For example the conversation AI entity asset owner may be responsible for the conversation AI entity name.

In one embodiment once the conversation name has been established a unique global identifier is assigned to the conversation AI entity wrapper which is a 1 1 relationship. The conversation AI entity asset global identifier may remain unchanged for the lifetime including archive of the conversational AI entity asset even if the constitution of the asset changes.

In one embodiment once the AI entity asset global identifier has been established the conversation AI entity asset ownership may be fully assigned to the conversation AI entity asset owner . Within implementations there may be a 1 1 relationship between conversation AI entity asset and the conversation AI entity asset owner which may indicate that the conversation AI entity asset has one share fully owned by the conversation AI entity asset owner.

In one embodiment the conversation AI entity asset owner may ascertain whether they wish someone else to negotiate on their behalf. In one implementation the conversation AI entity asset owner is assigned the status of conversation AI entity asset negotiator which is a 1 1 relationship.

In alternative implementations the conversation AI entity asset may define conversation AI entity asset negotiator identification and contact details . In one embodiment if the conversation AI entity asset owner wishes to assign proportional ownership to the conversation AI entity asset negotiator then a percentage is determined and the conversation AI entity shares are assigned . The allocation may not be a whole unit and therefore the assignment of shares may be fractional.

In one embodiment all interactions and transactions related to the exchange conversation asset are stored as an audit that provides a basis for future projected value . The retrieved audit history includes categorization by the portfolio conversation assets which is accessible from the exchange conversation wrapper.

In one embodiment an exchange conversation wrapper maintains a list of exchange conversation members that also have the status of exchange conversation authors which are categorized by their respective portfolio conversation asset.

In one embodiment an exchange conversation wrapper maintains a list of exchange conversation members that also have the status of exchange conversation designers which are categorized by their respective portfolio conversation asset.

In one embodiment the Exchange Conversation Wrapper may be used to establish references to other exchange conversation assets which may involve the trading of Exchange conversation asset shares or the assignment of exchange conversation asset shares new shares between the respective exchange conversation asset negotiators .

In another implementation the DCM Platform may receive related trading pricing information from a trading platform as a reference of price determination. For example pricing information of conversation assets from the same author may be grouped to provide relevant pricing information.

In one implementation the value of a dialogue may be determined based on the contents e.g. whether there is an outcome etc. For example if a dialogue starts with a question from an AI entity what kind of hair dresser are you looking for and an outcome is generated from the consumer s dialogue response I prefer hair dresser for straight and sleek hair styles then such dialogue may be priced higher than a dialogue without any outcome e.g. the consumer s response does not address any preferences I don t know. If no outcome is generated the DCM Platform may continue to price the next dialogue step.

In one implementation if an outcome is included in a dialogue step the DCM Platform may search received trading information related to similar outcomes and based on the searched pricing information the DCM Platform may adjust the price of the dialogue step . For example the trading information of conversations comprising outcomes indicating consumer s preferences of hair dressers may reflect the supply demand relationship of such information on the market and if the demand is high the DCM Platform may price the dialogue step higher accordingly.

In one implementation the DCM Platform may continue to determine every dialogue step in a conversation based on which the price of a conversation asset a conversation AI entity asset a portfolio asset and an exchange asset may be determined. The DCM Platform may then update the wrapper of the virtual asset and submit pricing information for a transaction .

Within implementations the DCM Platform may facilitate the initiation of monetization by obtaining a corporate certificate of the asset owner and or credentials from an investor . The DCM Platform may then assign intellectual property rights associated with the digital assets to the investor and then determine shares of stock and price of a stock share based on the pricing information submitted by the asset owner.

In one implementation the DCM Platform may determine cost factors associated with the monetization such as but not limited to operational cost advertisement cost and or the like. The DCM Platform may then determine a dividends payment structure based on the determined stock shares and the cost factors and facilitate transfer of stock shares . For example the DCM Platform may generate a financial instrument based on the stock shares such as futures forwards options and or the like which are based on the underlying virtual assets and submit to a financial trading platform for transactions.

In one embodiment the method for the determination of a Conversation Asset Index is influenced by whether it is standalone or part of a Portfolio Conversation or an Exchange Conversation. This method applies to the standalone Conversation Asset. In one implementation the method involves two parts Interaction Conversation Asset Interaction Index and Monetary Conversation Asset Monetary Index 

In one embodiment every digital conversation interaction involves one or more conversation steps. A conversation step contains the following attributes the dialogue the date and time the conversation step started the number of words within the dialogue the number of dialogue options which can be zero or more the selected country language.

In one embodiment each conversation step interaction is recorded and stored in an archive with the dialogue together with the attributes above.

In one embodiment the conversation asset interaction index is updated for each conversation step as follows go back to the previous conversation step which is not relevant for the first conversation step go to the next conversation step which is relevant when there are no dialogue options present but is not relevant in the case of the last conversation step selected a dialogue option and moves to the next contextual conversation step with interaction counter point for each appropriate backward forward or selected option taken.

In one embodiment each Digital Conversation has a start and an end point. This is known as a Conversation String. There is a minimum of one Conversation Step for each Conversation String but there is no limit to the number of Conversation Steps within a Conversation String. Therefore every action taken whether it is Forward Backward or Selected adds another node to the Conversation String. The Conversation String can be extended across multiple user sessions and therefore is not constrained by time. The Conversation Asset Interaction Index is the aggregation of points derived from the Conversation Strings. Stored with the Conversation String is the attributes defined above so this enables the calculation of the time it took to undertake a Digital Conversation though this does not impact the Conversation Asset Interaction Index.

In one embodiment there is a Conversation Link between Conversation Assets then the Conversation String continues unabated by accumulating the Interaction Counter Points. There is no constraint in the use of Conversation Links between Conversation Assets. Therefore a Conversation String may encompass any number of Conversation Assets. There is no limit to the number of Conversation Steps that can be counted and update the Conversation Asset Interaction Index. The first Conversation Asset is the origination of the Conversation String and therefore has its own Conversation Asset Interaction Index. However each Conversation Asset has its own Conversation String and its own Conversation Asset Interaction Index which are also updated even though they may not be the origination for a given Digital Conversation. Example Let s take three Conversation Assets called CA1 CA2 and CA3. The interaction starts with CA1 and involves 3 Conversation Steps. The CA1 Index is set to 3 Interaction Points. The CA1 Conversation Link goes to CA2 that involves 4 Conversation Steps. The CA1 Index is now set to 7 Interaction Points and the CA2 Index is now set to 4 Interaction Points. The CA2 Conversation Link goes to CA3 that involves Conversation Steps. The CA1 Index is now set to 12 Interaction Points the CA2 Index is now set to 9 Interaction Points and the CA3 Index is now set to 5 Interaction Points.

In one embodiment there are no deductions to the Conversation Asset Interaction Index for standalone Conversation Assets.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Interaction Index consistently is applied across changed versions of the Conversation Asset. However a historical audit is kept by Conversation Asset versions for trend and comparison analysis. This means the Conversation Asset Interaction Index provides a life time view of the Conversation Asset s interaction performance.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Interaction Index and the associated attributes of the Digital Conversation usage as described above are maintained with the Conversation Asset Wrapper.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is the accumulative numeric value associated with the Conversation Asset and is pegged to a global currency that is determined for the trading associated with the Conversation Asset.

In one embodiment there are varies ways that a standalone Conversation Asset can be monetized to update the Conversation Asset Monetary Index as follows 

For example in one embodiment where monetary value has been exchanged for Conversation Assets Shares this is logged to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index. So say one sold 10 shares out of 100 shares for a Conversation Asset for say 20 each. Once the transaction has been logged within the Conversation Asset Wrapper then the Conversation Asset is now worth in total 2 000 Monetary Points 100 shares 20 plus any additional monetary value sourced from elsewhere see below. If one more Conversation Asset share is sold for 10 then the Conversation Asset is now worth in total 1 000 Monetary Points 100 shares 10 plus any additional monetary value sourced from elsewhere. But if the next is sold for 30 then the Conversation Asset is now worth in total 3 000 Monetary Points 100 shares 30 plus any additional monetary value sourced from elsewhere see below. If no Conversation Assets Shares are sold then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index cannot be altered for this consideration 100 shares 0 .

In one embodiment this is treated in the same way as for Sell Conversation Asset Shares. The difference is that if a swap is with another Conversation Asset Shares and if this Conversation Asset Share has a monetary value then the current value is used as the bid price and is then treated like money. So if the Conversation Asset is worth 100 per share and it swaps 1 share for 2 shares then the bid price equates to 50 a share 100 shares 50 thus the Conversation Asset is now worth in total 5 000 Monetary Points plus any additional monetary value sourced from elsewhere.

In one embodiment this is treated in the same way as for Sell Conversation Asset Shares. The difference is that if a swap is with a Conversation AI Entity Asset Shares and if this Conversation AI Entity Asset Share has a monetary value then the current value is used as the bid price and is then treated like money. So if the Conversation AI Entity Asset is worth 100 per share and it swaps 1 share for 2 shares then the bid price equates to 50 a share 100 shares 50 thus the Conversation Asset is now worth in total 5 000 Monetary Points plus any additional monetary value sourced from elsewhere see below.

In one embodiment if monetary value is received for context Conversation Display Advertising or marketing then the transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific contract has been negotiated. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if the advert is a dollar per display then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated by one monetary point that is removed after 1 year. If however it was negotiated that an advert would be permanently displayed at a given Conversation Step for 1 000 for 3 months then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated by 1 000 Monetary Points but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of the 3 month period.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is only updated for the specific Conversation Asset and not for that Conversation Asset that it directly or indirectly has Conversation Links. However if the Conversation Asset Negotiator of a direct or indirect Linked Conversation Asset agrees to a pro rata monetary value for triggered Conversation Display Advert due to an earlier Digital Conversation but within the same Conversation String then this pro rata value is added to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index.

In one embodiment it should be remembered that Conversation Display Adverts can be triggered for each specific Conversation Step.

In one embodiment if monetary value is received for triggering a 3Party Conversation Event then the transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly.

In one embodiment the conditions and the term period for each Conversation Event are specifically negotiated.

In one embodiment the negotiation could be a fixed price for a given term period regardless to the number of times a Conversation Event is triggered. In this case once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term but removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of the negotiated term period.

In one embodiment the negotiation could be a fee based price for each time a specific Conversation Event is triggered. For example If the Conversation Event is a dollar per Conversation Event triggered then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is immediately updated by the agreed monetary unit whenever this trigger occurs. These Monetary Points are removed after the agreed term period negotiated.

In one embodiment the negotiation may be time sensitive so events are triggered only within an agreed time period. This may involve a fixed and or variable set of conditions including a cap to limit liability. Alternatively different Conversation Events can be triggered by different Dialogue Options. Regardless of these variations the method still applies that the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly whether to add or delete monetary points.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is only updated for the specific Conversation Asset and not for that Conversation Asset that it directly or indirectly has Conversation Links. However if the Conversation Asset Negotiator of a direct or indirect Linked Conversation Asset agrees to a pro rata monetary value for triggered Conversation Events due to an earlier Digital Conversation but within the same Conversation String then this pro rata value is added to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index.

In one embodiment it should be remembered that Conversation Event can be triggered for each specific Conversation Step.

In one embodiment if monetary value is received for triggering a 3Party Conversation Widget then the transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly.

In one embodiment the conditions and the term period for each Conversation Widget are specifically negotiated.

In one embodiment the negotiation could be a fixed price for a given term period regardless to the number of times a Conversation Widget is triggered. In this case once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term but removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of the negotiated term period.

In one embodiment the negotiation could be a fee based price for each time a specific Conversation Widget is triggered. For example If the Conversation Widget is a dollar per Conversation Widget triggered then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is immediately updated by the agreed monetary unit whenever this trigger occurs. These Monetary Points are removed after the agreed term period negotiated.

In one embodiment the negotiation could be a commission based price for each time a specific Conversation Widget that results with an agree outcome such as the purchase of a product or the provision of personalized information. For example If the Conversation Widget is 10 of a product purchase then this monetary value is added to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index. These Monetary Points are removed after the agreed term period negotiated.

In one embodiment the negotiation may be time sensitive so events are triggered only within an agreed time period. This may involve a fixed and or variable set of conditions including a cap to limit liability. Alternatively different Conversation Widget can be triggered by different Dialogue Options. Regardless of these variations the method still applies that the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly whether to add or delete monetary points.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is only updated for the specific Conversation Asset and not for that Conversation Asset that it directly or indirectly has Conversation Links. However if the Conversation Asset Negotiator of a direct or indirect Linked Conversation Asset agrees to a pro rata monetary value for triggered a Conversation Widget due to an earlier Digital Conversation but within the same Conversation String then this pro rata value is added to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index.

In one embodiment it should be remembered that Conversation Widget can be triggered for each specific Conversation Step.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is only updated for the specific Conversation Asset and not for other Conversation Assets that are linked to so a Conversation Asset through Digital Conversation could handoff to another Conversation Asset.

In one embodiment however if the Conversation Asset Negotiator of a direct or indirect Linked Conversation Asset agrees to a pro rata monetary value for a handoff then this pro rata value is added to the Conversation Asset Monetary Index with the inherited terms.

In one embodiment if monetary value is received for subscription based Digital Conversations then the transaction or pro rated part of the transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific contract has been negotiated. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if the subscription is an annualized 1 000 to access ten Conversation Assets then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index could be updated by 100 Monetary Points if prorated on an equal spread but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of the 12 month period. Alternative disbursement means can be used.

In one embodiment the Conversation Steps can be metered for Digital Conversation interactions and the associated transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific alternative period is determined. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if the meter is 10 per Conversation Step and the interaction involved 20 Conversation Steps then the transaction is valued at 200 then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index would be updated by 100 Monetary Points but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of a 12 month period.

In one embodiment the Conversation Outcomes can be metered for Digital Conversation interactions and the associated transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific alternative period is determined. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if the meter is 40 for a specific Conversation Outcome and 20 for a different Conversation Outcome then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index would be updated by 40 and 20 Monetary Points respectively but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of a 12 month period.

In one embodiment the Digital Conversation can be auctioned thus introducing scarcity into the supply demand equation. The auction transaction is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific alternative period is determined. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if the auction paid 10 000 for a specific Digital Conversation then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index would be updated by 10 000 Monetary Points respectively but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of a 12 month period.

In one embodiment the Digital Conversation Audit provides Conversational Intelligence that can be copied and sold or accessed or aggregated with 3party data as a one off or for an agreed period in exchange for a monetary value. The Conversational Intelligence transaction or prorated if shared with others is logged in the Conversation Asset Wrapper and the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated accordingly. The term period for this monetary value is defaulted to one year unless a specific alternative period is determined. Once this transaction has been updated into the Conversation Asset the Conversation Asset Monetary Index is updated for the period of the monetary term. For example if a copy of 3 months Digital Conversation is sold for 500 then the Conversation Asset Monetary Index would be updated by 500 Monetary Points respectively but the amount is removed from the Conversation Asset Monetary Index at the end of a 3 month period.

In one embodiment the methods above show a diverse range of methods for monetization of a Conversation Asset. This does not negate other methods of monetization but the underlying method for the assignment of Monetary Points still stands.

In one embodiment the Conversation Asset Index is formula driven and is calculated by Conversation Asset Interaction Index Conversation Asset Monetary Index.

In one embodiment the method for the determination of a Conversation AI Entity Performance Index is influenced by whether it is standalone or part of a Portfolio Conversation or an Exchange Conversation. This method applies only to the standalone Conversation AI Entity Asset. The Conversation AI Entity Performance Index is an associated method and does not reflect the actual monetization as an earning asset for the Conversation AI Entity Asset as this is addressed in the next chapter.

In one embodiment as already described the associated Conversation Asset Interaction Index is also stored against the Conversation AI Entity Asset and therefore becomes the Conversation AI Entity Interaction Performance Index.

In one embodiment as a Conversation AI Entity Asset can be involved with more than one primary Conversation Assets then the Conversation AI Entity Interaction Performance Index is the aggregation of the associated Conversation Asset Interaction Indexes.

In one embodiment the Conversation AI Entity Interaction Performance Index consistently is applied across changed versions of the Conversation AI Entity.

In one embodiment the methods above show a diverse range of methods for monetization of a Conversation AI Entity Asset. This does not negate other methods of monetization but the underlying method for the assignment of Monetary Points still stands.

In one embodiment the method for the determination of a Portfolio Conversation Asset Index is the aggregation and portfolio based weightings for 

Portfolio Conversation Asset Index Sum of the Conversation Asset Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation Asset Interaction Index Sum of the Conversation Asset Interaction Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation Asset Monetary Index Sum of the Conversation Asset Monetary Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Performance Index Sum of the Conversation AI Entity Performance Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Interaction Performance Index Sum of the Conversation Interaction AI Entity Performance Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Monetary Performance Index Sum of the Conversation AI Entity Monetary Performance Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Monetary Index Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Monetary Index Sum of the Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Monetary Indexes that have been branded by the Portfolio and are within the rules of engagement defined earlier.

The Portfolio Conversation Asset contains all the permutations associated with Conversation Assets and Conversation AI Entity Assets covered earlier.

In one embodiment the Portfolio Conversation Asset governs the monetary rules of engagement that apply to all the associated Conversation Assets and the AI Entity Assets that have been covered earlier for the individual asset classes.

In one embodiment the Portfolio Conversation Asset governs the weighting rules of engagement that apply to all the associated Conversation Assets and the AI Entity Assets that have been covered earlier for the individual asset classes. These weighting rules can be governed by the Portfolio and can be established for any permutation of influence including 

Portfolio Conversation Asset Feedback for example if the Portfolio has a weighting value of 5 for five star feedback then the number of Conversation Steps can be multiplied by a number assigned by the Portfolio thus 20 Conversation Steps is multiplied by 2 for a five star feedback equating to 40 weighted Conversation Steps that are applied to the Interaction Index.

Portfolio Conversation Asset Review for example if the Portfolio has a weighting value of 3 for a top review of a Conversation Asset then the number of Conversation Steps can be multiplied by a number assigned by the Portfolio thus 20 Conversation Steps is multiplied by 3 for a top review feedback equating to 60 weighted Conversation Steps that are applied to the Interaction Index.

Portfolio Conversation Asset Outcomes for example if the Portfolio has assigned a weighting value of 10 for a primary Conversation Outcome then the number of Conversation Steps can be multiplied by a 10 equating to 1000 weighted Conversation Steps that are applied to the Interaction Index.

Further weightings applied in a similar way to the above can be given to the following and again can be varied according to associated variables portfolio conversation display advert portfolio conversation widget portfolio conversation event. A Portfolio Conversation Asset can combine other variables such as country and any permutation of the above to apply weightings to the Portfolio Interactions.

The approach to these weighting for Conversation Asset Interactions also applied to the Conversation AI Entity Interactions which can be treated the same or at a Portfolio chosen variant.

The Portfolio Weightings are not applied to the monetary indexes as is simply a monetary actualization.

In one embodiment the Portfolio Conversation Liquidity Index monitors the trends for the accumulative monetary movements covering portfolio conversation asset monetary index portfolio conversation AI entity monetary index.

In one embodiment as the Portfolio Conversation Liquidity Index is updated as monetary changes occur the Portfolio Conversation Liquidity Index can show trends by hour day month year.

In one embodiment these trends can be drilled down into the Portfolio Conversation Asset Monetary Index and the Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Monetary Index. In turn these Indexes can be drill down into the actual transactions detailed earlier.

In one embodiment should the Portfolio Conversation Liquidity Index be zero or indeed stagnates no changes over time then this means the Portfolio is illiquid.

In one embodiment the Portfolio Conversation Capital Index monitors the trends for the accumulative asset share price movements covering Portfolio Conversation Assets Portfolio Conversation AI Entity Assets.

In one embodiment the Portfolio Conversation Capital Index changes whenever Conversation Assets are added or removed to the production portfolio and an Asset Share Price has been applied or Conversation AI Entity Assets are added or removed to the production portfolio and an Asset Share Price has been applied or Asset Share has been traded.

In one embodiment the latest Asset Share Price used for a transaction is applied to all the Shares of the Asset Total Asset Shares Latest Current Share Price the currency used is determined by the Portfolio Owner.

Within implementations the AI agent may receive the dialogue response from a consumer and perform data analysis. In alternative implementations the DCM Platform may receive a marketing request from a client and perform the data analysis to devise a marketing plan for the client . In one implementation the DCM Platform may create a dialogue agent application based on the client needs

For example a hair dresser manufacturer may submit a request to the DCM Platform for AI marketing service for their new hair dresser product. The manufacturer may provide their marketing budget product information and or the like to the DCM Platform. The DCM Platform may determine the number of AI agents to employ the platform to deploy the AI agent and create a dialogue agent accordingly.

The DCM Platform may then populate the created dialogue agent on search engines and social media and implement the dialogue agent to capture consumer AI interactive dialogues as further illustrated in .

In one implementation the created dialogue agent application may automatically capture and request for client update wherein the client may provide updated product information as further illustrated in . The dialogue agent may incorporate the updated information into the dialogue application and devise interactive dialogue based marketing strategies as further illustrated in .

FIG. A F provide diagrams illustrating creation of a dialogue agent application within embodiments of the DCM Platform. In one embodiment to create a dialogue agent application the DCM Platform may initialize a dialogue agent based on client needs and launch dialogue tree visualization and dialogue script panel . For example as shown in a user interface comprising a split screen that provides dialogue tree visualisation and a dialogue script panel may be provided wherein the left half of the screen may provide a dialogue tree illustrating the evolution of dialogue steps and the right half of the screen may illustrate the dialogue script including information with regard to the dialogue agent subject key words and or the like

In one implementation the DCM Platform may generate dialogue scripts by completing a dialogue tree e.g. joining all the dots within a dialogue tree as shown in . For example as shown in a dot in the dialogue tree may comprise a dialogue line from the AI agent Hi this is your stylist . . . and an ending dot comprises a line Thanks and see you. The dialogue may be considered complete when an ending dot is connected in the dialogue tree.

In one implementation upon completing a dialogue tree the DCM Platform may set social media parameters for the dialogue agent . For example as shown in the DCM Platform may add dialogue agent to a variety of social media platforms such as but not limited to Tiny URL FOLLOW ME Twitter Facebook Blogger LinkedIn Tell Wiki Mobile and or the like. In one implementation the DCM Platform may configure the social media parameters based on client requests. In alternative implementations the DCM Platform may determine the social media deployment based on client marketing budget.

In one implementation the DCM Platform may create dialogue agent application which may be implemented via automatically generating a web service automatically connecting the dialogue web service to an avatar front end based on which a dialogue agent application may be completed .

In a further implementation the dialogue agent application may be created within a dialogue cloud with key words which may be picked up by search engines e.g. Bing Yahoo Google etc. . For example as shown in the dialogue script discussed in may be associated with a keyword hairdresser which may be populated onto Google search for products services related to hairdresser for the AI agent Natalie and the AI agent Natalie may in turn utilize the search results to generate dialogue lines to provide information with regard to the hairdresser to a consumer.

In another further implementation the dialogue agent may be populated onto social media platforms . For example illustrates an automated population of a micro logging and social networking service i.e. Twitter using a shortened URL e.g. Tiny URL etc. .

In another further implementation the dialogue agent may create mobile applications accessible from the internet and smart phone applications e.g. Apple iPhone Blackberry Evo etc. . For example as shown in a dialogue agent avatar may be displayed on a consumer s smart phone and a list of Internet search results on related products and or services may be displayed in contextual adds on alongside the dialogue avatar.

Upon completing creation a dialogue agent application the DCM Platform may also generate wrapper description identification of the dialogue agent application. For example the wrapper of a conversation asset an AI entity asset a portfolio asset and or an exchange asset that contains the created AI agent application may be updated with the description of the application accordingly.

In a further implementation the DCM Platform may register the generated AI agent application on the virtual asset exchange platform and the financial trading platform by generating a wrapper for the agent application as described within embodiments of .

If there is an If Then Else logic the agent may retrieve options for the conditional logic and determines whether the consumer submitted dialogue step contains an outcome. If there is an outcome the agent may select a verbal outcome for each option to present to the consumer . Otherwise the agent may resort to a search engine to generate a hyperlink outcome for the consumer and or direct the consumer to another AI agent to continue the conversation.

For example as shown in the dialogue agent may receive two potential responses from a consumer confirm appointment or cannot attend each associated with a response and as shown in . In another example as shown in the dialogue agent may generate a hyperlink e.g. to suggest the consumer reschedule the appointment. In another example as shown in the dialogue agent may provide a hyperlink to direct the consumer to another AI agent John .

In one implementation to help optimise conventional search the dialogue agent may determine whether a search is requested in the conversation e.g. whether a consumer inquiry is received and or an aid is available to capture search logic outputs and comments with the dialogue agent. In one implementation the dialogue agent may populate key words onto a search engine e.g. Google etc. for results and generate a dialogue line for the consumer based on the Google search results .

In one implementation search engine may not return desirable results. For example illustrates a dialogue search that Google Search failed to match the search need wherein the agent s search on hair salon and stylist in Maldon Essex UK does not return any result. As shown in the dialogue agent may generate a dialogue line based on partial key words search results when Google search failed . For example as shown in when the Google search hairdresser Maldon Essex hair extension fails to return desirable results the dialogue agent may generate a link comprising a list of local hairdressers .

In an alternative implementation the dialogue agent may provide alternate questions to the consumer to obtain information . For example as shown in the dialogue agent may generate a line what type of hair specialist would you like to obtain further information to narrow down the search and thus provide relevant search results based on consumer provided preferences as shown in .

In one implementation the dialogue agent may then update an asset wrapper with the generated search results and the dialogue lines .

In one implementation as shown in a dialogue agent application developer may create a dialogue logic by building a decision tree associated with search engine results. For example a dialogue line Do you want to know about the cheapest battery charger may be generated as a dialogue step for a consumer as the node 1 in the decision tree two conditional responses from the consumer Yes and No are associated with this question and thus form a bipartite branches 2 and 3 in the decision tree. For each branch the dialogue agent may associate a search result link to be incorporated as a dialogue response for the conditional branch.

In one implementation the dialogue builder may be created by a human developer. In another implementation the dialogue applications may form an Internet community to allow Wiki submission of dialogue lines and conditions.

In one implementation the search associated with each dialogue step may be refined progressively based on the consumer submitted feedback. For example as shown in the dialogue agent may start a query on best battery chargers when the consumer triggers the branch Yes the search may be refined to a query on D size best battery charger when the consumer triggers the conditional branch by indicating D size. 

For example in one implementation an exemplar XML implementation of an If Then Else logic in the dialogue may take a form similar to 

In a further implementation the DCM Platform may facilitate a consumer to search for an available dialogue agent in a similar manner as discussed in . For example a consumer may submit battery charger and the DCM Platform may prompt a search on its database for a dialogue agent that can assist on topics related to battery chargers. 

The dialogue agent may then determine a dialogue pathway of the retrieved dialogue . For example FIGS. B a d illustrate examples of pathways taken by a consumer interacting with a dialogue agent wherein each node denotes a dialogue action line in the dialogue tree discussed in . For example FIG. B a shows a dialogue pathway wherein the consumer terminated the interaction before reaching an outcome.

Based on the dialogue pathway the dialogue agent may determine dialogue parameters such as but not limited to an actual number of dialogue actions in the interaction an amount of time taken for each dialogue action and or the like. For example as shown in FIG. B c the number of dialogue actions may be the number of edges along a dialogue pathway and the amount of time for each dialogue action is illustrated in FIG. B d .

In one implementation the dialogue agent may determine whether multiple consumers and or multiple dialogue pathways are included in the dialogue. IF yes the dialogue analytics may aggregate decision pathways across multiple consumers interacting with the dialogue agent as shown in .

The dialogue agent may further analyze value of the dialogue based on the parameters pathways of the dialogue and update the related asset wrapper accordingly. provide an exemplary screen shot illustrating a visualisation with multiple dimensions of dialogue analytics within embodiments of the DCM Platform.

In another implementation the My Hub application may provide a dashboard view for the DCM Platform users to track activities of the dialogue agents and the associated interactions with the consumers. For example shows the My Hub feature may show My Followers from social media platforms a list of My dialogue Agents a list of feedback alerts a list of dialogue agent research on different topics and searches a chart illustrating international dialogue agent performance a list of notes on captured Google searches and outputs and or the like.

In a further implementation interactive marketing may be realized via Internet communities. For example the DCM Platform may use Internet communities recommendation engines and services and social networks e.g. Stumble Upon Digg etc. to stimulate global networking of favourite dialogue agents e.g. by selecting related topics via Stumble Upon as shown in .

In another example each dialogue agent may have its own social media identity e.g. Twitter eBlogger etc. and followers and thus form feedback loops from its followers automatically linked to Twitter as shown in . In this way the dialogue agent and or the DCM Platform may revise the marketing plan e.g. the content language presentation format of the dialogue etc. based on consumer feedbacks on a real time basis.

In one implementation when a consumer has an activity via the social media e.g. update his status indicating a demand of service hair extension as shown in the dialogue agents may receive the status update and automatically generate dialogue lines providing information of hair extension services featuring hair salons which may be advertising clients of the DCM Platform. For another example the dialogue agents may communicate via social networks to update their stored knowledge and information as shown in . Thus dialogue agents and consumers may form a community and group on social media platforms to offer advice and share knowledge of brand products and services.

In a further implementation authors of dialogue agents may use their blogs for publishing details about their advancements and interactions. In a further implementation the DCM Platform may connect to Wikis e.g. Wikipedia etc. to include dialogue agents that are relevant to a subject matter e.g. a dialogue wiki application. For example as shown in the Wikipedia entry of the founder of Artificial intelligence an AI dialogue agent may be associated with the Wikipedia entry to provide interactive knowledge to a reader. For example a reader may ask questions with regard to the topic e.g. what are major academic journals on artificial intelligence etc. and the dialogue agent may then generate answers to the reader.

In a further implementation the DCM Platform may form a dialogue agent application community to build dialogue agent applications enhance existing applications with dialogue agents and or the like. For example the dialogue agent applications may be sold on an Internet store e.g. the iTunes store etc. and business seeking for advertising services may purchase dialogue agent applications for marketing plan executions.

The dialogue agent may further provide instructions to describe symptoms e.g. to explain what is a fever to the consumer. If the consumer indicates a fever the dialogue agent may respond Do not worry and request the consumer select an age status e.g. whether the consumer is under 12 years old. If yes the dialogue agent may direct the conversation to a pediatrician dialogue agent . Otherwise the dialogue agent may link to a knowledge database and provide medical instructions on fever to the consumer . In a further implementation the dialogue agent may generate a search list of physician contacts to the consumer.

In another implementation if the consumer does not select fever the dialogue agent may direct the consumer to a physician dialogue agent for further assistance or suggest the consumer see a physician and provide a list of physician contacts.

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may create ecosystems of a new type of virtual agent application that enables just in time knowledge. For example each virtual agent application has its own decision tree containing scripted dialogue that can be dynamically linked to other applications which facilitates the knowledge acquirer to reach their specific relevant targeted outcomes as shown in .

In one implementation whereas search is barely a one step interaction. these virtual agent applications use a combination of natural and scripted language for a meaningful conversation with consumers including decision outcomes as shown in .

As shown in when a virtual agent application engages in conversation the acquirer interacts with a dialogue step at a time so they only see the selected pathway e.g. a pathway selected by the consumer FIG. B a . Each conversation is captured in a decision string as shown in FIG. B b . In one implementation the dialogue with a person is streamlined along a decision pathway that can be as long or short as needed and if necessary based on questions answered one virtual agent can automatically hand off to another virtual agent on a different decision string with more relevant knowledge and a successful dialogue may end with a decision outcome and thus presents the optimal point for monetization as shown in FIG. B b .

In one embodiment the DCM Platform may obtain and store knowledge to form a world knowledge bank e.g. a knowledge database as shown in . For example each virtual agent app may have an API link with the world knowledge bank for access to the latest version of their knowledge the recording of their dialogue and the orchestration of events such as adverts and transactions. The knowledge bank may be monetized through virtual agent apps across markets.

For example via the knowledge bank DCM Platform may provide knowledge delivery as professional advisory services by virtual agent apps across global health in paramedical world trade paralegal and world trade accounting services and or the like and establish consumer market retail brands provide knowledge delivery through virtual agent apps for consumers across consumables including electronics e.g. digital cameras white goods clothing travel etc. leading to smarter online transactions.

In further implementations the DCM Platform may monetize the knowledge bank with revenues generated from dialogue advertising including multimedia advertisement at each dialogue step tariffs on high quality knowledge exceed the price per display price per click and location based pricing CPM rates and or the like. The DCM Platform may further generate revenue from Dialogue Analytics for business intelligence value from emergent dialogue patterns and flows Transactions Commissions dialogue transaction commission per dialogue step microfinance administration charges corporate services subscription charges to access knowledge portfolios licensed revenues through virtual agent platforms corporate internal knowledge exchange priced per conversation knowledge stock exchanges trading of virtual agent app shares several owners of each virtual agent pass thru transactions such as a financial products derivatives securities and or the like.

Further implementations of the DCM Platform may include a white box artificial intelligence engine associated with a dialogue avatar. The AI engine may support advertisement inventory for each dialogue action and an API may be created to link with an advertisement engine enabling dynamic ad placement and pricing.

For another example The AI Engine may support media placement for selective dialogue actions and placement of movement codes for selective dialogue actions.

In another implementation the AI engine may support placement of semantic codes for selective dialogue actions wherein the semantic codes provides the basis for semantic analytics to generate greater insights and learning. The AI engine may further support placement of ecommerce codes for selective dialogue actions.

In one implementation the AI engine may generate ecommerce codes used to orchestrate 3party ecommerce services for a targeted product or service. The AI engine may further be extended with an API to link dialogue agents into virtual communities for 7 24 accessibility.

In further implementations the AI engine may support automated handover to another dialogue tree which facilitates an infinite number of dialogue pathways to be created and captured during the interaction

In further implementations the DCM Platform may comprise new advertisement inventory across all digital end users use Dialogue Action as a new universal currency for measurement empowers users to create dialogue agent apps create new earning asset for authors orchestrate sponsorship and advertisements orchestrate ecommerce orchestrate media establish foundation for knowledge assets and or the like.

In some embodiments the DCM Platform may optimises search by creating Dialogue Agents that are driven by human powered artificial intelligence In some embodiments the DCM Platform may provide incentives to maximize the population of a dialogue wiki dialogue agents dialogue agent avatars and dialogue agent applications across clouds mobile operators networked marketing networked marketing and networked marketing and social networks in order to maximise highest volume population outcomes.

In some implementations a percentage of the links generated by the dialogue agents may have referral links that give money or incentive value points and or prizes.

In some implementations the dialogue agent may confirm user understanding and compliance via interactive user feedback reward mechanisms and or the like.

In some implementations the dialogue wiki dialogue agents dialogue agent avatars and dialogue agent applications may be aggregated and analyzed for user data characteristics tutorial adoption user interactive feedback such as asking how was your purchase system usage user behaviour s and or the like and structure pay for performance incentives based on the intelligence for various entities participating in providing products and or services for system users.

It should be noted that the term server as used throughout this application refers generally to a computer other device program or combination thereof that processes and responds to the requests of remote users across a communications network. Servers serve their information to requesting clients. The term client as used herein refers generally to a computer program other device user and or combination thereof that is capable of processing and making requests and obtaining and processing any responses from servers across a communications network. A computer other device program or combination thereof that facilitates processes information and requests and or furthers the passage of information from a source user to a destination user is commonly referred to as a node. Networks are generally thought to facilitate the transfer of information from source points to destinations. A node specifically tasked with furthering the passage of information from a source to a destination is commonly called a router. There are many forms of networks such as Local Area Networks LANs Pico networks Wide Area Networks WANs Wireless Networks WLANs etc. For example the Internet is generally accepted as being an interconnection of a multitude of networks whereby remote clients and servers may access and interoperate with one another.

The component collection may be consolidated and or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program components in the program component collection may be instantiated on a single node and or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load balancing and or data processing techniques. Furthermore single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and or storage devices e.g. databases. All program component instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.

The configuration of the DCM Platform controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as but not limited to the budget capacity location and or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and or integrated program components results in a more distributed series of program components and or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration data may be communicated obtained and or provided. Instances of components consolidated into a common code base from the program component collection may communicate obtain and or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to data referencing e.g. pointers internal messaging object instance variable communication shared memory space variable passing and or the like.

If component collection components are discrete separate and or external to one another then communicating obtaining and or providing data with and or to other component components may be accomplished through inter application data processing communication techniques such as but not limited to Application Program Interfaces API information passage distributed Component Object Model D COM Distributed Object Linking and Embedding D OLE and or the like Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA Jini local and remote application program interfaces JavaScript Object Notation JSON Remote Method Invocation RMI SOAP process pipes shared files and or the like. Messages sent between discrete component components for inter application communication or within memory spaces of a singular component for intra application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using development tools such as lex yacc XML and or the like which allow for grammar generation and parsing capabilities which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between components.

where Value1 is discerned as being a parameter because http is part of the grammar syntax and what follows is considered part of the post value. Similarly with such a grammar a variable Value1 may be inserted into an http post command and then sent. The grammar syntax itself may be presented as structured data that is interpreted and or otherwise used to generate the parsing mechanism e.g. a syntax description text file as processed by lex yacc etc. . Also once the parsing mechanism is generated and or instantiated it itself may process and or parse structured data such as but not limited to character e.g. tab delineated text HTML structured text streams XML and or the like structured data. In another embodiment inter application data processing protocols themselves may have integrated and or readily available parsers e.g. JSON SOAP and or like parsers that may be employed to parse e.g. communications data. Further the parsing grammar may be used beyond message parsing but may also be used to parse databases data collections data stores structured data and or the like. Again the desired configuration will depend upon the context environment and requirements of system deployment.

For example in some implementations the DCM Platform controller may be executing a PHP script implementing a Secure Sockets Layer SSL socket server via the information sherver which listens to incoming communications on a server port to which a client may send data e.g. data encoded in JSON format. Upon identifying an incoming communication the PHP script may read the incoming message from the client device parse the received JSON encoded text data to extract information from the JSON encoded text data into PHP script variables and store the data e.g. client identifying information etc. and or extracted information in a relational database accessible using the Structured Query Language SQL . An exemplary listing written substantially in the form of PHP SQL commands to accept JSON encoded input data from a client device via a SSL connection parse the data to extract variables and store the data to a database is provided below
