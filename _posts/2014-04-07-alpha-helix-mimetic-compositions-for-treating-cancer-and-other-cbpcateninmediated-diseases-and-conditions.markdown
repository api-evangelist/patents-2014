This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 124 104 filed May 20 2011 and entitled ALPHA HELIX MIMETIC COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING CANCER AND OTHER CBP CATENIN MEDIATED DISEASES AND CONDITIONS which will issue on Apr. 8 2014 as U.S. Pat. No. 8 691 819 which is the United States national phase of PCT JP2009 06085 filed Oct. 14 2009 and entitled ALPHA HELIX MIMETICS IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER which claims the benefit of Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 105 088 filed Oct. 14 2008 and entitled ALPHA HELIX MIMETICS IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The present invention relates generally to alpha helix mimetic structures and to a compound relating thereto. The invention also relates to applications in the treatment of medical conditions e.g. cancer diseases fibrotic diseases and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the mimetics.

Recently non peptide compounds have been developed which more closely mimic the secondary structure of reverse turns found in biologically active proteins or peptides. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 440 013 to Kahn and published PCT applications nos. WO94 03494 WO01 00210A1 and WO01 16135A2 to Kahn each disclose conformationally constrained non peptidic compounds which mimic the three dimensional structure of reverse turns. In addition U.S. Pat. No. 5 929 237 and its continuation in part U.S. Pat. No. 6 013 458 both to Kahn disclose conformationally constrained compounds which mimic the secondary structure of reverse turn regions of biologically active peptides and proteins. In relation to reverse turn mimetics Kahn disclosed new conformationally constrained compounds which mimic the secondary structure of alpha helix regions of biologically active peptide and proteins in WO2007 056513 and WO2007 056593.

While significant advances have been made in the synthesis and identification of conformationally constrained reverse turn and alpha helix mimetics there remains a need in the art for small molecules which mimic the secondary structure of peptides. There is also a need in the art for libraries containing such members as well as techniques for synthesizing and screening the library members against targets of interest particularly biological targets to identify bioactive library members.

The present invention also fulfills these needs and provides further related advantages by providing conformationally constrained compounds which mimic the secondary structure of alpha helix regions of biologically active peptides and proteins.

Wnt signaling pathway regulates a variety of processes including cell growth oncogenesis and development Moon et al. 1997 Trends Genet. 13 157 162 Miller et al. 1999 Oncogene 18 7860 7872 Nusse and Varmus 1992 Cell 69 1073 1087 Cadigan and Nusse 1997 Genes Dev. 11 3286 3305 Peifer and Polakis 2000 Science 287 1606 1609 Polakis 2000 Genes Dev. 14 1837 1851 .

In the absence of Wnt signals tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli APC simultaneously interacts with the serine kinase glycogen synthase kinase GSK 3 and catenin Su et al. 1993 Science 262 1734 1737 Yost et al. 1996 Genes Dev. 10 1443 1454 Hayashi et al. 1997 Proc.

Phosphorylation of APC by GSK 3 regulates the interaction of APC with catenin which in turn may regulate the signaling function of catenin B. Rubinfeld et al. Science 272 1023 1996 . Wnt signaling stabilizes catenin allowing its translocation to the nucleus where it interacts with members of the lymphoid enhancer factor LEF1 T cell factor TCF4 family of transcription factors Behrens et al. 1996 Nature 382 638 642 Hsu et al. 1998 Mol. Cell. Biol. 18 4807 4818 Roose et al. 1999 Science 285 1923 1926 .

Recently c myc a known oncogene was shown to be a target gene for catenin TCF4 mediated transcription He et al. 1998 Science 281 1509 1512 Kolligs et al. 1999 MoI. Cell. Biol. 19 5696 5706 . Many other important genes including cyclin D1 and metalloproteinase which are also involved in oncogenesis have been identified to be regulated by TCF4 catenin transcriptional pathway Crawford et al. 1999 Oncogene 18 2883 2891 Shtutman et al. 1999 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 11 5522 5527 Tetsu and McCormick 1999 Nature 398 422 426 . Moreover overexpression of several downstream mediators of Wnt signaling has been found to regulate apoptosis Morin et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 7950 7954 He et al. 1999 Cell 99 335 345 Orford et al 1999 J. Cell. Biol. 146 855 868 Strovel and Sussman 1999 Exp. Cell. Res. 253 637 648 . Overexpression of APC in human colorectal cancer cells induced apoptosis Morin et al. 1996 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although mutations in the Wnt gene have not been found in human cancer a mutation in APC or catenin as is the case in the majority of colorectal tumors results in inappropriate activation of TCF4 overexpression of c myc and production of neoplastic growth Rubinfeld et al 1997 Science 275 1790 1792 Morin et al 1997 Science 275 1787 1790 Caca et al 1999 Cell. Growth. Differ. 10 369 376 . The tumor suppressor gene APC is lost or inactivated in 85 of colorectal cancers and in a variety of other cancers as well Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996 Cell 87 159 170 . APCs principal role is that of a negative regulator of the Wnt signal transduction cascade. A center feature of this pathway involves the modulation of the stability and localization of a cytosolic pool of catenin by interaction with a large Axin based complex that includes APC. This interaction results in phosphorylation of catenin thereby targeting it for degradation.

In another aspect of this invention libraries containing compound of the present invention is disclosed. Once assembled the libraries of the present invention may be screened to identify individual members having bioactivity. Such screening of the libraries for bioactive members may involve for example evaluating the binding activity of the members of the library or evaluating the effect the library members have on a functional assay. Screening is normally accomplished by contacting the library members or a subset of library members with a target of interest such as for example an antibody enzyme receptor or cell line. Library members which are capable of interacting with the target of interest are referred to herein as bioactive library members or bioactive mimetics . For example a bioactive mimetic may be a library member which is capable of binding to an antibody or receptor or which is capable of inhibiting an enzyme or which is capable of eliciting or antagonizing a functional response associated for example with a cell line. In other words the screening of the libraries of the present invention determines which library members are capable of interacting with one or more biological targets of interest. Furthermore when interaction does occur the bioactive mimetic or mimetics may then be identified from the library members. The identification of a single or limited number of bioactive mimetic s from the library yields alpha helix mimetic structures which are themselves biologically active and thus are useful as diagnostic prophylactic or therapeutic agents and may further be used to significantly advance identification of lead compounds in these fields.

Synthesis of the peptide mimetics of the library of the present invention may be accomplished using known peptide synthesis techniques in combination with the first second and third component pieces of this invention. More specifically any amino acid sequence may be added to the N terminal and or C terminal of the conformationally constrained alpha helix mimetic. To this end the mimetics may be synthesized on a solid support such as PAM resin by known techniques see e.g. John M. Stewart and Janis D. Young Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis 1984 Pierce Chemical Comp. Rockford III. or on a silyl linked resin by alcohol attachment see Randolph et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 117 5712 19 1995 .

In addition a combination of both solution and solid phase synthesis techniques may be utilized to synthesize the peptide mimetics of this invention. For example a solid support may be utilized to synthesize the linear peptide sequence up to the point that the conformationally constrained alpha helix is added to the sequence. A suitable conformationally constrained alpha helix mimetic structure which has been previously synthesized by solution synthesis techniques may then be added as the next amino acid to the solid phase synthesis i.e. the conformationally constrained alpha helix mimetic which has both an N terminus and a C terminus may be utilized as the next amino acid to be added to the linear peptide . Upon incorporation of the conformationally constrained alpha helix mimetic structures into the sequence additional amino acids may then be added to complete the peptide bound to the solid support. Alternatively the linear N terminus and C terminus protected peptide sequences may be synthesized on a solid support removed from the support and then coupled to the conformationally constrained alpha helix mimetic structures in solution using known solution coupling techniques.

As to methods for constructing the libraries traditional combinatorial chemistry techniques see e.g. Gallop et al. J. Med. Chem. 37 1233 1251 1994 permit a vast number of compounds to be rapidly prepared by the sequential combination of reagents to a basic molecular scaffold. Combinatorial techniques can be used to construct peptide libraries derived from the naturally occurring amino acids. For example by taking 20 mixtures of 20 suitably protected and different amino acids and coupling each with one of the 20 amino acids a library of 400 i.e. 20 dipeptides is created. Repeating the procedure seven times results in the preparation of a peptide library comprised of about 26 billion i.e. 20 octapeptides.

Specifically synthesis of the peptide mimetics of the library of the present invention may be accomplished using known peptide synthesis techniques such as those disclosed for example in WO 2005 116032 which is incorporated herein by reference.

In a further aspect of this invention the present invention provides methods for screening the libraries for bioactivity and isolating bioactive library members.

In one embodiment data of biological activity is determined in the following manner. All of compounds are assayed by using a method of the following reporter gene assay.

Screening for inhibitory action of the Wnt signaling pathway can be carried out according to the following procedure using the stably transfected cell line Hek 293 STF1.1.

The libraries of the present invention also can be screened for bioactivity by other various techniques and methods. For example the screening assay may be performed by 1 contacting the mimetics of a library with a biological target of interest such as a receptor to allow binding between the mimetics of the library and the target to occur and 2 detecting the binding event by an appropriate assay such as the calorimetric assay disclosed by Lam et al. Nature 354 82 84 1991 or Graminski et al. Biotechnology 12 1008 1011 1994 both of which are incorporated herein by reference . In a preferred embodiment the library members are in solution and the target is immobilized on a solid phase. Alternatively the library may be immobilized on a solid phase and may be probed by contacting it with the target in solution.

A method for carrying out a binding assay also can be applied as follows. The method can include providing a composition that includes a first co activator an interacting protein and a test compound. The amino acid structure of the first co activator includes a binding motif of LXXLL LXXLI or FxxFF wherein X is any amino acid. The method further includes detecting an alteration in binding between the first co activator and the interacting protein due to the presence of the compound and then characterizing the test compound in terms of its effect on the binding. The assay may be carried out by any means that can measure the effect of a test compound on the binding between two proteins. Many such assays are known in the art and can be utilized in the method of the present invention including the so called Two Hybrid and Split Hybrid systems. The Two Hybrid system and various means to carry out an assay using this system are described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6 410 245. The Split Hybrid system has been described by e.g. Hsiu Ming Shih et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 13896 13901 November 1996 and John D. Crispino et al. Molecular Cell 3 1 20 February 1999. In the Split Hybrid system a fusion protein is utilized where protein X is fused to the lexA DNA binding domains pLexA and protein Y is fused to the transcription activator VP16 pSHM.1 LacZ . Interaction between lexA X and VP16 Y leads to the expression of the Tetracycline repressor protein TetR . TetR prevents transcription of the HIS3 reporter gene making the cells unable to grow on media lacking histidine. Disruption of protein protein interaction will restore the ability of the cells to grow on such media by shutting down expression of the tetracycline repressor. Accordingly compounds of the present invention may be added to the growing cells and if the addition of the compound restores the ability of the cells to grow on the media the compound may be seen as an effective disrupter of the protein protein interaction. The yeast strains required to make the Split Hybrid system work can be employed with two hybrid LexA VP16 constructs such as those described by Stanley M. Hollenberg et al. Molecular and Cellular Biology 15 7 3813 3822 July 1995. A useful modification of the Split Hybrid system was utilized by Takemaru K. I. and Moon R. T. J. of Cell Biol. 149 249 254 2000.

Other assay formats can also be suitable. For example reporter gene assays for AP 1 ELISA for example blocking the production of IL 2 by a T cell line after stimulation with CD3 and CD28 to look for inhibitors of IL 2 transcription. Direct binding assays between coactivators and their partners can be performed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy Biacore Sweden manufactures suitable instruments or ELISA.

The transcriptional coactivator can be a human transcriptional coactivator. In another embodiment the transcriptional coactivator is a member of the p300 CBP family of co activators which have histone acetyltransferase activity. p300 is described for example by Eckner et al 1994 and CBP by Bannister and Kouzarides 1996. For the 5 purposes of the present is invention reference to p300 CBP refers to human allelic and synthetic variants of p300 and to other mammalian variants and allelic and synthetic variants thereof as well as fragments of said human and mammalian forms of p300.

In another aspect of the invention the first co activator is CBP or p300.

The test compound is selected from compounds as described herein. For example compounds having the formula I . Typically a test compound can be evaluated at several different concentrations where these concentrations will be selected in part based on the conditions of the assay e.g. the concentrations of the first co activator and the interacting protein. Concentrations in the range of about 0.1 to 10 M may be used. In one aspect the assay evaluates the relative efficacy of two compounds to affect the binding interaction between two proteins where at least one of those two compounds is a compound of the present invention. The more effective compound can than serve as a reference compound in a study of the relationship between compound structure and compound activity.

Compounds of general formula I may inhibit CBP mediated transcriptional activation in cancer cells due to their specific binding to CBP. The compounds of the present invention may also inhibit the survivin expression in SW480 cells and therefore inhibit the oncogenic activity in cancer cells.

The compounds of the present invention can be used for inhibiting cancer cells and thus would be useful for the regulation of cell growth. The compounds of the present invention can be also advantageously used for inducing apoptosis in cells.

The present invention is also related to prodrugs using the libraries containing one or more compounds of formula I . A prodrug is typically designed to release the active drug in the body during or after absorption by enzymatic and or chemical hydrolysis. The prodrug approach is an effective means of improving the oral bioavailability or i.v. administration of poorly water soluble drugs by chemical derivatization to more water soluble compounds. The most commonly used prodrug approach for increasing aqueous solubility of drugs containing a hydroxyl group is to produce esters containing an ionizable group e.g. phosphate group carboxylate group alkylamino group Fleisher et al. Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews 115 130 1996 Davis et al. Cancer Res. 7247 7253 .

In other aspects the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions containing a compound having the general formula I . These compositions may be used in various methods e.g. treating cancer fibrosis or Alzheimer s disease of the present invention as described in detail below.

The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral e.g. intravenous intradermal subcutaneous oral e.g. inhalation transdermal topical transmucosal and rectal administration. Solutions or suspensions e.g. injection used for parenteral particularly intravenous intradermal or subcutaneous application can include the following components a sterile diluent such as water for injection saline solution fixed oils polyethylene glycols glycerine propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid buffers such as acetates citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. In addition pH may be adjusted with acids or bases such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.

Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions where water soluble or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration suitable carriers include physiological saline bacteriostatic water Cremophor EL BASF Parsippany N.J. or phosphate buffered saline PBS . In all cases the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing for example water ethanol polyol for example glycerol propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol ascorbic acid thimerosal and the like. In many cases it will be preferable to include isotonic agents for example sugars polyalcohols such as mannitol sorbitol sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption for example aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound e.g. a compound having general formula I in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They can be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets troches or capsules.

Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash wherein the compound in the fluid carrier is applied orally and swished and expectorated or swallowed. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition.

Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art and include for example for transmucosal administration detergents bile salts and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration the active compounds are formulated into ointments salves gels or creams as generally known in the art.

The compounds can also be prepared in the form of suppositories e.g. with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides or retention enemas for rectal delivery.

In one embodiment the active compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body such as a controlled release formulation including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable biocompatible polymers can be used such as ethylene vinyl acetate polyanhydrides polyglycolic acid collagen polyorthoesters and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals Inc.

These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art for example as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811.

It can be advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be treated each unit containing a 5 predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved and the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of individuals.

Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine TAXOL and topo II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin.

A compound with general formula I administered in combination with an anti neoplastic agent does not necessarily require that the compound and the anti neoplastic agent be administered concurrently. The compound and the agent may be administered separately as long as at a time point they both have effects on same cancer cells.

For example the administration mode may be exemplified by 1 administration of a single preparation obtained by simultaneously formulating the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent 2 simultaneous administration through the same administration route of two preparations obtained by separately formulating the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent 3 administration with a time interval through the same administration route of two preparations obtained by separately formulating the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent 4 simultaneous administration through different administration routes of two preparations obtained by separately formulating the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent 5 administration with a time interval through different administration routes of two preparations obtained by separately formulating the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent e.g. administration in order of the compound of formula I and then the other anti neoplastic agent or administration in the reverse order or the like. The amount of the other anti neoplastic agent to be administered can be appropriately selected with reference to the clinically used dosage. The mixing ratio of the compound of the compound of formula I and the other anti neoplastic agent can be appropriately selected in accordance with the subject of administration administration route disease to be treated symptoms combination and the like.

In addition the compound of the present invention can be also used in combination with for example gene therapy involving VEGF TNFa or the like or therapeutic methods involving various antibody medicines or the like.

In a further related aspect the present invention provides methods for promoting apoptosis in cancer cells. Such methods comprise the step of contacting cancer cells with a compound having general formula I in an amount effective to promote apoptosis in these cells. A compound promotes apoptosis if the number of cancer cells undergoing apoptosis is statistically significantly larger in the presence of the compound than that in the absence of the compound. Such compounds may be identified by methods known in the art e.g. measuring caspase activities and or cell death using cultured cancer cell lines xenografts or animal cancer models. Preferably the compound is more active in promoting apoptosis in cancer cells than in normal cells. Cancer cells treatable by the present method may be from various tissue origins.

In another aspect of the present invention a method for treating a disorder modulated by Wnt signaling pathway in which the method comprises administering to a patient a safe and effective amount of the compounds having general formula I is disclosed. Pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of the present invention can be also used for this purpose. In this connection it is found in the present invention that the compounds having general formula I or the pharmaceutical composition containing thereof can be useful for the treatment of disorder modulated by TCF4 catenin CBP complex which is believed to be responsible for initiating the overexpression of cancer cells related to Wnt signaling pathway. Thus it is another aspect of the present invention to provide a method for the treatment of disorder modulated by TCF4 catenin CBP complex using the compounds having the general formula I .

The present invention also provides compounds and methods for inhibiting survivin expression. Survivin is a target gene of the TCF catenin pathway and more specifically is a target gene of the TCF catenin CBP pathway. It is a member of the IAP Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein family of proteins. Biological activity associated with survivin includes highly expressed at G2 M regulating cell cycle entry and exit associated with microtubule centrosomes centromeres and midbody depending upon the phases of the cell cycle and anti apoptosis via interacting directly or indirectly with caspases e.g. caspase 3 7 and 9 . In connection with cancer survivin is widely and highly expressed in tumor cells but expressed to little or no extent in normal tissue cells. Also it has been observed that cancer patients whose tumors expressed survivin had a decreased overall survival. Furthermore the degree of survivin expression has been correlated with other cancer markers e.g. Ki67 PNCA p53 APC etc.

In an embodiment of the present invention the compound s of the present invention or pharmaceutical formulations containing one or more compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment and or prevention of fibrosis in general. Below is a further description of examples of various types forms of fibrosis that are treatable with the compounds of the present invention.

Transforming growth factor TGF a key mediator in the development of fibrosis is important in cell proliferation and differentiation apoptosis and deposition of extracellular matrix ECM . TGF signaling activates both the Smad and AP 1 transcription pathways. TGF in the airways of patients with pulmonary fibrosis PF may function initially as a healing molecule involved in the diminution of initial airway inflammation and in tissue repair. However with continued inflammatory response such as may occur in PF the balance may be shifted to excessive ECM deposition and development of airway fibrosis.

Fibroproliferative diseases are generally caused by the activation of resident stellate cells which are found in most organs. This activation of stellate cells leads to their conversion to myofibroblasts which display characteristics of muscle and non muscle cells. Activated stellate cells initiate inflammatory signals principally mediated through TGF . Inflammatory cytokines and mediators in addition to TGF lead to proliferation of myofibroblasts. Stellate derived myofibroblasts proliferate and replace healthy functional organ cells with extra cellular matrix that exhibit muscle and connective tissue traits. Ultimately organ failure results when the nonfunctional fibrotic honeycomb matrix replaces a critical number of healthy cells.

The initial cause of fibrosis is believed to be the result of injury or insult to organ tissues. This cellular injury to organ tissues can often be traced to toxic or infectious agents. Pulmonary fibrosis or interstitial lung disease is often the result of smoking chronic asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD or pneumonia. Fibrosis affects nearly all tissues and organ systems. Non limiting examples of disorders in which fibrosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality are listed below.

Interstitial lung disease ILD includes a wide range of distinct disorders in which pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis are the final common pathway of pathology. There are more than 150 causes of ILD including sarcoidosis silicosis adverse drug reactions infections and collagen vascular diseases and systemic sclerosis scleroderma .

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF is the most common type of ILD. Liver cirrhosis has similar causes to ILD with viral hepatitis schistosomiasis and chronic alcoholism being the major causes worldwide.

Kidney disease including diabetes can damage and scar the kidneys which leads to progressive loss of function. Untreated hypertension can also contribute to the fibroproliferation of the kidneys.

Chronic pancreatitis is an irreversible disease of the pancreas characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis which leads to the loss of endocrine and exocrine function.

Fibroproliferative disorders include systemic and local scleroderma. Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease that may be localized or systemic and may have an affect in many organs and tissues of the body.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars which can occur after surgery traumatic wounds burns or even scratches. They manifest as an overgrowth of scar tissue at the site of injury.

Atherosclerosis and restenosis. Restenosis refers to the re narrowing of a coronary artery after angioplasty to treat atherosclerosis. Scarring associated with trauma can be associated with overgrowth of scar tissue at the site of the trauma related injury. Surgical complications can lead to fibrosis in any organ in which scar tissue and fibroproliferation result from the surgical procedures.

Chemotherapy induced fibrosis can occur in for example the lungs following chemotherapy manifests as pulmonary fibrosis and can be severe enough to require lung transplant even in cases where the underlying malignancy did not affect the lungs.

Radiation induced fibrosis RIF is a serious and common complication of radiation therapy that may cause chronic pain neuropathy limited movement of joints and swelling of the lymph nodes. It occurs most often in breast head neck and connective tissues. RIF may develop from 4 6 months to 1 2 years following exposure to radiation therapy and it becomes more severe over time. Risk factors for developing RIF include high radiation dose large volumes of tissue exposed to radiation and radiation combined with surgery chemotherapy or both.

Burns can lead to fibrosis when there is an overproduction of ECM proteins. Excessive ECM deposition causes the tissue to become fibrotic.

Pulmonary fibrosis destroys the lung s ability to transport oxygen and other gases into or out of the blood. This disease modifies the delicate and elastic tissues of the lung changing these tissues into thicker stiff fibrous tissue. This change or replacement of the original tissue is similar to the permanent scarring that can occur to other damaged tissues. Scarring of the lung reduces the lung s ability to allow gases i.e. oxygen carbon dioxide to pass into or out of the blood. Gradually the air sacs of the lungs become replaced by fibrotic tissue. When the scar forms the tissue becomes thicker causing an irreversible loss of the tissue s ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. Symptoms include shortness of breath particularly with exertion chronic dry hacking cough fatigue and weakness discomfort in the chest loss of appetite and rapid weight loss.

Several causes of pulmonary fibrosis are known and they include occupational and environmental exposures. Many jobs particularly those that involve mining or that expose workers to asbestos or metal dusts can cause pulmonary fibrosis. Workers doing these kinds of jobs may inhale small particles like silica dusts or asbestos fibers that can damage the lungs especially the small airways and air sacs and cause the scarring associated with fibrosis. Agricultural workers also can be affected. Some organic substances such as moldy hay cause an allergic reaction in the lung. This reaction is called Farmer s Lung and can cause pulmonary fibrosis. Other fumes found on farms are directly toxic to the lungs.

Another cause is Sarcoidosis a disease characterized by the formation of granulomas areas of inflammatory cells which can attack any area of the body but most frequently affects the lungs.

Certain medicines may have the undesirable side effect of causing pulmonary fibrosis as can radiation such as treatment for breast cancer. Connective tissue or collagen diseases such as systemic sclerosis are also associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Although genetic and familial factors may be involved this cause is not as common as the other causes listed above.

In Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD connective tissue proliferation and fibrosis can characterize severe COPD. COPD can develop as a result of smoking or chronic asthma.

When all known causes of interstitial lung disease have been ruled out the condition is called idiopathic of unknown origin pulmonary fibrosis IPF . Over 83 000 Americans are living with IPF and more than 31 000 new cases develop each year. This debilitating condition involves scarring of the lungs. The lungs air sacs develop scar or fibrotic tissue which gradually interferes with the body s ability to transfer the oxygen into the bloodstream preventing vital organs and tissue from obtaining enough oxygen to function normally.

There are several theories as to what may cause IPF including viral illness and allergic or environmental exposure including tobacco smoke . These theories are still being researched. Bacteria and other microorganisms are not thought to be the cause of IPF. There is also a familial form of the disease known as familial idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Additional research is being done to determine whether there is a genetic tendency to develop the disease as well as to determine other causes of IPF.

Patients with IPF suffer similar symptoms to those with pulmonary fibrosis when their lungs lose the ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. The symptoms include shortness of breath particularly during or after physical activity spasmodic dry cough gradual unintended weight loss fatigue and weakness chest discomfort clubbing or enlargement of the ends of the fingers or sometimes the toes due to a buildup of tissue. These symptoms can greatly reduce IPF patients quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation and oxygen therapy can reduce the lifestyle altering effects of IPF but do not provide a cure.

In order to develop a treatment for fibrotic disease it is important to focus on the common pathway to the ultimate pathology that is shared by the disease states regardless of cause or of tissue in which it is manifested. Several components of the causative pathway are discussed below particularly in relation to the role of catenin.

Survivin an inhibitor of apoptosis is implicated in pulmonary hypertension. CK2 kinase activity has been shown to promote cell survival by increasing survivin expression via catenin Tcf Lef mediated transcription. Tapia J. C. et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 103 15079 84 2006 . This pathway therefore provides another opportunity to utilize the present compounds to alter the catenin mediated gene transcription processes.

McMurtry M. S. et al. J. Clin. Invest. 115 1461 1463 2005 reported that survivin was expressed in the pulmonary arteries of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension but not in the pulmonary arteries of patients without pulmonary arterial hypertension. Comparable results were found in rats treated with monocrotaline to induce pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the rats survival was prolonged and the pulmonary arterial hypertension was reversed by gene therapy with inhalation of an adenovirus carrying a survivin mutant with dominant negative properties.

Survivin expression is upregulated in hyperproliferative neovasculature Simosa H. F. et al. J. Vasc. Surg. 41 682 690 2005 . Survivin was specifically expressed in human atherosclerotic plaque and stenotic vein grafts. In a rabbit model of hyperplasia after balloon injury of iliofemoral arteries treatment with a phosphorylation defective survivin mutant vector reduced the neointimal area. The correlation between survivin expression and regulation of a smooth muscle cell phenotype after vascular injury points to survivin as a target for therapy in treating vascular disease.

Survivin is amenable to targeting by administration of a compound disclosed herein via one or more of the routes as described herein. Without being bound by a particular mode of action the compounds disclosed herein can be administered in the form of coated stents for example in connection with angioplasty. The methods for preparing coated stents are described in the art and would be modified as needed for use with the compounds of the invention. For example U.S. Pat. No. 7 097 850 discloses and teaches methods of coating a stent with a variety of bioactive compounds. U.S. Pat. No. 7 087 078 discloses methods of preparing a stent with at least one active ingredient. Both coronary and peripheral stents are amenable to incorporating one or more compounds disclosed herein. Further teachings regarding drug coated stents is available in Grube E. et al. Herz 29 162 6 2004 and W. L. Hunter Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 58 347 9 2006 .

Bone marrow cells contribute to transplant associated atherosclerosis Sata M. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 13 249 253 2003 . Bone marrow cells also contribute to the pathogenesis of lesion formation after n lechanical vascular injury Sata M. et al. Nat. Med. 8 403 409 2002 . Thus by treating atherosclerosis and vascular damage with one of more compounds of the invention reduction in vascular lesion formation can be accomplished.

Survivin also plays a role in vein graft hyperplasia Wang G. J. et al. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 25 2081 2087 2005 . Bypass grafts often develop intimal hyperplasia a fibroproliferative lesion characterized by intimal thickening. Rabbit vein grafts were treated with adenoviral survivin constructs. Transgene expression was demonstrated in all the adenovirus treated grafts. Treatment with a dominant negative mutant adenovirus decreased cellular proliferation in the early phase of graft remodeling. The data provide evidence for an important role of survivin in the regulation of vein graft remodeling in this system as well and further support a role for the compounds of the invention in conjunction with bypass grafts.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis LAM is a disease that occurs in some patients with tuberous sclerosis complex Moss J. et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit Care Med. 163 669 671 2001 .

Cystic lung disease in LAM is characterized by abnormal smooth muscle cell proliferation. Compounds disclosed herein are expected to find use in regulating and alleviating the cell proliferation thus moderating the clinical symptoms.

In pulmonary fibrosis the normally thin lung tissue is replaced with thick coarse scar tissue that impairs the flow of oxygen into the blood and leads to a loss of lung function. A growing body of research suggests that excess TGF is the immediate cause of the fibrosis. This over expression of TGF has been shown to cause pulmonary fibrosis in mice. An abnormally high TGF signal causes healthy epithelial cells in the lung to die via apoptosis. Cell death leads to the replacement of healthy lung tissue by thick poor functioning scar tissue. Apoptosis of healthy epithelial cells is required prior to the development of pulmonary fibrosis Elias et al . One form of treatment of fibrotic lung disorders involves administering drugs that specifically inhibit TGF which in turn blocks apoptosis preventing the formation of fibrotic tissue in the lung. However for reasons discussed below TGF itself may not be an ideal therapeutic target.

TGF is a member of the transforming growth factor superfamily which consists of secreted polypeptide signaling molecules involved in cell proliferation and differentiation apoptosis deposition of extracellular matrix ECM and cell adhesion. TGF is a potent inhibitor of cell growth and has immunosuppressive properties. However TGF also causes the deposition of ECM components leading to fibrosis. A role for TGF as a key mediator in the development of fibrosis relates to its ability to act as a chemoattractant for fibroblasts stimulate fibroblast procollagen gene expression collagen protein synthesis and inhibit collagen breakdown. TGF further stabilizes the ECM by inhibiting the expression of ECM proteases and stimulating the expression of ECM protease inhibitors. The fibrinolysis system is essential in ECM accumulation and fibrosis. Inhibition of fibrinolysis results in the accumulation of fibrin and ECM. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 PAI 1 is the key inhibitor of fibrinolysis. The PAI promoter contains several transcription factor binding sites including an AP 1 and Smad binding elements that promote PAI 1 induction by TGF . PAI 1 is the primary inhibitor of both tissue type TPA and urokinase type plasminogen uPA activator. Thus TGF and PAI 1 work in tandem to produce the characteristic tissue of fibrosis.

In the bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis PF mice in which the PAI 1 gene is deleted are protected from developing PF. Additionally adenovirus mediated transfer of the uPA gene to the lung significantly reduces the production of lung hydroxyproline and attenuated the bleomycin induced increase in lung collagen both hallmarks of fibrosis. The TGF signaling pathway is complex. TGF family members bind to specific pairs of receptor serine threonine kinases. Upon binding the ligand acts to assemble two type I and two type II receptors into a complex. The type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor that subsequently phosphorylates the intracellular substrates Smad 2 and Smad 3. This complex then binds Smad 4 and translocates to the nucleus for signal propagation. TGF can also activate AP 1 transcription via the MAPK pathway. TGF may originally act as a healing molecule in the lung or liver after initial inflammation and injury to the tissue. However with continued inflammation injury the balance may be shifted to excessive fibroproliferation and ECM deposition leading to an endless healing process and development of fibrosis. Thus complete inhibition of TGF could initially undermine the healing process.

TGF is highly expressed in airway epithelium and macrophages of small airways in patients with COPD. Using anti inflammatory therapies such as corticosteroids and interferon to treat PF has been disappointing due to variable efficacy and significant adverse effects. Therefore an important goal is to identify small molecules that interact with previously identified molecular pathways i.e. TGF signaling involved in the development of fibrosis to prevent the progression or reverse the fibrosis seen in patients.

Vertebrate Wnt proteins are homologues of the Drosophila wingless gene and have been shown to play important roles in regulating cell differentiation proliferation and polarity. Cadigan K. M. et al. Genes Dev. 11 3286 3305 1997 Parr B. A. et al. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 4 523 528 1994 Smalley M. J. et al. Cancer Met. Rev. 18 215 230 1999 and Willert K. et al. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 8 95 102 1998 . Wnt proteins are cysteine rich secreted glycoproteins that signal through at least three known pathways. The best understood of these commonly called the canonical pathway involves binding of Wnt proteins to frizzled cell surface receptors and low density lipoprotein cell surface co receptors thereby inhibiting glycogensynthase kinase 313 GSK 313 phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal protein catenin. This hypophosphorylated catenin is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds to members of the LEFITCF family of transcription factors. Binding of catenin converts LEF TCF factors from repressors to activators thereby switching on cell specific gene transcription. The other two pathways that Wnt proteins can signal through either activate calmodulin kinase II and protein kinase C known as the Wnt Ca pathway or jun N terminal kinase also known as the planar cell polarity pathway .

Several components of the Wnt pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis in humans and mice and studies of those have in turn identified a role for catenin. Wntl was first identified from a retroviral integration in mice that caused mammary tumors. Tsukamoto A. S. et al. Cell 55 619 625 1988 and Jue S. F. et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 12 321 328 1992 . Overexpression of protein kinase CK2 in the mammary gland which potentiates catenin dependent Wnt signaling also increases the incidence of mammary tumors in transgenic mice. Landesman Bollag E. et al. Oncogene 20 3247 3257 2001 and Song D. H. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275 23790 23797 2000 . Gut epithelia has revealed the most extensive correlation between Wnt signaling and tumorigenesis. Several reports have described mutations in catenin itself in some colon tumors and these mutations occur in or near the GSK 313 phosphorylation sites. Polakis P. et al. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 470 23 32 1999 and Morin P. J. et al. Science 275 1787 1790 1997 . Chilosi and colleagues Chilosi M. et al. Am. J. Pathol. 162 1495 1502 2003 investigated catenin mutations in IPF patients but did not identify any. This is consistent with a mechanism in which the aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway is a response and not a cause of IPF.

In the mouse the lung arises from the primitive foregut endoderm starting at approximately E9.5 during mouse development. Warburton D. et al. Mech. Dev. 92 55 81 2000. This primitive epithelium is surrounded by mesodermally derived multipotent mesenchymal cells which in time will differentiate into several cell lineages including bronchial and vascular smooth muscle pulmonary fibroblasts and endothelial cells of the vasculature. During gestation the airway epithelium evolves and grows through a process termed branching morphogenesis. This process results in the three dimensional arborized network of airways required to generate sufficient surface area for postnatal respiration. Mouse embryonic lung development can be divided into at least four stages embryonic E9.5 to E12.5 pseudoglandular EI2.5 to E16.0 canalicular EI6.0 to EI7.5 and saccular alveolar EI7.5 to postnatal .

During development epithelial mesenchymal signaling plays an important role in the regulation of both epithelial and mesenchymal cell differentiation and development. Several important signaling molecules are expressed in the airway epithelium and signal to the adjacent mesenchyme including members of the bone morphogenetic family BMP 4 transforming growth factor family TGF 1 2 and sonic hedgehog SHH . In turn the mesenchyme expresses several signaling molecules such as FGF 7 9 and 10 important for lung epithelial development and proliferation. Gain of function and loss of function experiments in mice have demonstrated an important role for each of these factors in regulating lung epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation and differentiation. Bellusci S. et al. Development 1997 124 4867 4878 Simonet W. S. et al. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 1995 92 12461 12465 Clark J C. et al. Am. J. Physiol. 2001 280 L705 L715 Min H. et al. Genes Dev. 1998 12 3156 3161 Motoyama 1. et al. Nat. Genet. 1998 20 54 57 Litingtung Y et al. Nat. Genet. 1998 20 58 61 Pepicelli C. V. et al. Curr. Biol. 1998 8 1083 1086 Weaver M. et al. Development 1999 126 4005 4015.

Wnt signaling also plays a role during lung development. Several Wnt genes are expressed in the developing and adult lung including Wnt2 Wnt2b 13 Wnt7b Wnt5a and Wnt1l. Kispert A. et al. Development 1996 122 3627 3637 Lin Y. et al. Dev. Dyn. 2001 222 26 39 Monkley S. J et al. Development 1996 122 3343 3353 Yamaguchi T. P. et al. Development 1999 126 1211 1223 Weidenfeld J. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2002 277 21061 21070. Of these Wnt5a and Wnt7b are expressed at high levels exclusively in the developing airway epithelium during lung development. Wnt2 Wnt5a and Wnt7b have been inactivated through homologous recombination in mice. Wnt2 null mice do not display an overt lung phenotype and Wnt5a null mice have late stage lung maturation defects corresponding to expression of Wnt5a later in lung development. Monkley 1996 Li C. et al. Dev. Biol. 248 68 81 2002 . Inactivation of Wnt7b results in either early embryo demise because of defects in extra embryonic tissues or perinatal demise because of defects in lung development. Parr B. A. et al. Dev. Biol. 237 324 332 2001 Shu W. et al. Development 129 4831 4842 2002 . These lung defects include decreased mesenchymal proliferation lung hypoplasia caused by reduced branching and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle defects leading to blood vessel hemorrhage in the lung Shu W. 2002 . Thus Wnt signaling regulates important aspects of both epithelial and mesenchymal development during gestation likely through both autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms.

Accumulation of nuclear catenin has been observed in both epithelial and mesenchymal myofibroblasts cell lineages in adult human lung. Other reports support these observations during mouse lung development. Tebar M. et al. Mech. Dev. 109 437 440 2001 . Type 2 pneumocytes appear to express high levels of catenin both in the embryo and in the adult. Tebar 2001 . Type 2 cells are precursors of type 1 cells which form the thin diffusible stratum important for gas exchange in the lung. Type 2 cells have been shown to re enter the cell cycle grow and differentiate into type 1 cells in some models of lung re epithelialization. Borok Z. et al. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 12 50 55 1995 Danto S.1. et al. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 12 497 502 1995 .

Importantly type 2 cells proliferate excessively during idiopathic fibrosis IPF and other proliferative lung diseases and increased nuclear catenin in these cells suggests that Wnt signaling regulates this proliferation. Kawanami O. et al. Lab. Invest. 46 39 53 1982 Kasper M. et al. Histol. Histopathol. 11 463 483 1996 . Increased proliferation of type 2 cells in IPF may also inhibit their differentiation into type 1 cells because excessive proliferation is often antagonistic to cellular differentiation. In this context it is important to note that expression of certain important transcriptional and signaling regulators in the lung decreases with gestational age. Forced overexpression of some of these such as BMP 4 GATA6 and Foxa2 results in aberrant lung development that exhibits many aspects of arrested lung epithelial maturity. Weaver 1999 Koutsourakis M. et al. Mech. Dev. 105 105 114 2001 Zhou L. et al. Dev. Dyn. 210 305 314 1997 . Thus a careful balance of the correct spatial and temporal expression of certain regulatory genes is required for normal lung development and improper activation of these pathways can result in severe defects in epithelial differentiation.

Nuclear catenin is found in the mesenchyme adjacent to the airway epithelium Chilosi 2003 and this is significant especially because these cells appear to be myofibroblastic in nature and may contribute to bronchial and vascular smooth muscle in the lung. Although Wnt signals in these mesenchymal cells could be autocrine in nature it is just as likely that the mesenchymal cells are responding to a paracrine signal from the airway epithelium where Wnts such as Wnt5a and Wnt7b are expressed. In this way the epithelium may be responsible for causing the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling in adjacent mesenchyme leading to increased fibrosis and damage to the lung. This is particularly relevant because of the increase in the number of type 2 cells in the airways of IPF patients. This may also be reflective of a switch to an embryonic phenotype in the alveolus where type 1 cells are rare. In turn this would result in an increase in expression of several genes including Wnts such as Wnt7b whose expression is dramatically down regulated in postnatal development. Weidenfeld 2002 Shu 2002. The increased level of Wnts may inhibit the proper differentiation of more mature alveolar cells such as type 1 cells impairing the repair process.

Because nuclear translocation of catenin is a result of Wnt signaling activity its presence in cells such as distal airway epithelium and in mesenchyme adjacent to airway. Epithelium suggests that epithelial mesenchymal Wnt signaling is active and likely plays an important role during both lung development and disease states such as IPF.

A link has been shown between Wnt signaling and regulation of cell matrix interactions including cell adhesion and migration. In particular Wnt signaling has been shown to affect cell motility and invasiveness of melanoma cells. Weeraratna A. T. et al. Cancer Cell 1 279 288 2002 . In this system melanoma cells overexpressing Wnt5a displayed increased adhesiveness which correlated to a reorganized actin cytoskeleton Weer 2002 . These data suggest that Wnt5a expression correlates directly with the metastatic ability of melanoma tumors. In IPF lung tissue Chilosi 2003 the important extracellular matrix metalloproteinase matrilysin was overexpressed in some of the cells containing high levels of nuclear catenin. This is supported by previous studies showing that matrilysin is a molecular target of Wnt signaling. Crawford H. C. Oncogene 18 2883 2891 1999. Matrilysin has been linked to a role in carcinogenesis both in intestinal and endometrial tumors. Increased matrilysin expression strongly correlates with increased nuclear catenin expression and inhibition of this nuclear translocation results in decreased matrilysin expression. Crawford 1999. Without being bound by a specific hypothesis the mechanism may involve increased degradation of the extracellular matrix from increased matrilysin expression leading to decreased cell adhesion and increased cell motility. In IPF this might reduce the ability of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells to properly restructure the alveolar architecture after injury. In addition extracellular matrix integrity may be required for type 1 cell differentiation because of their flattened morphology and the very large surface area that they cover in the alveolus. This process may contribute to an increase in type 2 cell proliferation which in turn could decrease type 1 cell differentiation.

Without being bound by a specific hypothesis several models could explain the finding that Wnt signaling is aberrantly activated in IPF. First unregulated activation of the Wnt signaling pathway could be a physiological response to either lung injury or the repair process possibly because of the requirement of the Wnt pathway for proliferation in cells such as type 2 alveolar epithelium and adjoining myofibroblasts. In this model Wnt signaling should deactivate once the repair process is complete leading to a return to normal proliferation. the second model aberrant Wnt signaling is the initiating event leading to increased cell proliferation in type 2 cells which may inhibit their ability to differentiate into type 1 cells and restructure the alveolar architecture properly. Either injury induced or spontaneous mutations in certain components of the canonical Wnt pathway or in regulatory molecules that regulate this pathway may result in this dysregulation of cell proliferation. The fact that nuclear catenin is up regulated in other lung proliferative diseases suggests that the previous data Chilosi 2003 may be a response and not a primary causative event in IPF. Moreover the unregulated proliferation in type 2 cells and mesenchymal fibroblasts along with the increased presence of nuclear catenin suggests that the Wnt pathway is continuously stimulated in lung diseases such as IPF and that inhibitors of Wnt signaling may provide a means to control this proliferation. Increased nuclear catenin was detected in the mesenchyme adjacent to the airway epithelium described as myofibroblasts. Chilosi 2003. These myofibroblastscan induce apoptosis in neighboring epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo probably through degradation of the extracellular matrix. Uhal B. D. et al. Am. J. Physiol. 275 L1192 L1199 1998 Uhal B. D. et al. Am. J. Physiol. 269 L819 L828 1995 Selman M. et al. Am. J. Physiol. 279 L562 L574 2000. In addition in IPF there appears to be either a lack of re epithelialization or an increase in type 2 cells with little if any maturation of type 1 cells leading to injured areas with exposed mesodermal components or re epithelialized with immature type 2 cells. Since it has been demonstrated that type 2 cells express high levels of TGF 1 which is a profibrotic cytokine in IPF either scenario would inhibit the proper re epithelialization of these injured areas causing more fibrosis. Kapanci Y. et al. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 152 2163 2169 1995 Khalil N. et al. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 5 155 162 1991. This process could go unchecked and eventually lead to massive changes in tissue architecture eventual tissue destruction and loss of lung function.

Connective tissue growth factor CTGF is a 36 to 38 kD cysteine rich peptide containing 349 amino acids. It belongs to the CCN CTGF cyr 61 cef 10 nov family of growth factors. The gene for CTGF was originally cloned from a human umbilical endothelial cell cDNA library. CTGF has been detected in endothelial cells fibroblasts cartilaginous cells smooth muscle cells and some cancer cell lines. Earlier studies revealed that TGF 1 increases CTGF mRNA markedly in human foreskin fibroblasts. PDGF EGF and FGF were also shown to induce CTGF expression but their effects were only transient and weak.

Connective tissue growth factor has diverse bioactivities. Depending on cell types CTGF was shown to trigger mitogenesis chemotaxis ECM production apoptosis and angiogenesis. In earlier studies CTGF was noted to have mitogenic and chemotactic effects on fibroblasts. CTGF was also reported to enhance the mRNA expression of a1 I collagen fibronectin and as integrin in fibroblasts. The finding that TGF increases CTGF synthesis and that TGF and CTGF share many functions is consistent with the hypothesis that CTGF is a downstream mediator of TGF .

The mechanism by which CTGF exerts its effects on cells especially its signal transduction is still unclear. CTGF was reported to bind to the surface of fibroblasts with high affinity and this binding was competed with recombinant PDGF BB. This suggests that CTGF binds to a certain class of PDGF receptors or that there is some cross reactivity of PDGF BB with CTGF receptors.

Connective tissue growth factor mRNA has been detected in fibroblasts of sclerotic lesions of patients with systemic sclerosis. In patients with localized scleroderma CTGF mRNA was detected in fibroblasts in tissues from sclerotic stage more than the inflammatory stage which suggests a close correlation between CTGF and fibrosis. Similar results were also obtained in keloid and other fibrotic diseases. Subsequently expression of CTGF has been reported in a variety of fibrosis such as liver fibrosis pulmonary fibrosis and heart fibrosis.

CTGF is also implicated in dermal fibrosis of scleroderma. However the detailed role of CTGF in fibrosis is still unclear. Further studies are needed to clarify this point.

The CCN family comprises cysteine rich 61 CYR61 CCN1 connective tissue growth factor CTGF CCN2 nephroblastoma overexpressed NOV CCN3 and Wnt induced secreted proteins 1 WISP 1 CCN4 2 WISP 2 CCN5 and 3 WISP 3 CCN6 . These proteins stimulate mitosis adhesion apoptosis extracellular matrix production growth arrest and migration of multiple cell types. Many of these activities probably occur through the ability of CCN proteins to bind and activate cell surface integrins.

Connective tissue growth factor CTGF has been identified as a potential target of Wnt and BMP signaling. It has been confirmed by microarray results and demonstrated that CTGF was up regulated at the early stage of B MP 9 and Wnt3A stimulations and that Wnt3A regulated CTGF expression was catenin dependent.
