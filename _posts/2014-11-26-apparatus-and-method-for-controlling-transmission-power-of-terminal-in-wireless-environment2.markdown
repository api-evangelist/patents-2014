This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2013 0147399 filed on Nov. 29 2013 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to a technology for controlling transmission power of a terminal in a wireless network.

Upon designing an enterprise wireless network considering a packet voice service VoIP and a streaming service a service range of an access point AP tends to be designed to be smaller than that of a public hotspot area. Accordingly in such an environment a mobile terminal may perform data communication with a base station even using relatively low transmission power compared to in a public hotspot area. However a default data transmission power value level of commercially available mobile terminals is fixed to a sufficiently high value. Accordingly in such a wireless network environment transmission power control TPC for reducing unnecessary power consumption and also minimizing an influence on another wireless communication is essentially required at a terminal side.

However an existing transmission power control scheme has the following problems. First since a radio wave environment changes quickly and variously in an indoor environment it is difficult for a terminal or an access point controller to accurately measure a radio wave environment for transmission power control in real time. Second in order to control transmission power at a terminal side additional power consumption occurs due to measurement of a radio wave environment such as data reception sensitivity and periodic data communication with an access point controller. The additional power consumption cost often exceeds a power consumption gain by performing real time transmission power control.

A back end server group performs authentication and transmission power setting on the m types of mobile terminals to each of which is connected to any one of the n wireless networks to . The back end server group may include an authentication server a management server and a database server .

The authentication server performs authentication on the terminal that is connected through the wireless network . For example the authentication server may receive an authentication request including an ID and a password from the terminal and authenticate the terminal in response to the received authentication request. In addition the authentication server may provide the authenticated terminal with an optimal transmission power value of the terminal . For example the terminal may transmit the authentication request including identification information for identifying a type thereof to the authentication server . The authentication server may provide the identification information to the management server and acquire the optimal transmission power value of the terminal from the management server .

The management server calculates a terminal type based optimal transmission power value with respect to each of the wireless networks connected to the back end server group and stores the calculated optimal transmission power value in the database server . In addition upon request from the authentication server the management server provides an optimal transmission power value corresponding to a terminal associated with the request using one of identification information of the terminal information on a wireless network to which the terminal is currently connected and frequency band information.

The database server is a server for storing and managing an optimal transmission power value for each wireless network or terminal that is measured by the management server .

Next the wireless network is positioned between the mobile terminal and the back end server group and configured to provide a communication service to the mobile terminal . Each wireless network may include one or more access points and one or more access point controllers that control the one or more access points .

Each wireless network is designed in consideration of factors of a service the number of users and a physical radio wave environment of an installation place indoor outdoor etc. Accordingly although wireless networks are connected to the same back end server group the wireless networks may have different internal wireless data communication environments.

The mobile terminal hereinafter referred to as simply MT or terminal is a terminal that accesses any one of the above described n wireless networks and receives a communication service. As described above in an embodiment of the present disclosure there are m different types of terminals . For example the types of the terminals may be distinguished according to a terminal manufacturer and a model. In addition although terminals of the same model are manufactured by the same terminal manufacturer the terminals may be distinguished as different terminals when internally used mobile chipsets or their associated software applications are different. The mobile terminal may include a wireless network access agent application program for authenticating a terminal through communication with the back end server group and setting a received optimal transmission power value to the terminal. In addition this application program may control the transmission power value of the mobile chipset through an application programming interface API that is provided in an operating system OS layer platform of the mobile terminal .

The m types of terminals that are connected to the wireless networks have respective default transmission power values that are set when the terminals are released from the factory. Hereinafter a product model of an i th terminal of the m types of mobile terminals is represented as MT i 1 i m and a default transmission power value of MT i is represented as MT i DFT TP. Although a terminal is released by the same manufacturer MT i DFT TP has a different value according to a product model or a wireless modem chipset fabrication model equipped in the terminal.

The back end server group measures an optimal transmission power value of MT i that will receive a data service in a wireless frequency band b 1

Subsequently when the terminal accesses any one of the plurality of wireless networks the back end server group may provide the terminal with a wireless network to be accessed by the terminal a wireless frequency band and an optimal transmission power value corresponding to a terminal type thus allowing the terminal to set the wireless network the wireless frequency band the optimal transmission power value.

Specifically MT i having the transmission power value initially set as MT i DFT TP approaches the wireless network to request authentication by a wireless network access agent information on MT i that is an authentication parameter is transmitted to the authentication server via the access point AP and the access point controller . The authentication server included in the back end server group finds identification information of MT i and identification information of a wireless network included in the authentication request. The identification information may be for example manufacturer model information of MT i that requests an access to the wireless network 1 WN 1.

If authentication of MT i succeeds in the authentication server the authentication server receives an optimal transmission power value MT i WN 1 OTP TP b corresponding to MT i of the wireless network 1 from the management server and transmits the optimal transmission power value to MT i. Then a wireless network access agent installed in MT i stores MT i DFT TP as a default transmission power value thereof and sets MT i WN 1 OPT TP b as a new transmission power value thereof to perform data communication in the wireless network . In this case wireless frequency access band information b may be determined by the authentication server using an authentication policy according to information on MT i.

Subsequently when MT i recedes from the wireless network MT i resets a transmission power value thereof as MT i DFT TP that is a default value. When MT i accesses a wireless network MT i sets MT i WN 2 OPT TP b as a new transmission power value thereof in the same method as described above.

The optimal transmission power calculation unit calculates a type based optimal transmission power value of a terminal that is accessible to a wireless network connected with the back end server group . Specifically the optimal transmission power calculation unit calculates an optimal transmission power value for each of the one or more access points included in each wireless network and calculates an optimal transmission power value of each wireless network from the calculated optimal transmission power value for each access point.

Furthermore in order to calculate the optimal transmission power value for each access point first the optimal transmission power calculation unit measures a service area of the access point using a forward transmission quality TX QoS between the access point and the terminal and calculates a minimum transmission power value at which the test terminal enables communication in the service area using a reverse transmission quality RX QoS between the terminal and the access point .

When an access of the terminal to any one of connected wireless networks is sensed the transmission power setting unit provides the accessed terminal with optimal transmission power values corresponding to the accessing terminal and the wireless network accessed by the terminal or corresponding to all frequency bands supported by the terminal.

As shown in a distance between a point pwhere a virtual line drawn vertically from any access point AP to the ground intersects with the ground and the AP is defined as a shortest distance Xbetween MT i and the access point AP. In this case the access point AP may be installed on a ceiling a wall a pillar and the like inside a building according to characteristics of an area where the wireless network is installed.

The optimal transmission power calculation unit measures a forward transmission quality TX QoS quality of data transmitted from AP to MT i measured by MT i and then transmitted to AP and a backward transmission quality RX QoS quality of data transmitted from MT i to AP measured by AP while moving MT i in a direction of any vector vthat is perpendicular to a straight line AP to p at the point p. In this case TX QoS and RX QoS are all data quality parameters that can be measured by MT i and may include one or more of a bit error rate BER a packet error rate PER a signal to noise plus interference ratio SNIR and a received signal strength indicator RSSI . Parameters constituting the above described TX QoS and RX QoS decrease SNIR RSSI etc. or increase BER PER etc. as the terminal becomes farther away from the access point . When the parameters increase above or decrease below a specific reference value forward communication or reverse communication is physically impossible. As such thresholds of TX QoS and RX QoS which enable the forward communication or reverse communication are defined as a forward transmission quality threshold TX QoS THOLD and a reverse transmission quality threshold RX QoS THOLD. That is if a measured TX QoS or RX QoS is within TX QoS THOLD or RX QoS THOLD the forward communication or reverse communication becomes possible and otherwise the forward communication or reverse communication becomes impossible. As described above the parameters may be divided into two types some increase and the others decrease according to a distance from the access point . An expression within the threshold has various meanings depending on which type is used as an index of TX QoS and RX QoS. For example when BER is used as the index of TX QoS and RX QoS BER being within a threshold or BER satisfying a threshold means that measured BER is lower or smaller than threshold BER. On the contrary when SNIR is used as the index of TX QoS and RX QoS SNIR being within a threshold or SNIR satisfying a threshold means that measured SNIR is higher or larger than threshold SNIR. This is the same with TX QoS SLA and RX QoS SLA to be described below.

The optimal transmission power calculation unit may set a service level agreement SLA to be higher SNIR RSSI etc. or lower BER PER etc. than a threshold according to an attribute of a data service that is intended to be serviced in a corresponding wireless network. The service level agreement SLA is defined as a forward transmission quality service level value TX QoS SLA and a reverse transmission quality service level value RX QoS SLA. That is the optimal transmission power calculation unit may define q 0 in order to set TX QoS SLA and RX QoS SLA as more conservative values than the thresholds TX QoS THOLD and RX QoS THOLD. In this case relations among TX QoS SLA RX QoS SLA TX QoS THOLD and RX QoS THOLD are as follows.

In operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets a position of MT i as a position p.

In operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets a counter a as 1. The counter a is used to perform measurement at a critical communication point repeatedly multiple times in a corresponding direction. That is since a deviation may occur due to changes in surrounding wireless environment even when forward transmission quality is measured while MT i moves in the same direction from p the optimal transmission power calculation unit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure repeatedly measures the forward transmission quality while repeatedly moving MT i.

In operations to the optimal transmission power calculation unit measures TX QoS at every position P0 v moving MT i by d in a direction from the point palong the vector v and determines whether the measured TX QoS is within the TX QoS SLA that is a reference value . When the determination result of operation is that the measured TX QoS is within the TX QoS SLA being a reference value the optimal transmission power calculation unit further moves MT i by d in a direction of the vector v and then repeats operations and . However on the contrary if the determination result of operation is that the measured TX QoS is outside the TX QoS SLA that is a reference value the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets a position moved from a current position of MT i by d in a direction of pas a critical communication point din a direction of v .

When the critical communication point is set the optimal transmission power calculation unit moves MT i by a certain distance for example h times of d h 1 in a direction of p back off and then repeats operations to 1 times . In this case h and f may be determined appropriately in consideration of characteristics of an AP and a terminal.

As such when f critical communication points dto dare calculated in a direction of v in operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit calculates a critical communication point din a direction of vusing the f critical communication points as follows. 

where Fis a symbol that denotes a mathematical operation for calculating dfrom the f critical communication points and includes one or more of a minimum value a maximum value a median value an arithmetic mean value a geometric mean value and a harmonic mean value calculated from input values d . . . d.

The optimal transmission power calculation unit repeats the above described process with respect to preset z vectors vto vto calculate critical communication points dto dfor the respective vectors. In this case the number z of vectors may be set appropriately in consideration of a physical environment of a position in which an AP is installed. Subsequently a closed curve is formed by connecting the critical communication points dto d thus finding a service area of a corresponding access point an area outlined in a thick solid line .

In operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets transmission power TP dof a wireless network access agent installed in MT i at the point das a minimum transmission power value MT i MIN TP that is supported by a mobile chipset of MT i.

In operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets a counter a as 1. The counter a is used to measure a minimum transmission power value at the same point repeatedly multiple times like in .

In operations and the optimal transmission power calculation unit measures RX QoS between MT i and AP with respect to set transmission power and compares the measured RX QoS with the set RX QoS SLA .

If the determination result of operation is that the measured RX QoS does not satisfy the RX QoS SLA that is a reference value the optimal transmission power calculation unit additionally increases the current transmission power TP dof MT i by tp and determines whether the increased transmission power exceeds a maximum transmission power value MT i MAX TP that is supported by the mobile chipset of MT i . If the determination result of operation is that the increased transmission power exceeds MT i MAX TP RX QoS still does not satisfy the RX QoS SLA although the transmission power of MT i is increased maximally. Accordingly the optimal transmission power calculation unit completes the process changes at least one of transmission powers of AP and TX QoS SLA and then performs the optimal transmission power calculation process again according to the changed parameter. However on the other hand when the result of operation is that the increased transmission power does not exceed MT i MAX TP the optimal transmission power calculation unit performs operations and again using the increased transmission power.

When the determination result of operation is that the measured RX QoS is within a reference value the optimal transmission power calculation unit sets transmission power at that time as a critical communication transmission power value tpof MT i at d .

When the critical communication transmission power value is calculated the optimal transmission power calculation unit decreases the transmission power of the terminal MT i by a certain level for example q times of tp q 1 and then repeats operations to 1 times . In this case q and g may be set appropriately in consideration of characteristics of an AP and a terminal. That is the critical communication transmission power value tpat dis repeatedly measured a preset number g g 1 times and the optimal transmission power calculation unit finally determines the critical communication transmission power value MT i dOPT TP at dthrough a mathematic operation of the repeatedly measured values . In this case the mathematical operation Ftp may be one of a minimum value a maximum value a median value an arithmetic mean value a geometric mean value and a harmonic mean value of the measured g critical transmission power values tpto tp.

The optimal transmission power calculation unit repeatedly performs process at z critical communication points dto dthat are calculated by performing process to calculate z critical communication transmission power values MT i dOPT TP to MT i dOPT TP and calculates an optimal transmission power value MT i CELL s OPT TP of MT i with respect to a service area CELL s of any AP through a mathematic operation of the calculated critical transmission power values as follows MT i CELL s OPT TP F MT i dOPT TP . . . MT i dOPT TP .

In this case the mathematical operation Fmay be one of a minimum value a maximum value a median value an arithmetic mean value a geometric mean value and a harmonic mean value of z critical transmission power values MT i dOPT TP to MT i dOPT TP.

Radio wave characteristics may vary depending on a wireless frequency band a 2 GHz band a 5 GHz band and so on being serviced despite the same AP. Accordingly when the AP and the terminal MT i support multiple wireless frequency bands the optimal transmission power calculation unit calculates an optimal transmission power value of a terminal for each service frequency band by repeatedly performing processes and on each of the plurality of service wireless frequency bands.

As shown in a wireless network k includes c cells. Accordingly when optimal transmission power values of m types of terminals are calculated with respect to b wireless frequency bands that can be serviced for each cell m c b reverse optimal transmission power values may be found from any wireless network area including c cells.

In addition since communication should be done using a single transmission power value in all cells included in a wireless network over any wireless frequency band e 1

The system layer has functional blocks such as a wireless communication unit a file system and the like that cannot be directly accessed by a user. The application program layer has application programs such as a wireless network access agent that may directly interface with the user. The application interface layer has a set of application programming interfaces APIs through which the application programs in the application program layer may control the functional blocks of the system layer .

A system module of the system layer is a module for controlling overall functions associated with the driving of the mobile terminal .

The wireless communication unit performs data communication with an access point adjacent to the mobile terminal . The wireless communication unit may include hardware and software elements such as an antenna a communication chipset and a driving driver for wireless data communication with the access point .

The file system is a storage space for reading or writing data needed while application programs such as the wireless network access agent are driven.

The wireless network access agent is one application program installed in the mobile terminal and includes an authentication control unit and a transmission power control unit . In the application program layer a separate application program may be executed according to a function of the mobile terminal in addition to the wireless network access agent .

When the mobile terminal first accesses the wireless network the authentication control unit transmits and receives an authentication request and an authentication result through the wireless communication unit . In addition the authentication control unit sets various types of parameters and provides an interface for wireless network communication using authentication information of the mobile terminal and wireless network access authentication information input from a user.

The transmission power control unit acquires an optimal transmission power value received separately from or together with the authentication response. The number of optimal transmission power values downloaded from the management server may be one or more according to information on a radio frequency band RF Band provided by the mobile terminal . When the optimal transmission power value is acquired the transmission power control unit performs the following.

1 A default transmission power value MT i DFT TP that is currently applied to the mobile terminal is obtained from the wireless communication unit . In this case acquisition of the default transmission power value MT i DFT TP from the wireless communication unit may be made through the application interface layer and may use the following function call including an API 

That is when the transmission power control unit calls a function Get Tx Power using a parameter such as the radio frequency band RF Band the wireless communication unit returns only a transmission power value set in a corresponding radio frequency band as a return value of the function. Alternatively when the transmission power control unit calls the function Get Tx Power without a parameter for radio frequency band RF Band information the wireless communication unit may return the transmission power values for the overall radio frequency band RF Band which are provided by a communication chipset. If the acquisition of the transmission power value fails the function Get Tx Power returns fail information. If the acquisition succeeds the transmission power value may be a number that is represented in decimal or hexadecimal form.

2 The transmission power control unit stores the acquired default transmission power value MT i DFT TP in the file system .

3 The transmission power control unit sets a downloaded optimal transmission power value to the wireless communication unit . In this case setting of optimal transmission power value to the wireless communication unit may be made through the application interface layer and may use the following function call including an API 

That is a radio frequency band RF Band and a value intended to be set in the band that is an optimal transmission power value are delivered as parameters. As a result the function Set Tx Power may return setting success and setting failure information.

4 When the mobile terminal gets out of the wireless network the transmission power control unit senses that the mobile terminal recedes from the wireless network reads a default transmission power value MT i DFT TP stored through the file system and sets the transmission power value to an original state using the above described function Set Tx Power.

A process of the mobile terminal with the above described configuration accessing the wireless network and setting an optimal transmission power appropriate for the accessed wireless network will be described in divided embodiments. Embodiment 1 shows an example in which a terminal i approaches a wireless network k and requests authentication. Embodiment 2 shows an example in which the terminal i recedes and disconnects from the wireless network k . Embodiment 3 shows an example in which the terminal i approaches another wireless network 1 1 k .

When the terminal i approaches the wireless network k a wireless communication unit of the terminal i recognizes the wireless network k from a broadcasting packet or the like that is received from the wireless network k . Then the authentication control unit transmits an authentication request to an authentication server of a back end server group using user authentication information and terminal information that are set by a user.

The authentication server performs user authentication according to the authentication request and acquires the optimal transmission power value of the terminal i with respect to the wireless network k from the management server when the authentication succeeds. Specifically the authentication server provides information on the wireless network k accessed by the terminal i information e on an accessed frequency band and identification information a manufacture a model number and the like of the terminal i . The management server provides an optimal transmission power value MT i WN k OTP TP e of the terminal i corresponding to the received information to the authentication server . Then the authentication server transmits the acquired optimal transmission power value to the terminal i together with an authentication response or through a message separate from the authentication response.

However on the other hand when the authentication of the terminal i fails in the authentication server the authentication server does not inquire of the management server about the optimal transmission power value and transmits only an authentication failure response.

Upon receiving the authentication response the wireless network access agent may inform authentication success to a user through a popup message. However depending on embodiments the wireless network access agent may proceed with a next process without a separate popup message. In addition the transmission power control unit acquires a default transmission power value MT i DFT TP through the wireless communication unit and stores the acquired default transmission power value MT i DFT TP in the file system . The transmission power control unit sets in the wireless communication unit the optimal transmission power value received together with the authentication response or through a message separate from the authentication response to allow data to be transmitted at that power value.

When the terminal i recedes from the wireless network to which the terminal is connected a transmission power control unit of the wireless network access agent senses the disconnection from the wireless network k and operates a timer time recovery. If the terminal i does not access the wireless network k by the time the timer expires the transmission power control unit considers the terminal i to have completely receded from the wireless network k and reads a default transmission power value MT i DFT TP from the file system to deliver the default transmission power value MT i DFT TP to the wireless communication unit . In this case a setting time of the timer may be set appropriately according to characteristics of a terminal and a network and operating policies.

The wireless communication unit sets the default transmission power value received through the transmission power control unit to allow data to be transmitted at the power value.

When the terminal i enters the wireless network 1 the terminal i performs authentication using the same method as in embodiment 1.

Change in transmission power according to a distance of the terminal to which the method has not been applied is shown as a dotted line in . This may be expressed as the following equation y MT i DFT TP where MT i DEF TP is a default power value of the terminal .

Next change in transmission power according to a distance of the terminal to which the transmission power control method according to embodiments of the present disclosure has been applied is shown as a solid line of . As shown in according to embodiments of the present disclosure the terminal receives from a currently accessed network an optimal transmission power value MT i WN k OTP TP that may be used in the network and sets the optimal transmission power value as transmission power thereof. As described above since this value is generally lower than the default transmission power value of the terminal according to the present disclosure power consumption can be reduced by a difference between the default transmission power value and the received optimal transmission power value.

As shown in since an optimal transmission power value of a terminal is set in consideration of RX QoS of the terminal according to embodiments of the present disclosure it can be seen that RSSI in the network is maintained below a reverse transmission quality service level value RX QoS SLA.

As described above in an embodiment of the present disclosure a transmission power value that is used by the terminal i may use an optimal transmission power value MT i WN k OTP TP that is lower than the default transmission power value MT i DEF TP thus minimizing interference in the same channel that is being used in neighbor cells. This increases the probability that the same channel that is operating in the neighbor cells will be sensed to be in an idle state thus increasing the probability that the wireless terminals in the area can perform data communication at the same time resulting in increasing of the service capacity of the entire wireless network.

In operation the optimal transmission power calculation unit calculates an optimal transmission power value for each type of a terminal accessible to each of one or more wireless networks. Particularly operation may be repeatedly performed periodically when an environment of a wireless network changes or a new wireless terminal is released according to operating policies of a wireless network service provider operator.

In operation the transmission power setting unit senses an access of a terminal to any one of the one or more networks.

In operation the transmission power setting unit provides the accessing terminal with an optimal transmission power value corresponding to the accessing terminal and the wireless network accessed by the terminal.

In operation the transmission power control unit of the mobile terminal sets the optimal transmission power value downloaded from the transmission power setting unit in the wireless communication unit of the mobile terminal .

According to embodiments of the present disclosure it is possible to effectively reduce power consumption of a terminal during data communication in an access network by controlling transmission power of the terminal to an optimal state according to a type of the terminal and a type of a wireless network accessed by the terminal.

In addition according to embodiments of the present disclosure it is possible to minimize additional power consumption for controlling transmission power at a terminal side since separate continuous communication such as open loop power control or closed loop power control with an access point or separate operations do not need to be performed unlike an existing scheme to control transmission power appropriate for a network currently connected to a terminal side by previously calculating and storing an optimal transmission power value for each wireless network and each type of the terminal and providing a first one time download of the optimal transmission power value if a first authentication of the wireless network succeeds in the terminal.

Furthermore since the optimal transmission power value set in the terminal is usually set to be lower than a factory vale it is possible to minimize interference in service areas of APs adjacent to a specific AP upon performing data communication with the specific AP thus increasing a service capacity in an entire wireless network.
