The invention relates to treatment of conditions of the paranasal sinuses including with respect to paranasal sinus access implant devices surgical tools methods and kits.

In the United States alone 35 million people a year are treated for sinus infections or sinusitis and 7 million of those will suffer from chronic sinusitis and will have minimal response to prescription drug therapies. Conventional surgical interventions may be expected to at best offer only moderate symptomatic improvement but no cure.

Conventional drug therapies include oral administration as pills and nasal topical administration neither of which is conducive to delivering adequate concentration of medication to the involved paranasal sinus. In addition to medication frequent sinus irrigation can be helpful in flushing out debris irritants and obstructing viscous fluids but patients are generally not able to adequately perform this procedure at home.

For patients with particularly severe symptoms surgical drainage has been an option of last resort. An early surgical procedure was the Caldwell Luc procedure which involves creating a permanent fistula from the base of the paranasal sinus into the oral cavity above the front upper incisors. More recently other surgical access points to the paranasal sinuses have been attempted. A variety of endoscopic techniques have been developed that access the paranasal sinuses through the nose including functional endoscopic sinus surgery FESS and balloon sinuplasty. All attempt to increase drainage but utilize different routes or tools. Surgical formation of a fistula between the lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus has been identified as a technique to provide direct access to the paranasal sinus and through which a variety of medical treatments and medical procedures may be directed to the paranasal sinus. None of these surgical approaches has yet achieved wide spread acceptance or success and millions of chronic sinusitis patients continue to suffer long term disability and discomfort.

Paranasal sinus access implant devices may be configured to be implanted in a human to provide fluid access to a paranasal sinus through an internal passage of such a paranasal sinus access implant device. Such paranasal sinus access implant devices have significant potential for performance of medical procedures and treatments of paranasal sinuses but such potential has not yet been realized and there is a continued need for implant devices and accompanying procedures that facilitate easy and effective implantation with good anchoring of the implant device patient comfort implant device durability post implantation and effective performance of medical procedures. Various aspects of this disclosure relate to paranasal sinus access implant devices tools and methods for implantation procedures and treatments through implanted implant devices and kits including paranasal sinus access implant devices. For brevity paranasal sinus access implant devices are sometimes referred to herein as simply implant devices.

A first aspect of the disclosure involves an implant device useful for implantation in a human to fluidly connect a lacrimal apparatus to a paranasal sinus through a fistula formed between the lacrimal apparatus and the paranasal sinus.

It has been found that implant devices may be better retained following implantation if the implant devices include anchoring surface features including protrusion areas and recess areas along a conduit that is to be inserted into the fistula for implantation. Anchoring is enhanced when a maximum outside diameter defined by protrusion areas to be disposed in the fistula is larger than the diameter of the fistula that was formed to accept the conduit of the implant device. This creates a snug fit of the conduit in the fistula with tissue forcing itself into the recess areas of the anchoring surface feature. However such implantation conduits made of relatively flexible plastic materials may bunch up such as in the manner of an accordion making it difficult to insert the conduit into the fistula for implantation. It has been found that by including a thicker conduit wall in a proximal portion of the conduit of an implant device than is included in a distal portion that is inserted first into the fistula that the ease of insertion of the conduit may be significantly improved. In addition a thicker conduit wall in a proximal portion of the conduit provides added mechanical durability of the conduit adjacent the proximal end of the implant device and reducing potential for mechanical damage to proximal portions of the conduit due to mechanical interactions that may occur between the implant device and tools used during an implantation procedure or during performance of medical treatments and other procedures following implantation.

The second maximum exterior width may be no greater than 5 millimeters no greater than 4 millimeters no greater than 3 millimeters no greater than 2.75 millimeters no greater than 2.5 millimeters or no greater than 2.25 millimeters.

The first longitudinal portion of the conduit may have a minimum exterior width first minimum exterior width and the second longitudinal portion of the conduit may have a minimum exterior width second minimum exterior width that is smaller than the first maximum exterior width. The first minimum exterior width may be at least 0.1 millimeter larger at least 0.2 millimeter larger at least 0.25 millimeter larger at least 0.3 millimeter larger at least 0.35 millimeter larger at least 0.4 millimeter larger or at least 0.5 millimeter larger than the second minimum exterior width.

The first minimum exterior width may be at least 1 millimeter at least 1.25 millimeters at least 1.5 millimeters at least 1.75 millimeters or at least 2 millimeters. The first longitudinal portion of the conduit may have a substantially constant cross section e.g. constant circular cross section in which case the maximum and minimum exterior widths of the first longitudinal portion of the conduit are the same e.g. diameter of constant circular cross section . The second minimum exterior width may be no greater than 2.5 millimeters no greater than 2 millimeters no greater than 1.75 millimeters or no greater than 1.5 millimeters. The second minimum exterior width may often be at least 1 millimeter at least 1.25 millimeter at least 1.50 millimeters or at least 1.75 millimeters. The second longitudinal portion may have a surface geometry wherein the second minimum exterior width may be smaller than a second maximum exterior width of the second longitudinal portion. The second minimum exterior width may correspond with locations of the second minimum wall thickness.

The conduit may have a circular cross section at some or all points along the length of the first and second longitudinal portions of the conduit. The first minimum wall thickness and the second minimum wall thickness may be tubular walls.

The conduit may be configured so that an exterior of the conduit comprises an anchoring surface feature that assists to anchor the implant device when the device is implanted. The anchoring surface feature includes protrusion areas and recess areas. The second minimum wall thickness may occur at a location corresponding with at least one of the recess areas. The implant device may be configured so that when implanted the conduit is disposed through the fistula with at least a portion of the recess areas disposed within the fistula and with at least a portion of the protrusion areas disposed in the fistula and engaging tissue exposed within the fistula to anchor the implant device. The structural and mechanical characteristics of protrusion occurrences in the protrusion areas may affect anchoring performance of the protrusion areas. The height of the protrusion areas relative to the recess areas may affect anchoring effectiveness when the implant device is implanted. A larger height may provide greater anchor effectiveness but also may involve a larger overall width of the implant device that must be inserted into the fistula. The protrusion areas may have a height relative to the recess areas of at least 0.1 millimeter at least 0.2 millimeter at least 0.25 millimeter or at least 0.3 millimeter. The protrusions areas may have a height relative to the recess areas of no greater than 2 millimeters no greater than 1.5 millimeter no greater than 1 millimeter no greater than 0.75 millimeter no greater than 0.5 millimeter or no greater than 0.4 millimeter. The height may be of particular protrusion occurrences relative to adjacent areas of recesses. Protrusion occurrences are also referred to herein as anchor protrusions. Such anchor protrusions may be configured to flexibly deform when the conduit is inserted through the fistula for implantation for example to flexibly deform in a direction opposite the direction of insertion when the anchor protrusions contact tissue disposed in the fistula during insertion. After insertion the anchor protrusions may over time return to their original shape and extend deeper into adjacent tissue to better anchor the implant device. The mechanical properties of the anchor protrusions may be influenced by materials of construction. Preferred materials of construction for the protrusion areas and also for the other portions of the implant device are polymeric materials. The polymeric materials may preferably be medical grade materials. Some preferred polymeric materials are silicones and polyurethanes. For enhanced performance the material of construction should have a rigidity that interacts positively with tissue in the vicinity of the fistula for example to promote load sharing and good anchoring. One preferred material of construction is a polymeric material e.g. silicone or polyurethane having a durometer Shore A in a range having a lower limit of 50 60 70 or 80 and an upper limit of 100 80 70 or 60 provided that the upper limit must be larger than the lower limit. One preferred range is for a durometer Shore A of 60 100 with a range of 80 100 being even more preferred. For some implementations the polymeric material has a durometer Shore A of about 60 of about 80 or of about 100. Mechanical properties of the protrusion occurrences of the protrusion areas will also be affected by the geometry of the protrusion occurrences. The protrusion occurrences may have a width that tapers or narrows in a direction from a base toward a top of the protrusion occurrences with the base being a portion of a protrusion occurrence disposed toward the internal passage of the conduit and a top of the protrusion occurrence being the extremity of the protrusion occurrence away from the internal passage of the conduit. The width may be transverse to the length of the conduit. The protrusion occurrences may have a width at the base that is no larger than 2 millimeters no larger than 1.5 millimeters no larger than 1.25 millimeters or no larger than 1 millimeter. One or more of the protrusion occurrences may have a width at the base that is at least 0.2 millimeter at least 0.3 millimeter at least 0.5 millimeter at least 0.75 millimeter or at least 1 millimeter. The protrusion occurrences may have a width adjacent the top that is no larger than 0.75 times width at the base no larger than 0.5 times the width at the base or no larger than 0.25 times the width at the base. The protrusion occurrences may have a width midway between the base and the top that is no larger than 0.8 times the width of the base no larger than 0.7 times the width of the base no larger than 0.6 times the width of the base or no larger than 0.5 times the width at the base.

The protrusion areas may be provided by a single protrusion occurrence feature located to correspond with the interior of the fistula when the implant device is implanted. In more preferred implementations the protrusion areas include multiple protrusion occurrences spaced on the exterior of the conduit. The protrusion occurrences may have a center to center spacing in one or more directions of at least 0.5 millimeter at least 0.75 millimeter at least 1 millimeter or at least 1.75 millimeters. The protrusion occurrences may have a center to center spacing of no greater than 2.5 millimeters no greater than 2 millimeters or no greater than 1.75 millimeters. The protrusion occurrences may have a center to center spacing longitudinally along the conduit. The protrusion occurrences may have a center to center spacing that is at least 0.5 times the base width of the protrusion occurrences or at least 1 times the base width of the protrusion occurrences or at least 2 times the base width of the protrusion occurrences. The protrusion occurrences may have a center to center spacing that is no more than 5 times a base width of the protrusion occurrences no more than 3 times a base width of the protrusion occurrences or no more than 2 times a base width of the protrusion occurrences.

The protrusion areas may be located on a longitudinal portion of the conduit that includes at least a portion of the conduit that will be disposed within a fistula when the implant device is implanted. The protrusion areas may be on a longitudinal portion of the conduit that extends for at least 2 millimeters along the length of the implant device that extends for at least 3 millimeters along the length of the implant device that extends for at least 4 millimeters along the length of the implant device that extends for at least 5 millimeters along the length of the implant device or that extends for at least 8 millimeters along the length of the implant device. A longitudinal portion of the conduit including the protrusion areas may be no longer than 20 millimeters no longer than 15 millimeters or no longer than 10 millimeters. A longitudinal portion of the conduit including the protrusion areas may be disposed at least 2 millimeters from the proximal end of the device at least 3 millimeters from the proximal end of the device or at least 4 millimeters from the proximal end of the device. When the implant device has a head a longitudinal portion of the conduit including the protrusions may be disposed at least 1 millimeter at least 2 millimeters or at least 3 millimeters from the head. Providing significant distance between the head and commencement of the protrusion areas permits the head to better float on the surface of tissue which may enhance patient comfort and device performance. The protrusion areas may be disposed along a longitudinal portion of the conduit with the protrusion areas covering no more than 35 of the area along that longitudinal portion of the conduit no more than 25 of the area along that longitudinal portion of the conduit or not more than 20 of the area along that longitudinal portion of the conduit. Providing significant spacing between protrusion occurrences may permit better engagement of tissue by the anchoring surface feature. Some or all of the protrusion occurrences may be on the second longitudinal portion of the conduit.

The protrusion areas may comprise at least one circumferential ridge. By circumferential ridge is meant a ridge that extends around an entire circumference of the conduit. The protrusion area may comprise at least two at least three or at least five circumferential ridges. The protrusion areas may comprise a spiral ridge. Such a spiral ridge may extend along a longitudinal portion of the conduit. The protrusion areas may comprise a knob or may comprise multiple knobs. The anchoring surface feature may comprise a textured surface with the protrusion areas comprising protruding portions of the textured surface and the recess areas comprising recess portions of the textured surface.

The length of the implant device may be selected to provide sufficient conduit length for extending through the entire length of the fistula plus any extension distance desired in the lacrimal apparatus proximal to the fistula and in the paranasal sinus distal to the fistula. The length of the implant device and or of the conduit may be in a range having a lower limit of 2 millimeters 3 millimeters 4 millimeters 5 millimeters 8 millimeters 10 millimeters or 12 millimeters and an upper limit of 50 millimeters 40 millimeters 30 millimeters 25 millimeters 20 millimeters 15 millimeters or 10 millimeters provided that the upper limit is larger than the lower limit. One preferred range for some implementations when the fistula is between the orbit and the ethmoid sinus or the maxillary sinus is for the length of the implant device and or for the length of the conduit to be in a range of from 10 millimeters to 30 millimeters with a range of from 15 millimeters to 25 millimeters being more preferred. By length of the implant device or conduit it is meant the dimension longitudinally along the implant device or the conduit as the case may be from the proximal end to the distal end of the implant device or conduit and may be along a longitudinal axis through the internal passage. The length may be a straight line for example when the internal passage is straight or the length may be curvilinear or some other shape for example when the internal passage is not linear. When a reference is made herein to transverse to the length the reference is to a right angle to the longitudinal direction of the length at that point e.g. right angle to a line of the length or to a line tangent to a curve of the length .

The implant device may advantageously be designed with a conduit of appropriate width dimensions to fit snuggly within a desired size of fistula. The implant device may have a first exterior width dimension defined by a maximum extent of the protrusion areas transverse to the length of the device with the first exterior width being within a range having a lower limit of 0.75 millimeter 1 millimeter 1.25 millimeters 1.5 millimeters 1.75 millimeters or 2 millimeters and an upper limit of 8 millimeters 7 millimeters 6 millimeters 5 millimeters 4 millimeters 3 millimeters 2 millimeters or 1.75 millimeters provided of course that the upper limit must be larger than the lower limit. The conduit may have a second width dimension defined by the minimum extent of the recess areas transverse to the length of the device and which second exterior width dimension will be smaller than the first exterior width dimension defined by the protrusion areas. The second exterior width dimension defined by the recess areas may be smaller than the exterior width dimension defined by the protrusion areas by an amount within a range having a lower limit of 0.2 millimeter 0.25 millimeter 0.35 millimeter or 0.5 millimeter and having an upper limit of 1.5 millimeters 1 millimeter or 0.75 millimeter. The height of the protrusion areas may be one half the difference between the first exterior width and the second exterior width. Either one of or each one of the first exterior width and the second exterior width may be the diameter of a circle.

The implant device may include one or a plurality of side openings through the conduit wall of a distal portion of the conduit which distal portion may be or include a portion of the conduit that is designed to be disposed within a paranasal sinus when the implant device is implanted to provide fluid access through the implant device to the paranasal sinus. The side openings may be open into the internal passage through the conduit and may provide a passage for fluid communication between the internal passage of the implant device and the paranasal sinus even if the distal opening of the internal passage at the distal end of the conduit were to become blocked or restricted for some reason. One or more of the side openings may be through a wall of the second longitudinal portion of the conduit and may be though a wall having the second minimum wall thickness. One or more of the side openings may be located within one or more recess areas of an anchoring surface feature of the conduit e.g. between circumferential ridges . With a thinner minimum wall thickness in the second longitudinal portion of the conduit than the first longitudinal portion of the conduit the second longitudinal portion of the conduit and in particular near a distal end of the second longitudinal portion of the conduit may be more prone to restriction due to collapse of the conduit at or near the distal end and the side openings provide an alternative fluid access to the paranasal sinus.

The implant device may include a head adjacent to the conduit at the proximal end of the implant device. The implant device may be configured so that when the implant device is implanted the head is disposed in the lacrimal apparatus and preferably with the head located in the orbit. The head may beneficially keep the implant device from migrating through the fistula toward the paranasal sinus following implantation of the implant device. The head may comprise a flanged tissue engagement surface on a side of the head disposed toward the conduit and configured to engage tissue outside of and adjacent to the fistula when the implant device is implanted. The flanged tissue engagement surface may be a flat surface. The flanged tissue engagement surface may have non flat surface features configured to improve seating of the surface against tissue such as for example to inhibit rotation of the implant device within the fistula after implantation. The head may have a face surface opposite the flanged tissue engagement surface and also disposed away from the conduit and disposed away from tissue engaged by the flanged tissue engagement surface when the implant device is implanted. The face surface may be substantially flat. The face surface may be disposed at the proximal end of the implant device and the internal passage may open at the face surface. The separation distance between the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may be in a range having a lower limit of 0.25 millimeter 0.5 millimeter or 0.75 millimeter and having an upper limit of 2 millimeters 1.5 millimeters or 1 millimeter. Such separation distance need not be constant across the flanged tissue engagement surface and face surface. A maximum separation distance between the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may be referred to as the depth of the head and such depth may be in a range described above for the separation distance between the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface. The flanged tissue engagement surface need not be continuous and may be divided into multiple distinct surface portions. For example the flanged tissue engagement surface may include a first flanged portion disposed to one side of the internal passage and a second flanged surface portion disposed to a second side of the internal passage that is opposite the first side. Each of the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may have a length dimension that represents a maximum separation distance between points on an outer edge of the respective surface and may each have a width dimension that is a maximum separation distance between points on the outer edge transverse to the length dimension. The length dimensions of the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may be the same or may be different. The width dimensions of the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may be the same or may be different. The face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may have corresponding outer edges. The length dimension of any or all of the face surface the flanged tissue engagement surface and the head may be larger than a first exterior width of the conduit defined by an extent of the protrusion areas transverse to the length of the implant device when the implant device includes an anchoring surface feature such as summarized above. The length dimension of any or all of the face surface the tissue engagement surface and the head may be in a range having a lower limit of 1 millimeter 2 millimeters 3 millimeters 4 millimeters or 5 millimeters and an upper limit of 10 millimeters 8 millimeters or 7 millimeters. The width dimension of any or all of the face surface tissue engagement surface and the head may be in a range having a lower limit of 0.5 millimeter 1 millimeter 1.5 millimeters or 2 millimeters and an upper limit of 5 millimeters 4 millimeters or 3 millimeters. The length dimension of any or all of the face surface the flanged tissue engagement surface and the head may be at least 1 millimeter at least 2 millimeters at least 3 millimeters or at least 4 millimeters larger than such first exterior width of the conduit defined by an extent of the protrusion areas when the implant device includes an anchoring surface feature such as summarized above. A ratio of the length of any of or all the face surface the flanged tissue engagement surface and the head to such a first exterior width of the conduit may be at least 2. Such a ratio may be smaller than 4. The width of any or all of the face surface the flanged tissue engagement surface and the head may be not larger than or may be smaller than e.g. by at least 0.1 mm or by at least 0.2 mm such a first exterior width of the conduit defined by an extent of the protrusion areas when the implant device includes an anchoring surface feature such as summarized above. A ratio of the length dimension to the width dimension for any or all of the face surface the flanged tissue engagement surface and the head may be in a range having a lower limit of 1 1.5 2 or 2.5 and an upper limit of 5 4 3 or 2.5 provided of course that the upper limit must be larger than the lower limit. Having a larger length dimension to width dimension on the head is particularly preferred when the head will be located in the orbit between the lacrimal caruncle and the plica semilunaris because the length dimension may advantageously align in a vertical direction next to the eyeball and will help provide sufficient flanged surface area to effectively anchor the implant device on the proximal end and impede conjunctival tissue from covering the opening into the internal passage of the implant device compensating for the narrower width. This is particularly advantageous when using polymeric materials of construction as described above.

The internal passage through the implant device may have a substantially uniform shape along the entire length of the implant device or may have a varying shape. The internal passage may be substantially straight from the proximal end of the device to the distal end of the device. The internal passage may have a cross section available for flow transverse to the length of the device that is substantially uniform from the proximal end to the distal end of the implant device. The internal passage may have a substantially circular cross section. The internal passage may have a substantially elliptical cross section. The width of the conduit maximum dimension across the cross section of the internal passage available for flow may be in a range having a lower limit of 0.25 millimeter 0.5 millimeter or 0.75 millimeter and 1 millimeter and an upper limit of 5 millimeters or 4 millimeters or 3 millimeters 2 millimeters or 1.5 millimeters.

The lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus may be in fluid communication through the internal passage of the implant device when the implant device is implanted. The conduit may extend from adjacent the proximal end of the implant device. The conduit may extend to adjacent the distal end of the implant device. The internal passage may have a first end open at the proximal end and a second end open at the distal end and when the implant device is implanted the first end of the internal passage may open in the lacrimal apparatus and the second end of the internal passage opens in the paranasal sinus

The implant device may be configured for implantation with the conduit passing through a fistula between a location in a lacrimal apparatus within the orbit and a paranasal sinus selected from the group consisting of a frontal sinus an ethmoid sinus a maxillary sinus and a sphenoid sinus with a frontal sinus a maxillary sinus or an ethmoid sinus being preferred with an ethmoid sinus or a maxillary sinus being more preferred and with an ethmoid sinus being particularly preferred. The implant device may be configured for implantation with the conduit passing through a fistula between a location in the lacrimal apparatus within the nasolacrimal duct and a paranasal sinus selected from the group consisting of an ethmoid sinus and a maxillary sinus. The location within the nasolacrimal duct may be within the lacrimal sac.

The implant device is primarily configured for and described herein with primary reference to the implant device being implantable in a fistula that may be formed between the lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus to provide a passage from the lacrimal apparatus to the paranasal sinus. The implant device is also implantable in a fistula that may be formed between the lacrimal apparatus e.g. from the corner of medial portion of the orbit between the lacrimal caruncle and the plica semilunaris and the nasal cavity for example for enhanced drainage of lacrimal fluid and such applications directed to the nasal cavity are within the scope of the different aspects of the disclosure.

A kit may include any or any combination of any apparatuses tools devices products components or treatment compositions described herein.

A kit may include a fluid treatment composition deliverable to a paranasal sinus through the implant device following implantation of the implant device to provide fluid access to the paranasal sinus.

The fluid treatment composition may be disposed within a fluid container as provided in the kit. The fluid container may contain any desired volume of the treatment composition. Such a volume may be in a range having a lower limit of 0.1 0.25 0.5 0.75 or 1 milliliter and an upper limit of 5 3 or 2 milliliters. Such a range may be the total treatment composition contained within the fluid container or may be the volume of treatment composition contained within the fluid container that is deliverable from the fluid container which may be referred to as the deliverable volume. The deliverable volume refers to that volume of fluid in the fluid container that can be effectively delivered from a fluid dispenser. The delivery volume may be less than the total volume of treatment composition contained in the fluid container because of residual treatment composition that may be retained in the fluid container or within the fluid dispenser for example residual treatment composition that may be adhered on internal wall surfaces of e.g. internal wall surfaces of the fluid container for example internal wall surfaces of a syringe barrel or that remain in fluid conduction portions of such a fluid dispenser between the fluid container and a distal fluid ejection tip e.g. remaining fluid in a dispensing needle .

The fluid container that contains the treatment composition may be part of a fluid dispenser. The fluid dispenser may be manipulable to dispense at least a portion of the treatment composition from the fluid container into the internal passage or through the internal passage directly into a paranasal sinus following implantation of the implant device. The fluid container may be provided in the kit by a syringe which may be or be part of such a fluid dispenser. The fluid container may include at least a portion of a syringe barrel. A fluid dispenser may include a fluid ejection member in fluid communication with the treatment composition in the fluid container. Such a fluid ejection member may be insertable in the internal passage of the implant device and the fluid dispenser may be manipulable when the fluid ejection member is inserted in the internal passage of the implant device when the implant device is implanted to eject at least a portion of the treatment composition from a distal end of the fluid ejection member into the internal passage of the implant device or distal of the distal internal passage directly into a paranasal sinus. For example a distal fluid ejection tip of the fluid ejection member may be disposed in the internal passage and the treatment composition may be dispensed into the internal passage to then flow into the paranasal sinus or the fluid ejection member may be inserted through the internal passage until the distal tip is disposed in the paranasal sinus distal of a distal end of the internal passage and the treatment composition may be dispensed directly into the paranasal sinus.

A kit may include multiple different treatment compositions and may include multiple fluid containers e.g. multiple syringes each containing a different treatment composition.

Forming a fistula for implantation of an implant device to provide a fluid passage between the lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus involves making a hole through a wall of the bone in which the cavity of the paranasal sinus is located. As described herein such a hole may be made by a sytlet or other solid piercing instrument and then widened as needed to form the fistula to the desired size for implantation of the implant device. For example following the initial piercing to make an initial hole the hole may be dilated using dilators to make the hole progressively larger until the desired size is obtained. However it has been found that when forming a fistula for implantation in such a manner the bone tends to crack and shatter in the vicinity of hole. Although this does not present a medical problem it has been found that if the bone is kept more in tact in the vicinity of the hole then the bone may provide mechanical support to help secure the implant device in place and prevent the implant device from migrating out of the fistula following implantation. Bone integrity in the vicinity of the fistula may be improved by cutting the hole for the fistula rather than piercing and dilating the hole. By cutting through the bone rather than pushing through the bone the bone remains more in tact in the vicinity of the hole and provides better mechanical support to help retain the implant device in place in the fistula following implantation. The implantation kit of the second aspect may include tools useful for cutting a hole for a fistula and implanting an implant device.

A kit may include at least one cutting tool for cutting away tissue to form a fistula through which the implant device may be implanted during an implant procedure. Such a cutting tool may include a hollow member having a hollow cutting tip at a distal end of the cutting member configured to cut tissue to size the fistula for implantation of the implant device through the fistula. Such a cutting member may have a cutting width that is smaller than a maximum exterior width of a conduit of the implant device configured to be disposed through the fistula during implantation. Such a cutting tool may be a drill.

A kit may include a cutting tool that may be guidable by a guide member disposable through an internal passage of the cutting tool. The cutting tool may include a hollow cutting member that has a hollow cutting tip at a distal end of the cutting member configured to cut tissue to size the fistula for implantation of the implant device through the fistula. The hollow cutting tip of the cutting tool may be configured to make a larger diameter cut to enlarge a smaller diameter preliminary cut that may have been previously made to accommodate the guide member or the cutting tool may be configured to make a desired final cut without prior formation of a smaller initial fistula. The cutting member may be configured to be slidably engaged with the guide member with the guide member disposed through a passage in the cutting member with the distal end of the guide member disposed distal of the distal end of the cutting member. A distal end of the guide member may be configured to be disposed in or distal of the fistula such that the cutting member is slidable over the guide member for example to conduct the cutting tip of the cutting member to cut tissue to size the fistula for implantation of the implant device when a smaller initial fistula has already been formed or to permit retraction of the cutting member while leaving the guide member in place for use to conduct another tool or tools to the location of the fistula for example an implantation tool for inserting an implant device into the fistula in position for implantation following cutting a fistula of a desired size for implantation.

A cutting member of a cutting tool may be or include a hollow needle or a cutting cannula. The cutting member may have a cutting width or diameter in the case of a circular cut that is smaller than a maximum exterior width of the conduit of the implant device. The maximum exterior width of the conduit of the implant device may occur at one or more protrusion areas that form part of an anchoring surface feature on the conduit. The cutting width may be at least 0.1 millimeter smaller at least 0.2 millimeter smaller at least 0.25 millimeter smaller at least 0.3 millimeter smaller at least 0.35 millimeter smaller or at least 0.4 millimeter smaller than the maximum exterior width of the conduit of the implant device. The cutting width may be not more than 1 millimeter 0.75 millimeter 0.6 millimeter or 0.5 millimeter smaller than the maximum exterior width of the conduit. The cutting width may be not larger than 5 millimeters 4 millimeters 3.5 millimeters 3 millimeters 2.5 millimeters 2.25 millimeters 2 millimeters 1.9 millimeters or 1.8 millimeters. The cutting width may be at least 1 millimeter 1.5 millimeter 1.75 millimeter or 1.85 millimeter.

A kit may include an implantation guide tool with a proximal end and a distal end and including a guide member extending longitudinally in a direction from the proximal end toward the distal end of the implantation guide tool. The guide member and internal passage may be configured for mounting the implant device on the guide member with the guide member disposed through the internal passage of the implant device with a distal end of the guide member disposed distal of the distal end of the implant device and the distal end of the guide member may be configured to be disposed in or distal of the fistula such that the implant device mounted on the guide member is slidable on the guide member toward the distal end of the guide member to conduct the implant device into the fistula for implantation. The guide member may be configured for insertion through a passage through a tool e.g. cutting tool or carrier tool to guide the tool to the site of a fistula.

In one example of a guide member the guide member may be a guide wire or a small diameter needle e.g. 20 gauge spinal needle a cutting member may be a larger gauge needle through which the guide member may be inserted e.g. 12 to 14 gauge spinal needle and an implant device may have an internal passage through which the guide member may be inserted e.g. 1 mm .

The guide member may be any appropriately sized member on which the implant device or a tool to be guided by the guide member may be slidably conducted along the guide member for implantation. The guide member may be a rigid flexible or malleable material. The guide member may be a solid member for example a solid guide wire or a stylet. The guide member may be a hollow member for example the guide member may be or include a needle or cannula. The guide member may include a cutting end at the distal end configured to cut tissue to form at least a portion of the fistula. Such a hollow guide member with a cutting end may be a needle or cutting cannula. Such a hollow guide member with a cutting end may be useful to cut an initial hole that may then be made larger to a desired size for implantation of the implant device.

A kit may include a carrier tool also referred to as an implantation tool for carrying the implant device during an implantation procedure. Such a carrier tool may include a carrier member with a distal tip with the carrier member being adapted to be disposed through a fistula between the lacrimal apparatus in the orbit and a paranasal cavity with the distal tip located in the paranasal cavity. The carrier tool may include a hand manipulable handle connected to the carrier member. An implant device may be mountable on the carrier member for implantation of the implant device with the mounted implant device disposed between the handle and the distal tip with the carrier member disposed through the internal passage and with a proximal end of the implant device disposed toward the handle and a distal end of the implant device disposed toward the distal tip of the member. When the implant device is mounted for implantation the carrier member and the carrier tool may be disengageable from the implant device for implantation of the implant device during an implantation procedure to provide fluid access to a paranasal sinus. A clearance fit of the carrier member in the internal passage of the implant device when the implant device is mounted on the carrier member for implant placement may be small to ensure a close fit and help prevent lateral deformation of the implant device during implantation. For example such a clearance fit may be no larger than 0.5 millimeter no larger than 0.4 millimeter no larger than 0.3 millimeter no larger than 0.2 millimeter or no larger than 0.1 millimeter. Having a close fit between of the carrier member in the internal passage of the implant device helps prevent accordion like bunching of the implant device during an implant procedure as the carrier tool with the mounted device may be advanced to advance push the carrier member and the mounted implant device into the fistula for implantation.

Any and all parts of a kit may conveniently be contained within a common package such as a common box bag or other common packaging enclosure. Some or all components of a kit may be sterilized and sealed within hermetically sealed enclosures such as for example hermetically sealed bags or wrapping.

A medical procedure of the method of a third aspect may include implanting an implant device to provide an artificial fluid path in fluid communication with the lacrimal apparatus. The method of the third aspect may involve cutting away tissue to form a fistula for implantation of an implant device which is particularly advantageous when the fistula is to pass through bone such as in the case of implant devices designed to provide an artificial fluid passage between the lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus. The cutting away tissue may be to form a fistula of a size to receive at least a portion of a conduit of an implant device the fistula having a proximal end opening into the lacrimal apparatus and implanting the implant device with at least a portion of the conduit of the implant device in the fistula. Following the cutting away tissue the method may include implanting an implant device to fluidly connect the lacrimal apparatus and the paranasal sinus. The implanting may include advancing the implant device into an implantation position using a carrier tool. The implanting may include advancing the carrier tool to have the carrier tool push the implant device into an implant position. The implanting may include sliding the implant device along a guide member or along a carrier member of a carrier tool into an implantation position. The implanting may include disengaging the carrier tool from the implant device positioned in the implant position.

A method of the third aspect or a portion thereof may be performed using a kit of the second aspect of this disclosure or parts of such a kit. When the method includes cutting away tissue the cutting away tissue may comprise cutting the tissue with a cutting tool of such a kit. During the cutting away or some portion thereof the cutting member may or may not be disposed over and conducted to the location for the cut by the guide member. For example a preliminary cut may be made for form a preliminary hole of a smaller size the guide member may be disposed with a distal end in or distal to the preliminary hole and the cutting member may be slid over the guide member to cut tissue to produce a larger fistula of the desired size for implantation of the implant device. As another example a single final cut may be made to make a hole of a final desired size for implantation which may be made without the aid of a guide member and without making a preliminary hole. In that regard a shoulder on the ethmoid bone facing the orbit has been identified that is a convenient landmark for orienting a cut into the ethmoid sinus. The shoulder has been named the shoulder of Willoughby. When the method includes administering a treatment composition to a paranasal sinus the treatment composition may be as described in relation to the kit of the second aspect.

Lacrimal fluid is produced and secreted from lacrimal glands to lubricate the surface of the eyeball disposed within the orbit. Lacrimal fluid forms a coating over the eyeball and is generally contained within the conjunctival sac the space between the lower eyelid upper eyelid and eyeball that is lined by the conjunctiva . Excess lacrimal fluid is conducted to the vicinity of the medial canthus medial corner of the eye and drains through the lacrimal puncta into the lacrimal canaliculi and into the lacrimal sac of the nasolacrimal duct . The lacrimal fluid then drains from the nasolacrimal duct through Hasner s valve and into the nasal cavity.

As used herein a fistula between the lacrimal apparatus and a paranasal sinus refers to an artificially created passage that fluidly connects the lacrimal apparatus with a paranasal sinus. Such a fistula may be surgically created. The paranasal sinuses include the frontal sinuses maxillary sinuses ethmoid sinuses and sphenoid sinuses which are cavities contained within frontal maxilla ethmoid and sphenoid bones respectively. The paranasal sinuses drain into the nasal cavity. also shows the general proximity of the frontal sinus maxillary sinus and ethmoid sinus relative to features of the lacrimal apparatus and some example fistula routes shown by dashed lines. A first example fistula route is from the orbit to the frontal sinus. A second example fistula route is from the orbit to the ethmoid sinus .

The head has a flanged tissue engagement surface on a side of the head disposed toward the conduit and which flanged tissue engagement surface is advantageously configured to engage tissue adjacent the proximal end of fistula and to prevent the proximal end of the implant device from migrating into the fistula following implantation. On the side of the head opposite the flanged tissue engagement surface is a face surface of the head which face surface is disposed away from tissue engaged by the flanged tissue engagement surface when the implant device is implanted. The head has a first dimension and a second dimension on both the flanged tissue engagement surface and the face surface . The first dimension is the length of the respective surface and the second dimension is the width of the respective surface. Such length and width dimensions may also be referred to as major and minor dimensions. The first dimension of a surface or corresponds to the maximum separation distance between points on the outer edge of the surface maximum cross dimension across the head and the second dimension of the surface or corresponds to the maximum separation distance between points on the outer edge of the surface that are on a line transverse perpendicular to the first dimension. Conveniently the face surface and the flanged tissue engagement surface may be made with corresponding outer edges so that the opposing surfaces and have substantially equal length and width dimensions although such is not required. The first dimension and the second dimension may be referred to generally as the length and width respectively of the head when the surfaces and have corresponding shapes as is the case for the embodiment shown in . When the surfaces and do not have corresponding shapes the length and width dimensions of the head will be different from one or more of the length and width dimensions of the surfaces and . The head has a depth dimension between surfaces and .

With continued reference to the conduit has a first exterior width that is a maximum exterior width of the conduit as defined by the maximum extents of the anchor protrusions transverse to the length of the conduit . The conduit has a second exterior width that is a minimum exterior width of the conduit defined between the most recessed portions of the areas of recess . In the embodiment shown in the height of the anchor protrusions is equal to one half the difference between the first exterior width and the second exterior width of the conduit . In the configuration of the head shown in the first dimension of the head is larger than both the first exterior width and the second exterior width of the conduit while the second dimension of the head is approximately equal to the second exterior width of the conduit .

With continued reference to the anchor protrusions are in the form of spaced circumferential ridges having a width that is at a maximum at the bottom of the ridges located adjacent the areas of recess and which width tapers to a minimum at the top of the ridges located away from the recess areas . Other configurations for anchor protrusions are possible and all anchor protrusions on an implant device need not be of the same size geometry or height. Likewise areas of recess may have varying configurations and not all recesses on an implant device need to be the same size or configuration. The implant device has a length including the depth of the head and the length of the conduit . The anchor protrusions are on a longitudinal portion of the conduit .

Referring now to an alternative embodiment is shown of a conduit of an implant device having anchor protrusions in the form of knobs or buttons and areas of recess adjacent the anchor protrusions . The conduit has a first exterior width defined by the anchor protrusions and a smaller second exterior width defined by the areas of recess . An example of another configuration for anchor protrusions is shown in . As shown in a conduit of an implant device has anchor protrusions and areas of recess on the exterior surface of the conduit . The anchor protrusions are in the form of a continuous spiral ridge extending along a portion of the longitudinal length of the conduit .

With continued reference to the wall thickness of the conduit thickness of the wall between the internal passage and the exterior surface of the conduit is greater along the first longitudinal portion than in the recess areas of the second longitudinal portion . The internal passage has a constant width along the length of the conduit such that the greater wall thickness of the conduit along the first longitudinal portion results in an exterior width that is larger than the minimum exterior width in the recess areas . The maximum exterior width at the anchor protrusions is larger than the exterior width along the first longitudinal portion . shows some exemplary dimensions in millimeters for one nonlimiting example for a configuration of the implant device .

Referring now to some examples of surgical procedures involving forming a fistula and implanting an implant device to provide access to a paranasal sinus and some example surgical tools for use therewith will now be described.

In a surgical tool in the form of an entry tool is shown in the process of making a fistula through tissue between the lacrimal caruncle and the plica semilunaris . Numbering of anatomical parts is the same as in . The fistula is formed through tissue between the conjunctival sac in the orbit and the ethmoid sinus . The route for the fistula would be consistent with general fistula route as shown in . The entry tool includes a hollow working member with a hollow cutting distal tip with a shape suitable to cut away tissue to form a fistula from the conjunctival sac to the ethmoid sinus . The entry tool may also be referred to as a cutting tool and the working member may also be referred to as a cutting member. The entry tool includes a hand manipulable handle . The handle may be advanced or retracted to advance or retract the hollow working member . As shown in the distal cutting tip has been advanced from a location in the conjunctival sac between the caruncle and the plica semilunaris to form a fistula between the conjunctival sac and the ethmoid sinus . As shown the fistula passes behind the caruncle canaliculi and nasolacrimal duct to access the ethmoid sinus .

After the entry tool has been used to initially form a fistula to the ethmoid sinus then a guide wire or other guide member may be inserted through an internal passage extending through the handle and the hollow working member . shows a guide wire inserted through the handle and the working member . After insertion of the guide wire entry tool may be retracted and removed from the fistula leaving the guide wire in place as a guide to and through the fistula as shown in . The guide wire is now available for guiding additional tools to and through the fistula into the ethmoid sinus .

With reference now to the guide wire has been used to guide a surgical tool in the form of an implant tool . The implant tool may also be referred to as a carrier tool. The implant tool includes a hollow working member and a hand manipulable handle . The working member may have a blunt distal tip as shown in since the working member may not need to cut additional tissue following formation of the fistula using the entry tool provided that the fistula has already been formed to a final desired size. The working member may also be referred to as a carrier member. The implant tool includes an internal passage passing through the handle and the hollow working member . As shown in the guide wire has been threaded through the internal passage of the implant tool to guide the hollow working member to and through the fistula and into the ethmoid sinus . An implant device is mounted on the hollow working member of the implant tool . shows the implant tool advanced to a point where the distal end of the implant device is in the vicinity of the proximal end of the fistula opening into the conjunctival sac. From this position the implant device may be advanced into the fistula with a head of the implant device disposed adjacent the conjunctiva in the conjunctival sac and a distal end of the implant device extending into the ethmoid sinus . For example a surgeon may slide the implant device down the hollow working member for placement through the fistula for implantation or the surgeon may advance the handle to have the handle push the implant device into the fistula for implant placement. The outside diameter of the hollow working member may be sized to closely fit within the inside diameter of the implant device to help prevent the implant device from bunching up and laterally deforming as the implant device is pushed into the fistula. The handle and the hollow working member form a carrier for the implant device . The handle may be retracted and the hollow working member disengaged from the implant device after the implant device has been appropriately positioned for implantation through the fistula. shows the implant device as implanted and following disengagement of the hollow working member of the implant tool . As implanted a head at the proximal end of the implant device is located adjacent the conjunctiva in the conjunctival sac within the orbit between the caruncle and the plica semilunaris and the distal end of the implant device is located in the ethmoid sinus . Some anchor protrusions of the conduit of the implant device are disposed within the fistula to engage tissue and help anchor the implant device . The implant device may be used to provide access to the ethmoid sinus to perform medical procedures or treatments for example to administer a treatment composition to the ethmoid sinus or to aspirate fluid from the ethmoid sinus.

The procedure as described with reference to permits the working member of the entry tool to have a larger diameter working member to form a fistula of appropriate size for accommodating the implant device which is then implanted in a separate step using the implant tool with the implant device carried on to the working member which may advantageously have a smaller diameter than the working member used to form the fistula. As an alternative an intermediate step to dilate the fistula or to cut away additional tissue to a desired hole size for implantation may be performed between initially forming a fistula with the entry tool and implanting the implant device using the implant tool .

Referring again to optionally one or more procedures may be performed prior to retracting the hollow working member . One or more fluids may be injected through the hollow working member . For example contrast media may be injected through the hollowing working member and may be imaged to confirm that the fistula has been formed to the proper location prior to proceeding with implantation.

The cutting may be performed for example with a cutting tool such as a needle or cannula that cuts tissue or a drill that drills out the tissue. A method may include cutting an initial hole at the location of the desired fistula and then using a guide member and further tools to complete an implantation procedure. For example the initial cut may be to make a preliminary hole and a larger gauge needle or cutting cannula may be guided by the guide member to cut the fistula to the final desired size for implantation of the implant device. Alternatively the initial hole that is cut may be of a final desired size for implantation of the implant device. After the hole has been made to the desired size the guide member may then be used to guide the implant device or a carrier tool on which the implant device is mounted to the fistula for implantation of the implant device. As one example a small gauge needle may be used to form an initial cut and a guide wire may then be inserted through the needle and into the fistula to maintain control of the fistula. The smaller gauge needle may then be retracted and the second cutting tool in the form of a larger gauge needle may be slid over the guide wire and conducted to the proper location to cut the fistula to the proper size for implantation of the implant device. A kit for performing such an operation my include the implant device the smaller gauge needle the guide wire as the guide member and the larger gauge needle as the cutting tool for making the fistula to the final desired size. As another example the initial cutting tool or a portion thereof may be used as the guide member for the subsequent cutting tool. For example the initial cut may be made using a smaller gauge needle having a handle such as a spinal needle or similar design. Following the initial cut the handle or head may be cut off and removed from the smaller gauge needle and a cutting tool in the form of a larger gauge needle may then be slid over the smaller gauge needle to cut the hole to the final desired size for the fistula. The larger gauge needle may then be retracted and the implant device may be slid over the smaller gauge needle and conducted to the proper location for implantation. A kit for performing such an operation may include the implant device the smaller gauge needle which serves as the guide member and the larger gauge needle as the cutting tool for making the fistula to the final desired size. Alternatively a kit may include a single cutting tool e.g. hollow needle or cutting cannula sized to cut a hole of the final desired size through which the implant device is to be implanted and without enlargement by further cutting or dilation.

Referring now to an example embodiment of a kit is shown that includes components for implanting a paranasal access implant device and delivering a treatment composition to a paranasal sinus through the implant device. As shown in a kit includes a paranasal sinus access implant device . The implant device may for example have any design according to or with features shown or described in relation to any of or may have a different design. The kit also includes a paranasal sinus fluid manipulation tool which includes a fluid dispenser in the form of a syringe and a fluid transmission attachment including a fluid ejection member in the form of a blunt tip hollow needle. The fluid transmission attachment includes an engagement structure at a distal end to engage with a head on a proximal end of the implant device to facilitate transmission of fluid from inside a barrel of the syringe to be ejected from a distal tip of the fluid ejection member . The syringe includes a piston disposed in the barrel of the syringe and that is hand manipulable by advancement or retraction of a plunger to move the piston in the syringe barrel to create pressure to expel fluid from the syringe barrel through the fluid transmission attachment or to create a vacuum to suction fluid through the fluid transmission attachment into the syringe barrel. The fluid manipulation tool may be provided with the syringe and the fluid transmission attachment assembled as shown in or may be provided with the syringe and the fluid transmission attachment as separate disassembled pieces that are assemblable into the assembly as shown in . In some preferred implementations the syringe may be prefilled with a treatment composition disposed inside the barrel of the syringe . Such a prefilled syringe may be provided in the kit assembled with the fluid transmission attachment as shown in and preferably with a protective cap covering the fluid transmission attachment and which cap is removable by a medical practitioner for use of the fluid manipulation tool to administer a treatment composition to a patient in which the implant device has been implanted to provide access to a paranasal sinus. A treatment composition disposed in the barrel of the syringe may be an irrigation liquid or a drug composition for example as previously described.

The kit as shown in also includes tools for forming a fistula between the lacrimal apparatus in the orbit and a paranasal sinus for example a frontal maxillary or ethmoid sinus. As shown in the kit includes a cutting tool having a hollow cutting member e.g. hollow needle for cutting away tissue to form a fistula of a size suitable for implantation of the implant device without enlargement by further cutting or dilation. Alternatively a kit could include a cutting tool with a smaller gauge cutting member or piercing member to form an initial hole and one or more additional tools e.g. cutting tool with larger gauge cutting member and or dilator may be included in a kit to enlarge the initial hole to a final desired size for implantation. The cutting tool may for example have a design according to or including features as shown or described in relation to either of or may be of a different design.

The kit as shown in also includes a carrier tool having an carrier member which has an outside diameter sized for insertion of the carrier member through the internal passage of the implant device to mount the implant device on the carrier member to carry the implant device for implantation after a fistula has been formed to a desired size. The carrier tool may for example have a design according to or including any features as shown in or described in relation to or may be of a different design. The carrier tool and the implant device may be provided in the kit as separate assemblable pieces such as is shown in . Alternatively the carrier tool and the implant device may be provided in the kit with the implant device pre mounted on the carrier member in a configuration ready for use in an implantation procedure.

The fluid ejection member is configured to be inserted into an internal passage that extends through the implant device . After implantation of the implant device to provide access to a paranasal sinus the fluid ejection member may be inserted into the internal passage from the proximal end of the implant device that is disposed in the orbit following implantation. After insertion of the fluid ejection member into the internal passage of the implant device the plunger may be pushed to advance the piston to force treatment composition in the barrel of the syringe to flow to and be ejected from the distal tip of the fluid ejection member . The fluid ejection member may be inserted into the internal passage of the implant device so that the distal tip of the fluid ejection member is disposed in the internal passage when the treatment composition is ejected and the treatment composition is ejected into the internal passage from which the treatment composition may flow to the paranasal sinus. Alternatively the injection member may be inserted into the internal passage of the implant device until the distal end of the injection member exits a distal end of the internal passage into the paranasal sinus in which case the treatment composition may be ejected from the fluid ejection member directly into the paranasal sinus.

The cutting tool and the carrier tool may have internal passages therethrough for insertion of a guide member e.g. a guide wire . A kit may include such a guide wire or other guide member.

A variety of medical treatments and procedures may be performed through a paranasal sinus access implant device implanted to provide access to a paranasal sinus. Fluid treatment compositions may be administered to a paranasal sinus through the implant device. Fluid may be aspirated from a paranasal sinus through the implant device. One or more medical devices may be inserted into the paranasal sinus through the implant device.
