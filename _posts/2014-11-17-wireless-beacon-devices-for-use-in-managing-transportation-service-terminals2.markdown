The present application generally relates to wireless beacon devices for use in managing transportation service terminals and more specifically to placing wireless beacon devices nearby or at bus stops train stations and other transportation terminals so that approaching transportation services may be informed of people at or approaching the terminal who may utilize one of the transportation services.

Transportation services such as buses trains subways taxis and or other services that may offer transportation to a user between two or more points and may utilize terminal locations where a user may visit in order to utilize the transportation service. For example bus stops and or subway stops may be located throughout a city in order to offer transportation to users in the city. Certain transportation services are required to stop at every terminal within a route that the transportation service travels. Thus the transportation service may waste valuable time stopping at terminals where no users access or utilize the transportation service. Other transportation services may wait until a user requests use of the service at a terminal or is physically waiting at the terminal prior to the transportation service picking up or responding to the users request to utilize the transportation service. Thus users may either miss a transportation service while running up to a terminal or also waste valuable time waiting for a transportation service to arrive at the terminal.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

Provided are methods utilized with wireless beacon devices for use in managing transportation service terminals. Systems suitable for practicing methods of the present disclosure are also provided.

Various transportation terminal locations e.g. bus subway stops train stations shuttle pickup locations taxi service locations and other terminal locations where a user may utilize a transportation service may provide short range wireless communications with a communication device for a user such as through beacons using Bluetooth Low Energy BLE LTE Direct or other communication protocol. These beacons may be set up at the terminal location such as at or nearby an entrance to the terminal transportation service pickup location and or payment location for use of the transportation service. The beacons may communicate with communication devices in possession of users in order to connect to the device and determine the user is in proximity to the beacon. The beacons may provide additional functionality such as establishing a connection with a transportation management device or server to provide the transportation management device server a notification that the user has been detected at the transportation terminal. Thus the beacons may provide proximity detection of users at the transportation terminal in order to determine if one or more of the users wishes to utilize the transportation service.

Thus these beacons at transportation terminal locations may communicate with the communication device in possession of the user through Bluetooth Low Energy BLE LTE Direct or another communication protocol receivable by the communication device. When establishing a connection the beacon may emit a communication signal including an identifier for the beacon the user and or the transportation management service administering the beacons e.g. a service provider transportation provider and or town city airport etc. management . A check in module of the communication device may execute specialized hardware and or software to passively monitor for the short range wireless communications for example through a communication module. When the device detects the signal and verifies the one or more identifiers both the device and the beacon may ramp up in power and establish a connection where the connection may further enable the device to communicate additional information to the wireless beacon such as check in information e.g. an identifier and or other stored data for the user and or communication device. The beacon may be connected to a networked device at the terminal or the beacon may include network functionality to communicate with other devices and or servers itself.

Thus a beacon enables the user s communication device to establish a connection communicate check in or other information e.g. an identifier for the user and or communication device and or complete a check in with the terminal location. The check in may be completed automatically when the communication device is in range of the beacon or may be completed after prompting the user to check in when the communication device is in range of the beacon. The wireless beacon s may be range limited to correspond to a sub area of a transportation terminal location such as by limiting the signal strength and or directionality of the beacon and or utilizing the physical boundaries of the terminal location e.g. walls boundaries etc. . The sub area may correspond to a ticketing payment counter of the terminal a walkway or boarding area station of the terminal an entryway for the terminal nearby seating for use at the terminal or other areas at or nearby the terminal. Thus the communication device may connect to one beacon in a sub area of the terminal multiple beacons in more than one sub area of the terminal and or one or more beacons corresponding to the entire terminal.

Utilizing information received from the one or more beacons connected to the communication device a transportation device server managing the transportation services that utilize the terminal may determine that a user at the terminal wishes to utilize one of the transportation services e.g. a bus subway train taxi shuttle etc. . For example based on an amount of time the communication device stays connected to the beacon s the transportation device server may determine that the user in possession of the communication device is waiting for a transportation service. Moreover the beacon s may receive information about a schedule calendar travel route past history of transportation service use or purchased fare for a transportation route from the communication device. Utilizing more than one beacon connection with the communication the device server may also determine that the user is approaching a boarding platform ramp stairway or other area in order to access the transportation service. The transportation device server receives the connection information from the wireless beacon s utilizing a communication module and stores the connection information to a non transitory memory of the transportation device server. The transportation device server may then utilize the aforementioned information to determine that the user may wish to access and utilize the transportation service for travel.

Once the transportation device server has determined that the user wishes to utilize a transportation service the device server may alert the transportation service through a device associated with the transportation service e.g. a GPS module radio unit or other device in communication with the transportation device server . The transportation device server may alert the transportation service that a user is waiting at a specified transportation terminal so that the transportation service may pick up the user for travel. The transportation service may be alerted of the user s identity image destination endpoint schedule calendar travel route and or pre purchased fare. Similarly the user may be alerted of a time until arrival of the transportation service and an identity of the transportation service e.g. bus car subway number . The transportation service may also be alerted of the transportation terminal s location such as on a map so that the transportation service may service the user. Still further the transportation service may be alerted of a number of users at the transportation terminal e.g. through other connections between wireless beacon s and communication device s so that the transportation service may determine whether the transportation service may pick up all users or if another transportation service would be required. If the transportation service is at or near maximum capacity the transportation device server may be alerted e.g. from the transportation service through a number of users connected to a wireless beacon associated with the transportation services and or through a number of purchased fares or users accessing the transportation service . Thus the transportation device server may alert a second transportation service serving the transportation terminal that one or more of the users may be picked up. If the transportation device server is required to alert the second transportation service the user may be alerted of the delay and the time until arrival of a next transportation service. The user may also be alerted of nearby transportation terminals that the user may utilize to access the same or similar transportation services.

In various embodiments the transportation device server may assist a plurality of transportation services all having separate routes such as a bus system within a city. Thus a transportation terminal may have multiple transportation services that each take their travelers on different routes to destination endpoints. In order to determine which of the transportation services a user is utilizing the transportation device server may utilize a schedule calendar of the user received from the communication device purchased fare of the user and or a prior travel history and times of travel for the user. Thus the transportation device server may alert the correct transportation service using the aforementioned information. The transportation device server may also request confirmation from the user through the communication device that the alerted transportation service is correct. If the user wishes to travel on a different transportation service the user may utilize the communication device to make a different selection.

System includes a user a user device a transportation terminal having wireless beacons a transportation server and a transportation device in communication over a network . User may visit transportation terminal in order to access a transportation service. One or more of wireless beacons may connect with user device when user is in proximity to transportation terminal . Transportation server may determine that user wishes to utilize the transportation service associated with transportation terminal using wireless beacons . Transportation server may then alert the transportation service through transportation device that is associated with the transportation service.

User device transportation terminal wireless beacons transportation server and transportation device may each include one or more processors memories and other appropriate components for executing instructions such as program code and or data stored on one or more computer readable mediums to implement the various applications data and steps described herein. For example such instructions may be stored in one or more computer readable media such as memories or data storage devices internal and or external to various components of system and or accessible over network .

User device may be implemented as a communication device that may utilize appropriate hardware and software configured for wired and or wireless communication with wireless beacons transportation server and or transportation device . For example in one embodiment user device may be implemented as a personal computer PC a smart phone laptop tablet computer wristwatch with appropriate computer hardware resources eyeglasses with appropriate computer hardware e.g. GOOGLE GLASS other type of wearable computing device and or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and or receiving data such as an IPAD from APPLE . Although a user device is shown the user device may be managed or controlled by any suitable processing device. Although only one user device is shown a plurality of user devices may function similarly.

User device of contains a check in module other applications a database and a communication module . Check in module and other applications may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments user device may include additional or different hardware and software as required.

Check in module may correspond to one or more processes to execute modules and associated devices of user device to establish a connection with one or more of wireless beacons including a check in with transportation terminal and or a sub area of transportation terminal . In this regard check in module may correspond to specialized hardware and or software utilized by user device with wireless beacons to establish a connection and complete a check in. Check in module may then provide user information about available transportation services available at transportation terminal and or alert at least one transportation service of the arrival of user . A connection by check in module with one or more of wireless beacons may provide and or verify the identity of user including transmission of an identifier for user and or user device . Thus check in information may be established when a connection is made by check in module with one or more of wireless beacons that includes one or more identifiers.

In various embodiments check in module receives short range wireless communications from one or more of wireless beacons through communication module at transportation terminal and transmits information to wireless beacons including check in information for a check in process that associates user with the one or more of wireless beacons connected with user device . For example wireless beacons may be located at and throughout transportation terminal and set up to communicate with user device when user device is in proximity to wireless beacons . For example wireless beacons may correspond to a single wireless beacon associated with all of transportation terminal . Wireless beacons may also correspond to a sub location area of transportation terminal e.g. at an entrance or walkway leading up to transportation terminal at a payment counter machine turnstile for transportation fare at transportation terminal at an access ramp stairs at transportation terminal etc. . Thus wireless beacons may be range limited to connect only with devices e.g. user device within the specified area such as a radius around wireless beacons a distance away from wireless beacons and or a signal direction for wireless beacons . When user device enters the proximity radius for one or more of wireless beacons user device and the one or more of wireless beacons may connect and check in information including an identifier for user and or user device may be transmitted to the connected beacons of wireless beacons .

Check in module may execute in the background of an operating system of user device and be configured to establish connections using communication module of user device with one or more of wireless beacons . The connection may be established with or without user input from user . For example wireless beacons may broadcast a token such as a universally unique identifier UUID for reception by check in module as will be explained in more detail herein. Check in module may utilize communication module of user device to receive the token from wireless beacons . If check in module acknowledges the UUID as identifying transportation terminal wireless beacons transportation server and or transportation device e.g. if check in module determines the UUID corresponds to a request to establish a communication channel and or process and complete a check in check in module may transmit an identifier corresponding to user and or user device back to wireless beacons . Check in module may utilize communication module of user device to communicate with wireless beacons e.g. over near field communication Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy radio infrared LTE Direct or other communication protocol . The identifier from user device may include be transmitted with concatenated with or otherwise bundled with the identifier received from wireless beacons . Thus wireless beacons may identify the communication as associated with a connection request by wireless beacons . In other embodiments different information may be transmitted to wireless beacons such as an identifier for user a name or other personal information for user or other identifying information. Thus the information transmitted to wireless beacons does not need to be utilized to process and or complete a check in in all embodiments.

Once a connection is established with wireless beacons the process may associate user with the one or more of wireless beacons used to connect to user device . For example wireless beacons may previous be registered as located at or nearby a specific area within transportation terminal e.g. at an entrance or walkway leading up to transportation terminal at a payment counter machine turnstile for transportation fare at transportation terminal at an access ramp stairs at transportation terminal etc. . Once user device connects to one or more of wireless beacons the check in connection information e.g. the check in information including an identifier and information for the check in such as the beacon s of wireless beacons that user device is connected to may be transmitted to transportation server . Transportation server may process the check in information to determine if user will utilize a transportation service available at transportation terminal as will be explained in more detail herein. Transportation server may further determine which transportation service user will utilize an availability of the transportation service similar transportation services usable by user and or similar transportation terminals usable by user . As previously discussed in other embodiments a check in need not be processed and or completed to associate user with the areas of the terminal. Thus other connections and data transfers to wireless beacons may be sufficient to associate user with transportation terminal .

Once a connection is established with wireless beacons by check in module check in module may be utilized to transmit further information to wireless beacons for use by transportation server in determining user whether user will utilize a transportation service what transportation service route timeline is required by user and or other transportation services terminals are usable by user as will be explained in more detail herein. For example check in module may access information stored to database such as user personal information e.g. an address for a work home friend family etc. a calendar schedule of user a travel route for user e.g. a route entered to a mapping application of user device past travel history for user and or purchased fare for a transportation service . Such information may be transmitted to transportation server for processing and or previously stored by transportation server . Check in module may also interface with one or more APIs for applications and or modules executed by user device to retrieve such information. Check in module may also receive information from wireless beacons and or transportation server . Received information may correspond to a name identifier of a transportation service that has been flagged for usage by user an expected time for arrival for one or more transportation services a capacity limit and or current occupancy of a transportation service a similar transportation service serving the same or similar route for user and or a nearby or similar transportation terminal for use by user . Such information may be presented to user through a device interface of user device and may allow user to select additional information. For example user may request a different transportation service purchase fare for a transportation service and or view a map to a transportation service in transportation terminal or a nearby transportation terminal.

In various embodiments user device includes other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide features to user device . For example other applications may include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network or other types of applications. Other applications may also include email texting voice and IM applications that allow a user to send and receive emails calls texts and other notifications through network . In various embodiments other applications may include financial applications such as banking online payments money transfer or other applications associated with a payment provider. As previously discussed other applications may include mapping applications for example through a GPS module that may identify user at a location and or calendaring scheduling applications which may be utilized to determine a service provider user may utilize. Other applications may include device interfaces and other display modules that may receive input from user and or output information to user . For example other applications may contain software programs executable by a processor including a graphical user interface GUI configured to provide an interface to the user.

User device may further include database stored to a transitory and or non transitory memory of user device which may store various applications and data and be utilized during execution of various modules of user device . Thus database may include for example identifiers such as operating system registry entries cookies associated with check in module and or other applications identifiers associated with hardware of user device or other appropriate identifiers such as identifiers used for payment user device authentication or identification. Database may include scheduling information travel route information calendaring information personal information purchase travel fare on a transportation service and or previous usage histories of one or more transportation service. Furthermore database may further include received information from transportation server for example locations and or maps to transportation services within transportation terminal or a nearby transportation terminal time for arrival of transportation services and or transportation services information e.g. name number etc. .

User device includes at least one communication module adapted to communicate with wireless beacons transportation server and or transportation device . In various embodiments communication module may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices. Communication module may communicate directly with wireless beacons using short range communications such as Bluetooth Low Energy LTE Direct WiFi radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communications.

Transportation terminal may correspond to a physical location where a user may access transportation services in order to travel between two or more locations. For example transportation terminal may correspond to a bus stop or station a train or subway station a taxi car shuttle service pickup location a boat dock or pier station or other location where a transportation service may provide a vehicle for transportation to user . Transportation terminal may include further specialized software and or hardware than displayed in environment such as schedule announcement systems and or fare payment systems. Transportation terminal further includes wireless beacons utilized to provide transportation service management utilizing connections with communication devices. Thus transportation terminal includes wireless beacons . Transportation terminal may also include communication modules and or network interface components configured to communication with user device transportation server and or transportation device directly and or over network .

Wireless beacons may be maintained for example by a service provider transportation provider town city planner or other entity providing management of one or more transportation services. Wireless beacons may be implemented using any appropriate hardware and software configured for wireless communication with user device transportation server and or transportation device . For example in one embodiment wireless beacons may be implemented as a dongle device including a hardware processor and a communication module for example connected to a device at transportation terminal e.g. a computing device having specialized hardware and or software for management of transportation services . Wireless beacons may also be implemented as a device incorporated within a personal computer PC a smart phone laptop computer and or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and or receiving data such as an IPAD from APPLE . Wireless beacons may also act as a stand alone device including a processor communication module and or network interface component configured to communicate with user device transportation server and or transportation device . Although a plurality of wireless beacons are described a single wireless beacon may be utilized at the transportation terminal.

Wireless beacons may be located at and throughout transportation terminal including sub areas of transportation terminal . Wireless beacons of contains processes procedures and or applications for example a software program executable by a hardware processor configured to interact with user device transportation server and or transportation device . Thus regardless of the implementation of wireless beacons as discussed above each of wireless beacons utilize a check in module and a communication module . Check in module may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments wireless beacons may include additional or different software and devices as required.

Check in module may correspond to an executable module having specialized hardware and or software features for transmitting requests to establish a connection between a device e.g. user device and one of wireless beacons transmitting the request to establish the connection. Thus wireless beacons may utilize short range wireless communications of wireless beacons to transmit the requests to establish a connection including an identifier such as a Universally Unique Identifier UUID . If user device receives a request to establish the connection with wireless beacons and responds with a user device identifier potentially including the UUID and other information necessary to effectuate a check in of user device check in module may cause wireless beacons to ramp up in power and create a connection between user device and wireless beacons .

Each of wireless beacons may transmit the request to establish the connection with wireless beacons as a short range wireless communication e.g. a BLE protocol communication including a wake up process for check in module of user device and or a token for wireless beacons . In other embodiments the request and or connection may utilize near field communication radio communication infrared communication Bluetooth communication or WiFi communication. Additionally although wireless beacons may utilize BLE protocol communications to effectuate an always on type service where the UUID and wake up process are transmitted continuously other communication protocols used to provide an always on service may include QUALCOMM LTE Direct or similar device to device communication technology. BLE and LTE Direct may both be utilized to provide discovery of nearby devices to wireless beacons e.g. user device and establishment of a connection for data transfers.

The request may be specific to user device by including information that is specific to user such as a name identifier or user device identifier. The information specific to user may be determined from a user account of user or other information previously provided to transportation server . Thus in certain embodiments only user device will pick up and authenticate the request. After check in module receives a user device identifier from user device check in module may determine user is in proximity to the beacon of wireless beacons connected to user device . The beacon of wireless beacons that connected to user device may pass the user device identifier to transportation server using check in module . Thus transportation server may determine user device is in proximity to the one or more of wireless beacons connected to user device through the connection between user device and the connected beacon of wireless beacons as will be discussed in more detail herein. As shown in wireless beacons may utilize communication module of one of wireless beacons to pass the identifier to transportation server . Additionally check in module may cause wireless beacons to keep a communication channel open with user device for passing additional information between user device and transportation server .

Check in module may also be utilized to request retrieve and or receive information from user device about user . For example once a connection is established between user device and one or more of wireless beacons check in module may pull receive scrape information from user device such travel routes calendar information personal information purchased transportation service fare prior travel on one or more transportation services and or preferred transportation services stored to database of user device . Check in module may also transmit information to user device such as a name identifier of a transportation service that has been flagged for usage by user an expected time for arrival for one or more transportation services a capacity limit and or current occupancy of a transportation service a similar transportation service serving the same or similar route for user and or a nearby or similar transportation terminal for use by user . Requests generated by user using user device e.g. requests for a schedule or flagging of a different transportation service and or requests to purchase or reserve fare for a transportation service may also be passed to transportation server through wireless beacons or directly by user device using network .

In various embodiments each of wireless beacons include at least one communication module adapted to communicate with user device transportation server and or transportation device . Communication module may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices. Communication module may communicate with user device using short range communications such as radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communications.

Transportation server may be maintained for example by a service provider which may provide management of transportation service for example as a transportation provider town city management or other service provider. Transportation server includes one or more processing applications which may be configured to interact with user device wireless beacons and or transportation device to provide transportation management services to user and a transportation service associated with transportation device . Although only one server is shown a plurality of servers and or devices may function similarly. Although transportation server is described as a server device in various embodiments transportation server may function as a specialized device local to transportation terminal . Thus in certain embodiments transportation server may communicate through wired or short range wireless communication with wireless beacons to determine usage of transportation services by user and flagging of a transportation service associated with transportation device . Furthermore although transportation server is shown as separate from transportation device the below described modules hardware and functions may be included within one device entity such as one local to transportation terminal or embodied as transportation device .

Transportation server of includes a terminal information processing module other applications a database and a communication module . Terminal information processing module and other applications may correspond to executable processes procedures and or applications with associated hardware. In other embodiments transportation server may include additional or different hardware and software as required.

Terminal information processing module may correspond to one or more processes to execute modules and associated devices of transportation server to determine a transportation service for use by user using connections established by one or more of wireless beacons with user device and alert the transportation service of user required usage at transportation terminal . In this regard terminal information processing module may correspond to specialized hardware and or software utilized by transportation server with wireless beacons to receive check in information e.g. a communication device identifier for user device including one or more connections between user device and one or more of wireless beacons . Thus the check in information may include an identifier used for identification of user and or user device . Terminal information processing module may utilize communication module to receive the check in information and store the check in information to database in a non transitory memory of transportation server . The connection s between user device and one or more of wireless beacons may further include information identifying the connected beacon s of wireless beacons that may be utilized by terminal information processing module to determine which of wireless beacons are connected to user device and the locations of those beacons. Utilizing such information about transportation terminal and or sub areas of transportation terminal that user has been detected in proximity to a transportation service that user may utilize at transportation terminal may be determined. For example through connections to wireless beacons a position for user may be determined and or triangulated. Further through additional connections established and ended between wireless beacons a path that user is travelling may be determined such walking to a boarding ramp or payment station. Still further a time or approximate time that user has been located at transportation terminal may be determined. Thus terminal information processing module may exclude users that are only quickly passing by or through transportation terminal . If user is determined to be waiting at transportation terminal based on location path and or time information terminal information processing module may determine that user wishes to access utilize a transportation service available at transportation terminal .

Terminal information processing module may receive the connection information from wireless beacons in order to determine whether user wishes to utilize a transportation service. Terminal information processing module may further determine whether user may utilize a transportation service available at transportation terminal using information available about user for example information received from user device and or previous stored to database . Thus once user device connects to one or more of wireless beacons information about the user device may be accessed received and or retrieved by the beacon s as previously discussed. Such information may include travel routes calendar information personal information purchased transportation service fare prior travel on one or more transportation services and or preferred transportation services stored to database of user device or utilized by another application or module of user device . Terminal information processing module may determine that user will utilize a transportation service using the aforementioned information. In various embodiments terminal information processing module may further determine which transportation service should be used e.g. a type of transportation service a name of a transportation service a number of the transportation service a transportation service associated with a specific route for user and or time of arrival of a transportation service . Using the information determined about the transportation service for user by user terminal information processing module may generate an alert for the transportation service and alert the transportation service that user requires transportation at transportation terminal for example through transportation device . For example terminal information processing module may access information about transportation services and routes for the transportation service from database . The transportation services information may include information about schedules travel routes and transportation service identification. Terminal information processing module may utilize the transportation services information to determine the transportation service to alert of required use by user . The alert may display information for user on transportation device a location for user and or transportation terminal other associated users wishing to utilize the transportation service at transportation terminal fare payments by user and or other users and or other information determined by terminal information processing module .

In various embodiments terminal information processing module may receive information about the transportation service associated with transportation device that user wishes to utilize and or transportation terminal . For example terminal information processing module may receive a notification from transportation device e.g. input by a driver conductor or other entity controlling the transportation service associated with transportation device that indicates the transportation service associated with transportation device is reaching or at maximum occupancy. Such information may be sent to transportation server when close to or at maximum occupancy at various time intervals or when transportation device receives the above described notification to server user at transportation terminal . In such embodiments terminal information processing module may utilize the transportation services information about transportation services serving transportation terminal to determine another transportation service that user may utilize at transportation terminal . For example a second bus travelling the required route by user may be 10 minutes behind a first bus currently at transportation terminal but at maximum capacity. Thus terminal information processing module may alert the second bus that user will still require service when the second bus approaches transportation terminal . Of course if user chooses to leave transportation terminal and or board the first bus because there is room or a passenger departed at transportation terminal the alert may be revoked by terminal information processing module .

Terminal information processing module may provide information to user device and or transportation device . As previously discussed information provided to transportation device may include the alert that user is waiting for the transportation service associated with transportation device at transportation terminal as well as information for identifying user and or allowing user to board the transportation service e.g. a name image other identifier purchased fare reserved fare and price to charge destination endpoint etc. . Similarly user may be provided through user device information about the transportation service such as a name number other identifier travel route stop endpoints cost of fare and option to purchase fare capacity and current occupancy estimated time to arrival location including a map coordinate or location e.g. visible through a mapping application of user device additional transportation services serving the same route for the user and their expected time of arrival and or other transportation terminals where the user may access and or depart the transportation service. For example user may be alerted as user is approaching or paying for fare at transportation terminal that the estimated time to arrival or wait time for the transportation service may mean that user may miss the transportation service. In other embodiments the transportation service may be at maximum capacity. Thus the user may visit another transportation terminal or may wait for another transportation service using the information provided by terminal information processing module .

Terminal information processing module may also receive information from user device . For example terminal information processing module may receive a notification that the transportation service that terminal information processing module has alerted for user is incorrect based on a different travel route user wishes to travel. User may utilize an input device with check in module to make a selection of another transportation service required by user . Thus terminal information processing module may instead generate a notification alert for the requested transportation service and may assist user with the requested transportation service as discussed above. Furthermore terminal information processing module may receive a payment request for a fare payment from user device . Terminal information processing module may process the payment request for example using a payment provider and provider a receipt having information used by the transportation service and or transportation terminal to provide admittance for user .

In various embodiments transportation server includes other applications as may be desired in particular embodiments to provide features to transportation server . For example other applications may include security applications for implementing server side security features programmatic server applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network or other types of applications. Other applications may contain software programs executable by a processor including a graphical user interface GUI configured to provide an interface to a user.

Additionally transportation server includes database . In various embodiments transportation server allow user to establish user accounts with transportation server that may include user information. For example a transportation provider town city or other service provider may allow user to establish a user account or user information in database that may be utilized when user device connects to one or more of wireless beacons . Database may further include check in information having connections between user device and one or more of wireless beacons as well as information received from user device . Database may information about transportation services serving transportation terminal such as identification information pricing schedules travel routes and or occupancy. Transportation server may further store information user with the transportation services such as notifications transmitted to transportation device requests from user device etc.

In various embodiments transportation server includes at least one communication module adapted to communicate user device wireless beacons and or transportation device over network . Communication module may include a DSL e.g. Digital Subscriber Line modem a PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network modem an Ethernet device a broadband device a satellite device and or various other types of wired and or wireless network communication devices including microwave radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communication devices. Communication module may communicate with wireless beacons and or transportation device using short range communications such as radio frequency infrared Bluetooth and near field communications where transportation server may be local to transportation terminal or transportation device .

Transportation device may be implemented as a communication device that may utilize appropriate hardware and software configured for wired and or wireless communication with user device wireless beacons and or transportation server . Transportation device may be located locally to a transportation service such as attached to a transportation service and visible or audible by a driver conductor or other administrator associated with the transportation service or in possession of the administrator. For example in one embodiment transportation device may be implemented as a personal computer PC a smart phone laptop tablet computer wristwatch with appropriate computer hardware resources eyeglasses with appropriate computer hardware e.g. GOOGLE GLASS other type of wearable computing device display device include processing components heads up display device vehicle dashboard or console device and or other types of computing devices capable of transmitting and or receiving data such as an IPAD from APPLE . Although a transportation device is shown the transportation device may be managed or controlled by any suitable processing device. Although only one transportation device is shown a plurality of transportation devices may function similarly.

Transportation device of contains a transportation route module other applications a database and a communication module .
