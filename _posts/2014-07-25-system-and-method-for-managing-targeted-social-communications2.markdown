This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 858 385 filed Jul. 25 2013 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

This invention relates to computer systems methods and solutions for managing marketing related communications. This invention further relates to targeting customers and potential customers using social networks.

Across the world social networks are becoming an increasingly popular communication medium. A large number of users use various social networks such as Facebook Linked In and Twitter to engage in a multitude of social communications on a variety of topics. The various social networking platforms the social networks that their users create using such social networking platforms and the various social interactions including communications between such social networks is generally referred to as the social web . The social web has evolved into a medium like email except that it is more public.

Various enterprises promote and sell a wide range of products and or services. Promotion and sales involve various sales activities including various interactions between sales marketing personnel and consumers who are often social web users. The social web represents important sales marketing opportunities for vendors. The social web is also important to vendors and other brands from a brand management and reputation management perspective. Social media interactions including for example communications regarding a brand can have a viral effect having significant positive or negative consequences. Business and government entities collectively referred to as brands in this disclosure are interested in taking advantage of these opportunities and managing associated risk.

However the social web is characterized by staggering volume of social communications and associated volume of data. Facebook and Twitter users alone generate more than 3.5 billion posts and comments per day. Add to this volume conversations happening on 300 million blogs and forums and additional content being contributed via YouTube LinkedIn Pinterest and others. It is estimated that 32 of social media conversations are about companies products and services making this a critical channel for businesses both to understand what is being said about their brands people and products and to engage with consumers to grow sales deliver customer service and retain their consumer base.

For companies wanting to participate in social media finding the posts that are relevant to their business can prove challenging enough. Traditional social media listening platforms keyword Boolean deliver high volumes of posts that match search criteria but that can be completely unrelated to a company s brand. For example a search using the term Apple may return posts relating to Apple computers Apple fruit and more similarly a search using the term TD may return posts relating to TD Bank touchdowns and more. Beyond this understanding the content of these posts usually requires human beings to read and categorize each one individually a costly and inefficient process for example the term iPhone is mentioned 14.5M times month which certainly does not permit for a timely response to posts other than those directed to the company s Twitter account or Facebook page which addresses only part of the engagement opportunity .

The social web is also characterized by a rapid pace of development. The potential viral effect of social networking can result in a Tweet turning into a full blown public relations disaster for a brand and there are numerous well documented examples of this phenomenon. Therefore acting on relevant social media objects quickly is essential and challenging.

There is a need for solutions that allow brands or their service providers to engage with individual businesses or consumers of interest to them from a variety of perspectives. They may be customers potential customers customers of a competitor whom they want to target citizens with whom a brand wants to foster and maintain a positive brand reputation and so on may be referred to as a customer in this disclosure . There is a further need for solutions that allow brands to communicate with customers in an efficient and effective way especially given the volume and rapid pace referred to previously.

There is a need therefore for a computer network implemented system a computer network implemented method and a computer network architecture that addresses at least some of the challenges referred to above. There is a further need for a computer network implemented system a computer network implemented method and a computer network architecture that addresses at least some of the challenges referred to above and that is easy to deploy and allows the management of marketing communications in an efficient manner.

In this respect before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

In this disclosure social networking platform refers to any computer network implemented application platform that is operable to generate a series of webpages so as to define a series of user interactions and or workflows including social media interactions that define a social networking environment. Social networking platform includes social media content aggregators such as e.g. radian6 and GNIP .

 Social media interactions refer to the various interactions between users of a social networking platform including friends including various communications such as platform messaging instant messaging videoconferencing voice messaging etc. uploading or posting content in one or more media downloading content in one or more media watching content in one or more media reviewing or rating content including objects taking a quiz selling or trading items such as objects and so on.

 Topic refers to a topic that is relevant to a brand objective such as a sales objective or a brand reputation management perspective. By operation of the present invention campaign personnel engage in platform managed social media interactions around topics .

 Campaigns refer to a promotional information marketing or sales campaigns that may be related to one or more topics .

 Campaign personnel refers to individuals engaged by a brand or on behalf of a brand by the operator of the platform an advertising agency or other entity to manage campaigns using the platform. Campaign personnel may also refer to automated computer implemented software agents who engage in certain campaign related functions automatically.

 Clients refer to clients of the computer system or platform of the present invention such as a brand or a company engaged by a brand who are given access to the computer system or platform of the present invention whether by subscribing to the computer system or platform or otherwise.

 Social media objects include any content or media object that may be used or consumed in connection with social networking interactions such as for example a social posting social feed a message a use case a video quiz a tip a discussion a digital good etc.

 Social media data refer to data extracted from social media objects that is likely to contain data relevant to a brand or a product or service of a brand for example a social posting social feed a message a discussion a video comment or the like.

 Actionable social media objects refers to the output of the platform namely a filtered classified set of social media objects that are relevant to one or more active campaigns and optionally are acted upon using platform features for example by campaign personnel.

The present invention provides a computer network implemented system a computer network implemented method and a computer network architecture that allows clients to target customers systematically using the social web.

One aspect of the present invention is that it provides a solution for extracting social media data of interest from a significant volume of social media objects in a way that allows campaign personnel to act on specific social media data on a timely basis.

The platform extracts data related to social media objects from social media platforms using a novel and innovative extractor filter system . The extractor filter system may be used to connect to social media platforms to access a broad range of different social media objects and extract a subset of these social media objects that may be of interest or social media data based one or more active campaigns.

The platform presents a plurality of dashboards and user portals that may be accessed by users e.g. clients and campaign personnel operating end user devices .

The platform may include a server computing device as detailed below or server farm and which may also include an application repository. Server computing device is adapted to execute computer executable instructions to provide the functionality of the platform as detailed below.

The platform harvests social media data such as millions of social media posts across a potentially large number of social media sites in real time or near real time. The cumulative social content is text mined for actionable insights such as sales leads or service opportunities. An important aspect is that the actionable insights are delivered in way that resolution is possible at the root cause or on an individual level as further explained below.

The platform provides many advantages including reduction of resources required to manage customer care centre revenue growth and improved customer satisfaction.

For example the servicing bus may provide dashboards and user portals in the form of webpages allowing users to configure platform or receive reports regarding the operation of platform as further detailed below. Users may for example be clients or campaign personnel. The servicing bus may also expose one or more APIs Application Programming Interfaces allowing suitably configured external systems to interact with platform e.g. to retrieve reporting data e.g. performance reports statistics etc. or to input configuration data e.g. campaign configuration parameters client parameters etc. 

Referring again to in one aspect a computer system is provided that allows the systematic targeting of customers through the social web and is configured to A extract social media data from social media objects in a way that has a low threshold of relevance B store the data into one or more data repositories and C apply one or more classifying techniques to the data repository in order to map a subset of the social media objects to categories. Categories relate generally to active campaigns as explained below. The classification or categorization uses the social media data to filter social media objects to establish only those relevant to a relevant process or workflow in the platform at a higher threshold of relevance. The platform then includes components that implement one or more workflows usually executed by campaign personnel but some workflows may be automated or may include automated steps for acting on the actionable social media objects.

Contrary to prior art social media listeners that generally continuously access and analyze social media interaction streams and tend to either generate many hits including irrelevant results or miss relevant results the two tiered approach of the present invention wherein first social media streams of interest are compiled in a data repository applying little to no filtering e.g. filtering may be mainly based on social networking source and then trained classification processes are applied based on specific attributes such as attributes defined based on an active campaign yields relevant results with a smaller number of relevant results being missed as compared to prior art solutions. Further details are provided under the heading Categorizing .

In one possible implementation the data repository may be subject to a variety of database management processes. For example timely social media data is of interest and becomes dated quickly. Accordingly records may be deleted from the data repository automatically after a certain date and new social media data may be extracted continuously and stored in the data repository in real time or near real time. The social media data being filtered therefore and used to create action items in the platform may be relatively current data so as to respond to the need for act on relevant social media interactions quickly.

In one implementation a management utility which may be associated with one or more dashboards may be linked with the extractor filter system . The management utility allows one or more administrative users to set the parameters for extracting social media data and then filtering social media data to identify specific social media data of interest based on one or more active campaigns registered to the platform .

In one possible implementation the parameters for extracting social media data in the first stage of extraction filtering relate to identifying social media objects that may be relevant to a particular vertical the vertical being relevant to a group of clients of the platform . Examples of a vertical include WIRELESS MOBILE APPLICATIONS BANKING or CABLE . The extractor filter system may include a range of semantic filters to perform semantic text analysis on social media objects and associated taxonomies for identifying social media objects that may have relevance to one or more of such verticals. In one aspect of the invention the management utility may include one or more tools that enable the management of relevance and other related factors for configuring the thresholds associated with filtering and classifying social media data.

In one aspect it may be preferable to set the thresholds relatively low for the purpose of the first tier or the extraction of social media data from the social media objects in order to extract into the one or more data repositories a significant volume of information that is nonetheless manageable based on utilization of a reasonable amount of data storage and processing resources.

For example in relation to one or more campaigns related to CABLE customers the extractor filter system first locates extracts and stores to an associated data repository on a regular basis blog entries FACEBOOK entries Tweets and so on that are CABLE related. In some embodiments extractor filter system locates extracts and stores social media objects continuously and in real time or near real time.

In another aspect the extractor filter system may locate extract and store social media objects that date to a user configured time period e.g. those social media objects created in the last 24 hours or last week. Conveniently this allows extractor filter system to retrieve objects in bulk as may be needed in the event of data loss from a data repository or other system failure.

In yet another aspect the extractor filter system may be configured e.g. by way of a management portal detailed below to generate alerts based on measuring a flow rate of social media objects through the system. Alerts may be keyed to a threshold corresponding to a particular number of social media objects located extracted stored over a particular time period. By way of example only an alert may be generated if the number of social media objects located extracted stored within the last 24 hours is less than a pre set minimum threshold e.g. 10 or if the number of objects in the last hour is more than a pre set maximum threshold e.g. 100 . Conveniently such alerts may be used to alert users when the flow rate of social media objects into the platform is below the minimum threshold indicative of a starvation state or to alert users when the flow rate is above the maximum threshold indicative of a flooding state.

In a particular implementation of the present invention various extraction methods or routines may be used by the extractor filter system .

Various campaigns are possible for example A a client may be interested in targeting customers who are unhappy with their services for the purpose of addressing their concerns and keeping the customer or B a client may be interested in targeting customers who are unhappy with a competitor for the purpose of attempting to have the customer deal with the client.

The management utility also provides a series of tools for managing the parameters associated with filtering data relevant to social media objects from the data repositories using classification as explained below based one or more campaign profiles. For example a data repository associated with MOBILE may be linked to one or more campaigns for targeting customers. For example one campaign for Mobile Carrier A may relate to identifying A customers in the social web that are making negative comments about Mobile Carrier A or its services or B customers in the social web that are making negative comments about one or more competitors of Mobile Carrier A i.e. Mobile Carrier B and Mobile Carrier C.

In A a campaign may consist of i detecting relevant social media interactions ii connecting with the relevant customers directly and on a timely basis through the relevant social networking platform and optionally iii engaging with the relevant customer in a way designed to retain the customer or minimize possible negative repercussions on the brand of Mobile Carrier A.

Relevant social media objects include social media data that maps to one or more active campaigns as configured using the campaign manager .

In B a campaign may consist of i detecting relevant social media interactions ii connecting with the relevant customers directly and on a timely basis through the relevant social networking platform and optionally iii engaging with the relevant customer in a way designed to solicit them to move their business from for example Mobile Carrier B or Mobile Carrier C to Mobile Carrier A. Other uses include service improvement support escalation responding to technical questions regarding products or services.

In one implementation the platform includes a workflow manager . The workflow manager may be used to design and deploy one or more processes or workflows related to targeting customers. For example the workflow manager may be used to configure and deploy one or more rules for engaging with customers include presentation of particular content to campaign personnel. Content such as draft social media communications may be stored to a database .

The database may include one or more templates that may include rules and or content created for different verticals or client types which may be used for example as a starting point for configuring workflows and content related to a particular campaign using the workflow manager .

In one aspect of the computer system features of the management utility related to the first level extraction of data related social media objects may be configured by the operator of the platform .

In another aspect of the present invention other features of the management utility may be used to configure one or more processes for categorizing or classifying the contents of one or more data repositories as further explained below. The management utility may include a series of functions that are used to train the classification algorithms for a particular active campaign as explained below.

In another aspect of the present invention the extractor filter system applies second level filtering to the relevant data repository . In one possible implementation the second level filtering uses one or more text analysis techniques to find social media objects of interest using classification techniques and optionally also statistical analysis techniques for example to rank or score returned social media objects for relevance for a particular campaign or workflow .

In one aspect of the present invention the platform includes a campaign manager . The campaign manager may be implemented in a number of ways including as part of a web application. The campaign manager may include functions and features similar to a campaign manager system or platform used to design and implement online advertising campaigns.

Representative screenshots of a management portal of the platform are shown in according to one possible embodiment. The management portal may be presented to users operating end user devices in the form of one or more webpages.

In particular shows a screen of the management portal allowing a user to define the parameters of a company that may be subject of a campaign.

In one aspect of the invention the platform provides a unified set of tools for managing marketing communications that addresses the social web.

In another aspect the CRM may be connected to a dashboard such as the dashboard shown in . The workflow manager creates a series of queues with actionable tickets. In one aspect the workflow manager includes a decision tree for apportioning tickets amongst campaign personnel. The workflow manager may include matching functions for matching personnel attributes to ticket attributes so as to assign tickets to personnel who may well positioned to act on the ticket. The CRM dashboard in one implementation displays the tickets and permits the campaign personnel to reject tickets that are not relevant to the campaign.

In another aspect of the present invention the CRM categorizes tickets into channels streams and permits campaign personnel to pick channels of their choice. This is based on the fact that campaign personnel tends to perform better if they can select a channel that they prefer based on their knowledge or interest. An example of this functionality for selecting channels is shown in . As shown channels streams may be selected by drag and drop into particular queues.

In another aspect of the invention the CRM dashboard displays information regarding the social media objects in the queue that permits the campaign personnel to accept or reject the ticket as being relevant to the campaign. Various types of queues are possible. For example customer service sales retention technical support or brand management queues. In particular verticals for example banking there may be separate queues for credit personal banking investment services insurance etc.

The platform can deliver for example to an agent or campaign personnel dashboard A actionable sales leads B requests for service support or C brand management opportunities. One function of the sales service portal is for example relevant social media posts are sent to the right parties such as specific campaign personnel . The sales and service portal may also include features that allow campaign personnel to capture notes within the conversation threads. The platform presents customizable fields that allows the presentation of information that matters to a particular client workflow. Because content is downloadable in the platform insights generated by the platform can be integrated into social and traditional customer insights.

In one aspect of the invention platform includes a communication utility . The communication utility allows campaign personnel to target customers in the same social networking platform in which the relevant social media interaction occurred. The communication utility also allows conventional communications to be initiated within the queue of relevant social media objects presented through a dashboard. The platform may include or link to a variety of communication features. For example the platform may include i Internet chat features ii automatic reply to social media objects using their associated social media platform iii switch to call switch to chat and so on.

In one aspect of the invention the present invention provides a special two level filtering process that improves using at each level different filtering tools techniques which in relation to social media objects provides an efficient scalable and cost effective solutions for targeting customers through the social web in real time or near real time.

Prior art solutions consist generally of listening platforms that were purely keyword based and are generally based on a one step approach. Listening profiles were defined based on key words and these would be applied to social media object pipelines in order to identify social media objects of interest. This approach tends to miss social media objects that may be of interest by filtering out social media objects that do not map to the key words and yet are relevant for the purposes of one or more campaigns. And once these prior art solutions deem a social media object to be of interest the filtering techniques are not robust enough to streamline or automate actions on such social media objects as further explained below.

The present invention on the other hand greater granularity in categorization of social media objects. One aspect of the granularity is the ability to map social media objects to specific campaign items.

As previously stated for ease of use social media objects are categorized by using one or more classifiers to process the social media data in a relevant repositories.

Additional details are now provided regarding possible filtering functionality for use in connection with the second stage of the extraction filtering of social media objects as previously described.

In another aspect of the invention the extractor filter system implements one or more text mining techniques or algorithms that incorporate learning technology elements. In one aspect the text mining techniques used include linguistic analysis and statistical analysis elements that provide very good relevance.

In one implementation the text mining techniques are first trained by humans for a particular campaign or class of campaigns. For example personnel of the operator of the platform for example may review information regarding a brand and then social media data that may be related to the brand in order to discover associations that may assist in filtering social media objects relevant to the brand. For example BELL may be a brand associated with a client. The personnel of the operator of the platform may learn the context of Internet posts that are relevant to BELL and those that are not. This information may be used to train the text analysis algorithms.

Various other filtering techniques may be used to further improve the targeting of consumers. The database may include for example information regarding priority customers and the platform may be used to manage campaigns targeting priority customers.

In one aspect the extractor filter system replicates human interpretation categorization of social media content by applying text analysis and statistical analysis. In one aspect the purpose of the text analysis is to categorize social media objects into one or more discrete topic relevant to a campaign. One example is a brand name such as VIRGIN where the platform find all posts relevant to VIRGIN VIRGIN related posts being a category. As explained below one or more classifiers are used to classify the social media objects and thereby organize them into one or more categories. These classifiers are first trained for example based on attributes of a campaign and how to differentiate between posts actually related to the VIRGIN brand. In one example it was found that the platform is around 96 accurate.

In another aspect the platform uses one or more statistical methods to calculate a confidence rating that a post for example relates to a particular category.

In one aspect the extractor filter system executes one or more routines that receive as input a set of labelled data points and using one or more suitable classifiers which may be implemented as classification algorithms labels previously un seen data points into one of a plurality of classes. This allows the construction of a model that can be used to a qualify a new observation as a member of a particular class.

Various supervised learning algorithms exist that may be used for classification. Different algorithms have different properties and characteristics in terms of accuracy training time amount and type of data needed for learning efficiency in re training based on additional data and ability to fix mistakes.

In one aspect the extractor filter system includes a library of algorithms and the operator of the platform may test different algorithms selections with data sets to select one or more optimal algorithms and the algorithms that provide an advantageous result may be saved to a profile associated for example with a campaign or template.

A number of classification algorithms or classifiers may be suitable including for example the following Naive Bayes Support Vector Machines SVM Max Entropy Generalized Linear Models GLM Logistic Regression Decision Tree Random Forest and Probabilistic Graphical Models. Such algorithms classifiers may be used alone or in combination. Other algorithms classifiers apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art may also be used. In one example implementation using a Probabilistic Graphical Model the model includes Sum Products Networks as described in Sum Product Networks A New Deep Architecture Poon H. and Domingos P. in Proceedings of the 27th conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence UAI 2011 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. As will be appreciated including Sum Product Networks may improve classification speed.

In another aspect of the invention another aspect of testing the algorithms is nullifying the effect of a certain algorithm achieving a positive result on a particular data set by chance. This can be achieved using a process known as cross validation which may be carried out by using a subset of the data to train the algorithm and then evaluate it on the held out sample which was not used in training. This process may be repeated multiple times and then the results may be averaged. Use of cross validation for training the classifiers ensures that the results are statistically significant and that the classifiers are resistant to any bias from a particular training data set.

Another aspect of evaluating the accuracy of an algorithm for a particular data set or data set type is parameter tuning. Different algorithms have different parameters that can be compared to tuning knobs. The output accuracy of the algorithms varies based on how these parameters have been set. The parameters may be set empirically by trying different values and using values which yield the best result. In one aspect of the system parameter tuning is used to ensure that the best parameters for each algorithm are determined and the best accuracy is available.

Often in practice the combination of several algorithms results in better results than any single algorithm. This is because different algorithms are better suited for different aspects and using them in conjunction can allow benefiting from their strengths. This process is known as ensemble learning. The key in ensemble learning is to combine algorithms such that their combination increases the accuracy rather than decreasing it. In another possible aspect of the platform algorithms may be combined thereby applying ensemble learning.

While cross validation and parameter tuning can help in determining the best individual classifiers they may not be the best combination overall. Some sub optimal individual classifiers can provide better results when used in conjunction with one another.

In one aspect an alternating optimization algorithm may be implemented that provides a heuristic to perform the task of alternating the algorithms. The process may start by first individually tuning the parameters for each algorithm. Next the parameter tuning process for the first algorithm may be initiated but at this point the parameters are tuned to get the best overall result assuming the parameters of the other algorithms have already been fixed. Once the best setting for this algorithm is available this setting may be logged. The parameter tuning may then be repeated for the next algorithm. This process may be repeated in a loop till convergence is achieved or otherwise a certain time quota has been exhausted and the best setting of parameters is achieved within the allotted time.

Classification algorithms build models to quantify by using a set of features. A feature can be any variable that provides some information that can contribute to the classification process. A classification algorithm observes a labelled data point provided for training purposes by examining the values for all the features on that data point and then using this information to develop a model for future classification. If the features do not provide discriminative information between the classes the classification algorithm cannot provide good accuracy.

In certain problems features are naturally available and can be used as input to classification algorithms. In other domains it may be necessary to devise features that experts would consider as discriminative to assist the classification algorithm in making the correct choice. For text classification features can be words phrases synonyms or some other logical concepts such as names of competitors of a company description of a price other concepts relevant to a domain etc or otherwise any linguistic patterns. Linguistic information such as part of speech tagging provides help in disambiguating word sense when multiple meanings are possible for the same word.

In one aspect dictionary entries as well as features generated by domain experts may be used as a set of features that may be used as input to the classification algorithm.

In another aspect the classification algorithm may be adapted to process features for a variety of languages and or alphabets. In this way social media objects having text in such languages and or alphabets may be classified into appropriate categories. In some embodiments social media objects stored in repositories may be separated by language alphabet. In other embodiments social media objects in different languages alphabets but having related content may be stored in the same repository. Channels streams may be defined based on language alphabet and appropriate campaign personnel may be assigned to particular channels streams based on language alphabet.

If a lot of features are available the classification algorithm may not be able to scale. This problem may present in text classification because each and every word can be considered as a feature. In such cases it may be necessary to retain features that are actually discriminative and to discard features that do not provide any information that is helpful to the classification process. In this case feature selection techniques may be used to evaluate individual features and then the best subset of features is retained as input to the classification algorithm.

In one aspect of the invention the following techniques may be used for feature selection mutual information information gain Gini impurity odds ratio and Chi squared techniques for feature selection.

If the results of a classification algorithm are considered to be inadequate more training data or more features may be required. This trade off is generalized and referred to as the bias variance trade off. If the same classification algorithm with the same set of features has different accuracy using different sample training data in the cross validation process it is known to have a high variance. To reduce the variance either more data needs to be added or some features need to be removed. On the other hand if the classification algorithm consistently makes mistakes even on the previously seen training sample it is known to have a high bias. This typically means that the features currently being used by the algorithm are not adequate and more features need to be provided to the algorithm. More training data in this case will not be helpful. Generally there exists a trade off between bias and variance. It may not be possible to achieve good results for both bias and variance. These concepts may be used to determine next steps obtain more features or training data to improve the algorithm.

6. The accuracy of individual classifiers is determined and it is decided if ensemble learning is needed.

The feature generation processes may be performed once for a single domain and then reused among other clients. For each new client in that domain features specific to that named entity client would still be needed. This is because the name of this client may not otherwise have any relation to the specific domain under consideration and thus any relations of that client s name to unrelated concepts and objects would have to be removed by use of new features that allow the algorithm to filter them out.

In yet another aspect of the invention feedback relating to classification accuracy is used to continuously tune a classification algorithm. In particular algorithm results are sampled and then reviewed and graded. Reviewing and grading may be performed by a human operator. The sampled results and results of the associated reviewing grading are provided as feedback to the algorithm s model. The model parameters may then be updated based on the feedback. For example the confidence level in the inference of any given algorithm feature may be may be updated. In this way an algorithm s model may change over time e.g. updated in real time based on automatic machine learning from the feedback. Conveniently in this way classification algorithms may be continuously tuned to track normal shift and drift in language usage. For example the algorithms may keep in step with the emergence of new terms phrases memes hashtags etc. as is common place in social media.

In one aspect the analytics engine links to client data in order to generate a variety of customer insights. In one aspect the analytics engine calculates the likelihood that a particular customer will engage in an activity of interest such as sign up with Mobile Carrier A or move from Mobile Carrier A to Mobile Carrier B.

In one aspect the platform generates a list of at risk customers an presents relevant information for engaging with these customers through the platform .

In another aspect the web application provides an insights portal that provides categorized quantified and clickable insights regarding what customers are saying regarding clients and their competitors in regards to active campaigns. The insights portal may permit users to view data at multiple levels from aggregate to individual posts drill into topics time frames trends and post types and shows the number of views. As best shown in a possible embodiment of the insights portal is shown. Each of the screens of the insights portal may be presented to users operating end user devices in the form of one or more webpages.

In particular shows a screen that provides a summary view of the number of social media objects e.g. posts broken down by company and by topic e.g. pricing hardware customer service sales etc. Meanwhile shows a screen that provides a pie chart showing the relative proportion of objects by topic overlaid on the view provided by screen . Of course such forms for presenting data are exemplary only and other types of tables charts graphs graphics etc. may also be used. shows a screen that provides a window containing a drilled down view of a particular set of social media objects overlaid on the view provided by screen .

In another aspect the platform incorporates analytics tools that discover marketing communication trends. In one possible implementation the platform suggests possible action items for improving marketing communications by presenting recommended actions to the management portal.

It should be understood that the business systems may also include remote third party data sources such as for example LinkedIn Twitter and others wherein a workflow implemented by operation of the present invention may include a step of automatically retrieving relevant information from such external sources upon for example a user completing an associated workflow step.

Also the business or technology environment that produces the need for adoption of new workflows or updates to existing workflows can be very fluid. For example in a sales environment new insights are developed all the time regarding workflows that are effective in driving sales. Similarly the sales environment is fluid and therefore the desired best practices for sales personnel are subject to change. Also sales techniques need to reflect that what works for one sales person may not work for another. The changing composition of sales staff and because of this the evolving cultural demographic social and personality traits of the sales staff as a whole also requires adjustment of sales strategies and how these are applied in specific instances. All of these factors are examples of what contributes to a changing environment. To develop and update workflows that keep up with these changes is often impractical. The present invention solves this significant problem.

The system of the present invention may also include an analytics engine that is operable analyze data related to sales activities and apply analytics for example to define trends suggest best practices identify insights or trends identify in real time top sales persons determine sales strategies that work best for certain products or certain types of customers. Once these patterns are identified these can be integrated in sales activity monitoring enabled by the present invention for example a salesperson may be sent one or more notifications designed to alert the salesperson if they are diverging from a pattern that has been established as being optimal in certain circumstances. For example the analytics engine may analyze a target based on his her social media interactions and automatically suggest a tone or approach to engaging the target through social media such as APOLOGETIC LIGHT OFFER INCENTIVE and so on.

The analytics engine may implement various analytics applications and or analytical processes. The analytics engine may include a semantic analyzer for example for analyzing semantically for example text captured from various communications that are part of the social media interactions initiated using the social networking environment of the present invention. Access to the analytics engine may be controlled and managed by operation of the management utility .

The analytics engine may enable an administrator for example to construct and obtain answers to various queries or initiate the generation of various reports based on data output from the analytics engine .

The platform including based on operation of the analytics engine may provide business intelligence that can be segmented by local regional national and internationally.

The analytics engine may incorporate or be linked to sentiment analysis functions or features so as to monitor the mood of the sellers in terms of how they are feeling about the products or services of the enterprise.

The computer system of the present invention may be configured to implement various intelligent features. These intelligent features may utilize the analytics engine . Examples of such intelligent features are provided below.

 A Social media interactions with targets may be analyzed to determine various parameters that may be relevant to approaching the target in an effective manner. For example the computer system may determine the best mode of communication with a prospective target customer or customer perhaps by analyzing bursts of activity or inactivity.

 B The computer system may determine for example the current mood of a sales prospect for example by applying sentiment analysis to postings of a sales prospect captured from their social media feeds.

 C The computer system may develop over time a personality file demographic profile or psychographic profile for a sales prospect which may be used by the computer system in various workflows. The computer system may utilize for example learned observed and or evaluated personality traits.

 D The computer system may utilize the various intelligent features described above for example to dynamically suggest targeting. A system generated notification may also for example suggest a specific product or service that a prospect is most likely to be interested in including at a particular time. The computer system may also for example iteratively match a sales prospect with a particular sales agent to exploit for example a personality match. A variety of different user interfaces may be used to present this information such as for example hot buttons .

 E The computer system may analyze various available data sources. For example the computer system may link to one or more social media platforms in order to extract information concerning users who have LIKED particular products content or services but also the content associated with the social media interactions of a target to provide deeper analysis of the preferences or interests of a target. This information may be used for example to suggest a particular offer or incentive for marketing to the target.

 F The analytics engine may also apply one or more operations for generating insights based on extracted information. These may include semantic operations for example analysis of an article that a target has read weighting of content fuzzy logic operations artificial intelligence and so on. Also the platform may enable site behavior profiling e.g. click path analysis purchase patterns analysis collaborative filtering people who have behaved like you were more likely to perform some specified activity and keyword search of content.

The resulting automatically generated information may also be matched with information from other associated sales tools such as sales records notes opportunity stages.

The overall platform architecture and associated resources enable these new and innovative processes.

The operation of platform is further described with reference to the example workflow depicted in the flowchart of .

In particular at block social media data of interest are extracted by the extractor filter from social media objects from one or more social media networks or aggregators i.e. platforms . At this stage social media data may be extracted based on a low relevance threshold. At block the social media data of interest is stored into one or more data repositories . At block one or more classifying techniques are applied by the extractor filter to classify the social media data of interest according to pre defined categories. At block S the extractor filter identifies the social media objects relevant to an active campaign based on the classifications. At block the platform presents one or more of the identified social media objects to a user in a form adapted to facilitate user action on the presented social media objects see .

In one example a telecom client s customers were coaching one another on how to get less expensive deals by placing multiple calls into the call centre. The issue resulted from the high variability of offers that would be made by the client s customer retention agents.

The insights portal can deliver a number of insights to clients such as the number of social media posts on the topic to measure engagement the number of views of each post to gauge impact and verbatim insights into the number of calls that needed to be placed to achieve a better deal which acted as guidance to the market.

It is well known that calls to a call centre are relatively expensive and can cost around 7 per call. The management of engagement with customers and potential customers allows standardization among campaign personnel and identifying gaps in training.

In another example a carrier learned through the platform that the social web was viewing the carrier s offer of only one type of mobile device negatively and therefore customers were purchasing from a competitor. A business decision was made to offer multiple versions thereby capturing and optimizing sales that would otherwise have gone to competitors.

If customers say something positive about a brand the positive brand impression can be reinforced with a simple timely thank you or by providing an incentive.

A TV cable provider wanted to increase their customer base and generate increased revenues. The platform identified new opportunities for the client and allowed them to more effectively use social media in order to sell services to consumers interested in the clients solutions motivate consumers to consider a new provider and or express intent to leave a competitor.

Another client had received a downgrade from a major credit rating agency which was garnering unwelcome attention in both traditional and social media. The client was unsure about the best response to the situation. The client used the platform to in real time gauge public response and evolution of public response and take steps to mitigate reputational damage.

Various other computer system implementations are possible. Various client server mobile and cloud computing implementations are possible.

 Cloud computing includes Internet based computing where shared resources software and data are provided on demand. A cloud therefore can refer to a collection of resources e.g. hardware data and or software provided and maintained by an off site party e.g. third party wherein the collection of resources can be accessed by an identified user over a network. The resources can include data storage services word processing services and many other general purpose computation e.g. execution of arbitrary code and information technological services that are conventionally associated with personal computers or local servers.

As used in this application the terms component and system are intended to refer to a computer related entity either hardware a combination of hardware and software software or software in execution. For example a component can be but is not limited to being a process running on a processor a processor an object an executable a thread of execution a program and or a computer. By way of illustration both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and or thread of execution and a component can be localized on one computer and or distributed between two or more computers.

In general the concepts of virtual and cloud computing include the utilization of a set of shared computing resources e.g. servers which are typically consolidated in one or more data center locations. For example cloud computing systems may be implemented as a web service that enables a user to launch and manage computing resources e.g. virtual server instances in third party data centers. In a cloud environment computer resources may be available in different sizes and configurations so that different resource types can be specified to meet specific needs of different users. For example one user may desire to use small instance as a web server and another larger instance as a database server or an even larger instance for processor intensive applications. Cloud computing offers this type of outsourced flexibility without having to manage the purchase and operation of additional hardware resources within an organization.

A cloud based computing resource is thought to execute or reside somewhere on the cloud which may be an internal corporate network or the public Internet. From the perspective of an application developer or information technology administrator cloud computing enables the development and deployment of applications that exhibit scalability e.g. increase or decrease resource utilization as needed performance e.g. execute efficiently and fast and reliability e.g. never or at least rarely fail all without any regard for the nature or location of the underlying infrastructure.

A number of factors have given rise to an increase in the utilization of cloud computing resources. For example advances in networking technologies have significantly improved resource connectivity while decreasing connectivity costs. Advances in virtualization technologies have increased the efficiency of computing hardware by improving scalability and making it possible to more closely match computing hardware resources to the requirements of a particular computing task. Additionally virtualization technologies commonly deployed in cloud computing environments have improved application reliability by enabling failover policies and procedures that reduce disruption due to an application or hardware failure.
