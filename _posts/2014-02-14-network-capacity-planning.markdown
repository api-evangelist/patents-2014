Any and all applications for which a foreign or domestic priority claim is identified in the Application Data Sheet as filed with the present application are incorporated by reference under 37 CFR 1.57 and made a part of this specification.

Generally described computing devices utilize a communication network or a series of communication networks to exchange data. Companies and organizations operate computer networks that interconnect a number of computing devices to support operations or provide services to third parties. The computing systems can be located in a single geographic location or located in multiple distinct geographic locations e.g. interconnected via private or public communication networks . Specifically data centers or data processing centers herein generally referred to as a data center may include a number of interconnected computing systems to provide computing resources to users of the data center. The data centers may be private data centers operated on behalf of an organization or public data centers operated on behalf or for the benefit of the general public.

For organizations providing data center functionality or organizations utilizing data functionality such as in commerce applications network capacity for facilitating the exchange of data can be a key concern. In some situations the ordering and implementation of network equipment can require months of lead time and significant capital investments. Accordingly in one approach communication network providers may make advanced investments in equipment and processes that require a longer lead time or in the event of an order backlog. However advanced investments in equipment can be inefficient and result in overbuilding or overproduction of network capacity. In another approach communication network providers can manually estimate network equipment capacity or utilization and project network equipment needs.

Generally described the present disclosure relates to network capacity modeling and data processing. More specifically aspects of the present disclosure relate to the modeling of network data link or path load estimates for a network corresponding to a set of nodes interconnected via point to point network paths. Additional aspects of the present disclosure relate to the modeling of routing of data packets between one or more network nodes and responsive to a set of failure scenarios. Still further aspects of the present disclosure relate to the generation of a set of processing results based on applying the set of modeled failure scenarios to the model of network data demand estimates. Finally aspects of the present disclosure relate to the utilization of the network data demand estimates models of failure scenarios and set of processing results for network capacity planning or contingency planning. Although aspects of the present disclosure will be described with regard to illustrative network models and communication paths capacity measurements user displays and processing results one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the disclosed embodiments are illustrative in nature and should not be construed as limiting.

With reference to an illustrative environment for network capacity management system is provided. The network capacity management system includes a network capacity processing system . Illustratively the network capacity processing system can obtain network capacity demand data for an identified communication network or portion of a network. The identified communication network or portion thereof can be illustratively modeled as a collection of network nodes and point to point network paths. The network capacity demand data can be observed or measured in accordance with utilization of the communication network. Additionally at least some portion of the network capacity demand data can be constructed based on processing measured data inputs. Illustratively the network capacity demand data corresponds to data between the identified network nodes of the communication network. Using the network capacity demand data as input the network capacity processing system can generate estimates of loads on network paths or links between the network nodes.

The network capacity processing system also obtains or determines failure scenarios for a network capacity model and generates failure matrices corresponding to an anticipated or modeled result of the failure scenario on the point to point network paths in the modeled network. Still further the network capacity processing system processes the network capacity demand data with the generated set of failure scenarios to generate or identify the anticipated result of projected network load on the network paths between network nodes e.g. the link or load path in each of the network failure scenarios. Finally the network capacity processing system can further process the anticipated result of network capacity to facilitate network capacity planning.

Illustratively the network capacity processing system can include an interface component and a capacity processing component alone or in combination to facilitate one or more of the above identified functions of the network capacity processing system . Additionally although the network capacity processing system is illustrated as a single system or component of the network capacity management system one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the network capacity processing system can be implemented by any number of computing devices or hardware components. Still further the network capacity processing system can be implemented as service or functionality that is implemented or invoked by utilization of application programming interfaces APIs or other communication protocols utilized in conjunction with a communication network such as the Internet private networks and the like. Although the network capacity processing system relates to the processing of network capacity of a target communication network or portion thereof the network capacity processing system does not need to be in direct communication with the target communication network nor have access either directly or indirectly with the target communication network. Accordingly a target communication network may include a number of other computing device and network components and is not represented in .

In one embodiment the network capacity processing system may be in communication with a number of computing devices to facilitate interaction or processing of network capacity information. In one aspect the network capacity processing system may be in communication with one or more communication network providers . The communication network provider may provide direct access to target communication networks or provide information related to a target communication networks. The communication network provider can also provide interfaces between a network administrator associated with a target communication network and the network capacity processing system . The network capacity management system can also include one or more client computing devices that provide information to the network capacity processing system or obtain information network capacity processing system but that may not be directly associated with or provided by a target communication network.

One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the network capacity processing system communication network communication network provider and client computing devices may be configured in a variety of ways and may be dependent on specific function and role of the network capacity processing system . Such different or alternative configurations should be considered to be within the scope of the present disclosures. Still further although the components of the network capacity management system have been generally referred to as systems components or devices one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the implementation of any referenced system component or device may include necessary hardware such a processing units memory buses network components etc. and could incorporate additional software applications or network protocols to achieve the described function.

With reference now to an illustrative network capacity planning and failure analysis process for a target communication network will be described. One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the disclosed target communication network model network demand information anticipated routing predictions and failure scenarios are merely illustrative in nature and should not be construed as limiting. With reference to an illustrative model of a target communication network includes a number of network nodes and . The nodes are in communication via directional based point to point network paths and . As illustrated in each network node has a point to point network path to the other nodes in the target communication network. However a target communication network and its corresponding network model may include single directional point to point network paths. Additionally a target communication network and its corresponding network model may be made up of a larger number of network nodes in which at least some of the network nodes do not have any point to point network paths between them. Still further one or more network nodes may have more than one point to point network path to another network node in the communication network. Additionally although the point to point network paths are considered to be direct between nodes one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that various networking devices may be utilized and implemented between the network nodes to facilitate the identified network paths. Still further one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that although one or more network paths may exist between network nodes the load experienced at each network path may not be equally distributed and some network paths may not experience any load.

With reference to FIGS. B and B in an illustrative embodiment the network capacity processing system obtains or measures demand related to the exchange of data e.g. data packets between the network nodes along the identified point to point network paths . The demand information may correspond to real time demand information partial real time demand information extrapolated information or statistically processed information. Still further demand information may correspond to estimated demand in accordance with projected business cases. Illustratively the demand information may be represented in terms of a variety of units of measurement. As illustrated in FIG. B a table includes a series of rows and columns that form a matrix of the measured demand or load information between pairs of nodes in the model . In some embodiments the table may be populated with default values or normalized values for demand between any two identified nodes in the model. The default or normalized values may be updated with actual measured values replaced with actual measured values or replaced with forecasted future values.

With reference now to FIG. B using the demand FIG. B as an input a table of the modeled link load or network load can be generated. Illustratively demand may be considered static for purposes of the modeling of various effects on various failure scenarios. Table includes entries and for each identifiable link in the modeled network that identify the modeled load for a respective link based on the demand. Illustratively table corresponds to the modeled load based on a non failure scenario. Accordingly the modeled load for each network path is similar to a respective entry in the demand table . However the modeled load does not have to equate to demand even in non failure scenarios.

Turning now to in aspect of the present disclosure the network capacity processing system can generate a series of failure scenarios for the modeled target communication network. For example a set of failure scenarios can correspond to the anticipated effect of the failure of each of the one or more of the point to point network paths the failure of the point to point network paths between two networks nodes the failure of groupings of point to point network paths and combinations thereof. Illustratively the anticipated failure scenario is based on the modeled network utilizing communication routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First OSPF in which the routing of data packets between nodes along point to point network paths is independent of the current demand at the node. However in other embodiments the anticipated failure scenario can be based on the modeled network utilizing a communication routing protocol in which routing decisions are based at least in part on traffic awareness or traffic reservation.

In an illustrative embodiment the anticipated failure scenario can be represented as a set of matrices in which each matrix in the set of matrices is reflective of the data packet routing effects that will likely be experienced along one or more of the point to point network paths. As will be described in greater detail below the set of matrices can be applied to the previously determined demand information as illustrated in FIG. B for the target communication network. The result of such an application can correspond to the generation of a new table of estimates reflective of the anticipated load at one or more of the point to point network paths in the event of the specified failure modeled in the failure scenario. The process is then repeated for each failure scenario in the set of failure scenario.

With reference to assume one of the failure scenarios in an illustrative set of failure scenarios corresponds to the failure of the point to point network path and point to point network path both of which represent a respective directional network path between node A and node B . Additionally assume that based on the routing protocol implemented in the model network the anticipated effect of a failure along path in the modeled failure would result in the diversion of data traffic along path which is between node and node and path which is between node and . Additionally assume that the anticipated effect of a failure of path would result in the diversion of data traffic along path which is between node and node and path which is between node and .

In an illustrative embodiment a series of matrices for modeling the anticipated routing results at the plurality of network nodes and point to point network paths in the network model . The series of matrices include a matrix for each point to point network path in the network model . Each matrix is populated with proportional amount of the estimated demand that may be experienced by corresponding point to point network path which may or may be equally distributed. The values in each of the matrices can be represented as a range of numerical values representative of a percentage or proportion of the previously estimated traffic demand that would be experienced at the path based on the modeled failure. For example a range of values can be from 0 to 1 in which the sum of all the values across the set of matrices for a failure scenario correspond to a value of less than or equal to one.

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link A C. Illustratively all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node A and node B . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link A B in FIG. B. Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node A and node C FIG. B .

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link C B. In a similar manner all of inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 e.g. a value of 1 of the data traffic demand attributed between node A and node B . Similar to matrix this demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link A B in FIG. B. Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic previously demand attributed between node C and node B FIG. B .

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link B C. In a similar manner all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 e.g. a value of 1 of the data traffic demand attributed between node B and node A . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link B A FIG. B . Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node B and node C .

Finally with reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link C A. In a similar manner all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 e.g. a value of 1 of the data traffic demand attributed between node B and node A . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link B A FIG. B . Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would receive 100 of the data traffic previously demand attributed between node C and node A .

With reference to illustratively the capacity processing component applies matrices FIGS. D D to the demand estimates FIG. B to generate a new table of network path load for the modeled network . In this embodiment capacity processing component generates a sum of the application of the matrices to generate the anticipated effect of routing results based on the modeled failure table . As illustrated in each network path that would be anticipated to receive an increase or decrease is identified. Specifically table includes entries and for each identifiable link in the modeled network that identify the modeled load for a respective link based on the demand. Accordingly the modeled load for each network path illustrates the anticipated effect on the previously modeled load on the network paths as illustrated in table FIG. B and responsive to the failure scenario.

With reference now to another illustrative network capacity planning and failure analysis process for a target communication network will be described. One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that the disclosed target communication network model capacity information and failure predictions are merely illustrative in nature and should not be construed as limiting. With reference to an illustrative model of a target communication network includes a number of network nodes and . The nodes are in communication via directional based point to point network paths and . As illustrated in most of the network nodes have a point to point network path to the other nodes in the target communication network with the exception of node to node . However a target communication network and its corresponding network model may include single directional point to point network paths. Additionally a target communication network and its corresponding network model may be made up of a larger number of network nodes in which at least some of the network nodes do not have any point to point network paths. Still further although the point to point network paths are considered to be direct between nodes one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that various networking devices may be utilized and implemented between the network nodes to facilitate the identified network paths. As previously discussed although a network path or point to point link may exist between nodes one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that traffic may not be routed along each possible path or that a disproportionate amount of traffic may be routed along a single point to point link for various reasons such as a lower capacity of the point to point link.

With reference to FIGS. B and B in an illustrative embodiment the network capacity processing system obtains or measures demand related to the exchange of data e.g. data packets between the network nodes and along the identified point to point network paths . The demand information may correspond to real time demand information partial real time demand information extrapolated information or statistically processed information. As previously described demand information may correspond to estimated demand in accordance with projected business cases. Illustratively the demand information may be represented in terms of a variety of units of measurement. As illustrated in FIG. B a table includes a series of rows and and columns and that form a matrix of the measure demand for between the nodes in the model . In some embodiments the table may be populated with default values or normalized values for demand between any two identified nodes in the model. The default or normalized values may be updated with actual measured values replaced with actual measured values or replaced with forecasted future values. Additionally the table can identify demand and between nodes such as node E and node F even though the network model does not include a direct point to point path between the nodes.

With reference now to FIG. B using the demand FIG. B as an input a table of the modeled link load or network load can be generated. Illustratively demand may be considered static for purposes of the modeling various effects on various failure scenarios. Table includes entries for each identifiable link in the modeled network that identify the modeled load for a respective link based on the demand. Illustratively table corresponds to the modeled load based on a non failure scenario. Accordingly the modeled load for each network path is similar to a respective entry in the demand table . Additionally at least some portion of the load estimated for some network paths incorporates demand attributed between node F and node E since no direct network path exists between these two nodes. As described above the modeled load does not have to equate to demand even in non failure scenarios.

With reference to and similar to assume for one of the failure scenarios in an illustrative set of failure scenarios corresponds to the failure of the point to point network path and point to point network path both of which represent a respective directional path between node A and node B . Additionally assume that the anticipated effect of such of the failure would result in the diversion of different percentages of the data traffic originally estimated for either path or path . As previously discussed the anticipated effect of a failure scenario can be modeled as a set of matrices in which each matrix is populated with a proportional amount of the demand information on the assumption that one or more network paths or other criteria is no longer available.

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link G E. Illustratively all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . Similar to the matrices of FIGS. D D values in the matrix can be represented as a range of numerical values representative of a percentage or proportion of the previously estimated data traffic that would be experienced at the path based on the modeled failure. As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node D and node E . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link D E in FIG. B. The matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node F and node E . 50 of this demand was previously carried by point to point network path and 50 of this demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link D E in FIG. B. Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic previously demand attributed between node G and node E FIG. B .

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link E G. In a similar manner all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG.

In a similar manner all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG. D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 30 e.g. a value of 0.3 of the data traffic demand attributed between node E and node D . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link E D FIG. B . Illustratively the diversion of the percentage of traffic between paths and can be attributed to the modeled routing protocol or various configurations that can be applied in accordance with the modeled routing protocol. The matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node E and node F . 50 of this demand was previously carried by point to point network path and 50 of this demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link E D in FIG. B. Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node G and node F .

With reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link G D. In a similar manner all of the inter node traffic demands in the model network are illustrated as a cell in the matrix . As illustrated in FIG.

This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link E D. As described above the diversion of the percentage of traffic between paths and can be attributed to the modeled routing protocol or various configurations that can be applied in accordance with the modeled routing protocol. Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic previously demand attributed between node G and node D FIG. B .

D the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 50 e.g. a value of 0.5 of the data traffic demand attributed between node D and node E . This demand was previously attributed to point to point network path link D E FIG. B .

Additionally the matrix indicates at cell that the point to point network path would likely receive 100 of the data traffic demand attributed between node F and node D FIG. B .

Finally with reference to FIG. D a matrix can be generated that models the effect of data routing for the specified failure scenario for path link F G.

With reference to illustratively the capacity processing component applies matrices and FIGS. D D to the demand estimates FIG. B to generate a new table of estimated network path load for the modeled network . In this embodiment capacity processing component generates a sum of the application of the matrices and to generate the anticipated effect of routing results based on the modeled failure table . As illustrated in each network path that would be anticipated to receive an increase or decrease is identified. Specifically table includes entries and for each identifiable link in the modeled network that identify the modeled load for a respective link based on the demand. Accordingly the modeled load for each network path illustrates the anticipated effect on the previously modeled load in table FIG. B responsive to the failure scenario.

In alternative embodiments of the resulting updated matrices of the demand can also be represented as a percentage of known capacity of the network node point to point network path. Additionally the resulting value can be compared to threshold levels or percentages labeled illustrated with the applied label or category. For example a point to point network path may be colored in accordance with a determination of whether the anticipated demand would be below meet or exceed thresholds or limits. Additionally the demand can be expressed in terms of demand below a threshold e.g. a number of units until the demand meets a threshold or demand above a threshold e.g. a number of units that exceed a threshold . Illustratively the network capacity processing system can incorporate standard thresholds or capacities for all nodes. Alternatively the network capacity processing system can incorporate custom thresholds configured specifically for the networking and computing equipment at each node or based on configuration information provided by the target communication network administrator.

Turning now to a routine for processing network demand data according to failure scenarios implemented by the network capacity processing system will be described. At block the network capacity processing system obtains or determines demand estimates between network nodes generally referred to as demand information for a model target communication network. As previously described the demand information may correspond to real time demand information partial real time demand information extrapolated information statistically processed information estimated demand in accordance with projected business cases and made be represented in terms of any unit of measurement. In some embodiments the demand information may be populated with default values or normalized values based on the configuration of the model target communication network similar communication networks or generically applicable information. The default or normalized values may be updated with actual measured values or replaced with actual measured values in a real time or substantially real time basis. Illustrative tables identifying initial demand and load estimates were described with regard to FIGS. B and B and FIGS. B and B.

At block the network capacity processing system identifies as set of failure scenarios to be applied to the model target communication network. In one embodiment the set of failure scenarios can include failure scenarios for a failure of each point to point network path in the modeled target communication network. In other embodiments the set of failure scenarios can include failure scenarios for failure of multiple point to point network paths in the modeled target communication network. For example the network capacity processing system may model the failure of both bi directional network paths between two nodes as illustrated generally in . In another example the network capacity processing system may model the failure of a grouping of directional network paths based on a variety of grouping or organizational criteria. In further embodiment the set of failure scenarios can include failure scenarios for failure of network nodes and any point to point communication paths attached to the failed node s . In still further embodiment the failure scenarios can include the addition of new point to point network paths between network nodes which can still be generally considered to a failure scenario for purposes of modeling the anticipated routing results. In still another embodiment the set of failure scenarios can include various iterations of a modeled failure in which one or more weights or inputs that may influence the packet routing protocols are modified. In this embodiment each separate modification configuration can be considered a failure scenario in the set of failure scenarios. Alternatively a set of failure scenarios may be repeated e.g. the modeling of a failure of multiple network paths for each modification configuration. Additional or alternative failure scenarios may also be included.

At block the network capacity processing system determines a set of failure matrices for each failure scenario in the set of failure scenarios. As previously described each matrix in the set of matrices is reflective of the data packet routing effects that will be experienced along one or more of the point to point network paths. As previously described the anticipated failure scenario can be based on communication routing protocols in which the routing of data packets between nodes along point to point network paths is independent of the current demand at the node. The resulting values in each cell of a respective matrix can correspond to the anticipated proportional effect of the demand at the network path in view of the modeled failure scenario. Illustratively the values in the various cells of each respective matrix are defined as a range of numerical values from zero to one in which the sum of all the values for any given demand across the set of failure matrices correspond to a value of less than or equal to one. Alternatively the system may model some loss in demand traffic such as due to packet drops or a failure of data integrity or failures that remove some portion of the systems that generate demand. In such embodiments the sum of the range of values in the cells of the matrices may be less than one. Illustratively the generation of the set of matrices in block may be automated.

At block the network capacity processing system calculates the expected load between each of the network nodes in the modeled communication network for each of the failure scenarios in the set of failure scenarios. As illustrated in the network capacity processing system can apply the set of failure matrices to the demand information to generate a new table of expected load. The application of the set of matrices to the demand information may be done automatically or semi automatically by the network capacity processing system .

At block the network capacity processing system processes the set of updated link load projections. In one aspect the network capacity processing system can identify the busiest point to point network path across the multiple failure scenarios. In another aspect the network capacity processing system can identify the failure scenario that generated the largest increase in load for any network path or in which the capacity of any network path will be exceeded. In still a further aspect the network capacity processing system can generate various user interfaces that graphically illustrate the results of at least a portion of set of updated matrices. For example the network capacity processing system can generate or causes to be generated various graphical representations of model target communication network that identify the results of the processing in terms of color shape identifiers or other labels. The network capacity processing system can also generate various animations in which the changes to load information for one or more paths are animated on a screen display to illustrate various failure scenarios or to illustrate a time based progression of load information.

In still another aspect the network capacity processing system can generate notifications or communications such as request for proposals bids purchase orders that include specifications e.g. demand capacities identified in the set of update matrices. For example the network capacity processing system can identify a minimum capacity for network nodes or point to point network paths to ensure a minimal level of service. The minimum capacity information can be further provided in a form or notification to facilitate ordering of additional equipment. In another example the network capacity processing system can initiate at least in part the ordering process automatically. In still another example the network capacity processing system can integrate with calendaring functionality for scheduling ordering of network components. In still a further aspect the network capacity processing system can attribute probabilities of exceeded capacity of any node or point to point network path based on the set update matrices. Additional or alternative processing may also be incorporated.

At decision block a test is conducted to determine whether the network capacity processing system will repeat the modeling of the set of failure scenarios according to a different demand estimate or network configurations for the network equipment or routing protocols of the model target communication network. As described above the network capacity processing system can model a set of failure scenarios based on varying demand information. Additionally the network capacity processing system can model a set of failure scenarios based on varying configurations of the network routing protocols or network equipment in the model communication network. Accordingly if the network capacity processing system is to modify the demand estimates or network routing configurations at decision block the appropriate modifications are made at block and the routine returns to block . Alternatively if the network capacity processing system does not need to modify the demand estimates or network routing configurations at decision block the routine terminates at block .

With reference to an illustrative screen display corresponding to the illustration of processing of failure scenarios on a model target communication network. One skilled in the relevant art will appreciate however that the processing of failure scenarios can corresponds to the generation of numerous screen displays and interfaces. Accordingly the screen display is illustrative of various types of information that may be generated on a computing device collectively or individually. Still further although the screen display illustrates various combinations or groupings of information one skilled in the relevant art will appreciate that alternative combinations or groupings may also be incorporated into a screen display.

As illustrated in the screen display can include a number of graphical representations of the target communication network or portions thereof . The graphical representations may include one or more categories that identify whether the anticipated load based on demand information can be processed or if one or more of the predicted failures will exceed predicted limits or thresholds for one or more the network paths. The graphical representations can also include labels that identify the total anticipated demand on a network node or point to point network path the percentage of utilization calculated as the quotient of the total anticipated demand on a network node or point to point network path and the predicted limits of the respective network node or point to point network path such as illustrated in graphical representation and . The graphical representations can also include color coding graphics or labels reflective of the anticipated total use percentage of utilization remaining capacity or exceed capacity such as illustrated in graphical representation . The graphical representations can also identify anticipated additional failures or exceeded capacities such as illustrated in graphical representation . As previously discussed a graphical representation may be animated to demonstrate changes in load or multiple graphical representations may be utilized to illustrate various stages of utilization of the model target communication network or to illustrate specific failure scenarios.

The screen display can further include a number of additional controls or displays that provide information associated with one or more of the processed failure scenarios such as the busiest point to point network path or largest failure . In one embodiment the controls may be used to elicit additional processing by the network capacity processing system . In other embodiments the controls may request additional inputs or configurations by a user. In still further embodiments the displays may correspond to previously selected or configured information. In another embodiment the screen display can further include a minimum link size table that identifies minimum size of each point to point network path required to accommodate for an identified failure scenario or set of failure scenarios or the projected future link sizes required to accommodate forecasted demand generally at .
