title: System and method for analyzing and imaging three-dimensional volume data sets using a three-dimensional sampling probe
abstract: System and method for analyzing and imaging three-dimensional volume data sets using a three-dimensional sampling probe. A number of sampling probes can be created, shaped, and moved interactively by the user within the whole three-dimensional volume data set. As the sampling probe changes shape, size, or location in response to user input, the image is re-drawn at a rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real-time by the user. In this manner, the user can more easily and effectively visualize and interpret the features and physical parameters that are inherent in the three-dimensional volume data set.

The present invention relates generally to imaging of three dimensional 3D volume data sets. More particularly the present invention relates to fast visualization and analysis of very large 3D volume data sets using 3D computer graphics.

Many fields of endeavor require the analysis and imaging of three dimensional 3D volume data sets. For example in the medical field a CAT computerized axial tomography scanner or a magnetic resonance imaging MRI device is used to produce a picture or diagnostic image of some part of a patient s body. The scanner or MRI device generates a 3D volume data set that needs to be imaged or displayed so that medical personnel can analyze the image and form a diagnosis.

Three dimensional volume data sets are also used in various fields of endeavor relating to the earth sciences. Seismic sounding is one method for exploring the subsurface geology of the earth. An underground explosion or earthquake excites seismic waves similar to low frequency sound waves that travel below the surface of earth and are detected by seismographs. The seismographs record the time of arrival of the seismic waves both direct and reflected waves. Knowing the time and place of the explosion or earthquake the time of travel of the waves through the interior can be calculated and used to measure the velocity of the waves in the interior. A similar technique can be used for offshore oil and gas exploration. In offshore exploration a ship tows a sound source and underwater hydrophones. Low frequency e.g. 50 Hz sound waves are generated by for example a pneumatic device that works like a balloon burst. The sounds bounce off rock layers below the sea floor and are picked up by the hydrophones. In this manner subsurface sedimentary structures that trap oil such as faults folds and domes are mapped by the reflected waves. The data is processed to produce volume data sets that include a reflection or seismic amplitude data value at specified x y z locations within a geographic space.

A 3D volume data set is made up of voxels or volume elements. Each voxel has a numeric value for some measured or calculated property e.g. seismic amplitude of the volume at that location. One conventional approach to generating an image of a 3D volume data set is to cross section the 3D volume data set into a plurality of two dimensional 2D cross sections or slices. The image of the 3D volume data set is then built as a composite of the 2D slices. For example the image of the 3D volume data set is generated by stacking the 2D slices in order back to front and then composited into a complete image. The user sees the image being built layer by layer as the composite grows. Although the user can see the internal organization or structure of the volume as the composite image grows the traditional slice and composite technique is typically slow particularly when very large 3D volume data sets are being used. Additionally the slice and composite technique clutters the user s field of view with extraneous information and interferes with the user s ability to accurately visualize and interpret features inherent in the 3D volume data set.

Computer software has been developed specifically for imaging 3D seismic data sets for the oil and gas industry. Examples of such conventional computer programs include VoxelGeo available from Paradigm Geophysical Houston Tex. SeisWorks and EarthCube available from Landmark Graphics Corporation and IESX available from GeoQuest. Such conventional computer programs have numerous deficiencies that preclude a user from quickly and accurately visualizing and interpreting features inherent in a 3D seismic data set. Conventional computer programs for visualizing and interpreting 3D seismic data operate on the full 3D volume of seismic data. Consequently every time a change is made such as a change to the transparency or opacity settings the full 3D volume of seismic data must be processed and the image redrawn. Even when such programs are run on highly efficient graphics supercomputers the delay or lag in re drawing the image is perceptible to the user. For a 3D volume containing 500 megabytes of seismic data it can take on the order of 30 45 seconds for conventional programs to re draw the complete image frame rate of 0.03 to 0.02 frames per second respectively . During the 30 45 second delay time the mind of the user loses focus on the feature of interest making it difficult to completely and properly analyze the seismic data.

Some conventional 3D seismic interpretation programs provide the capability to visualize and interpret a piece of the full 3D volume of seismic data. The user identifies the coordinates of the selected piece via a menu command. An image of the selected piece is drawn. The selected piece can then be rotated if desired at that location. However to look at a different piece of the full 3D volume of seismic data such as to follow a geologic feature that has been tentatively identified the image must be interrupted a new location or coordinates for the different piece is entered and a new image is drawn containing the different piece. The interruption in the displayed image makes it difficult for the user to visualize any continuity between the two pieces of the full 3D volume of seismic data that have been imaged. This impedes the user s ability to interpret and identify the geologic features that are inherent in the full 3D volume of seismic data. Additionally even though only a piece of the full 3D volume of seismic data is being visibly displayed conventional 3D seismic interpretation programs continue processing the full 3D volume of seismic data to draw the image thereby slowing the display of the image to the user.

Conventional 3D seismic interpretation programs provide the capability to auto pick and identify points that satisfy a voxel selection algorithm. However these programs typically iterate through the full 3D volume of seismic data to identify the points that satisfy the voxel selection algorithm. This is time consuming even on a high speed graphics supercomputer. Additionally conventional 3D seismic interpretation programs do not provide the capability to directly delete from the collection of picked voxels. The only way to eliminate points from the collection of picked voxels using conventional 3D seismic interpretation programs is to repeatedly adjust the selection criteria for the voxel selection algorithm until the points to be eliminated fall outside of the selection criteria for the displayed points that satisfy the voxel selection algorithm. Each time the selection criteria is adjusted the image must be interrupted. This iterative process is time consuming and interferes with the visualization process of the user.

Thus there is a need in the art for a system and method for imaging 3D volume data sets that overcomes the deficiencies detailed above. Particularly there is a need for a system and method that re draws images of large 3D volume data sets in response to user input at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives an instantaneous or real time change in the image without perceptible delay or lag. There is a need for a system and method that allows a user to interactively change the displayed image in a continuous manner without interruption or perceptible delay or lag. Such a system and method would allow a user to more quickly and accurately interpret and identify features inherent in 3D volume data sets.

The present invention is directed to a system and method for analyzing and imaging 3D volume data sets using a 3D sampling probe. In one aspect of the invention a program storage device is provided. The program storage device is readable by a machine and tangibly embodies a program of instructions executable by the machine to perform method steps of imaging a 3D volume defined by a data set of voxels each voxel expressed in the form of x y z data value . The method steps comprise the following steps 

In a further aspect of the invention the method steps further comprise identifying a seed point that is within a data set of voxels that defines an auto picking 3D sampling probe and defining a selection criteria based on data values. Points connected to the seed point that have data values satisfying the selection criteria are identified as selected points. As the auto picking 3D sampling probe moves through the 3D volume the image of the auto picking 3D sampling probe contains selected points within the auto picking 3D sampling probe sub volume and the image is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

In yet a further aspect of the invention the method steps further comprise defining an eraser 3D sampling probe and defining a de selection criteria based on data values. Points previously selected by an auto picking operation that satisfy the de selection criteria are identified as candidates for de selection. As the eraser 3D sampling probe moves through the 3D volume the de selected points are deleted from the image and the image is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

In still a further aspect of the present invention a method is provided for imaging a three dimensional 3D data volume representing a geographic space for visualization and interpretation of physical parameters of the geographic space by a user wherein the 3D data volume is defined by a data set of voxels each voxel expressed in the form of x y z data value the method comprising 

In still a further aspect of the invention a computer program product is provided that comprises a computer useable medium having computer program logic recorded thereon for enabling a processor in a computer system to image a three dimensional 3D seismic data volume for visualization and interpretation of geologic features by a user the 3D seismic data volume being defined by a data set of voxels each voxel expressed in the form of x y z seismic amplitude . The computer program product comprises probe creating means for enabling the processor to create one or more three dimensional 3D sampling probe s each 3D sampling probe being a sub volume of the 3D seismic data volume image drawing means for enabling the processor to draw an image of the 3D sampling probe s for display to a user the image comprising an intersection of the 3D sampling probe s and the 3D seismic data volume and drawing repeating means for enabling the processor to repeatedly draw responsive to input from the user to move a location of the 3D sampling probe s within the 3D seismic data volume so that as the 3D sampling probe s moves through the 3D seismic data volume the image of the 3D sampling probe s is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user thereby enabling the user to visualize and interpret geologic features.

In yet a further aspect of the invention a system is provided for imaging a three dimensional 3D seismic data volume for visualization and interpretation of geologic features by a user the 3D seismic data volume being defined by a data set of voxels each voxel expressed in the form of x y z seismic amplitude . The system comprises means for creating one or more three dimensional 3D sampling probe s each 3D sampling probe being a sub volume of the 3D seismic data volume image drawing means for drawing an image of the 3D sampling probe s for display to a user the image comprising an intersection of the 3D sampling probe s and the 3D seismic data volume and drawing repeating means for repeatedly drawing the image of the 3D sampling probe s responsive to input from the user to move a location of the 3D sampling probe s within the 3D seismic data volume so that as the 3D sampling probe s moves through the 3D seismic data volume the image of the 3D sampling probe s is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user thereby enabling the user to visualize and interpret geologic features.

It is a feature of the present invention that as a user interactively moves a 3D sampling probe through a 3D volume data set the image on the surfaces of the 3D sampling probe is redrawn on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with movement of the 3D sampling probe. Similarly as a user interactively moves a 3D sampling probe through a 3D volume data set the 3D sampling probe is volume rendered with varying degrees of transparency on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with movement of the 3D sampling probe.

It is a further feature of the present invention that a user can interactively change the shape or size of a 3D sampling probe so that the image on the surfaces of the 3D sampling probe is re drawn on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with the change in shape or size of the 3D sampling probe. Similarly a user can interactively change the shape or size of a 3D sampling probe so that the 3D sampling probe is volume rendered with varying degrees of transparency on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with the change in shape or size of the 3D sampling probe.

It is yet a further feature of the present invention that a user can interactively rotate a 3D sampling probe so that the image on the surfaces of the 3D sampling probe is re drawn on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with the rotation of the 3D sampling probe. Similarly a user can interactively rotate a 3D sampling probe so that the 3D sampling probe is volume rendered with varying degrees of transparency on the fly so that the user perceives the image changing in real time with the rotation of the 3D sampling probe.

It is yet a further feature of the present invention that an eraser 3D sampling probe can be created and manipulated by the user to directly delete from an image selected points that fall within a certain data value range.

It is an advantage of the present invention that a user can manipulate a 3D sampling probe to interactively traverse a 3D volume data set to continuously follow and image a feature.

It is a further advantage of the present invention that a user can interactively change the displayed image in a continuous manner without interruption or perceptible delay or lag. This allows a user to more quickly and accurately interpret and identify features inherent in 3D volume data sets.

It is yet a further advantage of the present invention that the 3D sampling probes can be interactively re shaped by the user to match the shape of geologic features thereby enabling the user to better visualize and define the extent of geologic features.

A still further advantage of the present invention is that it can be used to visualize and interpret large volumes of 3D seismic data. The present invention can be used to quickly and accurately identify drillings sites. The present invention can advantageously be used to sharply reduce 3D seismic project cycle times to boost production from existing wells and to locate additional reserves.

The present invention is directed to a system and method for analyzing and imaging three dimensional 3D volume data sets using a 3D sampling probe. 3D volume data sets comprise voxels or volume elements. Each voxel is a sample or point within a volume. Each voxel can be expressed in the form x y z data value where x y z identifies the 3D location of the point within the volume and data value is the value of some measured or calculated attribute or physical parameter at the specified point within the volume. For example a 3D volume data set suitable for use with the present invention is 3D seismic data. Each voxel in a 3D seismic data can be expressed as x y z amplitude with amplitude corresponding to the amplitude of reflected sound waves at the specified x y z location.

Any form of information that can be expressed in the voxel form x y z data value is suitable for use with the present invention. In addition to seismic data examples from the oil and gas industry include information from closely spaced well logs gravity and magnetic fields remote sensing data and sidescan sonar image data. Other geologic or physical information could also include temperature pressure saturation reflectivity acoustical impedance and velocity.

Another application for the present invention is for mining. For example the present invention can be used to visualize and interpret geologic and geophysical data to locate mining sites to locate and track deposits to be mined or to locate and track geologic features such as faults that would affect mining operations. The present invention also has application for cleanup of toxic hazardous or other types of waste. For example the present invention can be used to visualize and interpret data representing the geographic extent and distribution of the waste at a particular site. Such visualization and interpretation is useful for prioritizing clean up at various sites and for developing a clean up plan for a particular site.

The present invention can also be used with information outside of the oil and gas industry. For example the present invention can be used for analyzing and imaging in the medical field where the data value element of the voxel is obtained from a CAT computerized axial tomography scanner or a magnetic resonance imaging MRI procedure.

By way of explanation and example the present invention will be described in detail below using 3D seismic data as the 3D volume data set. It is to be understood however that the present invention is not limited in any way to use of 3D seismic data.

The present invention is particularly useful as a visualization tool for interpreting 3D seismic data. As used herein the term visualization refers to the construction of a three dimensional picture in the user s mind of physical or geologic features or physical parameters that are inherently present in 3D volume data sets. Such physical features or parameters are typically not apparent from conventional means of processing 3D data sets such as scanning a series of cross sections of the 3D volume data set because of the mental reconstruction that needs to take place in order for a user to mentally picture the three dimensional feature. Because of this mental reconstruction it is difficult to communicate and share among users the same 3D image. For example the same 3D mental image of the terrain will not necessarily be present in the mind of every person that reads or analyzes a two dimensional 2D contour map of that terrain. Through the use of 3D computer graphics users can visualize and communicate and share the same 3D image of 3D volume data sets. By visualizing 3D seismic data a team of geologists geophysicists and engineers can interpret the visualized data to make exploration and production decisions such as drilling locations and well paths.

To accomplish the visualization function the present invention uses the computer graphics techniques of texture mapping and volume rendering. By texture map is meant wrapping or mapping a 2D picture or image onto a 2D or a 3D object. For example a photograph of a person can be texture mapped onto a coffee cup.

The term volume rendering or volume imaging refers to drawing a three dimensional object in a manner that conveys to a viewer the three dimensional nature of the object even though the viewer may be looking at a two dimensional display or screen. Computer graphics technology makes use of coloring lighting and shading techniques to convey to the mind of the viewer what is high or low behind or in front light or dark etc. The perspective or viewpoint can be changed so that the viewer can see all sides of the 3D object. Volume rendering typically includes some type of transparency opacity opacity 1 transparency control so that certain parts of the 3D object are more transparent thereby allowing a viewer to see through outer surfaces of an object and view its internal structures.

The present invention enables fast visualization and analysis of very large 3D volume data sets through the use of a sampling probe also referred to herein as a probe or probe object . As explained in more detail below the sampling probes of the present invention have numerous attributes one of which is that they are typically created as a 3D sub volume of the whole 3D volume data set to be visualized and analyzed.

A number of sampling probes can be created shaped sized and moved interactively by the user within the whole 3D volume data set. The intersection of the sampling probe with the whole 3D volume data set is texture mapped onto the surfaces of the sampling probe or volume rendered with varying degrees of transparency within the sampling probe. As used herein the term interactive or interactively refers to changing or re drawing an image in response to user input at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives an instantaneous or real time change in the image without perceptible delay or lag. In practice a frame rate of at least about 10 to 15 frames per second is sufficient to achieve interactive imaging as described herein. For example as the user moves the sampling probe such as by clicking and dragging with a mouse the user perceives the texture on the surfaces of the sampling probe changing in real time with movement of the sampling probe. As the sampling probe changes shape size or location there is no user perceivable delay or lag in imaging the texture or with varying degrees of transparency volume rendered attributes. In this manner the user can interactively move the sampling probes through the whole 3D volume and more easily and effectively visualize and interpret the features and physical parameters that are present within the geographic space represented by the whole 3D volume data set.

The present invention may be implemented using hardware software or a combination thereof and may be implemented in a computer system or other processing system. One embodiment of a software or program structure for implementing the present invention is shown in . At the base of program structure is an operating system . Suitable operating systems include for example the UNIX operating system or Windows NT from Microsoft Corporation or other operating systems as would be apparent to one of skill in the relevant art.

Menu and windowing software overlays operating system . Menu and windowing software is used to provide various menus and windows to facilitate interaction with the user and to obtain user input and instructions. Menu and windowing software can include for example Microsoft Windows X Window System registered trademark of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and MOTIF registered trademark of Open Software Foundation Inc. . As would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art other menu and windowing software could also be used.

A basic graphics library overlays menu and windowing software . Basic graphics library is an application programming interface API for 3D computer graphics. The functions performed by basic graphics library include for example geometric and raster primitives RGBA or color index mode display list or immediate mode viewing and modeling transformations lighting and shading hidden surface removal alpha blending translucency anti aliasing texture mapping atmospheric effects fog smoke haze feedback and selection stencil planes and accumulation buffer.

A particularly preferred basic graphics library is OpenGL available from Silicon Graphics Inc SGI Mountain View Calif. The OpenGL API is a multi platform industry standard that is hardware window and operating system independent. OpenGL is designed to be callable from C C FORTRAN Ada and Java programming languages. OpenGL performs each of the functions listed above for basic graphics library . Some commands in OpenGL specify geometric objects to be drawn and others control how the objects are handled. All elements of the OpenGL state even the contents of the texture memory and the frame buffer can be obtained by a client application using OpenGL OpenGL and the client application may operate on the same or different machines because OpenGL is network transparent. OpenGL is described in more detail in the OpenGL Programming Guide ISBN 0 201 63274 8 and the OpenGL Reference Manual ISBN 0 201 63276 4 the entirety of both of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Visual simulation graphics library overlays basic graphics library . Visual simulation graphics library is an API for creating real time multi processed 3D visual simulation graphics applications. Visual simulation graphics library provides functions that bundle together graphics library state control functions such as lighting materials texture and transparency. These functions track state and the creation of display lists that can be rendered later.

A particularly preferred visual simulation graphics library . is IRIS Performer available from SGI in Mountain View Calif. IRIS Performer supports the OpenGL graphics library discussed above. IRIS Performer includes two main libraries libpf and libpr and four associated libraries libpfdu libpfdb libpfui and libpfutil.

The basis of IRIS Performer is the performance rendering library libpr a low level library providing high speed rendering functions based on GeoSets and graphics state control using GeoStates. GeoSets are collections of drawable geometry that group same type graphics primitives e.g. triangles or quads into one data object. The GeoSet contains no geometry itself only pointers to data arrays and index arrays. Because all the primitives in a GeoSet are of the same type and have the same attributes rendering of most databases is performed at maximum hardware speed. GeoStates provide graphics state definitions e.g. texture or material for GeoSets.

Layered above libpr is libpf a real time visual simulation environment providing a high performance multi process database rendering system that optimizes use of multiprocessing hardware. The database utility library libpfdu provides functions for defining both geometric and appearance attributes of 3D objects shares state and materials and generates triangle strips from independent polygonal input. The database library libpfdb uses the facilities of libpfdu libpf and libpr to import database files in a number of industry standard database formats. The libpfui is a user interface library that provides building blocks for writing manipulation components for user interfaces C and C programming languages . Finally the libpfutil is the utility library that provides routines for implementing tasks such as MultiChannel Option support and graphical user interface GUI tools.

An application program that uses IRIS Performer and OpenGL API typically carry out the following steps in preparing for real time 3D visual simulation.

Once the application program has created a graphical rendering environment by carrying out steps 1 through 6 above then the application program typically iterates through a main simulation loop once per frame.

A 3D sampling probe program of the present inventions overlays visual simulation graphics library . Program interacts with and uses the functions carried out by each of visual simulation and graphics library basic graphics library menu and windowing software and operating system in a manner known to one of skill in the relevant art.

3D sampling probe program of the present invention is preferably written in an object oriented programming language to allow the creation and use of objects and object functionality. A particularly preferred object oriented programming language is C . In carrying out the present invention program creates one or more probe objects . As noted above the probe objects created and used by program are also referred to herein as sampling probes or probes. Program manipulates the probe objects so that they have the following attributes.

A probe corresponds to a sub volume of a larger 3D volume. Particularly a probe defines a sub set that is less than the complete data set of voxels for a 3D volume data set. A probe could be configured to be equal to or coextensive with the complete data set of voxels for a 3D volume data set but the functionality of the present invention is best carried out when the probe corresponds to a sub volume and defines a sub set that is less than the complete data set of voxels for a 3D volume data set. For example a 3D volume data set of seismic data can contain from about 500 ME megabytes to about 10 GB gigabytes or more of data. A 2 500 square kilometer geographic space of typical 3D seismic data contains about 8 GB of data. A probe of the present invention for a 500 ME seismic data set would preferably contain about 10 20 ME of data.

By using probes that are a sub volume of the larger 3D volume the quantity of data that must be processed and re drawn for each frame of an image is dramatically reduced thereby increasing the speed with which the image can be re drawn. The volume of a three dimensional cube is proportional to the third power or cube of the dimensions of the three dimensional cube. Likewise the quantity of data in a 3D volume data set is proportional to the third power or cube of its size. Therefore the quantity of data in a sub volume of a larger 3D volume will be proportional to the cubed root of the quantity of data in the larger 3D volume. As such the quantity of data in a probe of the present invention will be proportional to the cubed root of the quantity of data in the 3D volume of which it is a sub volume. By only having to process the sub set of data that relates to the sub volume of the probe the present invention can re draw an image in response to user input at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives an instantaneous or real time change in the image without perceptible delay or lag.

The probes of the present invention can be interactively changed in shape and or size and interactively moved within the larger 3D volume. The outside geometry or surfaces of a probe can be interactively drawn opaque or texture mapped while the probe is being changed in shape and or size or while the probe is being moved. The probe can be drawn or volume rendered with varying degrees of transparency while the probe is being changed in shape and or size or moved thereby revealing the internal structures or features of the probe.

The 3D sampling probes of the present invention can have any shape including rectangular shapes having one or more right angles and non rectangular shapes having no right angles. The 3D sampling probes of the present invention can have orthogonal or perpendicular planes as outer surfaces e.g. squares and rectangles parallel planes as outer surfaces e.g. parallelograms or curved outer surfaces e.g. spheres ovals or cylinders . The present invention is not limited to 3D sampling probes of any particular shape. The 3D sampling probes of the present invention can have arbitrary shapes such as the shape of a geologic feature identified by a user. For example as a user moves the 3D sampling probe through a 3D volume of seismic data a geologic feature may be visualized and identified by the user. The 3D sampling probe can be interactively re shaped by the user to match the shape of the geologic feature thereby enabling the user to better visualize and define the extent of that geologic feature.

A probe can be used to cut into another probe and the intersection of the two probes can be imaged. A probe can be used to highlight data in accordance with a seed selection algorithm. A probe can also be used to erase or delete data in accordance with a seed de selection algorithm. These attributes will be explained in more detail below.

Voxel data from data volume is transferred to VSM via data pathway . VSM transfers data to GPM via data pathway . Data volume stores the 3D volume data set in a manner well known to one of skill in the relevant art. For example the format for data volume can consist of two parts a volume header followed by the body of data that is as long as the size of the data set. The volume header typically contains information in a prescribed sequence such as the file path location of the data set size dimensions in the x y and z directions annotations for the x y and z axes annotations for the data value etc. The body of data is a binary sequence of bytes one or more bytes per data value that can be ordered in the following manner. The first byte is the data value at volume location x y z 0 0 0 . The second byte is the data value at volume location 1 0 0 the third byte is the data value at volume location 2 0 0 etc. When the x dimension is exhausted then the y dimension is incremented and finally the z dimension is incremented. The present invention is not limited in any way to a particular data format for data volume .

User Interface Module handles the user interface to receive commands instructions and input data from the user. UIM interfaces with the user through a variety of menus through which the user can select various options and settings either through keyboard selection or through one or more user manipulated input devices such as a mouse or a 3D pointing device. UIM receives user input as the user manipulates the input device to move size shape etc. a 3D sampling probe.

The primary functions carried out by UIM will now be described. UIM inputs from the user the identification of one or more 3D volume data sets represented by data volume to use for imaging and analysis. When a plurality of data volumes are used the data value for each of the plurality of data volumes represents a different physical parameter or attribute for the same geographic space. By way of example a plurality of data volumes could include a geology volume a temperature volume and a water saturation volume. The voxels in the geology volume can be expressed in the form x y z seismic amplitude . The voxels in the temperature volume can be expressed in the form x y z Qq. The voxels in the water saturation volume can be expressed in the form x y z saturation . The physical or geographic space defined by the voxels in each of these volumes is the same. However for any specific spatial location xo yo zo the seismic amplitude would be contained in the geology volume the temperature in the temperature volume and the water saturation in the water saturation volume.

UIM inputs from the user information to create one or more 3D sampling probes. Such information includes size shape and initial location of the probe. Such information can also include imaging attributes such as color lighting shading and transparency or opacity . By adjusting opacity as a function of data value certain portions of the data volume are more transparent thereby allowing a viewer to see through surfaces. An exemplary opacity curve is shown in . Opacity curve illustrates opacity I transparency as a function of data value. As would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art data values with greater opacity less transparency will mask the imaging or display of data values with lower opacity more transparency . Conversely data values will less opacity and greater transparency will permit the imaging or display of data values with greater opacity and lower transparency.

UIM receives input from the user for sizing and shaping the 3D sampling probes. As described in more detail below in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user changes the shape and or size of a probe by clicking onto sizing tabs on the probe and making changes in the dimensions of the probe in one or more directions. UIM receives input from the user to move the position or location of a 3D sampling probe within the data volume. In a preferred embodiment a user manipulates a mouse to click onto a surface of the probe to be moved and then moves the mouse to move the probe throughout the geographic space defined by the data volume.

UIM receives input from the user to carry out auto picking processes. In an auto picking process data points voxels are selected based upon a selection algorithm. In a preferred embodiment the selection algorithm is based upon a seed point within the 3D data volume. The selection algorithm then selects data points that i satisfy the selection criteria or algorithm e.g. have a data value within a specified filter range and ii have a connectivity with or are connected to the seed point. Through UIM the user is prompted to identify a seed point within the 3D volume and to identify a filter range of data values used by the selection algorithm to pick the selected points. Preferably the seed point is within one of the 3D sampling probes.

UIM also receives input from the user regarding the content of the displayed image. For example the user can preferably select the content of the displayed image. The content of the displayed image could include only the 3D sampling probe i.e. its intersection with the 3D volume. Additionally the 3D sampling probe could be displayed either with or without a bounding box that defines the outer geometry of the probe. Alternatively the displayed image could include the 3D sampling probe as well as the data that occupies the background xz yz and xy planes and or the data occupies the 3D volume outside of the 3D sampling probe s being displayed.

To carry out the foregoing functions UIM sends a request to Volume Sampling Module to load or attach those 3D volume data sets identified by the user. UIM communicates via pathway with Graphics Processing Module that carries out the display and imaging.

The primary functions carried out by GPM will now be described. GPM processes data for imaging of 3D sampling probes with the color lighting shading transparency and other attributes selected by the user. To do so GPM uses the functions available through basic graphics library and visual simulation graphics library described above. The user can select through UIM to display only the one or more 3D sampling probes that have been created. Alternatively the user can select to display one or more 3D sampling probes as well as the 3D data volume outside of the probes i.e. voxels within the 3D volume that do not intersect any of the 3D sampling probes that are being displayed. 3D sampling probes that are being displayed are referred to herein as active probes .

GPM processes the re shaping and move requests that are received by UIM from the user. GPM draws the re shaped 3D sampling probe in accordance with the user selected attributes color lighting shading transparency etc. . As the user inputs a change in shape for a 3D sampling probe the image with selected attributes is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user. Similarly GPM draws the 3D sampling probe in the new position or location in accordance with the user selected attributes color lighting shading transparency etc. . As the user moves the 3D sampling probe through the 3D volume the image of the 3D sampling probe with selected attributes is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

GPM processes auto picking requests that are received by UIM . GPM will image selected points within the 3D volume in accordance with the selection algorithm. Alternatively GPM will erase selected points within the 3D volume in accordance with the selection algorithm.

To carry out the foregoing functions GPM communicates via pathway with UIM so that the information requested by the user is imaged or displayed with the selected attributes. GPM obtains the needed data from data volume by sending a data request via pathway to Volume Sampling Module VSM .

The primary function of VSM is to extract the appropriate data from data volume at the request of GPM . VSM receives requests for data from GPM via pathway . VSM extracts the required data from data volume and transfers the data to GPM via data pathway for processing and display. VSM also receives instructions from UIM via pathway to load or attach the 3D data volumes identified by the user.

Turning now to a flow diagram illustrating one embodiment for implementing the present invention is shown. A start up or initialization process is shown in a step . In step the user specifies the one or more data volumes to be used. The specified 3D volume data sets are loaded from disk into main memory a description of hardware suitable for carrying out the present invention will be described in more detail below . A default 3D sampling probe is created and drawn. The default 3D sampling probe is a sub volume of the specified 3D volume s of arbitrary size and shape. The present invention is not limited to any particular size or shape for the default 3D sampling probe.

By way of example of the present invention the default 3D sampling probe can be a square having equal dimensions in the x y and z directions . To draw the square default 3D sampling probe the bounding geometry is first drawn with one edge of the bounding geometry located on the z axis. Data is then extracted from data volume by VSM to draw the image of the intersection of the square default 3D sampling probe with the 3D volume data volume . Particularly data is extracted that corresponds to the intersection of the square default 3D sampling probe with the 3D volume in the xz yz and xy planes. This data is then sent by VSM to GPM so that it can be texture mapped onto the planes of the bounding box to provide an image of the square default 3D sampling probe.

In one embodiment of the present invention the data that occupies the background xz yz and xy planes themselves as well as the data that occupies the 3D volume outside of the default 3D sampling probe are also imaged or displayed in addition to the default 3D sampling probe during start up step . Alternatively startup step can be carried out so that the data that occupies the background xz yz and xy planes or the data that occupies the 3D volume outside of the default 3D sampling probe is not displayed or imaged. Preferably the present invention is carried out so that the user can selectively display or not display the data that occupies the background xz yz and xy planes as well as the data that occupies the 3D volume outside of the active probes.

In a step UIM is waiting to respond to user input or request. User input is received through a user input device suitable for use with a computer including but not limited to a keyboard mouse joystick trackball rollerball roller point or other type of suitable pointing device etc. Preferably the user input device comprises a mouse or other similar device that enables the user to click on a particular displayed image and drag that displayed image to another location. Such a user input device allows a user to move and re shape displayed probes. Such a user input device also allows a user to activate drop down menus and to select the various options for the color shading lighting and transparency attributes. A keyboard can also be used for entering information relating to the selected attributes.

Reference numeral refers generally to a plurality of functions that can be carried out by the present invention. These functions can be carried out individually or simultaneously depending upon input from the user. For example a probe can be moved function and rotated function simultaneously. While the functions identified by reference numeral are being carried out the image of the 3D sampling probes is being re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user. Each of the functions identified by reference numeral will now be described.

If a user wants to change the default probe then function is carried out. The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step the changes to the default probe are input by UIM from the user. For example the changes to the default probe can be to the shape or size the location or the attributes such as color shading lighting and transparency.

In a step UIM sends a request to GPM to draw the changed default probe. In a step GPM requests data for the changed default probe from VSM . In making this request GPM would invoke function if it was necessary to move the default probe function to re shape the default probe and functions or to rotate the default probe. The foregoing functions will be described in more detail below.

The data that will be extracted from data volume by VSM in response to the request made by GPM in step will depend upon attributes that have been selected by the user. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the changed default probe. Because of the selected opacity it will not be possible for the user to see inside the changed default probe so only the data corresponding to the surfaces or outside of the changed default probe will be extracted by VSM . In a step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the surfaces of the changed default probe and draws the changed default probe by texture mapping onto the surfaces in accordance with the attributes selected by the user. By extracting only the data that can be seen by the user the image of the changed default probe can be drawn more quickly because less data needs to be processed i.e. the data corresponding to the inside of the changed default probe is not processed.

Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volume of the changed default probe. Because of the selected opacity and transparency it will be possible for the user to see inside the changed default probe so data corresponding to the entire volume of the changed default probe will be extracted by VSM . In such a situation GPM processes the data extracted by VSM in step and draws the changed default probe by volume rendering in accordance with the attributes selected by the user.

If a user wants to create additional probes then function is carried out. The present invention is not limited to any particular number of active probes. The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step the shape size location attributes etc. for the additional probes are input by UIM from the user. In a step UIM sends a request to GPM to draw the additional probes.

In a step GPM requests data for the additional probes from VSM . In a manner similar to that described above for changing the default probe the data that is extracted from 3D or data volume by VSM will depend upon the opacity selected by the user for the additional probes. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values for the additional probes are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the additional probes. Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user for the additional probes are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volumes of the additional probes. In this manner the additional probes can be drawn more quickly by minimizing the quantity of data that must be processed.

In a step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the additional probes and draws the additional probes in accordance with the attributes selected by the user either by texture mapping onto the surfaces of the additional probes or by volume rendering the entire volume of the additional probes.

If a user wants to move a probe then function is carried out. The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step the new location for the probe is input by UIM from the user. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user inputs the new location of the probe by clicking a mouse or other type of suitable user input device to snap a pointer onto a surface of the probe to be moved. The user changes the location of the probe by moving the mouse or other suitable user input device in any direction thereby dragging the probe along a trajectory.

In a step UIM sends a move request to GPM to draw the probe at the new location. GPM requests data for the new location of the probe from VSM . In a manner similar to that described above the data that is extracted from data volume by VSM will depend upon the opacity selected by the user for the probe being moved. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values for the probe being moved are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the probe being moved. Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user for the probe being moved are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volume of the probe being moved. In this manner the probe can be drawn at its new location more quickly by minimizing the quantity of data that must be processed.

In a step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the probe being moved and draws the probe at its new location in accordance with the attributes selected by the user either by texture mapping onto the surfaces of the probe being moved or by volume rendering the entire volume of the probe being moved.

As the user moves the probe for each new location of the probe steps through are repeated at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives the image of the probe with texture mapping or volume rendering as appropriate changing in real time with movement of the probe. The image is being re drawn at a frame rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

If a user wants to re shape a probe then function is carried out. As used herein the term re shape refers to any change in dimension of a 3D sampling probe in any direction. The shape of a 3D sampling probe can be changed or re shaped for example by changing the size in one or more directions such as by changing a square probe into a rectangular probe by increasing the size of the probe in the x direction and decreasing the size of the probe in the y direction. As another example the shape of a 3D sampling probe can be changed by changing the shape from spherical to rectangular. As yet another example a square 3D sampling probe equal dimensions in the x y and z directions can be re shaped in accordance with the present invention to be a larger or smaller square shaped probe by changing the size equally in each of the x y and z directions. The re shaped probe also has a square shape but as a larger or smaller square.

The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector SA. In a step the new shape and or size for the probe is input by UIM from the user. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user inputs the new shape of a probe by clicking a mouse or other type of suitable user input device to snap a pointer onto a sizing tab of the probe to be re shaped. As used herein a sizing tab refers to a designated area on a surface of the probe. Such a designated area is preferably displayed in a color that is different from the colors being used to display the features or physical parameters of the 3D volume data set. When the pointer is snapped to the sizing tab manipulation of the mouse or user input device changes the dimensions or proportions of the surface on which the sizing tab is located. When the desired size or shape is reached the user again clicks the mouse or user input device to release the pointer from the sizing tab. Sizing tabs are illustrated in . The sizing tabs are the small green squares that appear on the surfaces of the probes along the bounding geometry of the probes. The location of the sizing tabs is not limited to the bounding geometry of the probes. The user changes the shape of the probe by clicking the mouse or other suitable user input device onto a sizing tab moving the mouse until the surface being changed has the desired shape and then releasing the mouse from the sizing tab. This process can be repeated if necessary using other sizing tabs on the probe until the probe is re shaped to the desired shape.

It would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art how to implement such a sizing tab for re shaping the probes of the present invention. It is to be understood however that the present invention is not limited to the use of sizing tabs for re shaping probes and other suitable methods can be used. For example the user could select from a number of pre set shapes e.g. squares rectangle cylinders spheres by activating a drop down menu or by scrolling through the shapes by repeatedly clicking a mouse.

In a step UIM sends a re shape request to GPM to draw the re shaped probe. In a step it is determined whether more data is needed to draw the re shaped probe. For example if the re shaped probe is of a shape and size that fits inside the existing probe then no more data is needed and processing continues at a step Alternatively if the reshaped probe is of a shape and size that falls at least partially outside of the existing probe then in a step GPM requests the data needed for the re shaped probe from VSM . In a manner similar to that described above the data that is extracted from 3D or data volume by VSM will depend upon the opacity selected by the user for the probe being re shaped. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values for the probe being re shaped are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the probe being re shaped. Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user for the probe being re shaped are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volume of the probe being re shaped. In this manner the probe can be drawn with its new shape more quickly by minimizing the quantity of data that must be processed.

In step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the probe being re shaped and draws the probe with its new shape in accordance with the attributes selected by the user either by texture mapping onto the surfaces of the probe being re shaped or by volume rendering the entire volume of the probe being re shaped.

As the user changes the shape of the probe steps through are repeated at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives the image of the probe with texture mapping or volume rendering as appropriate changing in real time with the changing shape of the probe. The image is being re drawn at a frame rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

If a user wants to rotate a probe in 3D space then function is carried out. In function the 3D orientation which is the same for both the 3D volume and the probe is changed thereby rotating the 3D volume and the probe in space. The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step the new 3D orientation for the 3D volume and the probe is input by UIM from the user. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user inputs the new orientation by clicking a mouse or other type of suitable user input device to snap a pointer onto an axis of the probe to be rotated. Manipulation of the mouse or user input device changes the orientation of that axis. When the desired orientation is reached the user again clicks the mouse or user input device to release the pointer from the axis. It would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art how to implement such a change in orientation. It is to be understood however that the present invention is not limited to changing the orientation in this manner. For example the user could select from a number of pre set rotations e.g. rotate 90 to the left or right rotate 45 to the left or right etc. by activating a drop down menu or by scrolling through the rotations by repeatedly clicking a mouse.

In a step UIM sends a request to rotate in 3D space to GPM to draw the rotated probe. In a step GPM requests data for the rotated probe from VSM . In a manner similar to that described above the data that is extracted from 3D or data volume by VSM will depend upon the opacity selected by the user for the probe being rotated. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values for the probe being rotated are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the probe being rotated. Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user for the probe being rotated are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volume of the probe being rotated. In this manner the probe can be drawn with its new orientation more quickly by minimizing the quantity of data that must be processed.

In step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the probe being rotated and draws the probe with its new orientation in accordance with the attributes selected by the user either by texture mapping onto the surfaces of the probe being rotated or by volume rendering the entire volume of the probe being rotated.

As the user rotates the probe in 3D space steps through are repeated at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives the image of the probe with texture mapping or volume rendering as appropriate changing in real time with the changing orientation of the probe. The image is being re drawn at a frame rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user. If a user wants to rotate a probe while it is fixed in 3D space then function is carried out. In function the 3D orientation of the probe is rotated independently of the 3D orientation of the 3D volume thereby rotating the probe while it is fixed in the 3D space defined by the orientation of the 3D volume. In this manner the background planes for an active probe can be displayed in a fixed orientation and the active probe can be rotated within the background planes.

The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step the new 3D orientation for the probe is input by UIM from the user. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user selects the option to rotate while fixed in space for example from a drop down menu. The user then inputs the new orientation for the probe by clicking a mouse or other type of suitable user input device to snap a pointer onto an axis of the probe to be rotated. Manipulation of the mouse or user input device changes the orientation of that axis. When the desired orientation is reached the user again clicks the mouse or user input device to release the pointer from the axis. It would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art how to implement such a change in orientation. It is to be understood however that the present invention is not limited to changing the orientation in this manner. For example the user could select from a number of pre set rotations e.g. rotate 90 to the left or right rotate 45 to the left or right etc. by activating a drop down menu or by scrolling through the rotations by repeatedly clicking a mouse.

In a step UIM sends a request to rotate while fixed in space to GPM to draw the rotated probe. In a step GPM requests data for the rotated probe from VSM . In a manner similar to that described above the data that is extracted from 3D or data volume by VSM will depend upon the opacity selected by the user for the probe being rotated. If the opacity settings selected by the user are such that all data values for the probe being rotated are opaque then the data extracted by VSM will be limited to the surfaces of the probe being rotated. Alternatively if the opacity settings selected by the user for the probe being rotated are such that some of the data values are opaque and some of the data values are transparent then the data extracted by VSM will include the data corresponding to the entire volume of the probe being rotated. In this manner the probe can be drawn with its new orientation more quickly by minimizing the quantity of data that must be processed.

In step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM for the probe being rotated and draws the probe with its new orientation in accordance with the attributes selected by the user either by texture mapping onto the surfaces of the probe being rotated or by volume rendering the entire volume of the probe being rotated.

As the user rotates the probe while it is fixed in space steps through are repeated at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives the image of the probe with texture mapping or volume rendering as appropriate changing in real time with the changing orientation of the probe. The image is being re drawn at a frame rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

If a user wants to carry out an auto picking process then function is carried out. The steps for carrying out function are shown in by way of flow diagram connector A. In a step a seed point within the data set of the 3D volume and a selection criteria based on data values are input by UIM from the user. Preferably the seed point is within the data set of voxels that defines a probe. As described below such a probe is referred to herein as a seed 3D sampling probe or an eraser 3D sampling probe. However the seed point can be within the data set of voxels that defines the 3D volume outside of an active probe. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the user selects the option to execute an auto picking process for example from a drop down menu. The user then selects the seed point by clicking a mouse or other type of suitable user input device to snap a pointer onto the desired seed point. The selection criteria can be input for example by graphically selecting a range or by keying in specific numerical values. It would be readily apparent to one of skill in the relevant art how to input from the user a seed point and filter range of data values.

In a step UIM sends an auto picking request to GPM to draw the rotated probe. In a step GPM requests selected points to image from VSM . The selected points are those that are connected to the seed point and that have a data value within the selection criteria.

In step GPM processes the data extracted by VSM to draw the selected points. The selected points are preferably highlighted within the probe by being drawn in a color different from those used to depict the features or physical parameters of the 3D volume data set. Alternatively step can be carried out to erase or delete from the probe the selected points.

In a similar manner auto picking function can be used to erase or de select points. For example an eraser 3D sampling probe is defined such as by invoking function to create an additional probe. A de selection criteria based on data values is defined. Points previously selected by an auto picking operation that satisfy the de selection criteria are identified as candidates for de selection. As the eraser 3D sampling probe moves through the 3D volume the de selected points are deleted from the image and the image is re drawn sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.

Once auto picking function is initiated by the user it can be carried out simultaneously with for example move function . In this manner as the user moves the probe steps through and steps through are repeated at a rate sufficiently fast that the user perceives the image of the probe with the selected points changing in real time with the changing location of the probe. As the probe is moved the selected points can be highlighted within the probe or within the probe and 3D volume by being drawn in a suitable color thereby having the auto picking 3D sampling probe function as a highlighter as it moves through the 3D volume. Alternatively as the probe is moved points previously selected by an auto picking operation can be erased or deleted from the probe or the probe and 3D volume thereby having the probe function as an eraser or eraser 3D sampling probe as it moves through the 3D volume. In either embodiment the image is being re drawn at a frame rate sufficiently fast to be perceived as real time by the user.
