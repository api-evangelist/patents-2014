This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 176 181 filed Jul. 18 2008 which is a non provisional application of and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60 950 404 filed Jul. 18 2007 entitled System and Method for Secure Fulfillment of Transactions Involving Virtual Items .

This invention relates generally to networked computer games. More particularly this invention relates to executing financial transactions in virtual environments.

Massively multiplayer online games MMOGs are online computer games capable of supporting hundreds or thousands of players simultaneously. Millions of users worldwide have created a virtual identity alter ego on various MMOGs and other virtual online worlds. Users of virtual worlds spend hundreds of hours playing and creating their virtual identities and winning various virtual items and currencies. With attainment of such virtual items comes the desire to trade or otherwise transact for other virtual items. Currently there does not exist a transaction mechanism that guarantees completion of such transactions for virtual items before payment. For example existing virtual trading mechanism are often subject to fraud since it is difficult to authenticate the identities of the parties and items involved in such virtual worlds. As a result the market for trading and transacting virtual items has languished waiting for a transaction mechanism that guarantees completion of the transaction before payment.

In one general aspect the present invention is directed to systems and methods which provide for secure fulfillment of transactions involving virtual items. According to various embodiments the system can provide proof that the virtual item s was delivered and paid for when two independent parties meet in an online or virtual market and decide to complete a transaction. The marketplace can then disperse the moneys to the respective parties securely.

The invention includes a computer implemented method to exchange virtual goods in a virtual environment by receiving funds at a trading platform from a buyer. The buyer is provided with a first secret that the buyer can decrypt and a second secret that the buyer cannot decrypt. The buyer is authenticated to a seller using the first secret. A virtual item is delivered from the seller to the buyer in response to authenticating. The buyer delivers to the seller the second secret for decryption by the seller. The seller is authenticated at the trading platform with the second secret. The seller is supplied with the funds.

The invention also includes a computer implemented method to exchange virtual goods in a virtual environment by listing virtual goods. A buyer is supplied with a first secret encrypted to a buyer key and a second secret encrypted to a seller key. The buyer is authenticated to a seller using the first secret. A virtual item is delivered from the seller to the buyer in response to authenticating. The buyer delivers the second secret to the seller. The seller is authenticated at a trading platform with the second secret to receive buyer funds.

The system may also include a virtual item trading platform connected to the network . The virtual item trading platform may provide a virtual marketplace for items in the virtual worlds of the games provided by the virtual online game server . For instance players of the virtual online game e.g. end users at the end user computer devices may list items they have acquired in the game for trade sale or other type of exchange in the marketplace provided by the virtual item trading platform . The virtual trade trading platform may comprise one or a number of networked servers and may be a virtual item trading platform as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 974 861 filed Oct. 16 2007 which is incorporated herein by reference. The trading platform may also have a dedicated connection to the game server .

End users may download a toolbar from the virtual online trading platform that is displayed for the end user on the end user s computer device when the end user is playing the virtual online game provided by the virtual online game server . An example of such a toolbar is shown in . The toolbar may be transparent and overlay the graphics from the game as shown in . End users may use the toolbar to list item with the broker s marketplace for exchange view items listed by other end users for exchange etc. The virtual item trading platform may also broker the exchange of virtual items transacted between end users in a manner that ensures the secure exchange of the virtual item between the end users prior to payment.

At step the trading platform provides a payment envelope to the seller . The payment envelope may be encrypted in the seller s key so that the seller can receive it privately and reliably. The trading platform may additionally sign a digest of the payment envelope to prove that it is authentic. Next at step the buyer deposits the purchase price with the trading platform or some other escrow agent for the transaction. Any suitable online payment technique may be used for depositing the funds.

Next at step the trading platform provides the buyer with a first message that may contain i a description of the transaction ii a date and iii a secret that only the buyer can decrypt using the buyer s public private keys. The secret may comprise two things a buyer secret code and another second encrypted message. The buyer secret code may be for example a random sixteen digit number. The second encrypted message may contain a seller secret code that is encrypted in the key of the seller . Thus in such an embodiment the first message received by the buyer may have the following format 

Buyer s Secret Transaction Description Seller s Secret Transaction Description K seller where Messageindicates that the content Message has been encrypted by the trading platform in in x s private key. So the message above indicates the original message sent to the buyer is encrypted in the buyer s key but contains another message encrypted in the seller s key. The buyer may give the second encrypted message to the seller when the exchange of the virtual item occurs as described further below. Like the buyer s secret code the seller s secret code may be a random sixteen digit number.

Once the seller has the payment envelope and the buyer has received the first message after depositing the purchase price with the trading platform delivery of the virtual item may take place pursuant to the agreed upon transaction. In order to do this the virtual characters for the seller and the buyer meet in their virtual world. The trading platform may facilitate the meeting by detecting the presence of the seller and the buyer in the virtual world. In one embodiment the trading platform may detect the presence of the parties by analyzing the executable files of the game server . In that connection the trading platform may include a database see that maps the executable files to particular places in the virtual world. That is by analyzing and interpreting the executable files running on the game server the trading platform can determine the location or presence of game participants in the virtual world based on the mappings in the database to particular locations in the game. In another embodiment the trading platform may have an API application programming interface that interfaces with the game server so that through the API the game server can provide the relevant location information for the participants to the trading platform .

Therefore in one example at step the trading platform could detect the presence of the buyer at the agreed upon location for the exchange of the virtual item. Further to authenticate the buyer the buyer may send back to the trading platform the buyer s secret code contained in the message received at step . That way the trading platform can authenticate the buyer since only the buyer will have the code which was encrypted with the seller s key.

Once the trading platform locates and authenticates the buyer the trading platform could send a message to the seller to go to the location to complete the transaction. The messages from the buyer to the trading platform and the message from the trading platform to the seller may be done via instant messaging using the toolbar see . In other embodiments the message may be sent via email or other suitable means.

Once the buyer and the seller meet at the agreed upon location in the game for the exchange the seller at step may present the payment envelope to the buyer. The buyer at step may then decrypt the payment envelope with the buyer s key to authenticate the seller the item and the transaction. The seller s virtual avatar may then at step give the virtual item to the buyer s avatar and the buyer may then give the seller s secret code to the seller e.g. the secret code given to the buyer at step .

In addition according to various embodiments the seller and or the buyer may capture an image of the completed transaction in the virtual world using the camera function in the toolbar see at step . The image may capture the buyer holding the virtual item that is the subject of the transaction so that the image evidences delivery of the item prior to payment. An image of a decrypted secret may also be used to provide delivery of an item. Alternately or in addition an image of a description of an item together with an actual picture of the item may be used for transaction verification.

Then at step the seller may decrypt the seller s secret code using the seller s key and send the code along with the image of the transaction to the trading platform . These items may authenticate completion of the transaction in which ease at step the trading platform may deliver the purchase proceeds which the trading platform was holding in escrow to the seller .

In such a transaction scenario the fact that the seller has the seller s secret code evidences that the seller has communicated with the appropriate buyer and received the seller s secret code from the buyer . This transaction scenario is capable of thwarting many fraudulent tactics used in current virtual world transactions. For instance the buyer cannot later deny that it accepted the item because i the seller has the seller s secret message given to the seller by the buyer at the time of the exchange and ii the image showing the buyer in possession of the item. Also the seller cannot ask for payment without delivering the item because i the seller will not have the seller s secret code given to it by the buyer at the time of the exchange and ii there will be no captured image of the buyer in possession of the item.

In the embodiment shown in only one game server is shown. It should be recognized that in other embodiments the trading platform may provide the transaction functionality for a number of game servers . That is the trading platform may facilitate virtual item transactions using the above described processes in a number of different virtual worlds. In such an embodiment the database preferably stores mappings for each such virtual world so that the trading platform can detect the presence of characters in the different virtual worlds.

In other embodiments as shown in the trading platform could be integrated with the game server . That is the game server could supply the functionality of the trading platform regarding the transaction process rather than having a third party marketplace provide the functionality as in the embodiment of .
