title: Network-based authentication for third party content
abstract: A system may be configured to allow for network-based authentication of a user device, which may reduce or eliminate the need for a user to provide credentials. The authentication may be performed when the user device attempts to access content provided by a third party content provider. The network-based authentication may be performed by, or in conjunction with, a device that (a) is associated with the same telecommunications network as the user device, and (b) can authenticate the identity of the user device.

Networks such as the Internet allow users to access content such as web pages. Content can often be tailored specifically to a user such as content based on the user s location preferences demographical information and or other information. Some content may include content that should be kept secure such as financial content user account content and or other types of secure content. In order to provide secure and or tailored content content providers often request that a user provide credentials such as a username and password so that the content provider can authenticate and or identify the user.

The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements.

As provided herein some implementations may allow for the automated authentication of a user device with respect to content e.g. a secure or personalized web page being accessed by the user device. For example as shown in a user device may output at arrow a request for a web page. The request may be for example a Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP request for a web page provided by a content provider. The user device may also send at arrow an authentication request to an authentication system. As described herein the authentication request may include information identifying the user device e.g. a mobile device number MDN associated with the user device .

The authentication system may authenticate and or identify the user device based on the request. For example the authentication system may authenticate the user device based on identifying that the user device is a trusted device that has been registered with the authentication system. The authentication system may in some implementations maintain a profile associated with the user device which may include information regarding a user of the user device e.g. name address present location etc. . Based on authenticating the user device the authentication system may provide at arrow an indication to the content provider that the user device has been authenticated as well as identification information e.g. information from the above mentioned profile associated with the user device.

Based on the authentication and identification information the content provider may provide at arrow a secure and or a personalized web page to the user device. For example the secure and or personalized web page may be a web page with financial information weather information based on the user device s present location advertisements and or content based on the user s past browsing activity or preferences and or other content which would traditionally be associated with a logged in user. By authenticating and identifying a user device according to techniques described herein the need to request authentication credentials from a user may be eliminated or reduced thereby enhancing the user s experience.

Additionally or alternatively HSS AAA server may perform authentication authorization and or accounting operations associated with the subscriber and or a communication session with user device .

PCRF may include one or more devices that aggregate information to and from the EPC network and or other sources. PCRF may receive information regarding policies and or subscriptions from one or more sources such as subscriber databases and or from one or more users such as for example an administrator associated with PCRF .

WLAN AP may include one or more devices that receive process and or transmit traffic to and or from user device . WLAN AP may implement or be used to implement a WLAN. For example WLAN AP may send traffic to and or receive traffic from user device via an air interface and may forward traffic associated with user device to and or from PDN . The air interface between user device and WLAN AP may correspond to a frequency band that is not associated with cellular communication e.g. an unlicensed frequency band which has not been licensed by a governmental entity . For instance the air interface between user device may correspond to a Wi Fi technology e.g. an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 based technology a Bluetooth technology and or another wireless communication technology. In some implementations WLAN AP may include or may be associated with a router a switch and or another type of networking device.

In some implementations WLAN AP and gateway may be implemented as a single integrated device.

PDN may include one or more wired and or wireless networks. For example PDN may include a packet data network PDN such as an Internet Protocol IP based PDN. PDN may include for example a wide area network WAN such as the Internet a core network of a telecommunications provider a private enterprise network and or one or more other networks. User device may connect through PGW to data servers application servers other user devices content provider and or to other servers or applications that are coupled to PDN .

INAD may include one or more computing devices that perform authentication services when user device is connected to the same network of which INAD is a part. For example INAD may be provided by a wireless telecommunications provider that is also associated with base station and or one or more other devices shown in . INAD may in some implementations be reachable by user device only when user device is connected to the same network as INAD . For instance INAD may be associated with a private address e.g. a private or internal IP address a private Session Initiation Protocol SIP address and or another private identifier which may not be able to be resolved by routing devices external to the network. As described further below INAD may communicate with HSS AAA server to obtain identifying information regarding user device and or may communicate with PCRF to obtain policy information e.g. security policy information regarding user device . INAD may authenticate user device based on information provided by user device PGW HSS AAA server and or PCRF and may provide information e.g. encrypted information such as an encrypted MDN or eMDN to user device . The eMDN may be used by user device as described below to aid in the automatic authentication of user device when accessing content provided by content provider . The eMDN in some implementations may be associated with a pre shared symmetric key that may be stored by INAD and AMS and used by INAD to generate e.g. encrypt the eMDN and by AMS to decrypt the eMDN.

AMS may include one or more devices that perform authentication services on behalf of user device . As described below AMS may handle authentication requests from user device authenticate and or identify user device and notify content provider regarding the authentication and or identity of user device .

Content provider may include one or more devices that provide content to user device . For example content provider may provide web based content e.g. web pages video content audio content etc. to user device . As another example content provider may provide other content such as file streaming virtual private network VPN services financial services application services e.g. video conferencing services voice call services etc. . Content provider may communicate with AMS in order to determine an authenticity and or identity of user device when user device attempts to access content provided by content provider . In some implementations content provider may implement an application programming interface API provided by a provider associated with AMS in order to communicate with AMS . The authentication performed in conjunction with AMS may in some implementations be an alternate form of authentication. For example content provider may allow for traditional authentication in which a user associated with user device provides credentials e.g. a username and password as well as for automatic authentication as described herein. In other implementations content provider may only support authentication in accordance with implementations described herein.

INAD interface may include an interface such as an API and or another type of interface via which user device communicates with INAD . As described below user device may send and or receive authentication information to and or from INAD via INAD interface . For instance INAD interface may be used to output a device authentication request to INAD and or to receive an authentication token signed by INAD .

AMS interface may include an interface such as an API and or another type of interface via which user device communicates with AMS . As described below user device may send and or receive authentication information to and or from AMS via AMS interface . For instance AMS interface may be used to output an authentication request to AMS provide additional credentials to AMS if necessary and or to receive an authentication token signed by AMS .

Authentication client may perform authentication functions as described herein. For example in one implementation authentication client may be provided by content provider in response to a request by user device for content from content provider . For instance the request for content may be an HTTP request for a web page and authentication client may be provided by content provider in response to the HTTP request. Authentication client in some implementations may be implemented as a script or other type of executable code. For example authentication client may be implemented as a JavaScript client to be executed by user device . In some implementations user device may include logic and or circuitry installed on user device prior to a request by user device for content from content provider .

Authentication client may perform functions for the authentication of user device with respect to content provider based on requests for content made by user device . For example as described above in some implementations authentication client may be implemented as a JavaScript program provided by content provider that is invoked upon receipt from content provider . In some implementations authentication client may include an interface e.g. an API via which authentication client communicates with other components of user device . For instance authentication client may communicate via the API with a browser program that provided the request to content provider .

Authentication client may communicate with INAD and or AMS in order to authenticate user device . In some implementations authentication client may receive and or store identifying information associated with INAD and or AMS e.g. IP addresses and or other information which authentication client may use to communicate with INAD and or AMS . Specific examples of communications with INAD and or AMS are described below e.g. with respect to . Briefly authentication client may output information identifying user device to INAD and or AMS and may receive signed authentication tokens from INAD and or AMS that is tokens signed by INAD and or AMS .

Authentication client may store the signed authentication tokens in token repository . In some implementations authentication tokens e.g. as stored by token repository signed by INAD and or AMS may be provided to content provider in order to authenticate user device .

HSS AAA interface may include an interface e.g. an API and or another type of interface via which INAD may communicate with HSS AAA server . HSS AAA interface may be used to obtain identifying information e.g. an MDN and or other identifying information associated with a particular user device . HSS AAA interface may obtain the information from HSS AAA server and or another device that stores the identifying information. In some implementations HSS AAA interface may obtain the information in response to an authentication request received from user device .

Authentication module may perform authentication based on the authentication request from user device and information obtained via HSS AAA interface . For example authentication module may compare information in the authentication request e.g. identifying information included in the authentication request to the identifying information obtained via HSS AAA interface in order to authenticate user device . Additionally or alternatively authentication module may request and or receive information from another device such as a device associated with a telecommunications network involved in performing authentication processes indicating that user device has been authenticated. For example authentication module may request an MDN associated with user device from HSS AAA server . The request may include the IP address of user device based on which the MDN can be identified. The authentication may be performed based on hardware information e.g. information associated with a Subscriber Identity Module SIM provided by user device when user device registers with the telecommunications network.

EMDN module may generate an authentication token based on the identifying information. The authentication token may be or may include for example an encrypted version of the identifying information e.g. MDN for user device . The authentication token generated by eMDN module may be thus sometimes referred to herein as an eMDN. The eMDN may in some implementations include additional information such as a timestamp indicating a time at which the eMDN was created and or other information.

As mentioned above INAD may be a device that has access to information stored by HSS AAA server and or other devices associated with a telecommunications network associated with a particular service provider. Because INAD has access to potentially sensitive information INAD may in some implementations only be reachable by user device when user device is connected to the telecommunications network e.g. via base station provided by the same service provider . In other implementations INAD may be reachable via a network other than the particular telecommunications network.

AMS interface may include an interface e.g. an API via which content provider communicates with AMS . As described below content provider may send and or receive via AMS interface data related to authenticating a particular user device . For example the data may include an authorization request sent from content provider to AMS which may in some implementations include a token signed by authentication client an access token sent from AMS to content provider identifying information and or profile information sent from AMS to content provider and or other information.

Authentication identification module may handle authentication functions in order to authenticate user device e.g. when an authentication request for user device is received via user device interface . For instance as discussed above authentication identification module may receive an authentication request from user device . The authentication request may in some implementations include a signed token. Authentication identification module may use one or more keys in order to authenticate the signature of the token. As described below the token may be signed by authentication client and or by AMS . Thus the one or more keys used by authentication identification module may be public keys respectively associated with authentication client and or AMS .

As also described below authentication identification module may output authorization requests to AMS e.g. via AMS interface . For example based on a authenticating a token e.g. by using the one or more keys mentioned above authentication identification module may output an authorization request to AMS . The authorization request may in some implementations include the token. AMS may as described below authenticate the token and provide an access token and or identification information regarding user device to authentication identification module . Based on receiving the access token authentication identification module may determine that user device is authorized to access content provided by content provider . Further based on the identification information content provider may provide access that is customized based on the identity of user device .

For example content generation module may generate content such as a web page based on the identifying information regarding user device . The content may include personalized content such as content based on user preferences a location associated with user device e.g. as determined by a cellular network associated with user device profile information associated with user device e.g. a user s name address email address etc. an MDN associated with user device and or other information. The content may additionally or alternatively include secure content such as financial information user account information and or other content that would generally be referred to as secure content or logged in content. Content generation module may in some implementations provide the content to user device via user device interface .

In some implementations content generation module may provide placeholder or non personalized content to user device before user device is authenticated. That is in some situations the authentication process may take some time e.g. one second ten seconds one minute or some other amount of time . When content provider initially receives a request for content content generation module may provide generic e.g. placeholder and or non personalized content such as a generic web page that is not based on authenticating and or identifying user device . In some implementations the generic content may include an indication that user device is being authenticated e.g. a loading bar or other indicator . When user device is authenticated content generation module may provide the customized content in a manner that replaces and or supplements the generic content. For example some generic content may remain while additional customized content is provided e.g. a Hello message that includes the name of a user associated with user device weather information associated with the user s present location shopping recommendations etc. .

Profile module may receive and or store profile information regarding user device . The profile information may include information regarding a user of user device e.g. a wireless telecommunications service subscriber such as the user s name address present location an identifier associated with the user and or other information. In some implementations the profile information may include user credentials which AMS may use to authenticate a user associated with user device . As described below the user credentials may be used in addition to or in lieu of network based authentication techniques e.g. in addition to or in lieu of an eMDN which may be received from user device . The user credentials may include a user name and password biometric data e.g. a set of fingerprints a set of retinal scans a set of voice samples a passphrase etc. and or other types of credentials. The profile information may be received from for example a user of user device e.g. during a registration process with AMS and or from another source.

Returning to assurance level module may receive and or store assurance level information which may indicate a level of security associated with certain content providers and or a level of security associated with content associated with content providers . For example assurance level information may indicate whether particular content and or content associated with a particular content provider can be accessed using techniques described herein e.g. automatic login techniques . The assurance level information may in some implementations indicate that additional credentials may be necessary. For example a particular content provider may provide sensitive financial information and may thus require additional credentials from user device before user device can be authenticated. The additional credentials may include for example a user name and or password biometric information e.g. a fingerprint scan a retinal eye scan a voice sample etc. and or other additional information. The assurance level information may indicate what type or types of information is or are required in order to authenticate user device .

The assurance level information may be received from content providers and or from another source. For example using an API and or another type of interface a particular content provider may indicate which type or types of additional verification may be necessary for authenticating user device with respect to content provider . The additional verification may correspond to user credentials stored by AMS e.g. as described above with respect to profile module .

Service policies module may receive and or store service policy information which may indicate whether automatic authentication techniques may be used and or whether a particular user device should be allowed to access content provided by content provider . The service policy information may for example include location based restrictions parental controls and or other types of policies. For example a location based restriction may include a policy whereby user devices outside of a particular country or region may not access content from a particular content provider . As another example a parental control may indicate that a particular user device e.g. a user device associated with a minor or a user device that has been designated as not authorized to access certain types of content and or content associated with certain content providers may not access content from a particular content provider . In some implementations the security policy information may include timeout information. The timeout information may indicate for example how long a previous authentication is valid. For instance if a previous authentication is no longer valid AMS may request additional credentials. The service policy information may be received from PCRF and or from another source.

User device interface may include an interface e.g. an API and or another type of interface via which AMS may communicate with user device . For example via user device interface AMS may receive requests for content and or authentication from user device may request additional credentials from user device e.g. based on assurance level information and or may provide a signed token to user device .

Content provider interface may include an interface e.g. an API and or another type of interface via which AMS may communicate with content provider . For example via content provider interface AMS may receive an authentication request e.g. a request to authenticate user device from content provider and or may provide an access token and or profile information to content provider .

Authentication module may authenticate user device based on a request received from user device and or content provider . For example as described in more detail below authentication module may receive an authentication request from user device . The authentication request may include a token signed by authentication client . In some such situations authentication module may authenticate the token e.g. by using a key associated with authentication client . In some situations the authentication request may also include an eMDN which may indicate that user device has been previously authenticated e.g. in a network based authentication process by INAD . In other situations the authentication request may not include an eMDN e.g. in situations where network based authentication was not performed or was not able to be performed . If the authentication request does not include an eMDN or if the eMDN is expired or if additional credentials are necessary e.g. based on assurance level information authentication module may request additional credentials from user device . Based on the eMDN and in some situations the additional credentials authentication module may authenticate user device and may generate a signed token. The token signed by authentication module may be provided to user device e.g. to authentication client .

As also described below authentication module may receive authentication requests from content provider to authenticate user device . These authentication requests may include for example a token signed by authentication module . The requests from content provider may also include identification requests e.g. using a technique similar to that described in the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF Request For Comments RFC The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework by D. Hardt . Authentication module may authenticate the token and may provide any requested information to content provider .

In the example scenarios illustrated in credentials may only need to be obtained from user device when service policies and or assurance levels specify that additional credentials should be obtained e.g. based on expired authentication and or based on sensitivity of content as specified by content provider . illustrates an example scenario in which user device has not been previously authenticated and INAD is not reachable by user device . The example shown in may involve requesting credentials from user device since network based authentication e.g. authentication involving INAD may not be possible.

Signals in some figures may be similar to signals present in multiple figures. Thus some of these signals may not be described in full detail with respect to each figure for the sake of brevity. Further while examples of how certain components may be implemented are described with respect to it is to be understood that other implementations are possible in practice. For example while described below in the context of a web page with a JavaScript client authentication client may be implemented differently in practice. Further while content is described below in the context of a web page other types of content may be provided in practice.

As shown in content provider may output at a web page with a JavaScript client to user device . The JavaScript client may correspond to for example authentication client . The web page may be provided to user device in response to a request for content e.g. an HTTP request from user device . The JavaScript client may include logic configured to communicate with or attempt to communicate with INAD . For example the JavaScript client may include an address e.g. an IP address associated with INAD .

User device may output at an authentication request to INAD . In this example INAD may be reachable by user device . For instance user device may be connected to the same network e.g. a wireless telecommunications network as INAD . The authentication request may include information identifying user device such as an MDN an IMSI value an IMEI value an IP address and or another value. As discussed above with respect to authentication module INAD may authenticate at user device based on the authentication request. INAD may also generate at an encrypted value such as an eMDN based on authenticating user device . INAD may output at the eMDN to user device .

User device may output at an authentication request including the eMDN to AMS . AMS may decrypt at the eMDN in order to identify and or authenticate user device . AMS may also identify at service policies and or assurance level information associated with content provider . As mentioned above e.g. with respect to assurance level module and service policies module the service policy information may indicate for example whether the authentication should be allowed to continue and the assurance level information may indicate which if any additional credentials are required for authentication.

If additional credentials are required e.g. as indicated by the assurance level information AMS may obtain at the additional credentials from user device . The additional credentials may include for example a username and password biometric information and or other credentials. AMS may authenticate at user device based on the decrypted eMDN and in some situations the additional credentials . AMS may generate at and sign a token referred to as an AMS signed token which indicates that AMS authenticated user device . The AMS signed token may include other information such as the eMDN a timestamp e.g. indicating a time at which the token was generated and or an identifier e.g. a random number which may be used by AMS in subsequent authorization and or identification operations as described below.

As further shown AMS may output at the AMS signed token to user device . User device may sign at the AMS signed token AMS and user device signed token . The AMS and user device signed token may in some implementations be used in subsequent authentication operations. User device may output at the AMS signed token to content provider . Content provider may validate at the AMS signature of the token using for example a public key associated with AMS .

Once the token has been validated as being associated with AMS content provider may output at an authentication request to AMS . This authentication request may include the AMS signed token. AMS may authenticate at the AMS signed token e.g. using a private key associated with AMS . As mentioned above the authentication request may include a request for certain information associated with user device e.g. name of a user address present location etc. . In some implementations AMS may identify user device based on information included in the authentication request e.g. based on a random number or other identifier assigned by AMS previously at .

Based on authenticating and identifying at user device AMS may output at an access token to content provider as well as the requested user information e.g. user profile information . As discussed above with respect to content generation module content provider may generate personalized and or secure content for user device and may output at the personalized and or secure content. User device may for example display the content via a web browser and or another application.

As shown in content provider may provide at a web page with a JavaScript client to user device . User device may store an AMS signed token that was previously provided e.g. at . User device may locate the previously received AMS signed token and may output at the AMS signed token to AMS . As mentioned above the AMS signed token may include an eMDN that was previously generated by INAD . AMS may validate at the AMS signature of the token e.g. using a private key associated with AMS decrypt the eMDN included in the token and may identify policies and or assurance level information associated with content provider . AMS may obtain at additional credentials if necessary may authenticate at user device and may generate an AMS signed token.

The new AMS signed token generated at may in some implementations be similar or identical to the old AMS signed token provided at to AMS . In some implementations the new AMS signed token may include a more recent timestamp than the old AMS signed token. The timestamp may be relevant in subsequent authentication procedures e.g. may indicate whether an authentication has timed out . AMS may output at the new AMS signed token to user device .

User device may sign and store at the AMS signed token. The AMS and user device signed token may be used in subsequent authentication procedures as described below. User device may output at the AMS signed token to content provider which may validate and store at the token and may output at an authentication request including the AMS signed token to AMS . AMS may authenticate and or identify at user device and may output at an access token and any requested user information to content provider . Content provider may generate and output at personalized and or secure content based on the access token and user information.

As shown in content provider may provide at a web page with a JavaScript client to user device . User device may unsuccessfully attempt at to contact INAD and may locate at an AMS signed authentication token associated with content provider . The authentication token may have been obtained previously e.g. at in and or at in . The AMS signed authentication token may be for example a token signed by AMS . In some implementations the AMS signed authentication token may include an eMDN. Further in some implementations the AMS signed token may further include a signature associated with user device .

User device may output at the located AMS signed token or in some situations the located AMS and user device signed token to AMS . AMS may validate the AMS signature and in some situations the user device signature of the token decrypt the eMDN included in the token and may identify at policies and or assurance level information. Once the signature s of the token have been validated at the devices illustrated in this figure may perform similar operations as described above e.g. with respect to in order to authenticate user device and to provide personalized and or secure content to user device .

As mentioned above illustrates another example of how an AMS signed token stored by user device may be used to authenticate user device . In the example shown in A user device communicated with AMS in order to validate the AMS signed token prior to providing the token to content provider . In the example shown in user device may provide at a previously received AMS signed token to content provider instead of providing the AMS signed token to AMS . Content provider may validate at the AMS signed token based on a public key associated with AMS and may store the token. Content provider may output at an authentication request including the AMS signed token to AMS .

AMS may authenticate and or identify at user device based on the AMS signed token and may obtain additional credentials if necessary. For example if an assurance level and or policy indicates that additional credentials should be obtained e.g. if content associated with content provider is sensitive if the previously obtained AMS signed token has expired etc. AMS may request the additional credentials from user device . Based on authenticating and identifying user device AMS may output at an access token as well as any requested user information to content provider which may output at personalized and or secure content to user device .

As shown in content provider may provide at a web page with a JavaScript client to user device . User device may attempt at to contact INAD . For example as described above with respect to authentication client user device may send a message destined for INAD and the message may fail to reach INAD e.g. may time out . The attempt to contact INAD may fail for instance if the address associated with INAD is a private address associated with a particular network to which user device is not connected. In this situation user device may be roaming. In other examples INAD may be unavailable due to an outage e.g. a network outage and or a hardware failure.

Based on failing to contact INAD user device may attempt at to locate a previously received authentication token. In this example the authentication token may not be available if user device had not previously attempted to log in to content provider if user device had not been successfully authenticated to access content provider and or if any such prior authentication token was deleted.

Based on failing to locate a prior authentication token user device may generate at a null authentication token. The null authentication token may be signed by authentication client . This signature may be used e.g. by AMS to identify content provider . That is different application servers may be associated with different authentication clients and thus different signatures. The null authentication token may include other information such as identifying information associated with user device a timestamp at which the null authentication token was created and or other information. User device may output at an authentication request to AMS . The authentication request may include the null authentication token e.g. as generated at .

AMS may validate at the token and identify the null value of the token. For example as described above with respect to authentication module in order to validate the token AMS may use a key associated with authentication client . The null value of the token may indicate that user device should be manually authenticated e.g. based on credentials provided by user device . AMS may thus obtain at user credentials from user device . The user credentials may be for example a username and password biometric information and or other credentials. AMS may authenticate at user device based on the obtained credentials e.g. using profile information stored in profile module .

AMS may also identify at service policies and or assurance level information associated with content provider . As mentioned above e.g. with respect to assurance level module and service policies module the service policy information may indicate for example whether the authentication should be allowed to continue and the assurance level information may indicate which if any additional credentials are required for authentication. If additional credentials are required e.g. as indicated by the assurance level information AMS may obtain at the additional credentials from user device .

Once user device has been authenticated e.g. based on credentials obtained at and or additional credentials obtained at AMS may generate at an AMS signed token. The AMS signed token may include a value e.g. a signature value indicating that the token has been signed by AMS . In some implementations the signed token may include an identifier e.g. a random number which may be used by AMS in subsequent authorization and or identification operations as described below.

As further shown AMS may output at the AMS signed token to user device . User device may sign and store at the AMS signed token. User device may output at the AMS signed token to content provider . Content provider may validate at the AMS signed token using a public key associated with AMS .

Once the token has been validated as being associated with AMS content provider may output at an authentication request to AMS . This authentication request may include the AMS signed token. AMS may authenticate at the AMS signed token e.g. using a private key associated with AMS . As mentioned above the authentication request may include a request for certain information associated with user device e.g. name of a user address present location etc. . In some implementations AMS may identify user device based on information included in the authentication request e.g. based on a random number or other identifier assigned by AMS previously at .

Based on authenticating and identifying at user device AMS may output at an access token to content provider as well as the requested user information e.g. user profile information . In some implementations AMS may provide at the access token to content provider without outputting additional user information. Content provider may subsequently request user information from AMS and or from another device. When subsequently requesting user information from AMS content provider may include the access token in the subsequent request. As discussed above with respect to content generation module content provider may generate personalized and or secure content for user device and may output at the personalized and or secure content. User device may for example display the content via a web browser and or another application.

Process may include receiving at an authorization request for access to a content provider from a user device. For example as described above AMS may receive an authorization request from user device that indicates whether user device was previously authenticated by INAD and or by AMS . For example the request may include a null identification token which may indicate that user device was not previously authenticated. As another example the request may include an eMDN and or a signature from AMS which may indicate that user device was previously authenticated.

Process may also include authenticating at the user device based on the request. For example as described above AMS may request authentication credentials when the request includes a null identification token. As another example AMS may forgo requesting authentication credentials when the request includes an eMDN and or a signature from AMS .

Process may further include verifying at based on service policies that the user device should be allowed to be automatically authenticated. For example as described above AMS may determine that user device should not be allowed to access content provider and or that user device should not be allowed to be automatically authenticated in certain situations. Such situations may be based on for example parental controls security protocols etc.

Assuming that AMS verified at that the authentication should be allowed to continue process may additionally include determining at based on assurance level information whether additional user credentials are necessary. For example content provider may have specified that additional user credentials are necessary in addition to the automatic network based authentication. Content provider may specify that additional user credentials are necessary for example when content provider provides secure or sensitive content such as financial information.

Process may also include obtaining at additional user credentials if necessary based on the assurance level information. For example AMS may request the additional user credentials if specified by content provider .

Process may further include generating at a signed token. For example as described above AMS may generate an AMS signed token which may signify that user device has been authenticated by AMS . The AMS signed token may include a timestamp which may aid in determining at a later time whether the AMS signed token has expired or not. The AMS signed token may also include an identifier associated with user device . The identifier may include a randomly generated number e.g. a number generated by AMS and or another identifier.

Process may additionally include storing and or outputting at the signed token. For example AMS may provide the AMS signed token to user device . AMS may store information regarding the identifier e.g. the generated random number of user device for later use.

As shown process may include receiving at an authentication request including an AMS signed token. For example as described above AMS may include an authorization request from content provider which may include an AMS signed token. Content provider may have obtained the AMS signed token from user device which may have obtained the token at a prior time from AMS as described above. As also mentioned above the authentication request may include a request for certain types of information regarding user device e.g. a user s name address present location and or other information .

Process may also include authenticating and identifying at the user device. For example as described above AMS may authenticate user device based on the AMS signed token. For instance AMS may use a private key associated with AMS to decrypt the AMS signature of the token in order to verify the signature. As also described above the authentication request may include an identifier e.g. a random number previously assigned by AMS which may be used by AMS to identify user device and locate a profile associated with user device .

Process may further include outputting at an access token including any requested user device identity information. For example the access token may indicate to content provider that content provider should grant access to user device e.g. that AMS has authenticated user device based on the AMS signed token . AMS may also output any requested information regarding user device .
