In one or more embodiments the system can provide wired and wireless access to communication services and media services for mobile communication devices computer devices and media processor devices . For example a mobile communication device can communicate through the IMS network via a cellular network including base stations and or a gateway device using wireless communications. In various embodiments the mobile communication device can access Internet based services via the IMS network . For example the mobile communication device can access the first application and or a second application . The first and second application and can be third party services such as social media sites news sites streaming media sites service providers service carriers and or search sites.

In one or more embodiments the system can incorporate functions of a service provider and or network carrier for offering services of the provider carrier and or services from third parties. The system can provide databases and which include a set of parameters for each subscriber to the system . For example the system can include a primary data repository and a secondary data repository . The primary and secondary data repositories and can include subscriber and or user profile information of a variety of types. These types can include personal identification information demographic information location information subscription service information device configuration information and or preference information. The user profile information that is stored in the primary and secondary data repositories and is used by the system to provide consistent performance of the system as user communication devices and access services from and or through the system . For example when a mobile communication device is powered on and registers to the IMS network the IMS network can access a data repository to obtain profile information that is associated with the mobile communication device and or a user of the device . In addition the IMS network can access the data repository profile information as the mobile communication device access the services of the IMS network .

In one or more embodiments the primary and secondary data repositories and can be utilized in a manner that provides security and accessibility for profile information. The primary data repository can include all profile data for subscribers in the network including services used by those subscribers. In one embodiment the primary data repository can be in the form of a Consolidated Network Repository CNR that includes subscriber profile data and rules and policies for accessing this information. In one or more embodiments the primary data repository can be a restricted and confidential database that is accessible only via proprietary services within the IMS network . Third party companies such as the first and second applications and can have little or no direct access to the information at the primary data repository . By maintaining a strict limit on accessibility to the primary data repository the system can protect subscriber data from malicious acts such as hacker attacks and can ensure security and integrity of subscriber profiles and rights as well as reliable system performance. The primary data repository can store user profile information associated with third party applications however access to and modification of this profile information can be strictly limited.

In one or more embodiments the second data repository can provide a more accessible database for the system . For example the second data repository can allow third party applications and to access and or modify user profile information in the database. And application programming interface API of the second data repository can allow third party applications to perform standard database functions such as searching accessing modifying editing adding and or deleting user profile information that is associated with the third party application. In one or more embodiments secondary data repository can be configured as a Shadow CNR for the system . The secondary data repository can receive a copy of the profile information that is stored at the primary data repository . This approach allows the system to maintain a permanent and secure set of user profile information at the primary data repository while simultaneously maintaining an up to date version of the same user profile information at the secondary data repository in a form that can be easily accessed and or modify by third party applications and or user devices and .

In one or more embodiments the secondary data repository can access rules and policies that govern access and or modification of the user profile information that is stored at the secondary data repository . Similarly the primary data repository can access rules and policies for the restricted access and or modification and or replication of the secured user profile information stored at the primary data repository . In one or more embodiments the system can include additional data repositories that can be designated for specific services third party services and or users. These additional data repositories can receive replicated user profile information from the primary data repository .

In one or more embodiments the system can include a dynamic profile adaptation server or simply adaptation server . The adaptation server can provide a policy of security function for monitoring and the policing modifications to user profile information performed at the secondary data repository . As application services including third party applications modify user profile information associated with those applications the information contained in the secondary data repository can differ from that contained in the primary data repository . The adaptation server can determine when modified user profile information should be imported back to the primary data repository .

In one or more embodiments the adaptation server can monitor modifications in user profile information at the second data repository and determine from the application in use by communication device and or a context of service whether a usage event has occurred. For example the adaptation server can detect that a user profile associated with a communication device has been modify by an application that performs a navigation function using a global positioning satellite GPS signal. The adaptation server can infer from the modification that the mobile communication device is being moved from one location to another. From this inference the adaptation server can apply rules and policies to determine if the modification to the user profile should be forwarded to the primary data repository as a permanent change or should be confined to the secondary data repository as a temporary change.

In one or more embodiments the adaptation server can draw an inference from a modification in a user profile at the secondary data repository where the inference strongly implies that an operating condition for the communication device has changed. Referring to for example a mobile communication device can at one point in time establish wireless communications to the IMS system via a gateway device . At a later time the mobile communication device can be moved such that it can no longer communicate through the gateway device . Rather the mobile communication device can be communicating to the IMS system via a cellular network . The IMS network and or an application in communication with the mobile communication device can detect the change in location of the device and or change in communication path of the device and can respond to this change by modifying user profile for major associated with the device. The modified user profile information can be stored at the secondary data repository the adaptation server can detect this change in user profile to draw an inference that a usage event has occurred where the specific usage event is a transition in communication path of the mobile communication device . The adaptation server can further draw an inference that the mobile communication device moved from one location to another. In one embodiment the adaptation server can draw inferences based on modifications to user profile information at the secondary data repository . In another embodiment the adaptation server can draw inferences further based upon information that is independent of the second data repository such as GPS information associated with the mobile communication device .

In one or more embodiments modifications to user profile information at the secondary data repository can directly indicate a usage event. For example a modification to user profile can directly indicate a change in user status such as a change in name age location subscription status and or device type or capability. The adaptation server can monitor for such changes and determine directly the nature of a usage event. In other embodiments modifications to user profile information at the secondary data repository are inferential and may have to be combined with other contextual information in determining a usage event. For example an application can detect a change in communication path for a mobile communication device as illustrated in and can respond by modifying the user profile associated with login security for the application. The application can for example alter a user profile configuration governing a maximum number of tries for logging into the application responsive to determining that the communication path has changed. The adaptation server can detect the modification in the user profile information associated with the maximum number of tries for login and draw an inference of a usage event whereby the mobile communication device has changed its communication to the IMS network .

In one or more embodiments the adaptation server can determine whether a modification in a user profile and or a usage event inferred from a modification to user profile should result in an additional modification to a different user profile that is stored secondary data repository . For example where the adaptation server detects a modification in a maximum user login configuration associated with a first application the adaptation server can determine that a similar maximum user login configuration associated with a second application should be changed at the second data repository . The adaptation server can use user profile modifications to anticipate further user profile modification that will benefit operations for a communication device and implement these additional modifications at the second data repository before they are requested. The adaptation server can thereby reduce the need for user intervention in making user profile changes after for example the user has upgraded a mobile communication device . New capabilities and or function of the mobile communication device can create a scenario where a global change in user profile information is beneficial. The adaptation server can detect a first change in user profile at the second data repository can determine that this change is due to a usage event such as the acquisition of a new local communication device and then can propagate this change through a number of user profiles associated with different applications. The adaptation server can then present the newly modified user profile information to the primary data repository for permanent storage.

At step the adaptation server can detect a modification of a user profile at the secondary data repository . The adaptation server can monitor user profiles as well as other information stored at the secondary data repository changes in the stored information. User profile information can be modified by applications and services within a service provider communication network or applications and services managed by other network providers and or third party companies. User profile information can be modified via actions initiated at communication devices of the user and or via applications accessed using the communication devices via the communications network

At step the adaptation server can identify a usage of the four communication device based on a modification of the user profile that has been detected at the secondary data repository . Usage events can be identified where a type of user profile and or modification to that user profile points toward a change in operation at the communications device . The adaptation server can infer a usage event by combining contextual information about the communication devices with the detective modification to the user profile.

At step the adaptation server can modify a second user profile at the secondary data repository based on the usage event. The adaptation server can apply rules and policies that link a detect a change in a first user profile at the secondary data repository one or more further modifications in user profile information at the secondary data repository . The additional modifications to user profile information at the second data repository can be associated with the same application that generated the detected modification to the user profile or can be associated with a different application . The adaptation server can apply rules and policies to detected modifications to user profiles to direct further modification of user profile information at the secondary data repository for specific applications for specific communication devices and or for all devices and or applications accessed by the user subscriber.

At step the adaptation server can replicate user profiles that had been modified at the secondary data repository to the primary data repository according to an update policy . The adaptation server can perform a periodic update to ensure that the user profile information at the primary data repository is kept up to date with changes to user profile information at the secondary data repository . The adaptation server can filter user profile updates such that a safety margin is maintained whereby critical user profile information is quarantined away from automatic update to the primary data repository requires an additional authorization step and or requires an additional delay in storage.

In one or more additional embodiments the adaptation server can predict the behavior of a user by extrapolating a change in user profile at the secondary data repository and or a determined usage event associated with a communication device of the user. For example a user can use a computer device to access a first application at a home environment via a gateway device and then switch to a mobile communication device for access to the first application via a cellular network . The first application can respond by altering a bandwidth of service to the mobile communication device. For example where the first application streams content the altered bandwidth of service can include a streaming codec that is compatible with the lower bandwidth available at the cellular network . This change in bandwidth of service can be detected by the adaptation server as a change in a user profile at the secondary data repository where the first application has initiated to change in user profile using an API. In response to the detection of the change in user profile associated with the first application the adaptation server can determine a usage event associated with a user of the computer device and the mobile communications device whereby the user is now on the go. The inference that the user of the computer device and the mobile communication device is now on the go can further be used by the adaptation server direct a change in security or other services such as a second application reflective of this usage event. Hence the adaptation server can cause additional user profiles to be modified at the secondary data repository . Plus the adaptation server can dynamically change security and performance for multiple applications services and devices of a user.

In one or more embodiments the policies and rules that are applied by the adaptation server can be specific to specific users types of users and or levels of subscription. In one or more embodiments a set of related services applications and or features can be dynamically changed in response to the change of a user profile for any single service application and or feature. For example a change in profile associated with a home media provider service such as interactive television or cable television can cause the adaptation server to change a user profile associated with a home alarm service a lawn and pool service or another service related to the home.

In one or more embodiments where a user purchases a new device with new capabilities and her features information regarding these new capabilities features can be transferred to the secondary data repository . The adaptation server can detect these changes to the secondary data repository and can replicate these changes to the primary data repository as a permanent upgrade.

In one or more embodiments the adaptation server can stop propagation of bad profile information from the secondary data repository the primary data repository to define. A good user profile at the primary data repository is maintained. When a new user profile is received at the secondary data repository the adaptation server can check this user profile against a set of rules and policies that are enforced for user profile information that is to be stored at the primary data repository . Where the set of rules and policies are violated the adaptation server can prevent the new user profile from being forwarded to the primary data repository . Alternatively the adaptation server can prevent the new user profile information from remaining at the secondary data repository . In another alternative the adaptation server can require an additional security measure such as requiring a user authentication step before allowing storage of the new user profile at the secondary data repository and or replication of the new user profile at the primary data repository . In this way rules and policies can allow certain changes to be made easily while certain other changes are difficult.

In one or more embodiments adaptation server can contact a change in user profile associated with a first application at the secondary data repository . In response to this change the adaptation server can notify a communication device of a user that the modification has been detected and can request an acknowledgment and or an authentication from the user before allowing the modification to remain the secondary data repository . In another embodiment the adaptation server can notify a second application with information regarding the modification to the user profile associated with the first application . The second application can proactively suggest a similar modification of user profile to a user.

In one or more embodiments the application server can generate a report of current user profile settings and or modifications. The report can be aggregated to conceal personal information. The report can be made available to third parties for data mining. Alternatively third parties can access user profile data at the secondary data repository using an API. A user subscriber can opt in or opt out from data mining activities involving user profile information stored at the secondary data repository and or monitored by the adaptation server .

The IMS network can establish communications between IMS compliant communication devices CDs Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN CDs and combinations thereof by way of a Media Gateway Control Function MGCF coupled to a PSTN network . The MGCF need not be used when a communication session involves IMS CD to IMS CD communications. A communication session involving at least one PSTN CD may utilize the MGCF .

IMS CDs can register with the IMS network by contacting a Proxy Call Session Control Function P CSCF which communicates with an interrogating CSCF I CSCF which in turn communicates with a Serving CSCF S CSCF to register the CDs with the HSS . To initiate a communication session between CDs an originating IMS CD can submit a Session Initiation Protocol SIP INVITE message to an originating P CSCF which communicates with a corresponding originating S CSCF . The originating S CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to one or more application servers ASs that can provide a variety of services to IMS subscribers.

For example the application servers can be used to perform originating call feature treatment functions on the calling party number received by the originating S CSCF in the SIP INVITE message. Originating treatment functions can include determining whether the calling party number has international calling services call ID blocking calling name blocking 7 digit dialing and or is requesting special telephony features e.g. 72 forward calls 73 cancel call forwarding 67 for caller ID blocking and so on . Based on initial filter criteria iFCs in a subscriber profile associated with a CD one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call originating feature services.

Additionally the originating S CSCF can submit queries to the ENUM system to translate an E.164 telephone number in the SIP INVITE message to a SIP Uniform Resource Identifier URI if the terminating communication device is IMS compliant. The SIP URI can be used by an Interrogating CSCF I CSCF to submit a query to the HSS to identify a terminating S CSCF associated with a terminating IMS CD such as reference . Once identified the I CSCF can submit the SIP INVITE message to the terminating S CSCF . The terminating S CSCF can then identify a terminating P CSCF associated with the terminating CD . The P CSCF may then signal the CD to establish Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP communication services thereby enabling the calling and called parties to engage in voice and or data communications. Based on the iFCs in the subscriber profile one or more application servers may be invoked to provide various call terminating feature services such as call forwarding do not disturb music tones simultaneous ringing sequential ringing etc.
