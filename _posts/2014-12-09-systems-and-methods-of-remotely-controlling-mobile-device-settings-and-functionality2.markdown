This patent application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 62 033 954 filed Aug. 6 2014. Application Ser. No. 62 033 954 is fully incorporated herein by reference.

Each year thousands of cell phones are taken to stores and repair centers. Many of these phones aren t really broken or could be easily fixed but are instead returned and stores are stuck with a plethora of broken cell phones. Current solutions include remotely performing diagnostics and repairs of computers and mobile devices. Generally these solutions guide a customer care associate through the process of diagnosing the issue fixing it on the spot or processing a repair ticket. That keeps the customer happy because in more situations than not the customer walks out with his phone data intact or knowing that his phone is truly broken and will be fixed.

In the support process the customer care associate may educate the customer thus decreasing the likelihood that the customer returns with the same problem.

A first way that cell phone support software works is by a self service application app installed on the phone at the point of sale. The app allows the customer to troubleshoot the problem himself and learn the best uses of his phone which will save embarrassing user error store visits. This way is prone to users inappropriately applying suggested solutions.

A second way is called over the air OTA . The smart phone can be diagnosed using a call center system. A call center representative can view the system generated diagnostics. However the call center representative must go step by step through a resolution process with the customer. This is a time consuming process with no guarantees that the customer will remember the process of fixing for future reference or that the customer s device can be repaired as the customer care representative promises due to specialized current device settings or other installed apps that may cause other problems if the repair is attempted.

In various implementations the technology facilitates interactions between the user of a mobile telecommunications or tablet device and a call center in order to help the user reduce interaction with a customer care system or to streamline or eliminate some of the oral interactions during a voice call with a human agent that are necessary to resolve the user s problem or request.

A system described in detail below facilitates interactions with computer telephony integration CTI equipment. A software component can permit connectivity to server based components that in turn interface with a gateway server or CTI resources. For example the system provides information appearing on the display of a call center agent s terminal such as the context of a caller who is routed to the agent. The agent may see if the user was prior to initiating a call using a menu of the help application to obtain technical support information. In another example the agent sees that a user has already provided account login or authentication information into a graphical user interface of the user s mobile telecommunications device. Accordingly the call center agent may not need to orally ask for authentication information during a phone call with the user thereby saving time of the agent and the user.

The system may automatically display information relating to a caller on an agent s computer screen such as information relating to the caller s account the caller s mobile device the caller s billing information the history of recent interactions with the caller other customer relationship management CRM information for the caller the likely reasons why the caller may be calling or suggested answers to likely questions diagnostic information about the caller s mobile device diagnostic information about coverage related issues associated with the caller s mobile device diagnostic information about settings associated with the caller s mobile device and so on.

The diagnostic information may also store or receive information that a caller or potential caller s mobile device has recently experienced an unexpected malfunction. The diagnostic information may subsequently be displayed on a call center agent s computer monitor. The call center agent s computer monitor will present a single issue solutions button that when activated will resolve a discovered diagnostic issue. The single issue solution button is presented provided that an eligibility check has successfully been completed relative to the associated issue.

Various examples of the invention will now be described. The following description provides certain specific details for a thorough understanding and enabling description of these examples. One skilled in the relevant technology will understand however that the invention may be practiced without many of these details. Likewise one skilled in the relevant technology will also understand that the invention may include many other obvious features not described in detail herein. Additionally some well known structures or functions may not be shown or described in detail below to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the relevant descriptions of the various examples.

The terminology used below is to be interpreted in its broadest reasonable manner even though it is being used in conjunction with a detailed description of certain specific examples of the invention. Indeed certain terms may even be emphasized below however any terminology intended to be interpreted in any restricted manner will be overtly and specifically defined as such in this Detailed Description section.

The diagnostics back end system could support multiple call centers and retail stores for allowing them to view diagnostics information. Even end users may be able to fix their own phones from a desktop PC in the future with support from the diagnostics back end system . The diagnostics back end system determines solutions to malfunctions or issues related to a particular mobile device in order to improve the user s experience of the mobile device. The diagnostics back end system determines whether the user s mobile device and or the user s account settings indicate that the user s mobile device is eligible for application of any determined solution. If the diagnostics back end system determines that the user s mobile device is eligible then a single solution button menu item or link is presented on a graphical user interface GUI at the agent s terminal . Activation of the single solution button menu or link by the agent causes communication with a client side app located at the user s mobile device . The client side app applies the solution to the identified issues based on information included within the communication and solution action information already stored at the mobile device and based on various levels of user authorization if applicable.

The mobile device includes processing device s memory for storing a client side app and one or more user interface devices e.g. keyboard touchscreen display mouse etc. . The client side app is executable by the processing device . The user interface includes a graphical user interface. Other mobile devices may have user interfaces different from the user interface .

The networks may include any of wireless telecommunication networks e.g. a cellular network such as a global system for mobile communications network GSM a code division multiple access CDMA network a 3G 4G network an IEEE 802.11 or 802.16 family network such as a WiFi or WiMAX network a satellite communications network and so on. The networks support the transmission of data. For example the networks may support the transmission of data over a wired and or wireless telecommunication network via any one or a combination of the following techniques short messaging service SMS including binary SMS general packet radio service GPRS 3GPP long term evolution LTE Internet protocol IP hypertext transport protocols HTTPS session initiated protocol SIP and any other techniques known in the art for delivering data across wired or wireless networks.

The memory of the diagnostics back end system includes a plurality of processor executable modules. The processor executable modules may include a diagnostics solutions module a device information module a coverage information module an account information module an eligibility module and a presentation module .

Upon a service session initiation between an agent at the agent terminal and a user at the mobile device the diagnostics solutions module determines any issues that are present based on information received from any of the device information module the coverage information module and or the account information module . The determination of issues may not be dependent upon service session initiation but may occur at any time. The diagnostics solutions module determines whether solutions exist for resolving any of the identified diagnostic issues. The eligibility module determines if the user s mobile device is eligible for application of a determined solution i.e. execution eligibility for the solution based on information provided by the modules . In response to a determination of the existence of an eligible solution the presentation module presents a single resolution button at a user interface device at the agent terminal .

Agent activation of the single resolution button menu or link causes the processor to transmit a solution message generated by the diagnostic solutions module to the mobile device via the network s . Upon reception of the solution message the processor validates the received message then performs one or more action steps that are based on a solution identifier portion of the message in accordance with any applicable parameters included within the message.

In some examples the solution message is at most 160 characters in length. This is to accommodate various network transmission protocols such as the short message service SMS protocol.

The client side app identifies resolution actions that are to be performed based on the solution identifier. The client side app uses any included parameters when performing the identified actions.

The resolution actions may require the user to perform one of a number of authorizations due to a previously determined severity level associated with actions that are to be performed on the mobile device.

After execution of the resolution actions the mobile device sends a communication to the agent via the user interface of the agent terminal informing the agent that the solution has been applied. The mobile device may also inform the agent when the solution has failed to complete or has not been initiated either because the user failed to authorize initiation or for some other reason.

In various implementations the processor may be implemented by a single processor on a single computing device by multiple processors on a single computing device or by multiple processors on multiple computing devices.

The memory devices or may be any one or a combination of storage devices e.g. RAM flash memory or other memory devices . The memory devices or may contain data and computer executable instructions which may be executed by the associated processor or . The data and computer executable instructions may implement operating systems and application programming interfaces APIs for interfacing with the operating systems or other libraries such as may be provided or compiled by software development toolkits SDKs . APIs and SDKs facilitate the development and maintenance of software or firmware widgets applications and other code. An operating system contained in the memory devices or may include one that is open to third party application development i.e. has APIs available for independent software vendors to utilize when writing code examples including Apple iOS Google Android Microsoft Windows phone or Windows Mobile and Symbian operating systems or one that is not open to third party application development.

In various implementations portions of the computer executable code facilitate interactions between the user of the mobile device and the diagnostics back end system . The UI may include a graphical user interface based application which may provide functionality to assist the user to perform tasks related to the diagnostics back end such as performing troubleshooting problems e.g. technical device problems could be supported by a call center related to the manufacturer of the mobile device or by the wireless service provider receiving other customer support and so on.

The client side app facilitates communicating with the diagnostics back end and providing functionality relating to the diagnostics back end .

Some exemplary processes using the system described above will now be provided. These are only examples and many other examples are of course possible. Further based on such examples one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate general features of the present system to allow a mobile device to more effectively interact with a call center diagnostics back end.

Next at a decision block the processor executes the eligibility module in order to determine if any of the solutions identified as a result of the diagnostics solutions analysis are resolvable based on predefined eligibility rules and based on information associated with the particular mobile device .

The determination of eligibility analyzes many different factors when determining resolution eligibility. Some factors may include any of the following 

If at the decision block the eligibility rules do not allow execution of any identified solutions or no solutions issues were identified in the diagnostic analysis then at a block no action is performed. If however at the decision block a solution is eligible for execution based on the eligibility rules then at a block the processor executing the presentation module causes presentation of a single fix it button for each issue that is identified as eligible for resolution. Next at a block after the agent has selected the presented fix it button the processor generates and sends a resolution message to the particular mobile device.

If the received resolution message is determined not to be authentic then at a block the received resolution message is ignored disregarded. However if at the decision block the resolution message was authenticated by the processor then at a block the processor executing the client side application identifies any actions that are included within or associated with information stored in the received resolution message and parameters if included in the resolution message. The memory of the mobile device may include a lookup table LUT or similar storage mechanism for storing sets of actions to perform based on issue identifiers included in resolution messages.

At a block the processor performs the identified actions by applying any of the associated identified parameters. Then at a block the mobile device reports the results of the actions to the diagnostics back end and in particular to the agent terminal with the open customer care tool associated with the mobile device .

A third exemplary type of diagnostics includes requested diagnostics at block . The requested diagnostics may be those diagnostic checks specifically requested by an administrative entity the entity responsible for operation of the diagnostics solutions module or by the user of the mobile device . A fourth exemplary type of diagnostics includes live session diagnostics at block . The live session diagnostics are performed during an active session between the mobile device and the diagnostics back end system .

At block the diagnostics information generated at blocks is collected. At block an issue for possible resolution is identified if the associated diagnostic information meets associated predefined thresholds. Associated threshold values may be based on any of user requirements desires system requirements or other optimization requirements. The predefined thresholds relate specifically to particular information that was diagnosed. For example if the information diagnosed was a download data rate then any download data rate below a threshold rate will trigger an issue for possible resolution.

If the severity determination equates to some user impact then at a block an accept deny prompt is presented at the UI of the particular mobile device . If the severity determination equates to low impact then at a block the particular mobile device is notified that the agent can perform resolution actions associated with the diagnosed issue.

The following are tasks that an agent may perform at the agent terminal at his discretion without the user s authorization for making changes at or associated with the mobile device 

Single issue resolution buttons menu items or links are presented below the areas . The presentation of the single issue resolution button menu item or link means that all eligibility factors have been cleared for execution of actions previously defined for resolving the identified issue. In this example a single resolution button is presented upon successful completion of an eligibility check performed by the processor when executing the eligibility module . The single resolution button relates to resolution action s associated with the device s identified issue shown in the first area . The resolution of the device s identified issue was determined by the processor when executing the diagnostics solutions module . In this example the device s identified issue is that the application Express New Pro that is installed on the particular user s device is crashing during operation.

The following is an example of an agent s initiating a single application uninstall for that customer s mobile device. An application program interface API may be exposed HTTP or other IP methods. The API may accept the mobile device s international mobile equipment identity IMEI mobile station integrated services digital network MSISDN as a primary input parameter. TODO align with call center service. The API may accept rep identity tokens such as Windows NT User ID as an input parameter for logging purposes. The API may return proper hypertext transfer protocol HTTP error codes for relevant successes failures 

If the diagnostics back end service is unavailable for any reason an error code may be generated and the response returned immediately as above. All network communications may be encrypted. All commands may be authenticated against diagnostics back end system so that only requests from the network infrastructure are passed to the mobile device. Only authorized network provider clients may be allowed to access the service and perform fixes from single button activation.

The network provider may recommend client secure socket layer SSL certificates to be used to meet this specification. Access to the system may be logged. Logs may include 

Audit logs may be retained according to the overall system auditing and logging policies. Each API may be implemented behind a static IP address or fully qualified domain name.

The following relates to a single button for resolving incorrect access point name APN settings based on the diagnostics check determining a need to update APN settings of the mobile device to values selected at the agent system . The processor executing the diagnostics solutions module recommends the best APN settings for the particular type of mobile device. When applying the recommendation the mobile device will do whatever it needs to do to update the APN settings data e.g. cycle data session or reboot automatically . Execution of this recommendation does not send a user a confirmation prompt. The processor determines that a precondition that must occur before fixing the APN settings is that the mobile device has a currently active APN profile. Communication of a resolution message may need to utilize SMS if data communication is not working due to an improperly configured APN. The client side app may check connectivity to back end services before trying SMS. The client side app may be shipped or loaded into the mobile device with embedded APN profiles so that an SMS may reference the embedded APN profile so that all the profile data do not have to be sent via SMS. The actions for fixing the incorrect APN settings need to replicate actions that an OS does when Reset to Default is selected for the APN settings.

A jumplist presented at the agent terminal allows the agent to quickly navigate on behalf of the customer through different areas of the customer s mobile device. No pre connectivity or prompt is required of the end user. Activities are called by a client service application which receives commands from the agent and navigates to the respective area of the device immediately.

Although the invention has been described in language specific to structural features and or methodological steps it is to be understood that the invention defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the specific features or steps described. Rather the specific features and steps are disclosed as preferred forms of implementing the claimed invention.
