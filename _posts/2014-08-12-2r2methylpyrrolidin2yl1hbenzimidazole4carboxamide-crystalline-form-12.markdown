The following examples are presented to provide what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of procedures and conceptual aspects of this invention.

A mixture of ABT 888 dihydrochloride 10 g was stirred in saturated potassium bicarbonate 50 mL and n butanol 50 mL until the ABT 888 dihydrochloride completely dissolved. The aqueous layer was extracted with a second portion of n butanol then discarded. The extracts were combined washed with 15 sodium chloride solution 50 mL and concentrated. The concentrate was chase distilled three times with heptane 50 mL dissolved in refluxing 2 propanol 45 mL and filtered hot. The filtrate was cooled to ambient temperature with stirring over 18 hours cooled to 0 5 C. stirred for 1 hour and filtered. The filtrant was washed with 2 propanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 45 50 C. with a slight nitrogen purge.

A mixture of ABT 888 in methanol in which the ABT 888 was completely dissolved was concentrated at about 35 C. and the concentrate was dried to a constant weight.

In one embodiment of Step 1 the volume of water for dissolution of the Dihydrochloride 15 is about 1.3 g water g 15. In another embodiment of Step 1 the volume of water for dissolution is about 1.3 g to about 4 g water g 15. In another embodiment of Step 1 the volume of water for dissolution is 1.3 g to 3.5 g water g 15. In another embodiment of Step 1 the volume of water for dissolution is 3.5 g water g 15.

In one embodiment of Step 2 the pH after addition of NaOH solution is between about pH 11 and pH 10. In another embodiment the pH is just under 10. In another embodiment of Step 2 equential additions of NaOH and NaCOwere performed for neutralization. Sodium carbonate has the property of buffering the system in the range of 9.4 to 9.6 once 2.0 equivalents total of base have been added assuming a stoichiometric conversion of NaCOto NaHCO . In another embodiment of Step 2 6 N NaOH solution 21 is used in the conversion. In another embodiment of Step 2 NaCOsolutions as concentrated as 15 are used in the conversion.

In one embodiment of Step 3 1.1 equivalent of base is added 1.0 equiv. NaOH and 0.1 equiv. NaCO . In another embodiment of Step 3 from about 1.1 to about 1.34 equivalent of base is added. In another embodiment of Step 3 more than 1.34 equivalent of base is added. In another embodiment 2.5 equivalent of base 1.0 equiv. NaOH plus 1.5 equiv. NaCO is added.

In another embodiment of Step 4 3 portions of 1 kg water kg 15 are used in the wash. In another embodiment of Step 4 the wash is mixed with the cake to increase the contact time.

In another embodiment crystal size and strength may be affected by initiating crystallization through seeding prior to addition of the first 0.1 equivalent of sodium carbonate. In another embodiment the batch is cooled prior to crystallization. In another embodiment a miscible solvent such as ethanol or isopropanol is added to the reaction.

Powder X ray diffraction was performed using an XDS 2000 X ray diffractometer equipped with a 2 kW normal focus X ray tube and a Peltier cooled germanium solid state detector Scintag Inc. Sunnyvale Calif. . The data were processed using DMSNT software version 1.37 . The X ray source was a copper filament Cu K at 1.54178 operated at 45 kV and 40 mA. The alignment of the goniometer was checked daily using a Corundum standard.

The sample was placed in a thin layer with no prior grinding onto a zero background plate and continuously scanned at a rate of 2 2 per minute over a range of 2 40 2 .

It is meant to be understood that relative intensities of peak heights in a PXRD pattern may vary and will be dependent on variables such as the temperature size of crystal size or morphology sample preparation or sample height in the analysis well of the X ray diffractometer.

It is also meant to be understood that peak positions may vary when measured with different radiation sources. For example Cu K Mo K Co K and Fe K radiation having wavelengths of 1.54060 0.7107 1.7902 and 1.9373 respectively may provide peak positions which differ from those measured with Cu K radiation which has a wavelength of 1.5478 .

The term about preceding a series of peak positions means that all of the peaks of the group which it precedes are reported in terms of angular positions two theta with an allowable variability of 0.1 as specified by the U.S. Pharmacopeia pages 1843 1884 1995 . The variability of 0.1 is intended to be used when comparing two powder X ray diffraction patterns. In practice if a diffraction pattern peak from one pattern is assigned a range of angular positions two theta which is the measured peak position 0.1 and if those ranges of peak positions overlap then the two peaks are considered to have the same angular position. For example if a peak from one pattern is determined to have a position of 11.0 for comparison purposes the allowable variability allows the peak to be assigned a position in the range of 10.9. 11.1 .

Accordingly for example the phrase about 9.9 11.0 and 11.8 and one or more than one additional peaks having respective 2 values of about 14.6 15.2 18.2 19.6 20.3 21.3 22.5 22.8 24.7 28.5 and 29.1 as used herein means about 9.9 about 11.0 and about 11.8 and one or more than one additional peaks having respective 2 values of about 14.6 about 15.2 about 18.2 about 19.6 about 20.3 about 21.3 about 22.5 about 22.8 about 24.7 about 28.5 and about 29.1 and also means 9.9 0.1 11.0 0.1 and 11.8 0.1 and one or more than one additional peaks having respective 2 values of about 14.6 0.1 15.2 0.1 18.2 0.1 19.6 0.1 20.3 0.1 21.3 0.1 22.5 0.1 22.8 0.1 24.7 0.1 28.5 0.1 and 29.1 0.1 .

The term about preceding a temperature means the given temperature 2 C. For example about 25 C. means 25 C. 2 C. or 23 C. 27 C.

Heat flow was measured using a differential scanning calorimeter model 2920 with Thermal Advantage version 1.1A operating software TA Instruments New Castle Del. . A sample 1 4 mg was weighed into an aluminum pan and the pan was covered with and aluminum lid containing a pinhole to allow vapor to escape. The partially sealed pan was placed in the furnace and heated in an open pan at a rate of 10 C. min. Indium standards were used for temperature and heat of fusion calibration. Data analysis was performed using separate software Universal Analysis for Windows 2000 XP version 4.2E TA Instruments New Castle Del. .

As shown in when heated at 10 C. min ABT 888 Crystalline Form 1 exhibits a single endothermic event corresponding to melting at 188.3 C. Multiple determinations showed a melting point 188.6 0.8 C.

Raman spectra were measured using a laser Raman spectrometer RamanRxnl HTS 785 785 nm NIR laser and model HLS L microprobe with Holograms version 4.004.0.0230 and Holomap version 2.3.4 software Kaiser Optical Systems Inc. Ann Arbor Mich. .

Transmission infrared spectra of the solids were obtained using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer Nicolet Magna 750 FT IR Spectrometer Nicolet Instrument Corporation Madison Wis. equipped with a Nicolet NIC PLAN Microscope and MCT A liquid nitrogen cooled detector. The sample was placed on a 13 mm 1 mm BaFdisc sample holder and 64 scans were collected at 4 cmresolution.

The foregoing is meant to be illustrative of the invention and not intended to limit it to the disclosed embodiments. Variations and changes obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be within the scope and nature of the invention as defined in the claims.
