The present application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 723 926 filed Mar. 15 2010 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to control of a mobile communication device s access to services.

Service providers of mobile communication services and 3rd party vendors of mobile communication devices currently do not have a means to identify if mobile communication devices accessing their networks and applications have legitimate access rights. For example a service provider operator such as a provider of email or messaging services or a wireless carrier may decide that they only want devices manufactured in certain geographies to be allowed to connect to their system.

This desire to authenticate mobile communications devices is partly driven by the fact that providers of mobile communication devices often outsource the manufacturing of the devices to outside agencies thus losing some control over the integrity and security of the devices. For example there have been cases where a third party manufacturer had installed wireless modems in credit card readers without the knowledge of the provider of the readers or the end user being aware. Similar infractions can occur in the manufacturing of any type of device including mobile communications devices. Not only does this type of breach of trust affect the security of the information processed by the devices and networks processing the information provided by the devices it affects the trust that customers and service providers have in the devices.

To provide a mechanism for service providers to authenticate mobile communications devices the present application proposes to install a digital certificate on each mobile communication device at the manufacturing stage. The digital certificate comprises a digital signature of an authority. In existing authentication methods used for wireless services it is typically the user that is authenticated. For example by providing a user defined password. Some wireless carriers authenticate removable SIM Subscriber Identity Module cards that are installed on mobile communication devices. As described herein the installation of the digital certificate on the mobile communication device enables the authenticity of the device itself to be verified rather than the user or an exchangeable component.

In an embodiment the digital signature is applied to device specific data using a private encryption key maintained by the authority and can be authenticated using a corresponding public encryption key. Examples of device specific data include but are not limited to device identity and device manufacturing heritage. The device specific data together with the digital signature make up the digital certificate. The certificate with the digital signature can be installed in some embodiments by the manufacturer. In these embodiments the manufacturer is trusted by the authority to maintain control of the private key. In other embodiments the certificate is installed at a testing facility after the mobile communications device is manufactured. In still other embodiments the certificate is installed by a producer of the mobile communications device before shipping the device to a customer such as a user or a service provider. These and other embodiments will be discussed in detail below.

Embodiments of the present application are not limited to any particular operating system mobile device architecture server architecture or computer programming language.

Reference is first made to which shows in block diagram form a communication system in which example embodiments of the present disclosure can be applied. The communication system comprises a number of mobile communication devices mobile devices which may be connected to the remainder of system in any of several different ways. Accordingly several instances of mobile communication devices are depicted in employing different example ways of connecting to system . Mobile communication devices are connected to a wireless communication network which may comprise one or more of a Wireless Wide Area Network WWAN and a Wireless Local Area Network WLAN or other suitable network arrangements. In some embodiments the mobile communication devices are configured to communicate over both the WWAN and WLAN and to roam between these networks. In some embodiments the wireless network may comprise multiple WWANs and WLANs .

The WWAN may be implemented as any suitable wireless access network technology. By way of example but not limitation the WWAN may be implemented as a wireless network that includes a number of transceiver base stations one of which is shown in where each of the base stations provides wireless Radio Frequency RF coverage to a corresponding area or cell. The WWAN is typically operated by a mobile network service provider that provides subscription packages to users of the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments the WWAN conforms to one or more of the following wireless network types Mobitex Radio Network DataTAC GSM Global System for Mobile Communication GPRS General Packet Radio System TDMA Time Division Multiple Access CDMA Code Division Multiple Access CDPD Cellular Digital Packet Data iDEN integrated Digital Enhanced Network EvDO Evolution Data Optimized CDMA2000 EDGE Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication Systems HSDPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or various other networks. Although WWAN is described as a Wide Area network that term is intended herein also to incorporate wireless Metropolitan Area Networks WMAN and other similar technologies for providing coordinated service wirelessly over an area larger than that covered by typical WLANs.

The WWAN may further comprise a wireless network gateway which connects the mobile communication devices to transport facilities and through the transport facilities to a wireless connector system . Transport facilities may include one or more private networks or lines the public internet a virtual private network or any other suitable network. The wireless connector system may be operated for example by an organization or enterprise such as a corporation university or governmental department which allows access to a network such as an internal or enterprise network and its resources or the wireless connector system may be operated by a mobile network provider. In some embodiments the network may be realised using the internet rather than an internal or enterprise network.

The wireless network gateway provides an interface between the wireless connector system and the WWAN which facilitates communication between the mobile communication devices and other devices not shown connected directly or indirectly to the WWAN . Accordingly communications sent via the mobile communication devices are transported via the WWAN and the wireless network gateway through transport facilities to the wireless connector system . Communications sent from the wireless connector system are received by the wireless network gateway and transported via the WWAN to the mobile communication devices .

The WLAN comprises a wireless network which in some embodiments conforms to IEEE 802.11x standards sometimes referred to as Wi Fi such as for example the IEEE 802.11a 802.11b and or 802.11g standard. Other communication protocols may be used for the WLAN in other embodiments such as for example IEEE 802.11n IEEE 802.16e also referred to as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or WiMAX or IEEE 802.20 also referred to as Mobile Wireless Broadband Access . The WLAN includes one or more wireless RF Access Points AP one of which is shown in that collectively provide a WLAN coverage area.

The WLAN may be a personal network of the user an enterprise network or a hotspot offered by an internet service provider ISP a mobile network provider or a property owner in a public or semi public area for example. The access points are connected to an access point AP interface which may connect to the wireless connector system directly for example if the access point is part of an enterprise WLAN in which the wireless connector system resides or indirectly via the transport facilities if the access point is a personal Wi Fi network or Wi Fi hotspot in which case a mechanism for securely connecting to the wireless connector system such as a virtual private network VPN may be appropriate . The AP interface provides translation and routing services between the access points and the wireless connector system to facilitate communication directly or indirectly with the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system may be implemented as one or more servers and is typically located behind a firewall . The wireless connector system manages communications including email messages to and from a set of managed mobile communication devices . The wireless connector system also provides administrative control and management capabilities over users and mobile communication devices which may connect to the wireless connector system .

The wireless connector system allows the mobile communication devices to access the network and connected resources and services such as a messaging server for example a Microsoft Exchange IBM Lotus Domino or Novell GroupWise email messaging server having a global address book an administration server and optionally other servers . The other servers may comprise a content server for providing content such as internet content or content from an organization s internal servers to the mobile communication devices in the wireless network and an application server for implementing server based applications.

The global address book comprises electronic contact records created and maintained by an IT information technology administrator of the network . Typically the global address book is maintained exclusively by the messaging server and there is no local copy on the mobile device . In addition the global address book typically comprises contact records for all users of the respective network e.g. enterprise . The contact records in the global address book may be one or more of individual contact records or user records or a group address or distribution list which lists multiple individual users .

The wireless connector system typically provides a secure exchange of data e.g. email messages personal information manager PIM data and IM data with the mobile communication devices . In some embodiments communications between the wireless connector system and the mobile communication devices are encrypted. In some embodiments communications are encrypted using a symmetric encryption key implemented using Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Triple Data Encryption Standard Triple DES encryption. Private encryption keys are generated in a secure two way authenticated environment and are used for both encryption and decryption of data.

The wireless network gateway is adapted to send data packets received from the mobile device over the WWAN to the wireless connector system . The wireless connector system then sends the data packets to the appropriate connection point such as the messaging server content server or application servers . Conversely the wireless connector system sends data packets received for example from the messaging server or other server to the wireless network gateway which then transmit the data packets to the destination mobile device . The AP interfaces of the WLAN provide similar sending functions between the mobile device the wireless connector system and network connection point such as the messaging server content server and application server .

The network may comprise a private local area network metropolitan area network wide area network the public internet or combinations thereof and may include virtual networks constructed using any of these alone or in combination. Computers may be connected to the network directly or indirectly via an intermediate communication network such as the Internet. When computers connect to the network indirectly e.g. via the Internet a VPN or other mechanism for securely connecting to the network may be appropriate. Computers may be of any suitable construction and include at least a processor and a display screen one or more user input devices and a memory each connected to the processor as is known in the art. The computers could be desktop computers laptop notebook netbook computers or combinations thereof and may have wired or wireless communication subsystems for connecting to the network .

A mobile device may alternatively connect to the wireless connector system using a computer via the network . In at least some embodiments for security purposes the computers with which the mobile devices can connect to the wireless connector system are limited to computers which are directly connected to the network . A link may be provided for exchanging information between the mobile device and computer connected to the wireless connector system . The link may comprise one or both of a physical interface and short range wireless communication interface. The physical interface may comprise one or combinations of an Ethernet connection Universal Serial Bus USB connection Firewire also known as an IEEE 1394 interface connection or other serial data connection via respective ports or interfaces of the mobile device and computer . The short range wireless communication interface may be a personal area network PAN interface. A personal area network is a wireless point to point connection meaning no physical cables are required to connect the two end points.

It will be appreciated that the above described communication system is provided for the purpose of illustration only and that the above described communication system comprises one possible communication network configuration of a multitude of possible configurations for use with the mobile communication devices . The teachings of the present disclosure may be employed in connection with any other type of network and associated devices that are effective in implementing or facilitating wireless communication. Suitable variations of the communication system will be understood to a person of skill in the art and are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure.

Reference is now made to which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the mobile device in which example embodiments described in the present disclosure can be applied. The mobile device is a two way communication device having data and voice communication capabilities and the capability to communicate with other computer systems for example via the Internet. Depending on the functionality provided by the mobile device in various embodiments the device may be a multiple mode communication device configured for both data and voice communication a smartphone a mobile telephone or a PDA personal digital assistant enabled for wireless communication or a computer system with a wireless modem.

The mobile device includes a rigid case not shown housing the components of the device . The internal components of the device are constructed on a printed circuit board PCB . The mobile device includes a controller comprising at least one processor such as a microprocessor which controls the overall operation of the device . The processor interacts with device subsystems such as a wireless communication subsystem sometimes referred to as a radio layer for exchanging radio frequency signals with the wireless network to perform communication functions. The processor interacts with additional device subsystems including a display screen such as a liquid crystal display LCD screen input devices such as a keyboard and control buttons flash memory random access memory RAM read only memory ROM auxiliary input output I O subsystems data port such as serial data port such as a Universal Serial Bus USB data port speaker microphone short range communication subsystem and other device subsystems generally designated as . Some of the subsystems shown in perform communication related functions whereas other subsystems may provide resident or on device functions.

The device may comprise a touchscreen display in some embodiments. The touchscreen display may be constructed using a touch sensitive input surface connected to an electronic controller and which overlays the display screen . The touch sensitive overlay and the electronic controller provide a touch sensitive input device and the processor interacts with the touch sensitive overlay via the electronic controller.

The communication subsystem includes a receiver a transmitter and associated components such as one or more antenna elements and local oscillators LOs and a processing module such as a digital signal processor DSP . The antenna elements and may be embedded or internal to the mobile device and a single antenna may be shared by both receiver and transmitter as is known in the art. As will be apparent to those skilled in the field of communication the particular design of the wireless communication subsystem depends on the wireless network in which mobile device is intended to operate.

The mobile device may communicate with any one of a plurality of fixed transceiver base stations of the wireless network within its geographic coverage area. The mobile device may send and receive communication signals over the wireless network after the required network registration or activation procedures have been completed. Signals received by the antenna through the wireless network are input to the receiver which may perform such common receiver functions as signal amplification frequency down conversion filtering channel selection etc. as well as analog to digital A D conversion. A D conversion of a received signal allows more complex communication functions such as demodulation and decoding to be performed in the DSP . In a similar manner signals to be transmitted are processed including modulation and encoding for example by the DSP . These DSP processed signals are output to the transmitter for digital to analog D A conversion frequency up conversion filtering amplification and transmission to the wireless network via the antenna . The DSP not only processes communication signals but may also provide for receiver and transmitter control. For example the gains applied to communication signals in the receiver and the transmitter may be adaptively controlled through automatic gain control algorithms implemented in the DSP .

The processor operates under stored program control and executes software modules stored in memory such as persistent memory for example in the flash memory . As illustrated in the software modules comprise operating system software software applications comprising an email messaging application also referred to as an email client a personal address book a calendar application a phone application and an authentication module . Example embodiments of the authentication module will be discussed in detail later herein. It is recognized that the authentication module and its various components as described herein can form a discrete module running on the device or the functions of the authentication module can be distributed on the device as separate modules or integrated within other existing modules as desired. Such discrete or distributed implementations all fall within the embodiments of the authentication module as described herein.

The software applications also may include a range of applications including for example a notepad application Internet browser application voice communication i.e. telephony application mapping application or a media player application or any combination thereof. Each of the software applications may include layout information defining the placement of particular fields and graphic elements e.g. text fields input fields icons etc. in the user interface i.e. the display screen according to the application.

Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the software modules or parts thereof may be temporarily loaded into volatile memory such as the RAM . The RAM is used for storing runtime data variables and other types of data or information as will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Although specific functions are described for various types of memory this is merely one example and those skilled in the art will appreciate that a different assignment of functions to types of memory could also be used.

In some embodiments the auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise an external communication link or interface for example an Ethernet connection. The mobile device may comprise other wireless communication interfaces for communicating with other types of wireless networks for example a wireless network such as an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed OFDM network or a GPS Global Positioning System subsystem comprising a GPS receiver or transceiver for communicating with a GPS satellite network not shown . The auxiliary I O subsystems may comprise a pointing or navigational input device such as a clickable trackball or scroll wheel or thumbwheel or a vibrator for providing vibratory notifications in response to various events on the device such as receipt of an electronic message or incoming phone call or for other purposes such as haptic feedback touch feedback .

In some embodiments the mobile device also includes a removable memory card or module typically comprising flash memory and a memory card interface . Network access is typically associated with a subscriber or user of the mobile device via the memory card which may be a Subscriber Identity Module SIM card for use in a GSM network or other type of memory card for use in the relevant wireless network type. The memory card is inserted in or connected to the memory card interface of the mobile device in order to operate in conjunction with the wireless network .

The mobile device also stores other data in an erasable persistent memory which in one example embodiment is the flash memory . In various embodiments the data includes service data comprising information required by the mobile device to establish and maintain communication with the wireless network . The data may also include user application data such as email messages address book and contact information calendar and schedule information notepad documents image files and other commonly stored user information stored on the mobile device by its user and other data. The data stored in the persistent memory e.g. flash memory of the mobile device may be organized at least partially into a number of databases each containing data items of the same data type or associated with the same application. For example email messages contact records and task items may be stored in individual databases within the device memory.

The mobile device also includes a battery as a power source which is typically one or more rechargeable batteries that may be charged for example through charging circuitry coupled to a battery interface such as the serial data port . The battery provides electrical power to at least some of the electrical circuitry in the mobile device and the battery interface provides a mechanical and electrical connection for the battery . The battery interface is coupled to a regulator not shown which provides power V to the circuitry of the mobile device .

The short range communication subsystem is an additional optional component which provides for communication between the mobile device and different systems or devices which need not necessarily be similar devices. For example the subsystem may include an infrared device and associated circuits and components or a wireless bus protocol compliant communication mechanism such as a Bluetooth communication module to provide for communication with similarly enabled systems and devices.

A predetermined set of applications that control basic device operations including data and voice communication applications will normally be installed on the mobile device during or after manufacture. Additional applications and or upgrades to the operating system or software applications may also be loaded onto the mobile device through the wireless network the auxiliary I O subsystem the serial port the short range communication subsystem or other suitable subsystem . The downloaded programs or code modules may be permanently installed for example written into the program memory i.e. the flash memory or written into and executed from the RAM for execution by the processor at runtime. Such flexibility in application installation increases the functionality of the mobile device and may provide enhanced on device functions communication related functions or both. For example secure communication applications may enable electronic commerce functions and other such financial transactions to be performed using the mobile device .

The mobile device may provide two principal modes of communication a data communication mode and a voice communication mode. In the data communication mode a received data signal such as a text message an email message or Web page download will be processed by the communication subsystem and input to the processor for further processing. For example a downloaded Web page may be further processed by a browser application or an email message may be processed by the email messaging application and output to the display . A user of the mobile device may also compose data items such as email messages for example using the input devices in conjunction with the display screen . These composed items may be transmitted through the communication subsystem over the wireless network .

In the voice communication mode the mobile device provides telephony functions and operates as a typical cellular phone. The overall operation is similar except that the received signals are output to the speaker and signals for transmission are generated by a transducer such as the microphone . The telephony functions are provided by a combination of software firmware i.e. the phone application and hardware i.e. the microphone the speaker and input devices . Alternative voice or audio I O subsystems such as a voice message recording subsystem may also be implemented on the mobile device . Although voice or audio signal output is typically accomplished primarily through the speaker the display screen may also be used to provide an indication of the identity of a calling party duration of a voice call or other voice call related information.

The phone application can be split into multiple applications or sub modules for example one or more user phone modules and a call control module. The user phone modules provide a variety of telephony features through a user interface while the call control module provides access to common telephony functions desired by the user phone modules such that telephony requests from phone modules can be coordinated and so that the user phone modules do not need to each provide instructions understood by the wireless communications subsystem . The call control function typically makes telephony features available to user phone modules through an application programming interface API . It is to be recognized that all or part of the phone application features or functions could be provided through the operating system or otherwise distributed in the device while continuing to fall within the term phone application .

Public and private encryption keys are used in secure messaging protocols such as S MIME and PGP based protocols to provide confidentiality and integrity. Data encoded using a private key of a private key public key pair can only be decoded using the corresponding public key of the pair and data encoded using a public key of a private key public key pair can only be decoded using the corresponding private key of the pair. It is intended that private key information never be made public whereas public key information is shared.

Public and private encryption keys are also used to sign a message using a digital signature. A digital signature generally comprises a digest of the message e.g. a hash of the message encoded using the sender s private key which can then be appended to the outgoing message. To verify the digital signature of the message when received the recipient uses the same technique as the sender e.g. using the same standard hash algorithm to obtain a digest of the received message. The recipient also uses the sender s public key to decode the digital signature in order to obtain what should be a matching digest for the received message. If the digests of the received message do not match this suggests that either the message content was changed during transport and or the message did not originate from the sender whose public key was used for verification. Digital signature algorithms are designed in such a way that only someone with knowledge of the signer s private key should be able to encode a signature that the recipient will decode correctly using the signer s public key. Therefore by verifying a digital signature in this way authentication of the signer and message integrity can be maintained.

An encoded message may be encrypted signed or both encrypted and signed. Signed and or encrypted means signed or encrypted or both. In S MIME the authenticity of public keys used in these operations is validated using certificates. A certificate is a digital document issued by a certificate authority CA . Certificates may be used to authenticate the association between users and their public keys and essentially provides a level of trust in the authenticity of the users public keys. Certificates contain information about the certificate holder with certificate contents typically formatted in accordance with an accepted standard e.g. X.509 . The certificates are typically digitally signed by the certificate authority.

Some wireless carriers use IMEI International Mobile Equipment Identity numbers to block stolen mobile communication devices from accessing their respective network. The reporting system for this service is optional and the database is typically only accessible by wireless carriers and not accessible by other service providers. IMEI has as a result not been an effective means for ensuring the authenticity of the mobile communications devices accessing services provided by various service providers.

In the present application certificates are used to verify the authenticity of a mobile communication device. A certificate with a digital signature of an authority such as the manufacturer or the service provider is installed in the device before providing the device to an end user. The certificate can be installed in a memory or can be securely bound to the device by storing a hash code of the certificate in an OTP One Time Programmable memory within one or more components of the device. Using the OTP memory within hardware of the device makes the certificate more secure by making it more expensive to change since it would require replacing at least one hardware component. The digital signature of the authority on the certificate can be verified thus vouching for the authenticity of the mobile communication device.

In some embodiments the certificate is a data packet that contains information related to the mobile communications device and a digital signature of the authority. Non limiting examples of the information that can be in the data packet are a serial number IMEI PIN Personal Identification Number MAC Media Access Control address CPU ID Central Processing Unit Identifier the location where the device was built when the device was built the manufacturer of the device and the carrier on which the device is authorized for use. Alternatively the certificate comprises an identifier for the mobile communications device and the digital signature and any other related information is maintained in a database accessible by a server responsible for verifying the authenticity of the device.

In an exemplary implementation a mobile communication device designed and sold by a producer is manufactured by a third party. The producer in this embodiment is the authority. In some embodiments the producer controls a private encryption key used for applying the digital signature the certificates.

Referring now to an exemplary embodiment of a mobile communication device will now be discussed. The mobile communications device comprises a transmitter a processor a memory and an authentication module . The memory comprises a certificate certifying the authenticity of the mobile communications device . The certificate has a digital signature signed by an authority having control of the authenticity of the mobile communications device and device specific data . Non limiting examples of device specific data include a serial number IMEI PIN MAC address CPU ID the location where the device was built when the device was built the manufacturer of the device and the carrier on which the device is authorized for use. The computer readable medium has computer readable instructions stored thereon that when executed configure the processor to instruct the transmitter to transmit a copy of the certificate to the service provider in response to a request to authenticate the mobile communications device with the service provider. Mobile device described with reference to is a non limiting example of mobile communications device .

The authority that signs the certificate in some cases is the manufacturer of the mobile communications device . In other implementations the authority is a testing organisation that tested the mobile device after it was manufactured. In other implementations the authority is the producer of the mobile device. In the case where manufacturing is outsourced the producer is different from the manufacturer. In still other embodiments the authority is a certification authority given responsibility for installing the certificates by the producer.

The digital signature is any verifiable secure digital mark that is identifiable with the authority. In some embodiments the digital signature is applied to the certificate using a private encryption key. In some such cases the validity of the certificate is verified using a corresponding public encryption key. The corresponding public encryption key can be distributed to services providers by the authority. It is to be understood that any encryption method or other verifiable secure signing means may be used to apply the digital signature to the certificate.

The certificate in some embodiments is installed in the memory while the mobile device is being manufactured. In other embodiments the certificate is installed during testing of the mobile device . In still other embodiments the certificate is installed before delivery of the mobile communications device to a customer. In some embodiments the certificate is installed in one of the hardware components of the device such as the CPU before the component is delivered to the manufacturer of the device. Non limiting examples of a customer are a distributor a service provider and an end user. A service provider can include but is not limited to a wireless carrier a messaging service provider an enterprise service provider an internet service provider a website and an online financial institution such as a bank or credit card company or combinations thereof.

In some embodiments the processor is configured to cause the copy to be transmitted to a server controlled by the service provider. In some implementations it is this server that determines the validity of the certificate. In other implementations this server forwards a request to determine the validity of the certificate to a central organization that maintains information related to certificates signed by the authority. In some implementations the central organisation is the authority. Other examples of a central organisation are the producer of the mobile communication device and a third party organisation entrusted with responsibility for validating certificates of mobile communication devices.

In some embodiments a stronger authentication mechanism is used whereby the mobile communications device is cryptographically challenged by the service provider using a public key contained in its certificate. A private key within the device not written plaintext in the certificate is used by the device to generate a response to the challenge. The private key can be protected in some further way such as but not limited to locked in hardware or a user supplied password.

In an exemplary embodiment the certificate comprises at least one of a unique identifier for the mobile communications device a location where the mobile communications device was built and a carrier on which the mobile communications device is authorized to operate. As mentioned above alternative embodiments employ certificates comprising an identifier for the respective mobile communications device and the digital signature with any other related information being maintained in a database accessible by a server responsible for verifying the authenticity of the device.

The computer readable medium can be implemented using software hardware or combinations thereof. Authentication module shown in is one example.

In some embodiments the processor is configured to cause the copy of the certificate to be transmitted in response to a challenge from the service provider. In still further embodiments the processor is further configured to encrypt the certificate prior to transmitting the certificate to the service provider.

Referring now to a method authenticating a mobile communications device with a service provider will now be described. The method is for implementation on a mobile communications device such as but not limited to mobile device or mobile communications device described herein.

At step the method starts with the mobile communications device receiving a request to authenticate the mobile communications device with the service provider. Then at step the mobile communications device transmits a copy of a certificate certifying the authenticity of the mobile communications device to the service provider in response to the request the certificate being stored in memory on the mobile communications device and comprising a digital signature of an authority having control of the authenticity of the mobile communications device.

In some embodiments receiving the request comprises receiving a challenge from the service provider. In other embodiments the request is received from a user of the mobile communications device through a user interface on the mobile communications device.

In an exemplary implementation the method further comprises receiving from the service provider at least one of an indication that the certificate is valid and an indication that the certificate is invalid. Various implementations of such indications are described above with reference to .

A server will now be described with reference to . The server is configured to authenticate mobile communication devices attempting to access services of a service provider. The server comprises a receiver a memory a processor and a transmitter . The receiver is for receiving a copy of a certificate stored on a mobile communications device attempting to access a service of the service provider the certificate certifying the authenticity of a mobile communications device and comprising a digital signature of an authority having control of the authenticity of the mobile communications device. The memory stores computer readable instructions that when executed configure the processor to make a determination of whether or not the digital signature on the certificate is authentic. The processor implements the instructions in response to receiving the certificate and if the digital signature is determined to be authentic causes the transmitter to transmit an indication that the mobile communications device is authentic to a sender of the copy.

In some embodiments the sender of the copy to the server is the mobile communications device on which the certificate is stored. In other embodiments the copy of the certificate is received from a network element of the service provider and the processor causes the transmitter to transmit the indication the mobile device is authentic to the network element. A non limiting example of a network element is a server. For example the mobile communications device in some implementations sends the copy of the certificate to a server of the service provider which in turn forwards the copy to the server which is responsible for authenticating the mobile device.

In an exemplary embodiment the memory comprises a public encryption key corresponding to a private encryption key used to generate the digital signature and the instructions implemented by the processor use the public key to determine if the digital signature is authentic.

In some embodiments the processor is further configured to cause the transmitter to transmit an indication that the mobile communications device is not authentic if the digital signature is determined to be invalid.

The server in some implementations comprises a database of information related to a list of mobile communications devices the information comprising an indication of whether or not each mobile communications device listed is authorized to access a respective service.

Non limiting examples of the server include at least one of a content server applications server and a messaging server.
