It is an object of the present invention to provide compounds that have a good pesticidal activity in particular insecticidal activity and show a broad activity spectrum against a large number of different invertebrate pests especially against difficult to control arthropod pests and or nematodes.

It has been found that these objectives can be achieved by compounds of the formula I below by their stereoisomers their tautomers their N oxides and by their salts in particular their agriculturally or veterinarily acceptable salts.

The present invention also relates to a compound of the formula INT and to the tautomers and salts thereof

The compounds of formula INT and their tautomers and salts are valuable intermediates in the preparation of the compounds of formula I.

The term tautomers encompasses isomers which are derived from the compounds of formula I by the shift of an H atom involving at least one H atom located at a nitrogen oxygen or sulphur atom. Examples of tautomeric forms are keto enol forms imine enamine forms urea isourea forms thiourea isothiourea forms thio amide thio imidate forms etc.

The term stereoisomers encompasses both optical isomers such as enantiomers or diastereomers the latter existing due to more than one center of chirality in the molecule as well as geometrical isomers cis trans isomers .

Depending on the substitution pattern the compounds of the formula I may have one or more centers of chirality in which case they are present as mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. One center of chirality is the carbon ring atom of the isothiazoline ring carrying radical R. The invention provides both the pure enantiomers or diastereomers and their mixtures and the use according to the invention of the pure enantiomers or diastereomers of the compound I or its mixtures. Suitable compounds of the formula I also include all possible geometrical stereoisomers cis trans isomers and mixtures thereof.

The term N oxides relates to a form of compounds I in which at least one nitrogen atom is present in oxidized form as NO . To be more precise it relates to any compound of the present invention which has at least one tertiary nitrogen atom that is oxidized to an N oxide moiety. N oxides of compounds I can in particular be prepared by oxidizing e.g. the ring nitrogen atom of an N heterocycle e.g. a pyridine or pyrimidine ring present in Ar or R or an imino nitrogen present in central tricyclic core with a suitable oxidizing agent such as peroxo carboxylic acids or other peroxides. The person skilled in the art knows if and in which positions compounds of the present invention may form N oxides.

The compounds of the present invention may be amorphous or may exist in one or more different crystalline states polymorphs which may have a different macroscopic properties such as stability or show different biological properties such as activities. The present invention includes both amorphous and crystalline compounds of the formula I mixtures of different crystalline states of the respective compound I as well as amorphous or crystalline salts thereof.

Salts of the compounds of the formula I are preferably agriculturally and veterinarily acceptable salts. They can be formed in a customary method e.g. by reacting the compound with an acid of the anion in question if the compound of formula I has a basic functionality or by reacting an acidic compound of formula I with a suitable base.

Suitable agriculturally acceptable salts are especially the salts of those cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose cations and anions respectively do not have any adverse effect on the action of the compounds according to the present invention. Suitable cations are in particular the ions of the alkali metals preferably lithium sodium and potassium of the alkaline earth metals preferably calcium magnesium and barium and of the transition metals preferably manganese copper zinc and iron and also ammonium NH and substituted ammonium in which one to four of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by C C alkyl C C hydroxyalkyl C C alkoxy C C alkoxy C C alkyl hydroxy C C alkoxy C C alkyl phenyl or benzyl.

They can be formed by reacting a compound of formulae I with an acid of the corresponding anion preferably of hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid phosphoric acid or nitric acid.

By the term veterinarily acceptable salts is meant salts of those cations or anions which are known and accepted in the art for the formation of salts for veterinary use. Suitable acid addition salts e.g. formed by compounds of formula I containing a basic nitrogen atom e.g. an amino group include salts with inorganic acids for example hydrochlorides sulphates phosphates and nitrates and salts of organic acids for example acetic acid maleic acid dimaleic acid fumaric acid difumaric acid methane sulfenic acid methane sulfonic acid and succinic acid.

The term invertebrate pest as used herein encompasses animal populations such as insects arachnids and nematodes which may attack plants thereby causing substantial damage to the plants attacked as well as ectoparasites which may infest animals in particular warm blooded animals such as e.g. mammals or birds or other higher animals such as reptiles amphibians or fish thereby causing substantial damage to the animals infested.

The term plant propagation material is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers e.g. potatoes which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds roots fruits tubers bulbs rhizomes shoots sprouts and other parts of plants including seedlings and young plants which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. The plant propagation materials may be treated prophylactically with a plant protection compound either at or before planting or transplanting. Said young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring.

The term plants comprises any types of plants including non cultivated plants and in particular cultivated plants .

The term non cultivated plants refers to any wild type species or related species or related genera of a cultivated plant.

The term cultivated plants is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development cf. http www.bio.org speeches pubs er agri products.asp . Genetically modified plants are plants which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding mutations or natural recombination. Typically one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post translational modification of protein s oligo or polypeptides e.g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.

Plants that have been modified by breeding mutagenesis or genetic engineering e.g. have been rendered tolerant to applications of specific classes of herbicides such as auxin herbicides such as dicamba or 2 4 D bleacher herbicides such as hydroxylphenylpyruvate dioxygenase HPPD inhibitors or phytoene desaturase PDS inhibitors acetolactate synthase ALS inhibitors such as sulfonyl ureas or imidazolinones enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase EPSPS inhibitors such as glyphosate glutamine synthetase GS inhibitors such as glufosinate protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase inhibitors lipid biosynthesis inhibitors such as acetyl CoA carboxylase ACCase inhibitors or oxynil i.e. bromoxynil or ioxynil herbicides as a result of conventional methods of breeding or genetic engineering. Furthermore plants have been made resistant to multiple classes of herbicides through multiple genetic modifications such as resistance to both glyphosate and glufosinate or to both glyphosate and a herbicide from another class such as ALS inhibitors HPPD inhibitors auxin herbicides or ACCase inhibitors. These herbicide resistance technologies are e.g. described in Pest Managem. Sci. 61 2005 246 61 2005 258 61 2005 277 61 2005 269 61 2005 286 64 2008 326 64 2008 332 Weed Sci. 57 2009 108 Austral. J. Agricult. Res. 58 2007 708 Science 316 2007 1185 and references quoted therein. Several cultivated plants have been rendered tolerant to herbicides by conventional methods of breeding mutagenesis e.g. Clearfield summer rape Canola BASF SE Germany being tolerant to imidazolinones e.g. imazamox or ExpressSun sunflowers DuPont USA being tolerant to sulfonyl ureas e. g. tribenuron. Genetic engineering methods have been used to render cultivated plants such as soybean cotton corn beets and rape tolerant to herbicides such as glyphosate and glufosinate some of which are commercially available under the trade names RoundupReady glyphosate tolerant Monsanto U.S.A. Cultivance imidazolinone tolerant BASF SE Germany and LibertyLink glufosinate tolerant Bayer CropScience Germany .

Furthermore plants are also covered that are by the use of recombinant DNA techniques capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins especially those known from the bacterial genus particularly from such as endotoxins e. g.

VIP1 VIP2 VIP3 or VIP3A insecticidal proteins of bacteria colonizing nematodes e. g. spp. or spp. toxins produced by animals such as scorpion toxins arachnid toxins wasp toxins or other insect specific neurotoxins toxins produced by fungi such Streptomycetes toxins plant lectins such as pea or barley lectins agglutinins proteinase inhibitors such as trypsin inhibitors serine protease inhibitors patatin cystatin or papain inhibitors ribosome inactivating proteins RIP such as ricin maize RIP abrin luffin saporin or bryodin steroid metabolism enzymes such as 3 hydroxysteroid oxidase ecdysteroid IDP glycosyl transferase cholesterol oxidases ecdysone inhibitors or HMG CoA reductase ion channel blockers such as blockers of sodium or calcium channels juvenile hormone esterase diuretic hormone receptors helicokinin receptors stilben synthase bibenzyl synthase chitinases or glucanases. In the context of the present invention these insecticidal proteins or toxins are to be understood expressly also as pre toxins hybrid proteins truncated or otherwise modified proteins. Hybrid proteins are characterized by a new combination of protein domains see e. g. WO 02 015701 . Further examples of such toxins or genetically modified plants capable of synthesizing such toxins are disclosed e.g. in EP A 374 753 WO 93 007278 WO 95 34656 EP A 427 529 EP A 451 878 WO 03 18810 und WO 03 52073. The methods for producing such genetically modified plants are generally known to the person skilled in the art and are described e. g. in the publications mentioned above. These insecticidal proteins contained in the genetically modified plants impart to the plants producing these proteins tolerance to harmful pests from all taxonomic groups of athropods especially to beetles Coeloptera two winged insects Diptera and moths Lepidoptera and to nematodes Nematoda . Genetically modified plants capable to synthesize one or more insecticidal proteins are e.g. described in the publications mentioned above and some of which are commercially available such as YieldGard corn cultivars producing the Cry1Ab toxin YieldGard Plus corn cultivars producing Cry1Ab and Cry3Bb1 toxins Starlink corn cultivars producing the Cry9c toxin Herculex RW corn cultivars producing Cry34Ab1 Cry35Ab1 and the enzyme Phosphinothricin N Acetyltransferase PAT NuCOTN 33B cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin Bollgard I cotton cultivars producing the Cry1Ac toxin Bollgard II cotton cultivars producing Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab2 toxins VIPCOT cotton cultivars producing a VIP toxin NewLeaf potato cultivars producing the Cry3A toxin BtXtra NatureGard KnockOut BiteGard Protecta Bt11 e. g.

The invention therefore also relates to seed comprising a compound of the present invention including an agriculturally useful salt of it as defined herein. The amount of the compound of the present invention including an agriculturally useful salt thereof will in general vary from 0.01 g to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed preferably from 0.05 g to 5 kg per 100 kg of seed in particular from 0.1 g to 1000 g per 100 kg of seed. For specific crops such as lettuce the rate can be higher.

Methods which can be employed for treating the seed are in principle all suitable seed treatment and especially seed dressing techniques known in the art such as seed coating e.g. seed pelleting seed dusting and seed imbibition e.g. seed soaking . Here seed treatment refers to all methods that bring seeds and the compounds of the present invention into contact with each other and seed dressing to methods of seed treatment which provide the seeds with an amount of the compounds of the present invention i.e. which generate a seed comprising a compound of the present invention. In principle the treatment can be applied to the seed at any time from the harvest of the seed to the sowing of the seed. The seed can be treated immediately before or during the planting of the seed for example using the planter s box method. However the treatment may also be carried out several weeks or months for example up to 12 months before planting the seed for example in the form of a seed dressing treatment without a substantially reduced efficacy being observed.

Expediently the treatment is applied to unsown seed. As used herein the term unsown seed is meant to include seed at any period from the harvest of the seed to the sowing of the seed in the ground for the purpose of germination and growth of the plant.

Specifically a procedure is followed in the treatment in which the seed is mixed in a suitable device for example a mixing device for solid or solid liquid mixing partners with the desired amount of seed treatment formulations either as such or after previous dilution with water until the composition is distributed uniformly on the seed. If appropriate this is followed by a drying step.

The active compounds were formulated by a Tecan liquid handler in 100 cyclohexa none as a 10 000 ppm solution supplied in tubes. The 10 000 ppm solution was serially diluted in 100 cyclohexanone to make interim solutions. These served as stock solutions for which final dilutions were made by the Tecan in 50 acetone 50 water v v into 5 or 10 ml glass vials. A nonionic surfactant Kinetic was included in the solution at a volume of 0.01 v v . The vials were then inserted into an automated electrostatic sprayer equipped with an atomizing nozzle for application to plants insects.

Bell pepper plants at the first true leaf stage were infested prior to treatment by placing heavily infested leaves from the main colony on top of the treatment plants. Aphids were allowed to transfer overnight to accomplish an infestation of 30 50 aphids per plant and the host leaves were removed. The infested plants were then sprayed by an automated electrostatic plant sprayer equipped with an atomizing spray nozzle. The plants were dried in the sprayer fume hood removed and then maintained in a growth room under fluorescent lighting in a 24 hr photoperiod at about 25 C. and about 20 40 relative humidity. Aphid mortality on the treated plants relative to mortality on untreated control plants was determined after 5 days.
