The invention specifically provides all combinations of the recited aspects as if each had been laboriously individually set forth.

In one aspect the invention provides a method for preparing an asymmetric hollow fiber the method comprising a passing through an outer annular orifice of a tube in orifice spinneret a polymeric solution comprising i 15 25 wt of a polybenzimidazole ii 1 5 wt of a polymeric pore forming material and iii a solvent with respect to the polybenzimidazole b passing though an inner tube of the spinneret a bore fluid comprising i 65 99 wt. of a non solvent with respect to the polybenzimidazole and ii 1 35 wt. of a solvent with respect to the polybenzimidazole wherein the bore fluid maintains the polymeric solution in an annular shape c dropping the polymeric solution and bore fluid through an atmosphere over a dropping distance of 0.3 to 20 cm d quenching the polymeric solution and bore fluid in a bath to form an asymmetric hollow fiber comprising first and second concentric layers wherein the first layer is non porous and the second layer is porous having pores in the range 5 250 nm.

The polymeric solution carries the polymeric material that forms the asymmetric hollow fibers and in some embodiments carries one or more additional components such as a pore forming material salts pH modifying agents viscosity modifying agents and one or more solvents.

The polymeric solution comprises a polybenzimidazole PBI . In some embodiments the PBI is sulfonated. Sulfonation can be carried out using any convenient method. For example the sulfonated version of PBI can be readily prepared by treating with sulfuric acid to form covalently bonded SOwith the proton forming a stable bond with the nitrogen of the imidazole ring. Sulfonated PBI SPBI hollow fibers provide higher chlorine tolerance water flux and salt rejection rates. The PBI can be present in an amount effective to create asymmetric hollow fibers according to the inventive methods. In embodiments the PBI is present in an amount ranging from 10 30 or 15 25 or 15 20 wt or in an amount greater than 10 15 17 20 or 25 wt or less than 30 25 22 20 or 18 wt . More than one type of PBI can be present provided that the total weight percent is within the given ranges.

In embodiments the polymeric solution comprises a pore forming material. The pore forming material is a material that causes or aids the formation of pores in the materials of the invention. For example the pore forming material aids the solvent exchange mechanism of pore formation. Any appropriate pore forming material can be used. Examples of pore forming materials are compounds containing multiple hydroxyl groups such as glycols and polyols. Examples include isopropanol ethylene glycol propylene glycol polyvinylalcohol saccharides and polysaccharides and the like. Another example of a pore forming material is PVP. The pore forming material is present in the polymeric solution in an amount sufficient to cause the desired porosity in the resulting asymmetric hollow fibers. In embodiments the pore forming material is present in the polymeric solution in the range 1 5 wt or 1 3 wt or less than 5 4 3 or 2 wt or greater than 1 2 3 or 4 wt .

The polymeric solution comprises a solvent with respect to the PBI. Such a solvent is able to fully dissolve the PBI present in the solution and under the conditions used in the inventive methods. Examples of suitable solvents are N N dimethylacetamide DMAc dimethylsulfoxide DMSO N N dimethylformamide DMF N methyl 2 pyrrolidine NMP pyridine and the like. Combinations of solvents are also suitable.

The polymeric solution may further comprise one or more additives such as LiCl e.g. as a stabilizer of PBI .

The polymeric solution is stable against chemical degradation for at least 6 months under ambient conditions such as within a temperature range of 15 25 C. In some embodiments the polymeric solution is stable for at least 9 or 12 months. Thus the components of the polymeric solution particularly the PBI component do not undergo significant degradation over the period of stability. For example there is less than 10 8 5 3 2 or 1 degradation of the PBI component in a polymeric solution over the period of stability provided that the solution is maintained in a temperature range of 15 25 C.

The inventive methods involve passing the polymeric solution through an outer annular orifice of a tube in orifice spinneret. The passing can be carried out at elevated pressure i.e. the polymeric solution can be forced through the orifice or the solution can be allowed to drop out of the orifice under the influence of gravity and at ambient pressure. Oriented below the outer annular orifice is a gap that may conveniently be segmented into an expansion region immediately below the outer annular orifice and an elongation region below the expansion region. Upon emergence from the outer orifice of the spinneret the polymeric solution which has the annular shape of the annular orifice first enters the expansion region where it expands in circumference slightly. The polymeric solution moves through the expansion region and then enters the elongation region where the circumference is reduced. In some embodiments a portion of the solvent evaporates from the polymeric solution as the polymeric solution passes through the gap. The evaporation increases the concentration of PBI within the polymeric solution and some solidification of the PBI may take place within the gap. The polymeric solution moves through the elongation region of the gap and enters a bath positioned below the gap. The bath functions to coagulate the PI within the polymeric solution such that the PBI solidifies completely within the bath. Furthermore solvent exchange occurs within the bath i.e. solvent from the polymeric solution exchanges with solvent from the bath . The solvent exchange results in the formation of pores within the solidifying PBI.

The inventive methods further involve passing a bore fluid through an inner tube of the tube in orifice spinneret. The inner tube is centrally positioned with respect to the center axis of the spinneret within the outer annular orifice. The bore fluid is used to maintain the polymeric solution in an annular shape during the dropping of the polymeric solution through the gap and into the bath. Thus bore fluid emerges from the inner tube at the same time that polymeric solution emerges from the outer annular orifice.

The bore fluid comprises a mixture of a solvent with respect to the PBI and a non solvent with respect to the PBI. In embodiments the bore fluid comprises 65 99 wt or greater than 65 70 75 80 85 or 90 wt or less than 99 95 90 85 80 75 or 70 wt of the non solvent. In embodiments the bore fluid comprises 1 35 wt or greater than 5 10 15 20 25 or 30 wt or less than 35 30 25 20 15 10 or 5 wt of the solvent with respect to the polybenzimidazole.

The non solvent with respect to the PBI is a solvent that does not appreciably dissolve PBI under temperatures and pressures used in the inventive methods. For example the non solvent is able to dissolve less than 10 5 1 0.5 or 0.1 of the weight of PBI that a similar volume of solvent is able to dissolve. Examples of non solvents for PBI include water and alcohols such as methanol ethanol i propanol n propanol etc.

By applying a liquid as a bore fluid a phase transition can be induced and the fiber morphology near the inner surface can be controlled through phase inversion.

The bath is filled with a non solvent with respect to PBI. The non solvent in the bath may the same or may be different from the non solvent present in the bore fluid. The precipitation of PBI resulting from the polymeric solution entering the bath is referred to herein as quenching. The quenching of the polymeric solution and bore fluid creates the asymmetric hollow fiber having an annular shape and having first and second concentric layers as described herein. In some embodiments the annular shape of the hollow fiber is identical to the annular shape of the polymeric solution i.e. surrounding the bore fluid passing through the gap. In some embodiments swelling or contracting other minor variations cause the annular shape of the hollow fiber to be non identical to the annular shape of the polymeric solution in the gap although the hollow fiber shape will nevertheless be derived from the annular shape of the polymeric solution in the gap.

The gap comprises an atmosphere. The atmosphere may be air a single gas such as nitrogen or argon or any desired composition of gases. The length of the gap between the spinneret and the bath is referred to herein as the dropping distance. The dropping distance may be any length in the range 0.3 20 cm such as greater than 0.3 0.5 1 3 5 10 or 15 cm or less than 20 15 10 5 3 or 1 cm. The relative lengths of the swelling and elongation regions will depend on a variety of factors such as the solution parameters the atmosphere within the gap and the like.

The inventive methods result in the formation of asymmetric hollow fibers comprising a PBI material. The method may further include post spinning procedures. For example post spinning procedures include washing and drawing the fiber. Washing may be with a non solvent or mixture of non solvents for PBI such as water alcohol glycol or polyol solvents. Drawing can include any method for stretching the fibers such as stretching though a double roller or stretching lengthwise using any appropriate method. In some embodiments such post spinning procedures increase the mechanical strength of the fibers. Such increase in mechanical strength may be by at least 100 150 or 200 and may refer to tensile strength or other measures of fiber strength.

The asymmetric hollow fibers have a donut shape in cross section. Thus the fiber comprises in cross section a wall having a ring shape wherein the wall comprises first and second concentric and contacting layers. The difference between the outer diameter of the ring and the inner diameter of the ring represents twice the thickness of the fiber wall.

The inventive hollow fibers are asymmetric in that they comprise first and second concentric layers wherein the first layer is non porous and contacts the second layer and the second layer is porous. In some embodiments the first layer forms an outer surface and the second layer forms an inner surface of the asymmetric hollow fiber. In other embodiments the first layer forms an inner surface and the second layer forms an outer surface of the asymmetric hollow fiber. Because of the porosity of the second layer the first layer is typically denser than the second layer. In embodiments the first layer is at least 1.1 1.3 1.5 2 3 4 or 5 times denser than the second layer.

The thickness of the first and second layers is controlled by the length of the dropping distance and by the relative polarities of the solvent and non solvent. In some embodiments the first layer has a thickness in the range 0.1 10 m such as at least 0.1 0.5 1 2 3 5 or 8 m or less than 10 8 5 3 2 1 or 0.5 m. In some embodiments the second layer has a thickness in the range of 10 500 m such as at least 10 25 50 100 150 200 250 or 300 m or less than 500 300 250 200 150 100 50 or 25 m. In some embodiments the relatively less dense second layer has a thickness that is at least 10 20 50 100 or 500 times greater than the relatively more dense first layer. The thickness of the various layers is measured as a cross section of the fiber.

The transition region between the first and second layers may be very sharp such as less than 0.5 0.1 0.05 or 0.01 times the thickness of the first layer. In the transition region the fiber material transitions from porous to non porous i.e. relatively low density to relatively high density . In some embodiments the transition region is thicker and porosity decreases gradually over a region having a thickness at least 0.5 0.8 or 1 times the thickness of the first layer.

In embodiments the porous second layer has interconnected nanometer scale pores. For example the pores have an average diameter in the range of 5 250 nm or greater than 5 25 50 100 150 or 200 nm or less than 250 200 150 100 50 or 25 nm. The pores may be spherical partially spherical or irregular in shape. The degree and size of pores in the second layer is determined in part by the polarities of the solvent and non solvent used which affects the solvent exchange mechanism for pore formation . Other factors include the bath solvent temperature and pressure and the rate and extent of solvent evaporation within the gap.

The dimensions of the annular spinneret hole hollow fiber dimension shear stress within a spinneret dope flow rate the polymer to bore volumetric flow rate ratio and the take up to initial velocity ratio draw ratio are the primary factors that determine the final fiber structure.

In embodiments the chemical composition of the first layer and the chemical composition of the second layer are the same. Thus for example the first and second layers are both made of the same PBI material selected from the materials described herein.

In embodiments the asymmetric hollow fiber is stable up to 400 C. Thus up to 400 C. there is little or no degradation i.e. less than 10 5 3 or 1 wt of the fiber material.

The outer annular orifice of the tube in orifice spinneret has an outside diameter in the range 100 2000 m. Thus the final asymmetric hollow fibers may have an outside diameter within the range of 100 2000 m such as greater than 100 200 300 400 500 1000 or 1500 m or less than 2000 1500 1000 500 400 300 or 200 m. The inside diameter i.e. the diameter of the cavity within the hollow fibers will be determined by the outside diameter and the thickness of the first and second layers and thus for example may be within the range 90 1990 m .

The inventive asymmetric hollow fibers may be used to form a hollow fiber membrane HFM . For example the spinning procedure described herein may further comprise taking up the fiber at a rate of 1 100 meters min to form a HFM.

The membrane may be used in a method for separating Hfrom a gas mixture comprising H CO CO and methane the method comprising passing the gas mixture through the membrane.

The membrane may be used in a method for removing impurities from a water solution the method comprising passing the water solution through the membrane.

PBI membranes can be sulfonated for example after fabrication of the hollow fiber using a dip and dry procedure.

A Dope solution was prepared as follows 18 wt PBI dope and 2 wt PVP K16 18 Acros Organics New Jersey a high molecular weight pore former with a molecular weight of 8000 daltons in DMAc.

A strong non solvent selected from water isopropyl alcohol methanol and their combinations are used as the bore fluid and the coagulation bath. The strong nonsolvent has the ability to coagulate the polymer solution at the exit of the spinneret therefore a thin membrane layer will be formed between the outer polymer solution otherwise the fiber is easily broken and the polymer solution will go down as liquid drop under the force of gravitation. Inner bore fluid is a mixture of non solvent and the solvent to avoid formation of membrane layer. The spinneret is fabricated with 1.2 mm outer diameter and 0.4 inner diameter. This dope solution contains 26 wt PBI and 2 wt. LiCl in Ndimethylacetamide DMAc . Following specific compositions of dope solution bore fluid and coagulation bath was used to fabricate asymmetric PBI hollow fiber membrane with Hpermeance of 300 GPU with defect free selective gas separating layer at the shell side.

High magnification pictures of fiber having a cross section of 0.5 mm OD were taken. Similarly high magnification pictures of fiber having a cross section of 0.8 mm OD were taken. The images show porosity at the inner layer and a non porous dense outer layer.

The dense layer provides the separation between the highly permeating Hand low permeating COwhereas the porous layer provides mechanical strength with low pressure drop for the passage of the permeating gas. The testing of the fabricated fiber showed that the Hpermeates more rapidly than COthrough the membrane. The permeance of Hincreases with increasing temperature whereas the permeance of COis relatively insensitive to temperature.

The performance of prepared fibers was evaluated over 50 days representing the performance over 1000 hours. The selectivity for H CO2 improved with time increasing from 35 to 50 exceeding the design target of 40. Long term performance evaluation data were obtained. The Hpermeance value remained at about 80 GPU Gas Permeation Unit throughout the test period. At the end of the 1000 h test period the Hpermeance was measured to be 130 GPU at 250 C.

H COwas measured as a function of Hpermeance in GPU units at 150 200 225 and 250 C. Both H CO2 selectivity and Hpermeance increased with increasing temperature up to 225 C. The ratio of H COincreases whereas the Hpermeance decreases at 250 C. This suggests a slight increase in the thickness of the dense layer. Permeance increases as selectivity decreases. Dense layer thicknesses were tested between 1 and 10 m and could be tested as low as 0.1 m.

The presence of macro voids is highly dope specific and is dependent strongly on the non solvent and solvent exchange rate during coagulation. The measured Hpermeance for a fiber containing macro voids was in the range 100 to 200 GPU at room temperature but the H COselectivity was only 5. The presence of macro voids also reduces the mechanical strength of the fiber.
