This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 917 532 filed on Dec. 18 2013 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 813 809 filed on Apr. 19 2013 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.

The invention relates to sulfonamide derivatives to their use in medicine to compositions containing them to processes for their preparation and to intermediates used in such processes.

Uric acid is the final product of purine metabolism in humans. In humans unlike many other animals uric acid is not further broken down but is predominantly 70 excreted into the urine with the remaining 30 excreted in faeces. Hyperuricemia is defined as an excessive production or decreased excretion of uric acid and can occur as an overproduction or under excretion of serum uric acid sUA or a combination of the both. Renal under excretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90 of cases while overproduction is the cause in less than 10 . Increased sUA concentration above 6.8 mg dL results in crystallisation of uric acid in the form of salts such as monosodium urate and to precipitation of these crystals in joints on tendons and in the surrounding tissues. These crystals known as tophi trigger a local immune mediated inflammatory reaction leading to gout. The risk of gout increases with increased sUA levels.

Gout is a painful condition that can present in a number of ways although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis a red tender hot swollen joint often occurring in big toes heels knees wrists and fingers.

Gout is treated by agents to both decrease the cause and effects of uric acid crystal inflammation and pain.

The pain associated with gout is commonly treated with pain and anti inflammatory drugs such as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs colchicine and steroids. Agents that decrease sUA levels may be used to treat the cause of gout. These include agents that inhibit the enzymes that result in uric acid production such as xanthine oxidase inhibitors e.g. allopurinol febuxostat or tisopurine or purine nucleoside phosphorylase PNP inhibitors e.g. ulodesine metabolise uric acid such as urate oxidases also known as uricases e.g. pegloticase or increase the excretion of uric acid in the urine uricosurics Uricosurics include agents that inhibit the transporters responsible for renal reabsorption of uric acid back into the blood such as benziodarone isobromindione probenecid and sulphinpyrazone and URAT 1 inhibitors e.g. benzbromarone .

URAT 1 is also known as solute carrier family 22 organic anion cation transporter member 12 and is encoded by the gene SLC22A12. Human genetic analysis has demonstrated that polymorphisms in the SLC22A12 gene are directly associated with changes in serum uric acid. Inhibitors of uric acid transport such as URAT 1 are therefore effective in the treatment of gout.

There is a continuing need to provide new treatments for gout that are more effective and or are better tolerated.

Certain URAT 1 inhibitors for the treatment of gout are known. WO2011 159840 discloses phenylthioacetate URAT 1 inhibitors. Additionally WO2008 118758 WO2009 012242 WO2010 079443 WO2012 004706 WO2012 004714 and WO2012 004743 disclose sulphonamides.

Furthermore preferred compounds should have one or more of the following properties be well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract be metabolically stable have a good metabolic profile in particular with respect to the toxicity or allergenicity of any metabolites formed or possess favourable pharmacokinetic properties whilst still retaining their activity profile as URAT 1 inhibitors. They should be non toxic and demonstrate few side effects. Ideal drug candidates should exist in a physical form that is stable non hygroscopic and easily formulated.

Described below are a number of embodiments E of this first aspect of the invention where for convenience E1 is identical thereto.

Alkyl and alkoxy groups containing the requisite number of carbon atoms can be unbranched or branched. Examples of alkyl include methyl ethyl n propyl i propyl n butyl i butyl sec butyl and t butyl. Examples of alkoxy include methoxy ethoxy n propoxy i propoxy n butoxy i butoxy sec butoxy and t butoxy.

The term C linked used in the definitions of formula I means that the group in question is joined via a ring carbon.

Specific examples of C linked 6 membered heteroaryl containing one two or three nitrogen atoms include pyridinyl pyridazinyl pyrimidinyl and pyrazinyl.

Hereinafter all references to compounds of the invention include compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts solvates or multi component complexes thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable solvates or multi component complexes of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I as discussed in more detail below.

Preferred compounds of the invention are compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non toxic salts. Examples include the acetate adipate aspartate benzoate besylate bicarbonate carbonate bisulphate sulphate borate camsylate citrate cyclamate edisylate esylate formate fumarate gluceptate gluconate glucuronate hexafluorophosphate hibenzate hydrochloride chloride hydrobromide bromide hydroiodide iodide isethionate lactate malate maleate malonate mesylate methylsulphate naphthylate 2 napsylate nicotinate nitrate orotate oxalate palmitate pamoate phosphate hydrogen phosphate dihydrogen phosphate pyroglutamate saccharate stearate succinate tannate tartrate tosylate trifluoroacetate and xinofoate salts.

Suitable base salts are formed from bases which form non toxic salts. Examples include the aluminium arginine benzathine calcium choline diethylamine diolamine glycine lysine magnesium meglumine olamine potassium sodium tromethamine and zinc salts.

The skilled person will appreciate that the aforementioned salts include ones wherein the counterion is optically active for example d lactate or l lysine or racemic for example dl tartrate or dl arginine.

For a review on suitable salts see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties Selection and Use by Stahl and Wermuth Wiley VCH Weinheim Germany 2002 .

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I may be prepared by one or more of three methods 

All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionisation in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non ionised.

The compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. The term solvate is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules for example ethanol. The term hydrate is employed when said solvent is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted e.g. DO d acetone and d DMSO.

A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site channel or metal ion coordinated hydrates see by K. R. Morris Ed. H. G. Brittain Marcel Dekker 1995 incorporated herein by reference. Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal ion coordinated hydrates the water molecules are bonded to the metal ion.

When the solvent or water is tightly bound the complex will have a well defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When however the solvent or water is weakly bound as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds the water solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases non stoichiometry will be the norm.

The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term amorphous refers to a state in which the material lacks long range order at the molecular level and depending upon temperature may exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give distinctive X ray diffraction patterns and while exhibiting the properties of a solid are more formally described as a liquid. Upon heating a change from solid to liquid properties occurs which is characterised by a change of state typically second order glass transition . The term crystalline refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X ray diffraction pattern with defined peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid but the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change typically first order melting point .

Also included within the scope of the invention are multi component complexes other than salts and solvates of compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof wherein the drug and at least one other component are present in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. Complexes of this type include clathrates drug host inclusion complexes and co crystals. The latter are typically defined as crystalline complexes of neutral molecular constituents which are bound together through non covalent interactions but could also be a complex of a neutral molecule with a salt. Co crystals may be prepared by melt crystallisation by recrystallisation from solvents or by physically grinding the components together see Chem Commun 17 1889 1896 by O. Almarsson and M. J. Zaworotko 2004 incorporated herein by reference. For a general review of multi component complexes see J Pharm Sci 64 8 1269 1288 by Haleblian August 1975 incorporated herein by reference.

The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state mesophase or liquid crystal when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state either melt or solution . Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as thermotropic and that resulting from the addition of a second component such as water or another solvent is described as lyotropic . Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as amphiphilic and consist of molecules which possess an ionic such as COONa COOK or SONa or non ionic such as NN CH polar head group. For more information see by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart 4Edition Edward Arnold 1970 incorporated herein by reference.

The compounds of the invention may be administered as prodrugs. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of formula I which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can when administered into or onto the body be converted into compounds of formula I having the desired activity for example by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as prodrugs . Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 ACS Symposium Series T Higuchi and W Stella and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design Pergamon Press 1987 ed. E B Roche American Pharmaceutical Association .

Prodrugs can for example be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in a compound of formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as pro moieties as described for example in Design of Prodrugs by H Bundgaard Elsevier 1985 .

Examples of prodrugs include phosphate prodrugs such as dihydrogen or dialkyl e.g. di tert butyl phosphate prodrugs. Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.

Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of formula I that is compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include where the compound of formula I contains a phenyl Ph moiety a phenol derivative thereof Ph PhOH 

Compounds of the invention containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Included within the scope of the invention are all stereoisomers of the compounds of the invention and mixtures of one or more thereof.

Conventional techniques for the preparation isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate or the racemate of a salt or derivative using for example chiral high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC .

Alternatively the racemate or a racemic precursor may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound for example an alcohol or in the case where the compound of formula I contains an acidic or basic moiety a base or acid such as 1 phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer s by means well known to a skilled person.

Chiral compounds of the invention and chiral precursors thereof may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form using chromatography typically HPLC on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon typically heptane or hexane containing from 0 to 50 by volume of isopropanol typically from 2 to 20 and from 0 to 5 by volume of an alkylamine typically 0.1 diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.

Mixtures of stereoisomers may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art see for example Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen Wiley New York 1994.

The scope of the invention includes all crystal forms of the compounds of the invention including racemates and racemic mixtures conglomerates thereof. Stereoisomeric conglomerates may also be separated by the conventional techniques described herein just above.

The scope of the invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically labelled compounds of the invention wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.

Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen such as H and H carbon such as C C and C chlorine such as Cl fluorine such as F iodine such as I and I nitrogen such as N and N oxygen such as O O and O phosphorus such as P and sulphur such as S.

Certain isotopically labelled compounds of the invention for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes such as C F O and N can be useful in Positron Emission Topography PET studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.

Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically labeled reagent in place of the non labeled reagent previously employed.

Also within the scope of the invention are intermediate compounds as hereinafter defined all salts solvates and complexes thereof and all solvates and complexes of salts thereof as defined hereinbefore for compounds of formula I . The invention includes all polymorphs of the aforementioned species and crystal habits thereof.

When preparing a compound of formula I in accordance with the invention a person skilled in the art may routinely select the form of intermediate which provides the best combination of features for this purpose. Such features include the melting point solubility processability and yield of the intermediate form and the resulting ease with which the product may be purified on isolation.

The compounds of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of compounds of analogous structure. In particular the compounds of the invention can be prepared by the procedures described by reference to the Schemes that follow or by the specific methods described in the Examples or by similar processes to either.

The skilled person will appreciate that the experimental conditions set forth in the schemes that follow are illustrative of suitable conditions for effecting the transformations shown and that it may be necessary or desirable to vary the precise conditions employed for the preparation of compounds of formula I . It will be further appreciated that it may be necessary or desirable to carry out the transformations in a different order from that described in the schemes or to modify one or more of the transformations to provide the desired compound of the invention.

In addition the skilled person will appreciate that it may be necessary or desirable at any stage in the synthesis of compounds of the invention to protect one or more sensitive groups so as to prevent undesirable side reactions. In particular it may be necessary or desirable to protect amino or carboxylic acid groups. The protecting groups used in the preparation of the compounds of the invention may be used in conventional manner. See for example those described in Greene s Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by Theodora W Greene and Peter G M Wuts fourth edition John Wiley and Sons 2006 in particular chapters 7 Protection for the Amino Group and 5 Protection for the Carboxyl Group incorporated herein by reference which also describes methods for the removal of such groups.

The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions for example by lyophilisation may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.

The solubility of compounds of formula I used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques such as the incorporation of solubility enhancing agents. Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed sustained pulsed controlled targeted and programmed release.

Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation the drug product is micronised to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation typically less than 5 microns . This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method such as spiral jet milling fluid bed jet milling supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles high pressure homogenisation or spray drying.

Capsules made for example from gelatin or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as l leucine mannitol or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran glucose maltose sorbitol xylitol fructose sucrose and trehalose.

Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or puff containing from 1 g to 100 mg of the compound of formula I . The overall daily dose will typically be in the range 1 g to 200 mg which may be administered in a single dose or more usually as divided doses throughout the day.

The compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally for example in the form of a suppository pessary microbicide vaginal ring or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.

The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear typically in the form of drops of a micronised suspension or solution in isotonic pH adjusted sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments biodegradable e.g. absorbable gel sponges collagen and non biodegradable e.g. silicone implants wafers lenses and particulate or vesicular systems such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed linked polyacrylic acid polyvinylalcohol hyaluronic acid a cellulosic polymer for example hydroxypropylmethylcellulose hydroxyethylcellulose or methyl cellulose or a heteropolysaccharide polymer for example gelan gum may be incorporated together with a preservative such as benzalkonium chloride.

There is also included within the scope the present invention combinations of a compound of the invention together with one or more additional therapeutic agents which slow down the rate of metabolism of the compound of the invention thereby leading to increased exposure in patients. Increasing the exposure in such a manner is known as boosting. This has the benefit of increasing the efficacy of the compound of the invention or reducing the dose required to achieve the same efficacy as an unboosted dose. The metabolism of the compounds of the invention includes oxidative processes carried out by P450 CYP450 enzymes particularly CYP 3A4 and conjugation by UDP glucuronosyl transferase and sulphating enzymes. Thus among the agents that may be used to increase the exposure of a patient to a compound of the present invention are those that can act as inhibitors of at least one isoform of the cytochrome P450 CYP450 enzymes. The isoforms of CYP450 that may be beneficially inhibited include but are not limited to CYP1A2 CYP2D6 CYP2C9 CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Suitable agents that may be used to inhibit CYP 3A4 include ritonavir saquinavir ketoconazole N 3 4 difluorobenzyl N methyl 2 4 methoxypyridin 3 yl amino sulfonylbenzamide and N 1 2 5 4 fluorobenzyl 3 pyridin 4 yl 1H pyrazol 1 yl acetyl piperidin 4 yl methanesulfonamide.

Lentiviral particles were generated according to ViraPower HiPerform expression system procedure Invitrogen Life Technologies and used to transduce CHO cells. Blasticidin selection enabled the generation of a stable clonal pool of cells confirmed by expression of GFP and V5 epitope. The clonal pools were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting FACS on the basis of GFP expression with the gating set at the top 50 of expression into single cells which were subsequently expanded to generate clonal lines. One clone was identified with the best assay performance as determined by maximal separation between complete inhibition of uric acid transport with 10 M benzbromarone and no inhibition DMSO . This cell line was used for all screening activities and is referred to as CHO URAT1 L GFP 8 or CHO 8.

The potency of the compounds of formula I as inhibitors of the URAT 1 transporter was determined as follows.

CHO 8 cells were cultured in cell line maintenance flasks in medium consisting of Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium DMEM with high glucose and sodium pyruvate 4.5 g of glucose per liter Invitrogen Life Technologies supplemented with heat inactivated foetal bovine serum FBC 10 v v 1 NEAA non essential amino acids and blasticidin 10 g ml . Cultures were grown in 175 cmtissue culture flasks in a humidified incubator at approximately 37 C. in approximately 95 air 5 CO. Near confluent CHO 8 cell cultures were harvested by trypsinisation re suspended in culture medium and the process was repeated once or twice weekly to provide sufficient cells for use.

Assay ready flasks were generated by the same method except the cells were not cultured in blasticidin.

Assay ready frozen cells were generated by freezing 40 000 000 cells in 1 ml of FBS without blasticidin containing 10 DMSO per vial. One vial was sufficient for 5 assay plates. Each vial was thawed rapidly to 37 C. washed and re suspended in pre warmed culture medium for seeding onto assay plates.

CHO 8 cells were seeded onto Cytostar 96 well plates at a density of 5 10cells per well. The cells were cultured for 1 day at approximately 37 C. in a humidified incubator containing approximately 5 COin air. After approximately 24 hours culture cells were used for uptake experiments.

On the day of assay culture medium was removed from the wells and the cells were washed once with 50 L of chloride containing buffer 136.7 mM NaCl 5.36 mM KCl 0.952 mM CaCl 0.441 mM KHPO 0.812 mM MgSO 5.6 mM D glucose 0.383 mM NaHPO.2HO 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4 with NaOH . The cells were pre incubated with another 50 L of chloride containing buffer for one hour at approximately 37 C. in a humidified incubator containing approximately 5 COin air.

Assay compound plates were prepared by diluting the compounds of formula I with chloride free buffer 125 mM Na gluconate 4.8 mM K gluconate 1.3 mM Ca gluconate 1.2 mM KHPO 1.2 mM MgSO 5.6 mM D glucose 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 with NaOH in 100 DMSO to a final concentration of 1 DMSO. C Uric Uric acid working stock was made by addition of radiolabeled compound to a final concentration of 120 nM in chloride free buffer. In all wells the final assay concentration of solvent DMSO was 0.25 the final assay concentration of C uric acid was 30 nM in chloride free buffer and the final compound of formula I concentrations ranged from 0 to 10 M. The vehicle comparator was DMSO i.e. no inhibition of uric acid transport and the pharmacological blockade i.e. 100 inhibition of uric acid transport was defined by benzbromarone at 10 M final assay concentration.

After pre incubation cells were washed with 50 L of chloride free buffer and another 50 L of chloride free buffer was added. Thereafter 25 L of compound of formula I was added from the prepared compound plate and the cells were pre incubated for 15 minutes prior to the addition of 25 mL of C uric acid. The plate was incubated at room temperature and protected from light for three hours prior to measuring proximity induced scintillation on a Wallac microbeta at 1 minute well.

The accumulation of C uric acid into CHO 8 cells was calculated and the IC M values defined as the concentration of inhibitor required for 50 inhibition of transport were determined from a 4 parameter logistic fit to generate sigmoid curves from dose response data.
