The Internet has been a boon to a great many businesses. Many of those businesses such as computing resource service providers are dependent on the ability of the Internet to provide fast and stable communications between network sites of the businesses and their users. However numerous threats abound which may have significant adverse effects on the speed and stability of the network such as distributed or other denial of service attacks wherein systems intentionally target a network server with a flood of incoming messages such that in a best case legitimate users of the server experience slow connections and in a worst case the network server may become inoperable. However conventional techniques such as filtering all received network traffic through a central point that attempts to identify and filter out bad network traffic can be resource intensive and expensive for a business and often require high capacity dedicated equipment that takes up valuable space in a data center and often becomes a bottleneck for hosts and users.

In the following description various embodiments will be described. For purposes of explanation specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. Furthermore well known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the embodiment being described.

Techniques described and suggested herein include a method and system of denial of service attack mitigation by utilizing a network interface controller having one or more processors configured to filter out data packets corresponding to a denial of service attack i.e. not trustworthy and forwarding data packets corresponding to legitimate traffic to a device hosting the network interface controller. The method further includes out of band management of the network interface controller having one or more processors for denial of service mitigation.

Denial of service attacks mitigation may be performed by passing network traffic through an intermediary device that attempts to determine whether incoming network packets are coming from a legitimate source or a hostile source like a botnet. The intermediary device may make this determination by examining the incoming network packets metadata such as internet protocol IP addresses cookies and hypertext transfer protocol HTTP headers and cross referencing this metadata against rules and tables of information about known hostile sources. Packets that are determined not to be hostile are routed to the appropriate target device while hostile packets are dropped. For example packets transmitted by a hostile device with an internet protocol address known to belong to a denial of service attacker are checked and the hostile packets are discarded without reaching the target device and tying up its resources.

The present disclosure describes performing denial of service attack mitigation by a network interface controller of the target device. Performing denial of service attack mitigation with the network interface controller of the target device may avoid a potential bottleneck caused by routing all incoming network traffic through a central point for denial of service attack mitigation. For example packets transmitted by a hostile device with an internet protocol address known to belong to a denial of service attacker will reach the network interface controller of the target device whereupon the hostile packets are checked and the hostile packets may be discarded without tying up the resources of the target device.

To meet the demands required for checking network packets without significantly impacting legitimate network communications with the target device the network interface controller of this disclosure has an on board processor for performing denial of service mitigation. The on board processor may be any suitable processing device such as one or more of a microprocessor a co processor a micro controller a microcomputer a central processing unit a graphics processing unit application specific integrated circuit ASIC custom reduced instruction set computing RISC chip or some other programmable logic device. Examples of such processing devices include but are not limited to devices based on an Intel x86 architecture an Itanium architecture an reduced instruction set RISC architecture including ARM Power Architecture and Blackfin architectures and a SPARC architecture.

The network interface controller of this disclosure may utilize an on board processor to inspect packets received checking the metadata within the packet for criteria indicating that the packet originates from a denial of service attacker. Packets that are indicated as originating from a denial of service attack may be dropped while other packets may be passed from the network interface controller to the target device. For example the network interface controller may have access to internet protocol tables and firewall rules for example in on board random access memory RAM read only memory ROM or firmware and the on board processor may inspect incoming packets to determine whether the packet originates from any of the addresses in the internet protocol tables. A technical advantage achieved by filtering packets by the individual network interface controllers of the target device is that it reduces the physical footprint of denial of service mitigation e.g. by performing the denial of service mitigation at the target server location valuable space within a data center that would have been used for servers or other devices dedicated to packet filtering may be used for other purposes.

The on board processor of the network interface controller may be configured to filter packets and apply firewall rules one or more ways. One way among others may be that the network interface controller is pre set with logic for performing the packet filtering and application of firewall rules by the manufacturer. Another way among others may be that the on board processor may execute instructions stored in one of the memories described above with the executable instructions directing the processor on how to filter the packets and apply the firewall rules. A third way may be to utilize a combination of the previous two ways. Further in some embodiments the filtering and firewall rules and even the executable instructions directing the on board processor may be updated modified using out of band management.

As noted the internet protocol tables and firewall rules may be maintained with out of band management. Out of band management refers to being able to control a device through a dedicated channel such that the device may be managed when normal modes of communicating to the device are unresponsive such as when the device is in a sleep mode error state or unresponsive due to a distributed denial of service attack. Out of band management allows system administrators to connect to and update the settings of devices remotely without software being installed on the system being managed. One advantage of out of band management of the network interface controller is that the network interface controller may be updated even if the operating system of the target device in which the network interface controller is installed is non responsive due to a distributed denial of service attack. Thus the internet protocol tables firewall rules and even the basic input output system BIOS of the network interface controller may be updated to provide the most up to date mitigation information about potential distributed denial of service attackers.

The network interface controller in the environment would be a network interface controller such as network interface controller as described in . Note that the network interface controller of this disclosure need not be an Ethernet network interface card of the form illustrated in the environment. Examples of a network interface controller of this disclosure include but are not limited to Ethernet Wi Fi and token ring configurations in peripheral component interconnect PCI PCI Express ExpressCard forms as well as being integrated with other circuitry of the target device such as on the motherboard of the server using one or more integrated chips ICs .

The legitimate packets A may be packets requested by actual human users such as comprising a request for a website an HTTP GET or POST response a file download a file transfer protocol command or other communication with the server . The legitimate packets A may further originate from an application or service designed to interact with the server such as time synchronization packets transmitted from an NTP server or a response from a domain name system DNS server. The undesirable packets may be packets from one or more machines running botnets or otherwise making a denial of service attack against the server . For example the undesirable packet may be part of a synchronization flood SYN flood user datagram protocol flood UDP flood network time protocol NTP reflection or simple network management protocol SNMP reflection attacks attack against the server .

Note however that the on board processor may be used for purposes beyond or instead of denial of service attack mitigation. For example the network interface card may be used to enforce blacklists also known as block lists to block data originating from addresses in the list may be used to perform whitelisting whereby only data originating from specified addresses are allowed through e mail spam filtration and content blocking for preventing the device hosting the network interface card from accessing to restricted sites. The on board processor may also be used to encrypt decrypt outgoing and incoming data such as for secure sockets layer SSL offloading

The network interface controller examines the metadata of each packet in some examples checking the internet protocol information of the packet against an internet protocol table of known attackers and otherwise applying firewall rules to the metadata of the packets. The result of this packet filtering is that legitimate packets B are allowed to be received by the server while the undesirable packet is ignored i.e. dropped . The server of the environment may be any suitable electronic device alone or present within a distributed virtual or clustered environment such as a data server a web server a portable computing device a personal computer or an electronic computing device similar to electronic computing device described in .

The network interface controller of the present disclosure may have one or more on board processors for performing detection and mitigation of denial of service attacks. As noted the on board processor may be any suitable processing device such as one or more of a microprocessor a co processor a micro controller a microcomputer a central processing unit a graphics processing unit or a programmable logic device. Examples of such processing devices include but are not limited to devices based on an Intel x86 architecture an Itanium architecture an reduced instruction set RISC architecture including ARM Power Architecture and Blackfin architectures and a SPARC architecture.

The network interface controller may further have a storage component for storing internet protocol tables firewall rules and executable software code usable for performing denial of service detection and mitigation. In some cases some or all of the information within the internet protocol tables firewall rules and other data used for filtering may be stored in Bloom filters for more efficient processing. The storage component may be a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices comprising one or more of read only memory random access memory volatile memory non volatile memory static memory dynamic memory flash memory cache memory and or any device that stores digital information. In some embodiments the network interface controller may also monitor network latency of incoming packets and route incoming data packets to alternate computing devices having less latency on the network than the target computing device. For example if the target computing device is being negatively impacted by a denial of service attack the network interface card may be able to reduce the load on the target computing device by forwarding packets to share the load with other computing devices. In other embodiments the network interface controller may be managed using an out of band management channel.

The first three layers of the Open Systems Interconnection OSI model for network architecture are the physical layer the data link layer and the network layer. The physical layer consists of the hardware transmission technologies of the network. The data link layer is the layer that provides for encapsulating data packets into frames synchronizing frames and error correction. The data link layer is comprised of the logical link control sublayer and the media access control sublayer. The logical link control LLC sublayer allows different network protocols to coexist on the same network and may provide flow control and error management mechanisms. The media access control MAC sublayer provides addressing and access control making it possible for nodes of a network to communicate with each other. The network layer provides for packet routing and forwarding. The network interface controller of the present disclosure may operate at the data link layer as it performs checksum and header validation and may operate at the network layer as it validates source and destination internet protocol addresses and or forwards data packets to destination devices and in some embodiments performs virus checking and other content validation on the payloads or groups of payloads of data packets.

The network interface controller may have a physical layer consisting of the basic hardware transmission components for computer networking. The physical layer supplies encoding decoding functionality and timing functions for interfacing with the network through network media such as RJ 45 cable or optical cable.

The network interface controller of the present disclosure may further contain a processor having access to a local memory . As noted the processor may be any suitable processing device such as one or more of a microprocessor a co processor a micro controller a microcomputer a central processing unit a graphics processing unit or a programmable logic device. Examples of such processing devices include devices based on various architectures including but not limited to an Intel x86 architecture an Itanium architecture a reduced instruction set RISC architecture a Power Architecture and a SPARC architecture. Examples of the memory include but are not limited to a single memory device or a plurality of memory devices comprising one or more of read only memory random access memory volatile memory non volatile memory static memory dynamic memory flash memory cache memory and or any device that stores digital information. The processor of the network interface controller may receive incoming packets from the physical layer and with reference to information such as internet protocol tables and firewall rules within the memory may determine which packets are legitimate traffic and which packets originate as a result of a denial of service attack and should be dropped. Upon making this determination the processor may forward the legitimate packets to the media access controller .

The media access controller performs functions related to the transmission and reception of data packets. For example when preparing to provide the data to the physical layer the media access controller assembles the data into packets with addresses and error detection fields. Likewise when receiving data packets for transfer to a computing device the media access controller disassembles the packet and performs address checking and error detection. Thus legitimate packets like legitimate packets A and B described in reference to received by the media access controller from the processor are processed and output to the computing device . Depending on the embodiment the legitimate packets may be output to the computing device through various channels including but not limited to a PCI bus for example if the network interface controller is embodied as a card present in a PCI slot of the computing device through a network connection for example if the network interface controller of the present disclosure is embodied in a network router or some other bus present on a motherboard of the computing device for example if the network interface controller of the present disclosure is embodied within one or more integrated circuits present on a motherboard of the computing device .

Going the other direction the media access controller receives data from the computing device processes the data and forwards the processed data directly to the physical layer for output to the network media bypassing the processor . In some embodiments such as that depicted in the processor may be bypassed for this data because the server may be trusted and only legitimate traffic should be travelling in this direction. However in other embodiments outbound traffic may be directed through the processor for various purposes such as for logging NTP server requests or for analyzing outgoing data for breaches of data security i.e. for data loss prevention DLP blocking purposes . In this embodiment by logging NTP server requests unsolicited responses from NTP servers such as from an NTP attack may be filtered out without significantly burdening the computing device . In some embodiments the processor and or memory may be integrated with the media access controller . In other embodiments the processor and or memory may be located between the media access controller and the computing device and packets received by the physical layer pass through the media access controller before being processed by the processor . In still other embodiments one or more of the physical layer processor memory and media access controller may be connected to a common bus.

The plurality of servers in various embodiments may be configured to host a network interface controller similar to the network interface controller described in . Note that more than one network interface controller may be present within any of the plurality of the servers . Examples of such servers include data servers and other servers including but not limited to web server and application server described in . As noted the network interface controller may be similar to the network interface controller described in having an on board processor an examples of which includes but is not limited to a microprocessor a co processor a micro controller a microcomputer a central processing unit a graphics processing unit or a programmable logic device.

Websites and computing resource service providers are frequently targets of denial of service attacks which are external attempts to overload the resources of one or more target devices such as servers such that the target device responds slowly to communication requests from legitimate users for example web sites served by the target device become unavailable or slow to load or in some cases the target device may stop working altogether. A distributed denial of service attack is an attack wherein denial of service attacks are made against the target device by multiple systems often infected by malicious software malware executing on computer systems of unsuspecting users. Malware configured to make coordinated actions against one or more targeted devices is known as a botnet. Because the distributed denial of service attacks can come from numerous sources mitigating distributed denial of service attacks can be difficult and may demand additional resources from website administrators and computing resource providers.

Distributed denial of service attacks are often made by flooding the target device with communication requests. Common types of floods used in distributed denial of service attacks are synchronization flood SYN flood user datagram protocol flood UDP flood network time protocol NTP reflection and simple network management protocol SNMP reflection attacks. A SYN flood is an attack where the attacking machines depicted in by attackers transmit a succession of synchronization SYN requests to the target device. The target device interpreting the requests as legitimate responds with a synchronization acknowledge SYN ACK message. However the attacking machines do not respond to the SYN ACK message causing the target device to wait for some period of time while expecting a response. A multitude of repeated SYN requests can thereby tie up resources of the target device to the point that legitimate connection requests cannot be made.

A UDP flood occurs when attacking machines illustrated by the attackers transmit many UDP packets to random ports of the target device. In response the target device checks to see whether any application is expecting to receive the UDP packets at the receiving port and responds with an internet control message protocol ICMP destination unreachable message. A multitude of repeated UDP attacks can thereby tie up resources of the target device by causing it to provide multitudes of ICMP return packets.

An NTP reflection attack involves transmitting communication requests using a forged spoofed internet protocol address of the target device to NTP servers which are servers used by computers and other devices for clock synchronization and are often publicly available. The NTP server may respond to the communication requests sent to it by attackers spoofing the destination address of the target device such as one or more of servers by sending a relatively large amount of data to the target device. For example every time an NTP attacker provides a monlist or MON GETLIST command to an NTP server the NTP server may respond by transmitting addresses of up to the last machines the NTP server has interacted with to the spoofed address of the target device thereby consuming the bandwidth of the target device. In this manner a multitude of NTP attacks may quickly consume large amounts of the target device s bandwidth.

An SNMP reflection attack often involves netbots that send small SNMP queries to gateway devices using a source internet protocol address spoofed to be an internet protocol address of a target device. The gateway devices respond by sending SNMP responses to the internet protocol address of the target device. The SNMP response data may be much larger than the query data sent by the netbots and the bandwidth of the target device may be inundated and overwhelmed by the SNMP data received.

The attackers depicted may be botnets attacking one or more of the servers with a distributed denial of service attack such as a SYN flood UDP flood or NTP reflection attack whereas the legitimate users may be customers of the computer resource service provider attempting to access the servers for any of a variety of purposes such as online shopping video or audio streaming news feeds utilizing a search engine file downloading or browsing. Note that the router is depicted for illustrative purposes and the network interface controller may be used in any suitable computing environment with or without one or more routers such as a direct connect environment or utilizing one or more network switches instead of or in addition to router or other method of enabling data packets to reach their target device such as the servers . The router in is depicted to be connected to the Internet but the network interface controller of the present disclosure may be utilized with any suitable network such as a public or private network like a local area network a wide area network wireless network distributed network or the Internet .

The bus subsystem may provide a mechanism for enabling the various components and subsystems of computing device to communicate with each other as intended. Although the bus subsystem is shown schematically as a single bus alternative embodiments of the bus subsystem may utilize multiple busses.

The network interface controller may be a network interface controller having an on board processor similar to the network interface card of and may provide an interface to other computing devices and networks. The network interface controller may serve as an interface for receiving data from and transmitting data to other systems from the computing device . For example the network interface controller may enable a data technician to connect the device to a wireless network such that the data technician may be able to transmit and receive data while in a remote location such as a customer data center. The network interface controller may comprise more than one network interface controller performing operations independently from each other. The network interface controller may be utilized with any suitable network such as a public or private network like a local area network a wide area network wireless network or the Internet. The network interface controller performs denial of service mitigation of hostile network traffic targeting the computing device by for example performing packet filtering of incoming network data packets against internet protocol tables and firewall rules.

The user interface input devices may include one or more user input devices such as a keyboard pointing devices such as an integrated mouse trackball touchpad or graphics tablet a scanner a barcode scanner a touch screen incorporated into the display audio input devices such as voice recognition systems microphones and other types of input devices. In general use of the term input device is intended to include all possible types of devices and mechanisms for inputting information to the computing device .

User interface output devices may include a display subsystem a printer or non visual displays such as audio output devices etc. The display subsystem may be a cathode ray tube CRT a flat panel device such as a liquid crystal display LCD light emitting diode LED display or a projection or other display device. In general use of the term output device is intended to include all possible types of devices and mechanisms for outputting information from the computing device . The output device s may be used for example to present user interfaces to facilitate user interaction with applications performing processes described herein and variations therein when such interaction may be appropriate.

The storage subsystem may provide a computer readable storage medium for storing the basic programming and data constructs that may provide the functionality of at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. The applications programs code modules instructions that when executed by one or more processors may provide the functionality of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure and may be stored in the storage subsystem . These application modules or instructions may be executed by the one or more processors . The storage subsystem may additionally provide a repository for storing data used in accordance with the present disclosure. The storage subsystem may comprise a memory subsystem and a file disk storage subsystem .

The memory subsystem may include a number of memories including a main random access memory RAM for storage of instructions and data during program execution and a read only memory ROM in which fixed instructions may be stored. The file storage subsystem may provide a non transitory persistent non volatile storage for program and data files and may include a hard disk drive a floppy disk drive along with associated removable media a Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROM drive an optical drive removable media cartridges and other like storage media.

The computing device may include at least one local clock . The local clock may be a counter that represents the number of ticks that have transpired from a particular starting date and may be located integrally within the computing device . The local clock may be used to synchronize data transfers in the processors for the computing device and all of the subsystems included therein at specific clock pulses and may be used to coordinate synchronous operations between the computing device and other systems in a data center. In one embodiment the local clock is an atomic clock. In another embodiment the local clock is a programmable interval timer.

The computing device may be of various types including a portable computer device tablet computer a workstation or any other device described below. Additionally the computing device may include another device that may be connected to the computing device through one or more ports e.g. USB a headphone jack Lightning connector etc. . The device that may be connected to the computing device may include a plurality of ports configured to accept fiber optic connectors. Accordingly this device may be configured to convert optical signals to electrical signals that may be transmitted through the port connecting the device to the computing device for processing. Due to the ever changing nature of computers and networks the description of the computing device depicted in is intended only as a specific example for purposes of illustrating the preferred embodiment of the device. Many other configurations having more or fewer components than the system depicted in are possible.

However the network interface controllers of the present disclosure need not be constrained to a data center client server or multi server environment. The network interface controller of the present disclosure may be usable by a personal computing device such as a personal computer laptop smartphone tablet device or other electronic client device similar to electronic client device described in conjunction with for additional protection against the device by hostile attackers.

In some embodiments the network interface controller performs synchronous actions regarding the data packets it receives. That is as packets are received those packets are processed and if determined to be legitimate and not part of a denial of service attack the packets are passed through to the host computing device. Alternately in other embodiments the network interface controller may be configured to act as a router and forward re route the legitimate packets to the appropriate destination device. Otherwise if the packets are deemed hostile e.g. part of a denial of service attack the packets may be dropped or rejected i.e. an error message transmitted to the sender .

In other embodiments the network interface controller performs asynchronous actions regarding the data packets it receives. That is data obtained by analyzing a data packet may be used to effect an action on another data packet. For example in some embodiments the network interface controller may log network statistics such as roundtrip times of sent and received packets and retransmits at the hardware level and using these logged statistics may be able to determine network latencies and other statistics. These network latencies and other statistics may be useful in embodiments where the network interface controller may forward future received packets to appropriate servers on the network with less latency. For instance a network interface controller may log the time of an outgoing response to a request and again log the time when a data packet is received notifying the network interface controller that the outgoing was delivered or undeliverable. Network latencies and other statistics may be used to perform network load balancing or denial of service mitigation for example if the target computing device is being negatively impacted by a denial of service attack the network interface card may be able to reduce the load on the target computing device by forwarding packets to share the load with other computing devices. In some embodiments the log may be provided to a user application service device or other entity by reporting the log to an endpoint such as a server or other device. In other embodiments the network interface controller may report its log to a user application service device or other entity in response to a programmatic call to an application programming interface. In such embodiments as described herein the network interface controller of the present disclosure may be usable by a router switch or other computing device acting to route data packets to and from one network to another or to and from the Internet such as a Linux based system configured as a router. In still other embodiments wherein the network interface controller performs asynchronous actions the network interface controller may log the source internet protocol addresses of received packets. In such embodiments the logged addresses may be used to identify denial of service attacks not initially flagged by the internet protocol tables and filtering rules. For example data packets may be received from a particular internet protocol address that when internet protocol tables and filtering rules are applied initially appear to be legitimate network traffic. However if the network interface controller begins to detect e.g. by referencing the logs of addresses to determine whether a certain source internet protocol address has been logged more than a threshold number of times within a given time period that the device at the source internet protocol address is consuming an alarming amount of the bandwidth of the target computing device or sending an unusually large number of packets to the target computing device the network interface controller may determine that the data packets may be a portion of a denial of service attack and perform a suitable mitigation action.

In still other embodiments the on board processor of the network interface controller may be able to scan the payloads of data packets for viruses trojans malware or other data to be flagged according to defined legitimacy criteria. However because data packets may be fragmented i.e. each data packet comprising only a portion of the data being sent in such an embodiment the network interface controller may temporarily store such packets until all fragments of the data are collected assembled and the assembled payloads may be scanned for viruses trojans malware or other content. In some embodiments the on board processor of the network interface controller may be configured to analyze and or filter outgoing data such as for mitigation of data breaches by performing data loss prevention DLP analysis and blocking on data outgoing from the host computing device.

The network interface controller of the present disclosure may serve as a standard network interface controller or may additionally act as a firewall by performing packet filtering with its on board processor. For example as incoming data packets are received the processor of the network interface controller may verify the checksum of the packet and confirm the validity of the packet header. The processor may further check the source internet protocol address of the packet against a table containing invalid internet protocol addresses and source net blocks i.e. groups of sequential internet protocol addresses internet protocol addresses of known attackers and other internet protocol addresses that may be blocked. The processor may also determine whether the packet came from a hostile domain i.e. domains known for hosting denial of service attackers or netbots or an invalid domain.

Multiple network interface controllers of the present disclosure may be present within a single computing device with each network interface controller independently performing packet filtering on data packets received through their respective connections to a network. In some embodiments one or more network interface controllers may perform packet filtering on the same data packets in series or in parallel. For example one network interface controller may validate checksums on a data packet while another network interface controller validates the source internet protocol address of the data packed against internet protocol tables.

In a data packet is received by the network interface controller through a network connection. The data packet may be data formatted to be provided by a network and is typically divided into control information and payload i.e. user data . The control data of the data packet is typically located within the header or trailer portion of the data packet and may contain various information fields indicating the type of packet header or trailer length priority of the packet also known as quality of service QoS length of the packet identification tag fragmentation flags expiration or time to live TTL data protocol type checksums for error detection and the source and destination network addresses and other data depending on the protocol used. Examples of different types of data packets that the network interface controller may be filtering include but are not limited to Internet Protocol version 4 IPv4 packets Internet Protocol version 6 IPv6 packets and Ethernet II frame packets. The control data of a data packet may be classified into data integrity fields and semantic fields. The data integrity fields include information usable to determine the condition i.e. integrity of the packet such as the checksums for error detection and the time to live data of the packet. The semantic fields correspond to characteristics attributes of the packet and often contain information about the contents of the packet such as the length of the packet and the priority of the packet. Examples of the network connections the data packet may be received upon include but are not limited to a local area network a wide area network a virtual private network the Internet an intranet an extranet a public switched telephone network an infrared network a wireless network a satellite network and any combination thereof.

In the control information of the data packet is isolated and in the on board processor of the network interface controller performs a check to determine whether the header is valid for the protocol expected. If the header validation fails the processor performing the process proceeds to wherein appropriate action is performed according to the embodiment and the type of verification failure. As illustrated in the data packet may be dropped i.e. ignored and not passed on however other operations may be additionally or alternatively taken at such as rejecting the packet i.e. ignoring the packet and providing an error message to the source internet protocol address rate limiting the source internet protocol address tarpitting i.e. delaying future incoming packets from the source internet protocol address the source internet protocol address. Furthermore the network interface controller may log information including but not limited to logging the source internet protocol of the data packet and or logging network statistics e.g. roundtrip times retransmits etc. corresponding to the data packet in internal memory of the network interface controller such as the memory described in conjunction with . In other embodiments some operations that may be taken in may be to add the source internet protocol address or domain address to an internet protocol table as an address to be blocked or monitored and further may communicate the offending source internet protocol address or domain address to other network interface controllers with processors on the network or data center possibly through an out of band management channel so that the other network interface controllers with processors may add the source internet protocol address or domain address to their internet protocol tables as an address to be blocked or monitored. In another embodiment usable in combination with other embodiments the source internet protocol address may be routed to another device for forensic analysis.

However if the header is valid the processor performing the process proceeds to wherein the on board processor performs a check to determine whether the checksum is valid for the data packet header of the data packet trailer of the data packet or payload as appropriate for the particular packet type or protocol involved. If the checksum validation fails the processor performing the process may proceed to wherein appropriate action as described above is performed.

Likewise if the checksum is valid the processor performing the process proceeds to wherein the source internet protocol address is checked against internet protocol tables stored in memory of the network interface controller such as the memory described in conjunction with . If the source internet protocol address is found in the internet protocol tables as an internet protocol address to be blocked or watched the processor performing the process may proceed to wherein appropriate action as described above is performed.

Otherwise if the source internet protocol address is verified in the processor performing the process proceeds to wherein the destination domain is referenced against domain names stored in memory of the network interface controller. In this step if a domain is known to be under a distributed denial of service attack incoming packets targeting that domain may be identified possibly by performing a regular expression regex to match the destination domain of the packet with domain names known to be under a distributed denial of service attack. Further checking of source internet protocol addresses source net blocks source ports destination internet protocol addresses or destination ports may be used to separate legitimate traffic to the domain from hostile traffic. As illustrated if the domain check of fails the processor performing the process may proceed to wherein appropriate action as described above is performed.

However in if the filtering passes the domain check in the processor performing the process proceeds to wherein the processor may check to determine whether an NTP attack may be occurring. During this operation if a data packet is recognized as being provided from an NTP server the processor may consult logging information in memory of the network interface controller such as the memory described in conjunction with FIG. to determine whether device hosting the network interface controller solicited the NTP server for the data packet. If the data packet does not correspond to an NTP request by the host device the processor performing the process may proceed to wherein appropriate action as described above is performed. Note that other methods for determining whether an NTP attack is occurring may be taken at alternatively or in addition to the operations described above.

In the processor performing the process may apply additional firewall rules including but not limited to deep packet filtering and detecting internet protocol addresses coming from countries where denial of service attack traffic is suspected of frequently originating. In some embodiments the on board processor of the network interface controller may be able to scan the payloads of data packets for viruses Trojans malware or other data to be flagged according to defined legitimacy criteria. If the verification check at fails the processor performing the process may proceed to wherein appropriate action as described above is performed. Otherwise at if the data packet passes all verification checks the processor performing the process may proceed to whereupon the network interface controller may then forward the data packet to the host device of the network interface controller. Note that in some embodiments the network interface controller may perform network monitoring by sampling incoming traffic and in rather than forwarding the data packet to the host device of the network interface controller may forward i.e. re route the data packet to another computing device with less network latency than the host device i.e. network load balancing as described above.

Note that where the data packet may be encrypted such as by transport layer security TLS or secure sockets layer SSL in some embodiments the network interface controller of the present disclosure may be further configured to perform decryption such as SSL offloading through SSL acceleration before performing some or all of the operations of the process . In other words in this embodiment the network interface controller may perform SSL processing to perform SSL handshakes to agree on symmetric or asymmetric keys and perform decryption on the data packet in order to perform deep packet filtering and or other filtering checks. Note that the operations performed in may be performed in various orders including in parallel.

In at least one embodiment the network interface controller of the present disclosure may be configured to receive updates through an out of band management channel. Out of band management provides the ability to modify and update the configuration of the network interface controller through a network physically separated connection or other communication channel independent from the software running on the host device of the network interface controller. Among other advantages out of band management on a network interface controller provides clients with the ability to update a network interface controller in the event that the host device such as a server is non responsive as a result of a denial of service attack. For example a system administrator of a data center may be able to update the internet protocol tables in the memory of the network interface controller by connecting to the network interface controller via an interface such as a telnet session or graphical user interface and upload new internet protocol tables and or firewall rules or flash the network interface controller with a new basic input output system BIOS to aid in mitigation of denial of service attacks.

In at least another embodiment multiple network interface controllers may be configured in a batch operation. An advantage of such an embodiment could be that a large data center utilizing many network interface controllers of the present disclosure may be able to save time and expense by providing multiple network interface controllers in the data center with updated internet protocol tables and firewall rules rather than having to update each network interface controller separately. In some embodiments network interface controllers in some computing devices may be configured with different internet protocol tables and firewall rules than network interface controllers in other computing devices. As another embodiment usable in combination with other embodiments a customer of a computing resource service provider such as the computing resource service provider computing resource service provider described in conjunction with may have access to perform out of band management on one or more network interface controllers within a server hosting services for the customer. For example a customer may have a need to protect the customer s website from one or more potential attackers known by the customer but not configured to be blocked by the network interface controllers of the servers hosting the customer s website. In such an example the customer may be able to perform out of band management remotely to add the one or more potential attackers to the internet protocol tables and or other firewall rules of the network interface controllers of the servers. In some embodiments such out of band management may be able to maintain separate internet protocol tables and firewall rules for different instances such as separate virtual computer system service instances as described in conjunction with executing on one or more servers.

In some embodiments network interface controllers of the type described in the present disclosure may communicate with other similar network interface controllers on the network through an out of band management channel. In such an embodiment a network interface controller with updated internet protocol tables and firewall rules may propagate the most recent internet protocol tables and firewall rules to other network interface controllers through the out of band management channel. An advantage of embodiments with this capability may be that a large data center utilizing many network interface controllers of the present disclosure may be able to save time and expense by only updating a single network interface controller and the single network interface controller may push out the updates to the other network interface controllers without human intervention. Another advantage of embodiments of network interface controllers with the capability to communicate with each other through an out of band management channel may be that one network interface controller may be able to alert other network interface controllers of a detected denial of service attack and thereby prepare the other network interface controllers for the attack with updated detection and mitigation information.

In other embodiments the network interface controllers of the present disclosure may be at least one level of a multi level filtering process. For example in a data center dedicated devices and software may be utilized to perform certain types of coarse grained denial of service mitigation such as detecting and mitigating NTP reflection attacks or SNMP reflection attacks while computing devices hosting network interface controllers of the present disclosure may comprise a second tier of more fine grained denial of service attack mitigation such as comparing source internet protocol information in packet headers to internet protocol tables and domain filtering as described above. In some embodiments two or more network interface controllers of the present disclosure may be present within a single host computing device and may be in communication with each other. In such an embodiment each network card may perform differing amounts and types of filtering at different tiers of a multi level filtering process. For example a first network interface controller may perform a coarse grained filtering passing packets that are not filtered out to a second network interface controller for more fine grained filtering which may in turn pass packets that are not filtered out to a third network interface controller for even finer grained filtering and so on with the final network interface controller providing packets that pass the legitimacy criteria to the host computing device. is a block diagram illustrating an example of a process for modifying the configuration of a network interface controller in accordance with various embodiments. The process may be implemented by a network interface controller of the present disclosure hosted by any suitable system such as a data server web server personal computing device router switch or any electronic client device such as the computing device described in conjunction with and the electronic client device described in conjunction with . The process includes a series of operations wherein a client makes a request to perform an out of band management operation on a network interface controller of the present disclosure such as network interface controller of . In a network interface controller receives a request from a client through an out of band management channel to perform a management operation on the network interface controller. As noted the request may arrive through a network communication channel a physically separated connection or other communications channel. Although the network interface controller of the present disclosure may be managed remotely from the device hosting the network interface controller in at least some examples the network interface controller may be managed through a shell application or other interface executing on the host device. The client making the request may be an individual or may be a service such as a service executing under the control of a computing resource services provider.

In the network interface controller authenticates the request by the requestor. Authentication may occur according to a variety of established methods such as verification by submission of credentials such as a username and password or a digital signature utilizing public private key encryption. After the requestor has been determined to have sufficient permissions the network interface controller may generate an access token performing actions the requestor is authorized to perform such as in below.

In the requestor submits a request to change the configuration of the network interface controller. Such configuration changes include but are not limited to flashing the BIOS of the network interface controller updating the internet protocol tables of the network interface controller updating firewall rules of the network interface controller creation of new firewall rules for the network interface controller and changing a password of a user of the network interface controller. If the requestor is authorized to perform the requested action the device performing the process proceeds to . In the network interface controller performs the requested modification. For example the requestor may have submitted one or more internet protocol addresses to the internet protocol table block list the requestor may have selected to upload a file containing a revised internet protocol table or the requestor may have identified internet protocol addresses to log if detected by the network interface controller.

The computing resource service provider may provide various computing resource services to its customers. The services provided by the computing resource service provider in this example include a virtual computer system service a block level data storage service a cryptography service an on demand data storage service a notification service an authentication system a policy management service a task service and one or more other services .

As noted data stored in the on demand data storage service may be organized into data objects. The data objects may have arbitrary sizes except perhaps for certain constraints on size. Thus the on demand data storage service may store numerous data objects of varying sizes. The on demand data storage service may operate as a key value store that associates data objects with identifiers of the data objects which may be used by the customer to retrieve or perform other operations in connection with the data objects stored by the on demand data storage service .

The computing resource service provider in various embodiments is also equipped with a task service . The task service is configured to receive a task package from the customer and enable executing tasks as dictated by the task package. The task service may be configured to use any resource of the computing resource service provider such as one or more instantiated virtual machines or virtual hosts for executing the task. The task service may configure the one or more instantiated virtual machines or virtual hosts to operate using a selected operating system and or a selected execution application in accordance with a requirement of the customer .

The computing resource service provider additionally maintains one or more other services based at least in part on the needs of its customers . For instance the computing resource service provider may maintain a database service for its customers . A database service may be a collection of computing resources that collectively operate to run one or more databases for one or more customers . The customer may operate and manage a database from the database service by utilizing appropriately configured API calls. This in turn may allow a customer to maintain and potentially scale the operations in the database. Other services include but are not limited to object level archival data storage services services that manage and or monitor other services and or other services.

The illustrative environment includes at least one application server and a data store . It should be understood that there can be several application servers layers or other elements processes or components which may be chained or otherwise configured which can interact to perform tasks such as obtaining data from an appropriate data store. Servers as used herein may be implemented in various ways such as hardware devices or virtual computer systems. In some contexts servers may refer to a programming module being executed on a computer system. As used herein unless otherwise stated or clear from context the term data store refers to any device or combination of devices capable of storing accessing and retrieving data which may include any combination and number of data servers databases data storage devices and data storage media in any standard distributed virtual or clustered environment. The application server can include any appropriate hardware software and firmware for integrating with the data store as needed to execute aspects of one or more applications for the client device handling some or all of the data access and business logic for an application. The application server may provide access control services in cooperation with the data store and is able to generate content including but not limited to text graphics audio video and or other content usable to be provided to the user which may be served to the user by the web server in the form of HyperText Markup Language HTML Extensible Markup Language XML JavaScript Cascading Style Sheets CSS or another appropriate client side structured language. Content transferred to a client device may be processed by the client device to provide the content in one or more forms including but not limited to forms that are perceptible to the user audibly visually and or through other senses including touch taste and or smell. The handling of all requests and responses as well as the delivery of content between the client device and the application server can be handled by the web server using PHP Hypertext Preprocessor PHP Python Ruby Perl Java HTML XML or another appropriate server side structured language in this example. It should be understood that the web and application servers are not required and are merely example components as structured code discussed herein can be executed on any appropriate device or host machine as discussed elsewhere herein.
