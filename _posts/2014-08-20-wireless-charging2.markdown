Generally wired charging between vehicles requires hardware such as jumper cables. For example jumper cables may be electric cables which electrically connect power sources such as batteries of two vehicles. Jumper cables booster cables or jump leads have a pair of insulated wires with alligator clips which enable the ends of the jumper cable to be attached to a disabled vehicle or a corresponding power source such as a battery of another vehicle. However jump starting a vehicle or forming such physical connections may be dangerous because flammable hydrogen gas may be produced as a result. Further users or operators may be injured if correct jump start procedures are not followed such as if a recommended sequence of connections is not followed.

As an example if connections are not properly made a short circuit may be created thereby igniting the battery or hydrogen gas associated with the battery. Additionally jumper cables generally cannot be utilized to interconnect systems with different operating voltages or different system voltages. For example if a jumper cable is used to connect a 6V system with a 12V system damage to one or both systems may result. In any event there may be risks associated with wired charging or utilizing jumper cables to provide electrical power from one vehicle to another or from a power source e.g. backup battery to a vehicle in need of power. Additionally with regard to hybrid vehicles or electric vehicles wired charging for these vehicles may occur at charging stations which may be difficult to find and are not portable.

This brief description is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are described below in the detailed description. This brief description is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

In one or more embodiments a vehicle to vehicle wireless charging system is provided. A first vehicle equipped with a first vehicle to vehicle wireless charging system may charge jump start or supply electrical power or energy for a second vehicle equipped with a second vehicle to vehicle wireless charging system such as when the second vehicle is stalled disabled or in need of electrical power e.g. and the first vehicle has electrical power . As an example if the second vehicle is disabled in need of a jump start or otherwise in need of electrical power the first vehicle may be parked or stationed within a charging proximity of the second vehicle. The first vehicle may be oriented such that a primary charge component of the first vehicle is within a charging proximity of a secondary charge component of the second vehicle.

The first vehicle the second vehicle or both the first vehicle and the second vehicle may monitor a surrounding environment e.g. traffic roadways etc. or a real world environment for hazards such as oncoming traffic passing traffic etc. Respective vehicles may provide generate or render one or more notifications based on one or more detected hazards within the real world environment thereby alerting users or individuals of potentially dangerous scenarios when charging should be conducted or when charging should be avoided. The second vehicle e.g. the vehicle with no charge may communicate one or more vehicle specifications to the first vehicle to facilitate wireless charging. For example one or more of the vehicle specifications may include operating voltages current ranges open circuit voltages ampere hours cranking amperes reserve capacity of a battery etc. This enables the vehicle to vehicle wireless charging system of the first vehicle to provide power or charging to the second vehicle accordingly. In other words the first vehicle may step up or step down voltage levels according to system voltage levels e.g. 24 V or 12V for the second vehicle for example.

In one or more embodiments vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may be achieved through electromagnetic induction. The first vehicle may include a primary charge component and the second vehicle may include a secondary charge component. Together when these two components are in close enough proximity or within a charging proximity of each other respective charge components may form an electrical transformer. In other words the primary charge component of the first vehicle may include one or more induction coils. Similarly the secondary charge component of the second vehicle may also include one or more induction coils. When current such as a charging current is passed through the primary charge component a time varying magnetic field is generated. Accordingly when the secondary charge component is placed within a charging proximity of the primary charge component exposure to this time varying magnetic field induces a current in the secondary charge component thereby providing electrical power to the second vehicle. Connecting the secondary charge component to a battery thereby enables the battery to be charged.

Further in one or more embodiments control may be provided to a user driver or operator of the first vehicle such that he or she may engage in charging the second vehicle without exiting or without the need to exit the first vehicle. For example a control component or an interface component of the first vehicle may enable an operator or user to place or engage both vehicles in paired charging modes e.g. the first vehicle in charge providing mode and the second vehicle in charge receiving mode guide the operator to align the first vehicle appropriately with the second vehicle and commence charging. In this way vehicle to vehicle charging may be achieved in a wireless efficient and safe manner.

Such inference may result in the construction of new events or new actions from a set of observed events or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.

The interface component may enable a user a driver or occupant to interact with or provide input such as user input gestures clicks points selections etc. to the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging. As an example the interface component may include a touch screen a touchpad a trackpad one or more hardware buttons one or more software buttons one or more soft buttons one or more switches a keypad a microphone one or more sensors or other human machine interface HMI etc. The interface component may integrate one or more other components such as a display component an input receiving component a touch screen capable of receiving touch input or gesture inputs and also be capable of rendering content such as icons shortcuts a home screen an interface etc. In other words the interface component may include a touchscreen a display component or one or more other components which enable a user to interact with the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging.

Accordingly the interface component may receive one or more user inputs such as user inputs from a user driver or other occupant of a vehicle. In one or more embodiments the interface component may enable a driver operator user or other entity to communicatively couple a device such as a mobile device with the vehicle or the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging. Here in these embodiments the mobile device may be utilized by the user to interface or interact with the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging. For example if the mobile device is equipped with a touch screen or one or more buttons the interface component may enable the user to interact with the system by rendering an interface which allows the user to manage the system . In other words the interface component may enable a user to manipulate one or more aspects of the system via an application installed on a mobile device which is communicatively coupled to the vehicle e.g. via the communication component .

Regardless the interface component may receive a variety of types of user inputs such as verbal commands spoken commands e.g. utilizing a microphone or audio sensor pressing of buttons activating switches gesture inputs such as a swipe a two finger swipe a pinch and zoom a touch e.g. utilizing a touch screen a press a press and hold a selection a movement of a cursor a click e.g. utilizing a button mouse button track button etc.

In one or more embodiments the interface component may receive one or more user inputs and place or engage a vehicle in a charge providing mode or a charge receiving mode based on one or more of the user inputs. As will be described herein e.g. in a vehicle equipped with a system A for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may interact with or facilitate charging with another vehicle equipped with another system B for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging. In other words a first vehicle equipped with a first system A for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may charge jump start or supply electrical power or electrical energy to a second vehicle equipped with a second system B for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging for example. In this example the first vehicle or the first system A may be the vehicle providing electrical power and therefore be in charge providing mode. Similarly the second vehicle or the second system B may be the vehicle receiving electrical power e.g. due to being stalled disabled or otherwise having little or no electrical power and therefore be in charge receiving mode.

Accordingly the system of may be described from different perspectives such as a perspective associated with a system in charge providing mode or a perspective associated with a system in charge receiving mode. In one or more embodiments a same system may operate or be capable of being placed in either mode e.g. charge providing mode or charge receiving mode . Generally when a vehicle is travelling the system may place or engage the vehicle in normal operating mode. However when circumstances arise such as when a vehicle has little or no charge a user may utilize the interface component to place or engage that vehicle in charge receiving mode. Here in this example the interface component may receive a user input and place the vehicle in charge receiving mode based on or in response to the user input. For example the interface component may render a menu on a display of a vehicle which provides a user an option to place a vehicle in charge receiving mode. In other embodiments the interface component may place a vehicle in charge receiving mode based on a current battery level being below a threshold battery level for example. In other words the interface component may place the vehicle in charge receiving mode e.g. automatically when a battery of a vehicle dies or is close to dying. In this way the interface component may place a vehicle in charge receiving mode. A vehicle may be placed in charge receiving mode utilizing manual configuration or inputs from hardware buttons in the event that no power is available to render an interface for example.

Similarly when a vehicle equipped with a system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging is preparing to provide electrical power to another vehicle a user may utilize the interface component to place or engage that vehicle in charge providing mode. Here in this example the interface component may receive a user input and place the vehicle in charge providing mode based on or in response to the user input. Again the interface component may render a menu on a display of a vehicle which provides a user an option to place the vehicle in charge providing mode. In this way the interface component may place a vehicle in charge providing mode. Accordingly it may be seen that the interface component may be utilized to place or engage a vehicle in one or more different modes such as charge providing mode charge receiving mode or normal operation mode etc. Examples of different user inputs which may be utilized to place or engage a vehicle in different modes or charging modes may include selection of menu items pressing of corresponding buttons etc. The interface component may render a menu with different mode options such as enter charge providing mode enter charge receiving mode or enter normal operation mode and receive corresponding user inputs for example.

Regardless interface components e.g. A and B of may pair a first vehicle with a second vehicle such that the first vehicle is in charge providing mode and such that the second vehicle is in charge receiving mode. In one or more embodiments multiple vehicles e.g. two or more vehicles may be placed in charge providing mode to provide electrical power to a vehicle in charge receiving mode. In other words it may be possible for multiple or two or more vehicles to concurrently or simultaneously wirelessly charge a vehicle. In any event the interface component may enable users or operators of one or more vehicles to place or engage vehicles in different charging modes to facilitate vehicle to vehicle wireless charging.

In one or more embodiments the interface component may engage a vehicle in a charging mode such as a charge providing mode or a charge receiving mode in an automatic fashion. For example the interface component may engage a second vehicle in charge receiving mode based on a proximity of a first vehicle e.g. the charge providing vehicle or the charge providing vehicle to be to the second vehicle e.g. the charge receiving vehicle or the charge receiving vehicle to be . In other words the interface component may engage or place a vehicle in a charge providing mode when a disabled vehicle is detected such as a vehicle equipped with a system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging which is low or in need of electrical power. Here the sensor component for respective vehicles may detect the other vehicle the power level of the other vehicle the proximity of the first vehicle to the second vehicle or vice versa. The sensor component may in one or more embodiments disable charging unless vehicles are within a proximity in contact with each other or almost within contact for example.

A system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may include a sensor component . The sensor component enables a vehicle equipped with the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging to detect one or more hazards in a surrounding environment or in a real world environment. In this way a first vehicle a second vehicle or both the first vehicle and the second vehicle may monitor a surrounding environment e.g. traffic roadways etc. or a real world environment for hazards such as oncoming traffic passing traffic etc. which may be on a collision course with the first vehicle or the second vehicle. For example the sensor component may include an image capture unit a radar unit a laser unit an infrared unit etc. Respective units of the sensor component may thus enable the sensor component to detect or monitor for one or more hazards within a real world environment or a surrounding environment. For example the image capture unit may capture one or more successive image snapshots and extrapolate or infer whether or not an object e.g. a vehicle or oncoming traffic has an anticipated collision course with one or more of the vehicles e.g. the first vehicle or the second vehicle or users standing nearby for example. In this way the sensor component may monitor or detect one or more hazards within an environment.

The sensor component may also utilize technologies such as radar technology or laser technology to facilitate detection of objects or movement associated therewith. The sensor component may include multiple sensors or units which may be mounted at various locations on a vehicle. For example with regard to image capture units the sensor component may include a front image capture unit a dashboard image capture unit a side image capture unit a rear view image capture unit etc. The sensor component may sample frequency of oncoming traffic or other statistics associated with objects within a real world environment such as average velocity of passing traffic or oncoming traffic.

Further the notification component may provide notifications or alerts to indicate to one or more users that an area is congested or that an area where a vehicle is located is a high risk area for wireless charging e.g. due to average vehicle velocity . Further the notification component may infer or calculate a likelihood or risk factor for accidents e.g. a collision due to traffic in the area based on velocity of traffic detected by the sensor component or volume of traffic detected by the sensor component . Here the notification component may calculate or determine volume of traffic while the sensor component may detect velocity associated with detected traffic or averages associated therewith. The interface component may regulate or control when a vehicle may enter a charging mode such as charge providing mode or charge receiving mode. For example the interface component may disable charging modes based on a proximity of one or more of the detected hazards from the vehicle. In other words if the sensor component detects multiple hazards and the interface component determines that the risk factor is too high e.g. over a threshold risk factor the interface component may not enable vehicle to vehicle wireless charging to be enabled or for a vehicle to enter a charging mode such as charge providing mode or charge receiving mode unless the user acknowledges such risks or clears notifications provided by the notification component as will be discussed herein .

In one or more embodiments when the sensor component detects one or more hazards such as oncoming traffic which is determined or inferred to have a collision course with one or more of the vehicles engaged in wireless charging e.g. prior to during or after the charging or while a vehicle is stationary or in park the notification components of respective vehicles may provide generate or render one or more notifications or one or more alerts based on one or more of the detected hazards or a hazard having or being associated with an inferred collision course with a vehicle such as the first vehicle e.g. in charge providing mode or the second vehicle e.g. in charge receiving mode . In other words a vehicle may provide notifications based on detected hazards within a real world environment or a surrounding environment thereby alerting users or individuals of potentially dangerous scenarios. Further a notification component may notify or alert users of when charging should be conducted when charging should not be conducted or scenarios to avoid for example.

In this way the notification component may render one or more alerts based on one or more detected hazards within the real world environment. For example the notification component may render one or more audio alerts in response to a detected hazard. The audio alert may be internal to the vehicle if the sensor component detects that a user or individual is seated within a vehicle. The audio alert may be audible outside of the vehicle or be external to the vehicle based on a presence of a user or individual outside of the vehicle. For example if a user exits a vehicle to facilitate vehicle to vehicle wireless charging the sensor component may detect that the user has left the vehicle. Similarly if other occupants remain in the vehicle the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may have the notification component provide audio alerts both internally within the vehicle and externally to the real world environment e.g. honking a horn such as when another vehicle is detected and determined or inferred to be on a collision course with the vehicle equipped with the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging.

As an example the notification component may play a pre recorded warning or otherwise provide notifications for users to clear an area or a charging proximity when wireless charging is about to commence or be initiated. Further when an interface component of a first vehicle e.g. A of places the first vehicle in charge providing mode and an interface component of a second vehicle e.g. B of places the second vehicle in charge receiving mode respective interface components A and B may share notifications generated between vehicles via communications component s of respective vehicles such as via a connection a wireless connection a telematics channel etc.

For example if a first vehicle is in charge providing mode and a second vehicle is in charge receiving mode the first vehicle may be considered to be paired with the second vehicle e.g. though additional vehicles may engage in wireless charging . Continuing with this example if a sensor component of the first vehicle detects a hazard e.g. prior to the sensor component of the second vehicle detecting the same hazard or because the sensor component of the first vehicle is aligned to detect the hazard the communication component of the first vehicle may transmit a notification to the communication component of the second vehicle. The notification component of the first vehicle may provide an alert or notification for users or individuals within the first vehicle. Additionally the transmittal of the notification via the communication component s of respective vehicles enables a notification component the second vehicle to alert users or provide notifications accordingly. In this way notifications may be broadcast between vehicles which are paired for example.

In one or more embodiments the sensor component and notification component of a vehicle may facilitate vehicle to vehicle wireless charging such as by detecting orientation or proximity of vehicles or detecting objects which may reduce charging efficiency or pose as potential hazards. For example the sensor component may detect a position of a first vehicle e.g. a vehicle providing charge or a vehicle in charge providing mode relative to a position of a second vehicle e.g. a disabled vehicle or a vehicle in charge receiving mode .

As discussed herein electromagnetic induction may be utilized to facilitate wireless charging between vehicles such as between a first vehicle and a second vehicle. When induction is utilized wireless charging may be promoted or may be more efficient when charge components of vehicles are closer in proximity. Accordingly the sensor component may detect a proximity of a first vehicle in charge providing mode to a second vehicle in charge receiving mode and guide a user or driver to orient the first vehicle e.g. which is not disabled to be within a charging proximity of the second vehicle or such that a primary charge component e.g. of the first vehicle is within the charging proximity of the secondary charge component e.g. of the second vehicle . Further the notification component s of respective vehicles may provide notifications to guide the user or driver to engage the vehicles in an appropriate manner. In other words a system may notify a driver to move a vehicle having or providing electrical power via wireless charging closer to another vehicle to be charged via wireless charging. In this way the sensor component and the notification component may detect positioning of vehicles and guide users or drivers accordingly by providing notifications or alerts based on orientation factors or proximities detected by the sensor component for example.

In one or more embodiments the sensor component may detect objects which may interfere with charging such as objects which may be associated with electromagnetic shielding or objects which may be affected by electromagnetic induction. In other words the sensor component may detect objects which have the potential to be charged by the primary charge component of a vehicle such as objects which may be shaped similarly to an induction coil for example. Other objects detected by the sensor component may merely interfere with wireless charging by reducing efficiency of the charging such as by magnetically shielding a charge component. Regardless the notification component may render one or more notifications or one or more alerts based on objects detected by the sensor component .

The communication component may enable a vehicle to communicate transfer transmit receive etc. data associated with that vehicle or another vehicle. A second vehicle e.g. the vehicle with no charge may communicate one or more vehicle specifications to a first vehicle to facilitate wireless charging. This enables the vehicle to vehicle wireless charging system of the first vehicle to provide power or charging to the second vehicle accordingly. For example a communication component may transmit or receive one or more vehicle specifications or one or more vehicle attributes associated with a vehicle e.g. a first vehicle to a communication component of another vehicle e.g. a second vehicle . Vehicle specifications may include power specifications operating voltages current ranges open circuit voltages ampere hours cranking amperes reserve capacity charge level of a battery etc. In this way the communication component may enable the system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging to communicate specifications attributes statuses such as battery level etc. with another vehicle.

In one or more embodiments the communication component and the interface component may facilitate wireless charging by finding other vehicles in an area or a radius which are capable of wireless charging or are equipped with similar systems and notify drivers of those vehicles that wireless charging is requested such as when the interface component of a vehicle places or engages a vehicle in charge receiving mode. For example when the interface component places a vehicle in charge receiving mode e.g. automatically when the battery dies based on a user input or in response to a user input the communication component may transmit a beacon to other drivers in the area driving or operating vehicles equipped with systems for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging. Here in this example drivers within a ten mile radius may receive the beacon via their respective communication components and be notified via their notification components . The notified drivers or authorities e.g. for safety reasons may be provided with contact information for the user or driver of the disabled vehicle to promote use of the wireless charging feature for example.

The communication component may facilitate pairing of two or more vehicles. For example the communication component s of two vehicles may have a connection or be communicatively coupled via a channel such as a telematics channel. Further the communication component may enable broadcasting or sharing of functionalities across multiple vehicles. For example if a sensor component of a second vehicle is broken or disabled information from a sensor component of a first vehicle may be shared or broadcast to the second vehicle to promote pairing as well as safety.

If a second vehicle is disabled in need of a jump start or otherwise in need of electrical power a first vehicle may be parked or stationed within a charging proximity of the second vehicle. The first vehicle may be oriented such that a primary charge component of the first vehicle is within a charging proximity of a secondary charge component of the second vehicle. In one or more embodiments the primary charge component and the secondary charge component may include one or more induction coils to facilitate wireless charging via electromagnetic induction. Vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may be achieved through electromagnetic induction utilizing these charge components e.g. from a first vehicle and e.g. from a second vehicle . A first vehicle may include a primary charge component and a second vehicle may include a secondary charge component . Together when these two components are in close enough proximity or within a charging proximity of each other respective charge components and may form an electrical transformer.

As an example the primary charge component of the first vehicle may include one or more induction coils. Similarly the secondary charge component of the second vehicle may also include one or more induction coils. When current such as a charging current is passed through the primary charge component a time varying magnetic field is generated. Accordingly when the secondary charge component is placed within a charging proximity of the primary charge component exposure to this time varying magnetic field induces a current in the secondary charge component thereby providing electrical power to the second vehicle. Explained yet another way the primary charge component of a first vehicle may generate a time varying magnetic field based on a charging current or otherwise act as a charging base station . The secondary charge component of a second vehicle may generate an inducted current based on exposure to the time varying magnetic field caused by the primary charge component . Here the secondary charge component may induce a current based on the exposure to the time varying magnetic field or otherwise take power from the electromagnetic field and convert that power into electrical current which may be utilized to charge a battery of the second vehicle. In one or more embodiments the primary charge component or the secondary charge component may be moveable portable or removable from a vehicle.

In one or more embodiments the secondary charge component may be connected with a battery of a vehicle to facilitate charging or wireless charging. In other embodiments engaging a vehicle in charge receiving mode e.g. via the interface component may include electrically connecting a component associated with induced current to a battery of the vehicle. For example the interface component may place or engage a vehicle in charge receiving mode by electrically connecting the secondary charge component to a battery of the vehicle via a switch. In one or more embodiments a user driver or operator of a vehicle may manually connect the secondary charge component to the battery by manually operating the switch e.g. due to no power or safety reasons . Connecting the secondary charge component to a battery thereby enables the battery to be charged upon commencement of wireless charging e.g. when the primary charge component is within a charging proximity and provided with a charging current .

In one or more embodiments the sensor component may determine a charge level of a battery of a vehicle. For example when the sensor component determined that a battery is 95 charged the interface component may automatically disconnect the secondary charge component of the vehicle from the battery of the vehicle such that overcharging of the battery does not occur. In this way the interface component may automatically disengage a vehicle from charge receiving mode. Additionally the communication component of a second vehicle e.g. in charge receiving mode may notify the communication component of a first vehicle e.g. in charge providing mode or transmit a battery level of the battery of the second vehicle. The communication component of the first vehicle may receive the battery level and similarly have the interface component of the first vehicle disengage or disable charge providing mode for the first vehicle e.g. due to the charged status of the battery of the second vehicle .

In one or more embodiments a converter component may convert a voltage associated with a secondary charge component to a voltage associated with one or more vehicle specifications of a vehicle such as a vehicle in charge receiving mode. In other words the converter may convert a voltage associated with the induced current e.g. associated with the secondary charge component to a voltage associated with one or more vehicle specifications of the vehicle receiving power. This enables a vehicle to make adjustments to voltage current or power settings associated with a vehicle or a component of a vehicle accordingly e.g. to suit a make model year trim etc. of a vehicle unlike jumper cables for example. Accordingly it can be seen that the converter component may enable a second vehicle to step up or step down voltage levels according to system voltage levels e.g. 24 V or 12V for that vehicle. The converter component may include DC to DC converters voltage regulators linear regulators or other types of power conversion systems.

The control component or the sensor component may enable a monitoring of a charge level or a battery level of a battery of a vehicle. The control component may cause the interface component to render status updates as to the battery level or charge level to enable a user or operator to see the battery level of a vehicle which is engaged in wireless charging. The control component may calculate an estimated charge time an inferred charge time a time until a vehicle may be started or ignition engaged etc. based on a detected rate of charge a proximity of the vehicles a charging current etc. e.g. via the sensor component . Further the control component may adjust or control an amperage associated with the charging current based on one or more vehicle specifications or vehicle attributes of the other vehicle e.g. in charge receiving mode distance between vehicles or corresponding charge components size of induction coils within respective charge components etc. In this way the control component may facilitate one or more aspects of vehicle to vehicle wireless charging.

If the sensor component detects a short circuit etc. the control component may disable wireless charging for a corresponding vehicle e.g. via disabling charging modes and by communicating an error to a paired communication component of another vehicle which may also disable charging mode in a similar fashion for example.

In one or more embodiments the control component the interface component the sensor component and the notification component may enable a user to start a disabled vehicle e.g. a second vehicle without getting into the second vehicle or leaving their vehicle e.g. a first vehicle . Accordingly may be described with reference to one or more components of the system of implemented in a first vehicle and a second vehicle.

The interface component B of the first vehicle may automatically place the first vehicle in charge providing mode based on detecting the second vehicle being disabled or a driver of the first vehicle may manually select an option via an interface rendered by the interface component B to have vehicle enter charge providing mode. Regardless when respective vehicles and have entered charge receiving mode and charge providing mode sensor components e.g. of may detect one or more hazards or potential hazards and notification component may provide notifications based thereon.

Further in one or more embodiments control may be provided to a user driver or operator of the first vehicle e.g. via an interface component or control component such that he or she may engage in charging the second vehicle without exiting or without the need to exit the first vehicle . For example a control component or an interface component of the first vehicle may enable an operator or user to place both vehicles and in paired charging modes e.g. the first vehicle in charge providing mode and the second vehicle in charge receiving mode via the communication component guide e.g. via notifications directions or prompts from the notification component the operator to align the first vehicle appropriately with the second vehicle and commence charging. In this way vehicle to vehicle charging may be achieved in a wireless efficient and safe manner while providing the benefit of enabling a user or driver to have the option of not leaving or exiting a vehicle.

In one or more embodiments a system for vehicle to vehicle wireless charging may be utilized to provide charge by enabling a vehicle to act as a charging station to an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle equipped with a similar system for example.

One or more embodiments may employ various artificial intelligence AI based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. One or more aspects may be facilitated via an automatic classifier system or process. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class. In other words f x confidence class . Such classification may employ a probabilistic or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.

A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that may be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that may be similar but not necessarily identical to training data.
