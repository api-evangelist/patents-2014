Cellular and wireless communication devices such as smartphones have seen explosive growth over the past several years. This growth has been fueled by better communications hardware larger networks and more reliable protocols. Today s smartphones include cameras GPS receivers Bluetooth transceivers and of course the cellular communication capabilities e.g. LTE 3G and or 4G network access to enable the devices to establish data communication links with the Internet. Smartphones are now very widely deployed in society. Additionally the components and capabilities in smartphones are now very affordable enabling the capabilities to be deployed in other types of devices.

There are many uses for a device that can report when the device has been moved or is moving. On application is for determining location based functionality as long as computing device remains in a particular location e.g. on the desk it need not change its security or other settings. Another application is as a theft detector that sends a signal when it is being moved that a service can track. The use of GPS sensors for these applications may be expensive overkill.

The various embodiments provide methods devices systems and non transitory processor readable storage media for authenticating a computing device to access functionalities. An embodiment method may include operations for receiving in the computing device a first signal from a proximity beacon device obtaining from the received first signal information that indicates whether the proximity beacon device has detected movement determining whether the obtained information from the received first signal matches stored data corresponding to the proximity beacon device performing an abbreviated authentication operation for the computing device to access the functionalities when it is determined that the obtained information from the received first signal matches the stored data and performing a normal authentication operation for the computing device to access the functionalities when it is determined that the obtained information from the received first signal does not match the stored data. In an embodiment the first signal may be one of a broadcast message and a secure link. In an embodiment the method may further include operations for authenticating the proximity beacon device based on the obtained information from the received first signal. In an embodiment authenticating the proximity beacon device based on the obtained information from the received first signal may include transmitting a message to a server to authenticate the proximity beacon device based on the obtained information from the received first signal and receiving from the server a response message that indicates whether the proximity beacon device is authenticated. In an embodiment the obtained information from the received first signal may include an obscured device identifier. In an embodiment the obtained information from the received first signal may include a 64 bit movement indicator. In an embodiment the abbreviated authentication operation may include automatically logging into at least one of a WiFi router a website and an application or automatically configuring the computing device to operate in a configuration mode. In an embodiment the method may further include operations for broadcasting a second signal with a device identifier receiving from a server a message that indicates whether a proximity broadcast receiver that received the broadcast second signal has been moved performing the abbreviated authentication operation for the computing device to access the functionalities when the received message indicates the proximity broadcast receiver has not been moved and performing a normal authentication operation for the computing device to access the functionalities when the received message indicates the proximity broadcast receiver has been moved.

Further embodiments include a computing device having means for performing functions of the operations of the methods described above. Further embodiments include non transitory processor readable medium on which are stored processor executable instructions configured to cause a processor of a computing device to perform operations of the methods described above.

The various embodiments will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.

The terms mobile computing device or mobile device or computing device are used herein to refer to any one or all of cellular telephones smartphones e.g. iPhone web pads tablet computers Internet enabled cellular telephones WiFi enabled electronic devices personal data assistants PDA s laptop computers personal computers and similar electronic devices equipped with at least a processor. In various embodiments such devices may be configured with a network transceiver to establish a wide area network WAN or local area network LAN connection e.g. an LTE 3G or 4G wireless wide area network transceiver a wired connection to the Internet or WiFi . Further such devices may also be configured with components for exchanging short range wireless signals such as Bluetooth transmissions.

The term server is used to refer to any computing device capable of functioning as a server such as a master exchange server web server mail server document server and a personal or mobile computing device configure with software to execute server functions e.g. a light server . A server may be a dedicated computing device or a computing device including a server module e.g. running an application which may cause the computing device to operate as a server . A server module or server application may be a full function server module or a light or secondary server module e.g. light or secondary server application that is configured to provide synchronization services among the dynamic databases on computing devices. A light server or secondary server may be a slimmed down version of server type functionality that can be implemented on a personal or mobile computing device such as a smart phone thereby enabling it to function as an Internet server e.g. an enterprise e mail server to a limited extent such as necessary to provide the functionality described herein.

The various embodiments include systems methods devices and non transitory processor readable storage media for beacon devices to transmit information that provides location awareness to nearby receiver computing devices such as Bluetooth capable mobile devices. A beacon device may include a short range wireless signal transmitter such as a Bluetooth transmitter an accelerometer or other sensor that can detect movement of the beacon device and a processor configured to change information e.g. an device identifier or ID movement indicator etc. transmitted via the transmitter in response to the accelerometer or other sensor detecting that the beacon device has moved. The transmitted information e.g. ID may be generated in a manner that enables a remote server to identify and confirm the identity of the beacon device to a receiver computing device reporting receipt of the transmitted information. Because the beacon device transmits a short range signal that includes information that changes in response to movement a receiver computing device determining that the information e.g. ID has not changed can perform operations presuming that the receiver computing device is in the same location i.e. within close proximity to the beacon device which has not moved as it was when it first encountered to beacon device. Thus an authentication or registration process that was performed when information from the beacon device e.g. ID was first received and confirmed can be relied on to enable the receiver computing device to perform an abbreviated authentication or registration process. For example when a smartphone receiver computing device receives from a beacon device a wireless signal that includes expected data e.g. identifier value etc. the receiver computing device may determine that it is within an office in which the beacon device was previously broadcasting. Receiver computing devices may be configured to perform operations in response to determining they are in proximity to a beacon device in a known or pre associated location such as abbreviated authentication operations for accessing functionalities appropriate for the known location. For example a receiver computing device that has determined based on receiving a beacon device ID that it previously received that it is within an office or other pre associated location may utilize an easy setup routine that runs applications supplies credentials or performs other menial tasks related to the office or other associated location.

As actual location information e.g. GPS coordinates or other geographic information etc. may not be within signals from beacon devices a receiver computing device in receipt of a beacon device signal may merely be aware that it is within proximity to a beacon device without being certain the beacon device is still at its pre associated location. Therefore a beacon device may transmit information within wireless signals that indicates whether the beacon device has been moved or otherwise re located to avoid spoofed or otherwise inaccurate information that may improperly cause the receiver computing device to determine it is within a known location. The beacon device may transmit a rolling device identifier a movement indicator e.g. a numeric value or both that change in relation to the beacon device being moved. For example every time sensor data is detected that indicates movement the beacon device may be configured to roll increment decrement or otherwise change a number e.g. a 64 bit register value included or encoded within its periodic broadcast signals. As another example every time sensor data is detected that indicates movement the beacon device may stop rolling an encoded device identifier within periodic broadcasts to indicate movement of the beacon device. Such changing information based on movement may enable nearby receiver computing devices to validate any inference of location from signals received from known beacon devices thereby making information tamper or movement resistant.

As an illustration a beacon device may be placed in an office and may periodically broadcast a signal that includes a first identifier. A laptop receiver computing device may store information associating the beacon device and the first identifier with a particular first configuration mode in which the laptop screen does not lock when within proximity of the beacon device i.e. it is safe to leave the screen unlocked when within the office . When the laptop is in the office receiving wireless signals including the first identifier from the beacon device the laptop may operate in the first configuration mode. If the beacon device is moved from the office to a lobby area the beacon device changes the identifier included in broadcasts from the device so that it begins periodically broadcasting a signal including a second identifier. The next time that the laptop receives signals from the beacon device the signals include the second identifier. Because the laptop determines that beacon device signals include a different identifier than previously received the laptop may not operate in the first configuration mode and thus may enter another second configuration mode such as a screen lock configuration because the laptop cannot determine that it is safe to remain in the first configuration such as the screen unlocked configuration.

In various embodiments a beacon device may periodically broadcast a secure identifier e.g. a unique device identifier MAC address etc. using short range wireless signals e.g. Bluetooth LE WiFi etc. . The secure identifier may be encrypted encoded or otherwise obfuscated such as by encrypting a device identifier using a pseudo random function or encryption algorithm with a secret key. The beacon device may be registered with a central server and or other devices so that the secure identifier may be cross checked. For example a central server may also utilize the same encryption function and secret key used by the beacon device to decode the secure identifier to obtain an identification code that may be matched to stored identity data for the beacon device.

As beacon device identities may be spoofed or otherwise faked in various embodiments authentication of a beacon device may be required before a receiver computing device may perform operations associated with the beacon device and or its pre associated location. In particular a receiver computing device receiving a broadcast message from a beacon device may authenticate the beacon device based on information stored locally on the receiver computing device. For example the receiver computing device may match a secure identifier to data of previously authenticated beacon devices. Alternatively the receiver computing device may transmit a message to a central server causing the central server to perform authentication operations and return information indicating whether the beacon device is or is not authenticated. For example a central server may decode a rolling identifier to compare with stored information of all registered beacon devices. In another embodiment authentication operations may not be required when the beacon device and receiver computing device communicate via a secured link such as a paired Bluetooth connection or other similar secure transport mechanism as the communication may only be achieved with the pre authenticated parties.

In an embodiment the beacon device may be configured to maintain and transmit a movement indicator as a value number code or other data that indicates whether the beacon device has been moved. The movement indicator may be a large numeric e.g. a 32 bit 64 bit or 128 bit identifier such that the beacon device may be capable of changing the movement indicator once a second for an indefinite period without ever using the same value more than once. For example a 64 bit movement indicator e.g. a register value may be incremented in a random non repeating way every second without ever duplicating a value within a period of thousands of years. The movement indicator may be broadcast as an extra piece of data in addition to a secure identifier or a unique device identifier . In an embodiment the movement indicator may be broadcast in the open and the secure identifier e.g. a unique device identifier may be obscured or otherwise require authentication. In an embodiment the movement indicator may be signed.

In various embodiments the beacon device may include one or more internal motion sensors such as an accelerometer a magnetometer a piezoelectric sensor etc. configured to detect motion acceleration or other changes in environment. For example the beacon device may detect when it has been moved based on accelerometer sensor data that exceeds predefined threshold values. Other sensors such as a barometer a microphone a camera etc. may also be included within the beacon device and monitored to determine when the beacon device has been moved or experienced similar conditions. For example based on detected environmental changes e.g. air pressure light and or ambient sound as indicated in obtained sensor data e.g. barometer sensor data camera sensor data microphone sensor data etc. the beacon device may determine it has been moved into a new location. As another example the beacon device may determine it has been moved in response to an internal switch opening due to the absence of a magnet. In an embodiment the beacon device may utilize various tolerance thresholds when evaluating sensor data and determining movement. Such thresholds may be used to ignore errata or noise such as sensor data representing a bump or an earthquake as opposed to the wireless device being picked up and moved. For example the beacon device may determine that detected accelerometer sensor data having values lower than a predefined threshold value may not represent a movement but instead may represent a non actionable event e.g. a quick bump by a passerby .

Configured to detect movement based on sensor data the beacon device may be enabled to change information e.g. the secure identifier and or a movement indicator that it periodically broadcasts in response to being moved. For example the beacon device may roll a rolling identifier in response to detecting sensor data from an accelerator. The beacon device may increment decrement a value generate a new or random number as an identifier or movement indicator or perform other algorithms for adjusting the information it transmits when sensor data is detected that indicates movement. For example the beacon device may begin or stop rolling a device identifier in response to an internal switch opening due to the absence of a magnet. As another example with every detected movement based on a motion detector sensor a beacon device may perform an operation on a 64 bit register and broadcast the register s value in a payload. In an embodiment a previously transmitted information e.g. an identifier or movement indicator value may never again be transmitted by the beacon device once movement is detected. In other words a movement indicator may keep climbing without being reset. For example when the beacon device initially broadcasts a first code e.g. a zero as a movement indicator after a detected movement the beacon device may never broadcast the first code again instead broadcasting different codes e.g. a 1 etc. . In this way the beacon device may transmit movement indicators that are unique to itself but not necessarily different from movement indicators of other beacon devices enabling disambiguation when the beacon device has been moved. In an embodiment the beacon device may generate a secure identifier using the sensor data such as using accelerometer data as a source of random numbers that may be in the payload of a broadcast message or used in generating an obfuscated identifier. Accordingly when the beacon device is moved it may be configured to broadcast a packet that includes a unique identifier that is changed due to signals from a sensor.

Receiver computing devices may receive messages from beacon devices and determine whether identifiers within the messages are valid i.e. whether the beacon devices are still in a known location . In particular receiver computing devices may compare secure identifiers and or movement indicators from proximity beacon devices to stored identifiers to see if they match. For example a receiver computing device may compare a newly received movement indicator from a beacon device to a stored identifier that was received when the beacon device was located in an office. Alternatively receiver computing devices may transmit messages to a central server that may perform validation operations on identifiers. When identifiers from beacon devices are determined to be valid i.e. the beacon device has not been moved the receiver computing devices may perform operations associated with the locations related to the beacon devices.

In various embodiments when it confirms a proximity beacon device has not been moved from a known location a receiver computing device may perform abbreviated authentication operations or simplified authentication operations for accessing functionalities. In other words the receiver computing device may require less or different information from human operators before authenticating them for accessing protected information or services. For example a laptop that has become location aware of being within proximity of a beacon device in an office may automatically use stored user passwords that otherwise would have to be manually entered into the laptop by a user in order to access websites intranets etc. This is beneficial in that sensitive data e.g. passwords for web sites email documents etc. may be conveniently and safely accessible when the receiver computing device is determined to be within known locations. The receiver computing device e.g. a laptop a smartphone etc. may assume that the person using the receiver computing device is known when the receiver computing device is in certain known locations.

In an embodiment the receiver computing device may be configured to operate in different modes when it confirms a proximity beacon device has not been moved from a known location. For example when determined to be near a beacon device within a trusted known location e.g. a home a laptop receiver computing device may be configured to operate in a configuration mode that permits the receiver computing device s screen to not lock after a certain number of minutes of non use. As another example when in a trusted office location a smartphone receiver computing device may give its user access to some or all the information on the smartphone such as credentials to authenticate with a network however when not in the trusted office location the smartphone may change back to a operational or configuration mode that prompts the user to enter passwords to login unlock the screen access network resources etc.

In an embodiment identifiers concurrently received from more than one beacon device may be utilized to provide a receiver computing device with location awareness and enable abbreviated access to functionalities. As an illustration a first beacon device may be associated with a work desk such as by storing the identity of the first beacon device and its movement indicator in a relational database. A second beacon device may be associated with a verified user e.g. placed within the user s wallet purse backpack etc. such as by storing the identity of the second beacon device in the relational database. When a laptop receiver computing device receives broadcast messages from only one of the first and the second beacon devices nothing may happen e.g. no configuration mode may change in the laptop no automatic authentication operations may be available etc. . However when the laptop receiver computing device receives broadcast messages from both the first and the second beacon devices the laptop may perform operations associated with the verified user and the work desk e.g. automatic login to a work intranet enters screen unlock mode auto log the verified user into low risk systems websites etc. .

In an embodiment a moved beacon device may be re validated by updating stored data. For example after a beacon device changes its broadcast movement indicator due to being moved into a new office a smartphone receiver computing device may store the changed movement indicator for subsequent use. As another example a user may provide a new valid movement indicator of a beacon device to a central server for storage via a web portal e.g. update a beacon profile . As another example a smartphone receiver computing device may transmit a new valid movement indicator to a central server based on user inputs on the smartphone receiver in response to receiving a broadcast message from a moved beacon device.

The various embodiments of this disclosure are different from typical motion detection techniques that send alarm signals in response to detected movement. The techniques of various embodiments may utilize beacons that continuously transmit signals with a secure identifier and or a movement indicator that changes in response to detected movement. Further the embodiment techniques do not transmit location information but instead identifiers that may be evaluated to determine whether a receiver computing device is within a known location based on its proximity to a beacon device associated with the known location.

For the purpose of simplicity the following descriptions may refer to the communication framework devices and techniques as described in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 745 308 entitled Platform For Wireless Identity Transmitter and System Using Short Range Wireless Broadcasts filed Dec. 21 2012 and related U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 13 773 379 the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. However it should be appreciated that the various embodiments may utilize any similar communication framework and devices e.g. short range wireless signaling devices or beacon devices to exchange information enabling location awareness of receiver computing devices.

The term broadcast message is used herein to refer to short range wireless broadcast signals broadcast by wireless identity transmitters defined below that may include identification information i.e. identifiers associated with the wireless identity transmitters and or their users. Such identifiers may be periodically changed and encrypted i.e. rolling identifiers . In various embodiments broadcast messages may include other identifying information such as Bluetooth media access control MAC addresses and counters which may also be encrypted. Additionally broadcast messages may include metadata and other data such as characteristics of the transmitting wireless identity transmitter e.g. device type sensor data and or commands or other instructions. In various embodiments broadcast messages may be transmitted via a wireless communication protocol such as Bluetooth Low Energy WiFi WiFi Direct Zigbee Peanut and other RF protocol. In various embodiments because of the high unreliability of certain short range transmission channels broadcast messages may be single packet transmissions limited to a certain size e.g. 80 bits 10 bytes 20 bytes etc. . For example the payload of an embodiment broadcast message may be 80 total bits including 4 bits that indicate battery status information and 76 bits that indicate a rolling identifier. As another example an embodiment broadcast message may include 20 bits representing a nonce or counter and 60 bits representing a rolling identifier such as generated with a pseudo random function or encryption algorithm.

The term wireless identity transmitter is used herein to refer to a beacon device that is configured to periodically transmit broadcast via short range wireless transmitters messages that include an identifier of the transmitter in addition to the movement indicator. The unique device identifier i.e. a deviceID such as a factory ID may be a transmitted encoded number that can be correlated to the device through an algorithm or table lookup procedure by a receiver device or by a server receiving the identifier from a receiver device. In an embodiment the unique device identifier may be a code 56 bits in length. In various embodiments for security purposes this unique device identifier along with other data e.g. nonce or counter values may be encoded encrypted or otherwise obfuscated when included within broadcast messages as a rolling identifier. Wireless identity transmitters may be configured to maintain inaccurate time e.g. UTC information such as by using a 30 ppm 16 kHz crystal oscillator as a clock. In various figures and diagrams of this disclosure wireless identity transmitters may be referred to as WIT or WITs. 

The term proximity broadcast receiver is used herein to refer to any computing device that is configured to receive broadcast messages transmitted by wireless beacon devices such as wireless identity transmitters. In various embodiments proximity broadcast receivers may be mobile devices configured to operate as proximity broadcast receivers or mobile proximity broadcast receivers . For example a smartphone or a laptop computing device may be configured to receive broadcast messages and operate as a mobile proximity broadcast receiver. Reference to a particular type of computing device as being a proximity broadcast receiver is not intended to limit the scope of the claims unless a particular type of device is recited in the claims. Further unless otherwise indicated references to proximity broadcast receivers throughout this disclosure are not intended to limit any method or system to a particular type of proximity broadcast receiver device. Proximity broadcast receivers are described throughout the disclosure. In various figures and diagrams of this disclosure proximity broadcast receivers may be referred to as PBR or PBRs and mobile proximity broadcast receivers are referred to in the figures as MPBR or MPBRs. 

The terms identity transceiver and wireless identity transceiver are used herein to refer to devices that are configured to receive and transmit broadcast messages. In other words an identity transceiver may function as both a proximity broadcast receiver and an identity transmitter. For example a smartphone may be configured to broadcast short range signals that include its unique identifier as well as receive broadcast messages from nearby wireless identity transmitters. Throughout this disclosure various operations may be described as being distinctly performed by either a wireless identity transmitter or a proximity broadcast receiver however those skilled in the art should appreciate that a device configured to operate as an identity transceiver may be configured to perform any or all of the same operations and thus may be interchangeable with references to either a wireless identity transmitter or a proximity broadcast receiver.

The term sighting message is used herein to refer to reports signals and or messages sent by proximity broadcast receivers to a central server in response to receiving broadcast messages from wireless identity transmitters. Sighting messages may be transmissions that include part or all of the information encoded in received broadcast messages including any obscured or encrypted information such as identifiers of wireless identity transmitters. Additionally sighting messages may include metadata and other information or associated data such as the sending proximity broadcast receivers identification information e.g. device ID third party affiliations etc. whether the proximity broadcast receiver paired with a wireless identity transmitter transmissions context information e.g. a code indicating the sighting message is related to an alert or a registered service information regarding software or applications executing on proximity broadcast receivers e.g. app IDs location information proximity information with respect to known areas within a place and timestamp data. In an embodiment sighting messages may also include authentication information e.g. secret keys passes special codes digital certificates etc. that may be used by a central server to confirm the identification or identification information of proximity broadcast receivers transmitting the sighting messages. For example a sighting message may include a code from a hash function that can be decoded by the central server to ensure the sending proximity broadcast receiver is associated with a particular registered service. In various embodiments sighting messages may be sent immediately after receipt of broadcasts e.g. when related to an alert buffered or scheduled along with other scheduled transmissions.

In general a wireless identity transmitter may be a compact device configured to transmit a packet with at least a movement indicator and an identifier or identification code in a format that can be received by any in a network of proximity broadcast receivers e.g. cell phones mobile devices stationary receivers etc. within range of the short range wireless broadcast. The wireless identity transmitter relies on a short range wireless signaling e.g. short range radio signals such as Bluetooth Low Energy packets light signals sound signals etc. to transmit such broadcast messages and thus only proximity broadcast receivers within the reception range of the short range wireless signaling may receive such broadcast message. In other words only receiver devices that are in proximity to beacon devices wireless identity transmitters will receive their signals and thus reception of those signals communicates information about the location of the receiver device. Each proximity broadcast receiver receiving a broadcast message from a wireless identity transmitter may pass sighting messages including the encrypted wireless identity transmitter identifiers to a central server for processing. The central server may decode encrypted or obscured information including the identifier within received sighting messages.

As noted above a wireless identity transmitter may be configured to change the movement indicator value in response to detecting movement of the device via an accelerometer gyroscope and or other movement or inertia sensor. The movement indicator value may be changed in a random manner e.g. through the use of a random number generator and or random process using a random seed value such that the same value is never or very rarely used twice within the lifetime of the device.

In an embodiment the identifier of the wireless identity transmitter may be incorporated within the movement indicator value so that the broadcast messages include a single value that can be used by receiving computers to both indicate that the device has moved and uniquely identify the device. For example the device identifier may be a large prime number the movement indicator may be a large number that is randomly generated each time movement of the device is detected and the broadcast message may be the product of these two numbers. In this example a proximity receiver device will recognize that the wireless identity transmitter has moved because the broadcast value will have changed and a server receiving the broadcast value can determine the identity of the wireless identity transmitter by dividing the value by the prime numbers of registered transmitters.

In some embodiments a wireless identity transmitter may be configured to periodically change the manner in which the device identifier is encoded encrypted or change the identifier itself referred to herein as a rolling identifier in a manner that makes tracking the transmitter difficult while enabling the central server to decode decrypt or otherwise recognize the unique device identifier and other identifying information of the wireless identity transmitter. For example a wireless identity transmitter may be configured to periodically broadcast a Bluetooth packet including an encoded version of the wireless identity transmitter s device identifier i.e. deviceID . Such encryption of identifiers indicated in broadcast messages may be required to enable the central server to reliably identify the originator wireless identity transmitter of a broadcast message while forcing a third party e.g. passive attacker to determine the origin of the broadcast message by only guessing. For example if the identifier was static the third party could sniff the identifier such as by impersonating a proximity broadcast receiver and then use the identifier to track the wireless identity transmitter. Rolling identifiers may make such an attack impossible if the third party lacks the means of generating the encrypted identifiers.

Since a single packet broadcast message may not support a payload that can fit a cipher text of a conventional asymmetric key encryption standard private public key pair encryption may not be useable in the various embodiments. Additionally wireless identity transmitters may be generally broadcast only devices so there may be no back channel that is typically required in conventional encryption schemes. Therefore the central server in various embodiments may process encrypted message payloads by pre provisioning a shared secret key unique to each wireless identity transmitter. Such secret keys may be associated with each wireless identity transmitter s unique device identifier at the central server and may be used to decode data e.g. identifiers encoded by the each wireless identity transmitter. Various techniques for obfuscating encoding encrypting decoding decrypting and otherwise enabling secure identifiers suitable for use in the various embodiments of this disclosure are described in related U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 745 395 entitled Preserving Security By Synchronizing a Counter Between Systems filed Dec. 21 2012 and related U.S. Non Provisional patent application Ser. No. 13 773 336 the entire contents of all of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Additional precautions may be important to protect against security breaches such as hacker attacks against databases associated with a central server as well as to provide registered users e.g. merchants parents children etc. peace of mind and confidence their privacy may be fully protected. Such privacy safeguards may be provided to parties registered with embodiment systems by storing identifying information e.g. names addresses financial information medical information etc. separately from other information related to tracking devices and or proximity information of users. In particular to avoid unintended leaking of personal information of registered merchants customers children or individuals embodiment systems may utilize double blind architectures. For example such a double blind architecture may use a first unit e.g. a server database or other computing hub that stores and has access to information related to the proximity information or other location based data of registered users devices e.g. wireless identity transmitters proximity broadcast receivers identity transceivers mobile devices etc. . In other words the first unit may access information associated with sighting messages that indicate approximate locations proximities of various users devices. However the first unit may not store uniquely identifying personal information such as user names addresses and or social security numbers. Instead a second unit may store the identifying personal information without being configured to access any location proximity information as used by the first unit. The first and second units may use anonymous identifiers that connect data stored within the two units without indicating the protected information stored in either unit. In an embodiment the first and second units may be maintained by separate entities e.g. service providers and further at least one of such entities may be trusted by registered users who provide identifying information.

Any mobile device such as smartphones equipped with a short range radio such as a Bluetooth transceiver may be configured to perform as mobile proximity broadcast receivers and receive identification codes from wireless identity transmitters that may be nearby. Mobile devices are also often equipped with a clock that may provide a current time and a GPS receiver that may provide a current location whenever a wireless identity transmitter identifier is received. The mobile devices may communicate these identification codes times and locations via sighting messages to central servers through longer range network connections such as a cellular radio connection.

Because the broadcast signals should be short range in order to enable the security aspects of the various embodiments wireless identity transmitters can be relatively small inexpensive and simple devices including little more than a short range radio such as a Bluetooth LE transceiver and a battery. In various embodiments wireless identity transmitters may also include additional short range radios such as Peanut radios. In various embodiments the wireless identity transmitters may not include a user interface multiple radios global positioning system GPS receiver or other features common on mobile devices. Embodiment wireless identity transmitters may also consume very little power allowing them to be deployed without needing to be frequently recharged or replaced. These characteristics make them ideal for a wide variety of uses and implementation in a variety of physical configurations. For example wireless identity transmitters may be easily hidden or incorporated into many different objects such as desks closets bags etc.

Wireless identity transmitters may also serve to communicate information e.g. sensor data or prompt proximity broadcast receivers to take particular actions. In some embodiments wireless identity transmitters may transmit broadcast messages that indicate one or more behaviors to be performed by a proximity broadcast receiver such as a mobile phone in which case the broadcast message may also include a secondary segment corresponding to a command i.e. a command identifier or the type of the wireless identity transmitter i.e. a device type identifier or device type information . Proximity broadcast receivers receiving the broadcast message may take an action based on the identification or secondary code. Alternately the proximity broadcast receivers may transmit the received broadcast message to the central server which may return instructions or another code to the proximity broadcast receiver to indicate a behavior to be performed.

In further embodiments wireless identity transmitters and proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to exchange transmissions using various wireless technologies such as LTE D peer to peer LTE D WiFi and WiFi Direct. In an embodiment wireless identity transmitters may be configured to broadcast messages via a WiFi radio such that proximity broadcast receivers with WiFi transceivers may receive the broadcast messages. In such embodiments wireless identity transmitters may utilize WiFi transmissions to broadcast identification information similar to WiFi access point broadcast advertisements. For example a wireless identity transmitter including a WiFi radio may be configured to transmit broadcast messages via WiFi transmissions with low power so that the reception range is limited thereby providing a short range radio signal with a range similar to that of Bluetooth LE transmissions. In utilizing various wireless broadcast technologies and communication protocols with wireless identity transmitters proximity broadcast receivers with limited capabilities may still be capable of receiving and processing broadcast messages from wireless identity transmitters. For example a smartphone configured to operate as a mobile proximity broadcast receiver and including a WiFi transceiver but not a Bluetooth LE radio may receive and process broadcast messages from a wireless identity transmitter configured to broadcast short range signals with a WiFi radio. In an embodiment wireless identity transmitters may broadcast over multiple radios such as a Bluetooth LE transceiver and a low power WiFi transceiver in order to enable more models of proximity broadcast receivers e.g. more types of smartphones to receive the message broadcasts.

The various embodiment methods may determine that proximity broadcast receivers are within proximity to wireless identity transmitters based on the receipt of the short range wireless broadcast messages. Further embodiments may not require determining exact locations for wireless identity transmitters and or proximity broadcast receivers but instead may determine approximate and or relative locations of devices between each other.

In an alternative embodiment the roles of the beacon and the receiver device as described above may be reversed with stationary proximity broadcast receivers designed to be placed in particular locations and transmit movement indicators to a central server in sighting messages in response to receiving broadcast messages from mobile wireless identity transmitters or transceivers e.g. a user carrying a smartphone configured to operate as an identity transceiver etc. . In such an embodiment stationary proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to detect when they are moved based on one or more incorporated sensors such as an accelerometer. For example a stationary proximity broadcast receiver including an accelerometer that is positioned on a desk may detect when the proximity broadcast receiver is moved based on accelerometer data exceeding a predefined tolerance threshold. The central server may evaluate the movement indicators from the stationary proximity broadcast receivers to determine whether the data indicates movement has occurred and may then report to user devices e.g. the smartphone configured to operate as a wireless identity transceiver etc. when the stationary proximity broadcast receiver is moved.

In an embodiment the short range wireless signal may correspond to an established wireless communication link e.g. a secure link via Bluetooth etc. between the wireless identity transmitter and a nearby device such as a proximity broadcast receiver. Such a secure link may be established when the wireless identity transmitter is paired bonded or otherwise pre authenticated with another trusted device.

The short range wireless signal may be according to any of a variety of communication protocols such as Bluetooth Bluetooth LE Wi Fi infrared wireless induction wireless ultra wideband UWB wireless universal serial bus USB Zigbee Peanut or other short range wireless technologies or protocols which have or which can be modified e.g. by restricting transmit power to limit their effective communication range to relatively short range e.g. within about 100 meters . In some embodiments the wireless identity transmitter may use the low energy technology standardized in the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol or later versions . For example in some embodiment systems a wireless identity transmitter may periodically broadcast identification packets configured as an advertiser as described in the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol.

The Bluetooth protocol and Bluetooth devices e.g. Bluetooth LE devices have a relatively short effective communication range are widely used in deployed communication and computing devices have standard advertising or pairing procedures that meets the discovery and reporting needs of various embodiments and exhibit low power consumption which make the protocol ideal for many applications of the various embodiments. For this reason Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE protocols and devices are referred to in many of the examples herein for illustrative purposes. However the scope of the claims should not be limited to Bluetooth or Bluetooth LE devices and protocol unless specifically recited in the claims. For example Peanut transceivers may be included within wireless identity transmitters and may be used to transmit two way communications with proximity broadcast receivers also configured to utilize Peanut short range radio transmissions.

The communication system may also include a first proximity broadcast receiver e.g. a smartphone mobile computing device and a second proximity broadcast receiver e.g. a laptop computing device . The proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to automatically scan for and receive the short range wireless signals transmitted by the wireless identity transmitter . For example when within proximity or broadcast range of the wireless identity transmitter the first proximity broadcast receiver and or the second proximity broadcast receiver may utilize Bluetooth radios to receive broadcast messages periodically sent from the wireless identity transmitter . Alternatively when paired bonded or otherwise pre authenticated with the wireless identity transmitter the proximity broadcast receivers may receive information via a secure link established with the wireless identity transmitter .

In an embodiment the proximity broadcast receivers may be in communication with a local area network or LAN such as a WiFi network that may include an Internet access server not shown that provides a connection to the Internet . In particular the first proximity broadcast receiver may have a wireless connection to a router e.g. a WiFi router associated with the local area network and the second proximity broadcast receiver may have a wired or wireless connection to the router . In an embodiment the first proximity broadcast receiver may be configured to communicate with a cellular network via long range wireless links to one or more base stations that may be coupled to one or more network operations centers not shown . Such a cellular network may utilize various technologies such as 3G 4G and LTE and may further include network operations centers not shown that may manage voice calls and data traffic through the cellular network and that typically may include or may be connected to one or more servers not shown . The cellular network may provide a connection to the Internet . In another embodiment the second proximity broadcast receiver may also be configured to communicate with the cellular network via long range wireless links not shown .

The proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to inspect received broadcast messages to determine whether at least a portion of the message associated with a movement indicator has changed and to automatically take an action in response to the movement indicator matching or no longer matching a stored value. For example the proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to execute an abbreviated network authentication routine e.g. registering with the local area network in response to determining that a received movement indicator matches a previously received movement indicator that is stored in memory and to execute a normal or more involved network authentication routine in response to determining that the received movement indicator does not match a previously received movement indicator.

The proximity broadcast receivers may be configured to report contact with the wireless identity transmitter e.g. received broadcast messages to a central server connected to the Internet . For example the proximity broadcast receivers may transmit a sighting message to the central server that includes a rolling device identifier corresponding to the identity of a user of the wireless identity transmitter . Each time a proximity broadcast receiver receives an identifier from a wireless identity transmitter the identifier may be associated with the time of the connection as well as other information e.g. location information from the proximity broadcast receiver and this information may be transmitted to the central server within a sighting message. In some embodiments the information for a sighting message may be stored in the memory of the proximity broadcast receiver for later reporting such as in response to a query message broadcast or multicast by the central server . In an embodiment proximity broadcast receivers may also be configured to operate as wireless identity transceivers that are capable of receiving short range wireless signals i.e. broadcast messages from the wireless identity transmitter as well as transmitting short range wireless signals for receipt by other devices.

The central server may store the various information reported by sighting messages in a database which may be used for identifying the wireless identity transmitter . Further the central server may be configured to store registration data profiles movement indicators and other information associated with the wireless identity transmitter and or the proximity broadcast receivers . For example the central server may include one or more databases that store a last known valid movement indicator of the wireless identity transmitter . The central server may include a plurality of components blades or other modules to process sighting messages and data received from the proximity broadcast receivers . Further embodiments may provide a direct connection not shown between the central servers and any of the mobile device network components such as network operations centers to more directly connect the proximity broadcast receivers and the central servers .

The communication system may also include computing terminals such as personal computers at home or work through which users may communicate via the connection to the Internet and thus with the central server . Such terminals may allow users such as parents police fire medical attendants and other authorized authorities to register devices e.g. wireless identity transmitters access records on the central server and or to change stored data related to the wireless identity transmitter . In an embodiment users may use such terminals to register wireless identity transmitters and or proximity broadcast receivers e.g. smartphones configured to execute client software associated with the central server such as by accessing web portals and or user accounts associated with the central server . Similarly third parties such as merchants may use terminals to register wireless identity transmitters and or proximity broadcast receivers e.g. stationary receiver devices configured to execute client software and relay broadcast messages to the central server .

In various embodiments the message broadcast by the wireless identity transmitter i.e. the broadcast message may include an identifier segment such as a rolling identifier. In various embodiments the broadcast message may also include additional segments such as a type segment. The type segment may indicate the type of wireless identity transmitter . For example wireless identity transmitters may be marketed for various purposes such as child safety devices dog collars or security tags for stores. The wireless identity transmitter may have a different type segment based on the intended purpose e.g. one code for child safety devices a second code for dog collars etc. . Type segments may be static and set by manufacturers while the remaining portion of the identifier may be unique to each device and may roll as described below. The type segment may also be changed by a user such as when a wireless identity transmitter is reset for a different purpose or application.

In other embodiments a broadcast message may also include one or more static or dynamic segments with instructions or commands to be implemented by a proximity broadcast receiver. Such command segments may also be passed along to instruct a central server or other network device. Command segments may be set or static similar to type segments or may vary over time based on various conditions such as pairings or data from one or more proximity broadcast receivers. Such command settings may also be configured by a user of the wireless identity transmitter . Second or additional segments may also indicate the status of the wireless identity transmitter . For example a second segment may indicate the remaining power or estimated time left before the battery dies. Proximity broadcast receivers or a central server may interpret this status and respond accordingly.

Returning to in block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may enter a sleep mode. For example after broadcasting the broadcast message having the identifier the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to enter a power conservation state that may continue for a predetermined period of time. In various embodiments the wireless identity transmitter may sleep for a predetermined time never sleep or sleep for varying times determined based on various inputs. In block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may wake up from the sleep mode such as after the predetermined duration expires. In block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may generate a new device identifier from an algorithm such as a rolling identifier algorithm. For example the wireless identity transmitter may generate a rolling identifier using a pseudo random function or a streaming like encryption algorithm e.g. AES CTR . The wireless identity transmitter may then return to block to broadcast again such as by broadcasting a message including the newly generated identifier. In various embodiments the operations in blocks may be performed by an identity transceiver e.g. a smartphone configured to operate as both an identity transmitter and a proximity broadcast receiver .

The algorithm or rolling identifier algorithm used in block may generate a rolling identifier which is very difficult to predict or recognize by a device or system that does not know either an identity of the wireless identity transmitter e.g. a media access control address MAC or Bluetooth ID a decode key and or the algorithm used to generate the rolling identifier. As discussed below the central server configured with the algorithm or a decoding algorithm or a decode key and in possession of the wireless identity transmitter identities can use the rolling identifier to determine a corresponding account or device identity. While method shows the rolling identifier changing with every wake and broadcast cycle as one example in other embodiments the identifier may be changed less frequently such as once per minute once per hour etc. In such embodiments the operation of generating a new identifier in block may be performed only at the designated interval so at other times upon waking i.e. block the wireless identity transmitter may return to block to broadcast the identifier. Various algorithms for generating rolling identifiers or other encoded identifiers are discussed in the related applications incorporated by reference above. In an embodiment the rolling identifier and other information may be communicated within the payload of a Standard Bluetooth LE message packet format or packet type .

As described above in block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may boot up and may broadcast a message that includes an identifier in block such as a broadcast message as described above. In block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may enter a sleep mode and may wake up from the sleep mode in block such as after a predetermined duration expires.

In determination block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may determine whether a movement is detected based on sensor data. In particular the wireless identity transmitter may evaluate data generated by an accelerometer gyroscope or other sensor within the wireless identity transmitter to detect whether the wireless identity transmitter has experienced motion or similar activity. For example the wireless identity transmitter may analyze accelerometer sensor data collected over a period e.g. a number of seconds an operational cycle etc. to determine whether someone has picked up or otherwise moved the wireless identity transmitter . In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may compare sensor data to predefined values to determine whether sensor data indicating motion exceeds a minimum threshold. For example when accelerometer sensor data indicates a slight and or quick movement was experienced the wireless identity transmitter may determine that the movement does not exceed a minimum threshold and therefore may not determine that the wireless identity transmitter was moved. In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to only determine a movement occurred when sensor data indicates movement to have been experienced over a certain duration. For example the wireless identity transmitter may determine a movement occurred only when accelerometer sensor data indicates motion was consistently experienced at the wireless identity transmitter for a number of seconds minutes etc.

In an embodiment in response to determining movement is detected based on sensor data the wireless identity transmitter may set stored information such as a flag variable bit or other data to indicate movement has been experienced. Such stored information may be reset periodically such as at the end of each operational loop of the method or alternatively based on a detected event. For example once movement is detected the stored information may indicate movement has been experienced until the wireless identity transmitter has been rebooted or a user has provided a reset input e.g. tapped a reset button .

If movement is not detected based on sensor data i.e. determination block No the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may continue with the operations in block by broadcasting the same identifier such as by broadcasting the default device identifier that has not been adjusted or alternatively the last generated device identifier when no further movements are experienced after generating the last device identifier. In this way the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to broadcast the same device identifier while in the same location.

If movement is detected based on sensor data i.e. determination block Yes in block the processor of the wireless identity transmitter may generate a new device identifier from an algorithm that minimizes the chances that the same number will be broadcast by the same device twice in its lifetime. The wireless identity transmitter may then return to block to broadcast again such as by broadcasting a message including the newly generated device identifier. By repeating the operations in blocks through a new device identifier may be generated each time movement is detected. Thus in this embodiment the device identifier also serves as the movement indicator as the identifier changes in response to all significant movements i.e. movements exceeding the threshold .

In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may continue generating and broadcasting new device identifiers in response to a single detected movement e.g. a one time move of the wireless identity transmitter from office to office etc. . In other words once a movement is detected the wireless identity transmitter may always generate a new device identifier such as once every second for an indefinite period. In another embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to discontinue generating and broadcasting new device identifiers in response to receiving a signal from a nearby beacon device and or user inputs such as a user pressing a halt button on the wireless identity transmitter . As an illustration of these embodiments in response to a user e.g. the owner purposefully moving the wireless identity transmitter from a first office to a second office a wireless identity transmitter may begin generating and broadcasting new device identifiers indefinitely. However as the user intended to move the device he she may then press a halt button on the wireless identity transmitter that causes the wireless identity transmitter to stop changing the identifier and continue broadcasting the last generated device identifier until the next time the wireless identity transmitter is moved. The user s computing devices may then record in memory the stable last generated device identifier for subsequent comparisons to received device identifiers to recognize when the wireless identity transmitter moved again.

In another embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to only generate new device identifiers in response to not detecting movement based on the sensor data i.e. determination block No . In other words by default the wireless identity transmitter may perform the operations described above in and may only cease generating new device identifiers periodically in response to detecting movement. In this way a server or other device configured to look for a rolling or otherwise changing identifier from the wireless identity transmitter may determine movement occurred when a broadcast identifier no longer rolls or is not otherwise adjusted on a periodic basis.

As described above in block the wireless identity transmitter may boot up. In block the wireless identity transmitter may initialize a movement indicator such as a data that indicates whether the wireless identity transmitter has been moved. The wireless identity transmitter may initialize a register variable number representation or other data to a default or beginning value. For example the wireless identity transmitter may set a floating point number to an initial value e.g. zero . The initial value of the movement indicator may be predetermined by a manufacturer a central server or a user. For example during a registration process as described below a central server may provide the wireless identity transmitter with an initial movement indicator value. In an embodiment the initial movement indicator may be a random number. In an embodiment the initial movement indicator may be reported to and stored within a central server and or various user devices e.g. mobile devices configured to operate as proximity broadcast receivers etc. during an initial configuration or registration process when the wireless identity transmitter is first activated. For example a central server may store the initial movement indicator in a data structure in association with the identity of the wireless identity transmitter .

The movement indicator may data that is capable of representing a large number of unique values. In particular the movement indicator may be represented by a 64 bit or similarly large register or data structure stored within the memory of the wireless identity transmitter . In this way the wireless identity transmitter may be capable of adjusting the movement indicator as described below a large number of times without ever duplicating a value. For example with a 64 bit representation of the movement indicator the wireless identity transmitter may be capable of changing the movement indicator value once per second for an indefinite amount of time without the movement indicator every being set to the same value more than once.

In block the wireless identity transmitter may broadcast a message i.e. a broadcast message that includes a device identifier such as a rolling unique device identifier as described above and the movement indicator. For example the wireless identity transmitter may broadcast a Bluetooth packet that includes in a payload both an encrypted device identifier as well as the movement indicator. In various embodiments the broadcast message may be completely or partially encrypted encoded or otherwise obscured. For example the broadcast message may include an encrypted payload that includes the device identifier and the movement indicator. As another example the broadcast message may include an encrypted device identifier but unencrypted or otherwise in the clear data representing the movement indicator. Based on the structure and formatting of the broadcast message a device e.g. a proximity broadcast receiver a central server etc. configured to access the information of the message such as by applying a decryption algorithm with a secret key may be capable of identifying the device identifier and the movement indicator independently or alternatively may be required to process the broadcast message to identify either identifier. For example a proximity broadcast receiver may be configured to recognize an in the clear movement indicator but may be required to relay other data from the broadcast message to a central server for further processing e.g. decoding etc. to authenticate an obfuscated device identifier.

In block the wireless identity transmitter may enter a sleep mode and in block may wake up from the sleep mode such as after the predetermined duration expires. In determination block the wireless identity transmitter may determine whether movement is detected based on sensor data. If it is determined that movement was detected at the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless identity transmitter may adjust the movement indicator such as by incrementing decrementing a value. The wireless identity transmitter may utilize various schemes calculations equations seeds and or other predefined techniques for adjusting the movement indicator. For example the wireless identity transmitter may use a particular random number generating algorithm with a seed value that is known by a central server. As another example the wireless identity transmitter may simply add a value e.g. 1 to the current movement indicator e.g. the initial movement indicator .

If it is determined that movement was not detected at the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No or if the movement indicator has been adjusted with the operations in block the wireless identity transmitter may generate a new device identifier from an algorithm in block such as a rolling identifier algorithm. The wireless identity transmitter may then return to block to broadcast again such as by broadcasting a message including the newly generated identifier and a movement indicator that may or may not be adjusted since the last broadcast message was transmitted based on the operations in determination block .

In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may continue generating and broadcasting adjusted movement indicators in response to a single detected movement e.g. a one time move of the wireless identity transmitter from office to office etc. . In other words once a movement is detected the wireless identity transmitter may always adjust the movement indicator on a periodic basis such as once every second for an indefinite period. In another embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may be configured to discontinue adjusting the movement indicator in response to receiving user inputs such as a user pressing a halt button on the wireless identity transmitter .

As an illustration in response to a user e.g. the owner purposefully moving the wireless identity transmitter from a first office to a second office the wireless identity transmitter may begin adjusting the movement indicator to be different for each subsequent broadcast message that includes a periodically rolling device identifier. However when the user presses a halt button on the wireless identity transmitter the wireless identity transmitter may include the last adjusted movement indicator value in subsequent broadcast messages with the periodically rolling device identifier until the next time the wireless identity transmitter is moved.

As described above in block the wireless identity transmitter may boot up. In block the wireless identity transmitter may initialize a movement indicator. In optional block the wireless identity transmitter may broadcast a message i.e. a broadcast message that includes a device identifier such as a rolling unique identifier as described above and the movement indicator. In optional block the wireless identity transmitter may enter a sleep mode and in optional block may wake up from the sleep mode such as after the predetermined duration expires. In determination block the wireless identity transmitter may determine whether a movement is detected based on sensor data. If it is determined that movement was detected at the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless identity transmitter may adjust the movement indicator such as by incrementing decrementing a register value. If it is determined that movement was not detected at the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No or if the movement indicator has been adjusted with the operations in block the wireless identity transmitter may generate a new device identifier from an algorithm in optional block such as an algorithm for generating an obfuscated or otherwise rolling device identifier.

In determination block the wireless identity transmitter may determine whether a connectable device is detected such as a Bluetooth paired or bonded smartphone laptop or other user device. The wireless identity transmitter may detect such a connectable device by performing periodic scanning operations for nearby devices having compatible functionalities and pre authenticated identities such as Bluetooth radios configured to engage in paired or otherwise secure communication links. For example the wireless identity transmitter may perform operations for scanning for Bluetooth capable devices that are bonded or otherwise known to the wireless identity transmitter based on previously communications or user supplied data e.g. an address book etc. . In an embodiment connectable devices may be those nearby devices that are configured to be discoverable by nearby devices such as the wireless identity transmitter and already known e.g. paired to the wireless identity transmitter .

If it is determined that no connectable device is detected within proximity of the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No the wireless identity transmitter may then return to perform the operations in optional block to broadcast again such as by broadcasting a message including the newly generated device identifier e.g. rolling identifier and a movement indicator that may or may not be adjusted since the last broadcast message was transmitted based on the operations in determination block .

However if it is determined that at least one connectable device is detected within proximity of the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the wireless identity transmitter may establish a secure link with the detected connectable device. Such a link may enable two way communications between the wireless identity transmitter and the detected connectable device such as a secure Bluetooth link between paired devices. In block the wireless identity transmitter may transmit the movement indicator to the detected connectable device via the secure link and may complete the secure link in block . The wireless identity transmitter may then continue with the operations in optional block to broadcast another broadcast message.

The proximity broadcast receiver may include a core client module that may be software instructions routines applications operations or other circuitry utilized to process received broadcast messages from proximate wireless identity transmitters . The core client module may also handle communications between the proximity broadcast receiver and the central server such as transmitting sighting messages and receiving return messages from the central server . For example the core client module may operate as a background service that performs operations such as uploading or transmitting sighting messages without interaction from a user.

The core client module may include an API component that corresponds to application programming interface data code or other commands related to broadcast messages and or sighting messages. For example the API component may be utilized by a proximity broadcast receiver when listening for Bluetooth LE advertising packets received from the wireless identity transmitter . As another example the API component may be utilized to register the proximity broadcast receiver to receive notifications alerts or other communications corresponding to wireless identity transmitters .

The core client module may also include an authorization system component for processing received broadcast messages. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may support oAuth for authorization requests and xAuth for approved communication partners.

The core client module may also include a radio specific sightings receiver component e.g. a component for handling Bluetooth LE LTE D WiFi and other communications an operations administration and management or OA M module a wireless identity transmitter network manager component an event registration component that relates to stored look ahead identifiers and a sightings manager component . In an embodiment the event registration component may store numerous rolling identifiers downloaded from the central server and corresponding to a particular wireless identity transmitter such as a set of rolling device identifiers that may match possible rolling identifiers broadcast by the wireless identity transmitter during a certain time window.

Like many modern mobile devices the proximity broadcast receiver may be configured to execute third party applications or apps and thus may include a third party applications module that may execute manage and otherwise perform software instructions and routines related to applications provided by various third parties e.g. merchants . For example the third party applications module may receive various data from the core client module to be used by various third party applications. For illustration purposes a third party application related to a department store that is registered with the central server may be configured to receive notifications from the core client module when the user of the proximity broadcast receiver enters remains and or leaves the department store e.g. a geofence of the store . In an embodiment for optimization purposes applications or apps executing via the third party applications module may register or otherwise be configured to received notifications from the core client module when particular wireless identity transmitters are within proximity or alternatively leave proximity. For example applications may register in advance with the core client module to receive event notifications that indicate whether a particular wireless identity transmitter enters proximity stays within proximity e.g. standing nearby and not moving or leaves proximity.

The proximity broadcast receiver may also include an operating system and platform module for performing various operations and managing circuitry such as short range signal receiver circuitry. In particular the operating system and platform module may include a Bluetooth Low Energy module for processing communications utilizing Bluetooth LE protocols a cellular network module for processing communications corresponding to various cellular and similar long range wireless networks e.g. LTE D etc. .

The operating system and platform module may also include a time services component that may track time and generate timestamp data a location services component that may maintain low precision location data or alternatively more precise GPS or A GPS location data a storage component and a wireless wide area network wireless local area network component for enabling communications via WiFi or other wireless networks.

In an embodiment the core client module may request from the central server sets of wireless identity transmitter identifiers e.g. rolling identifiers of all transmitters on an interested list identifiers for all transmitters owned by a user etc. . Such sets may correspond to wireless identity transmitters that are currently in use and are expected to be in use for some period of time.

If the proximity broadcast receiver receives a broadcast message i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may generate a sighting message based on information from the received broadcast message and other associated data. In particular the sighting message may include an identifier specific to the wireless identity transmitter that transmitted the received broadcast message such as a rolling identifier i.e. an encoded device identifier MAC address or other unique code that may be used to identify the particular wireless identity transmitter.

Other associated data that may be included in a sighting message may include various information related to the receipt of the broadcast message such as the time the proximity broadcast receiver received the broadcast message location information the proximity broadcast receiver s identification information related services e.g. associated software or third parties and signal strength information. In other words the proximity broadcast receiver may associate data about present conditions e.g. a timestamp GPS coordinates Cell ID of the closest base station etc. with the broadcast message and or the wireless identity transmitter s identifier. This data may be stored in any of various types of data structures such as an array with one or more identifiers associated with timestamps and GPS coordinates from when the sighting corresponding to each identifier occurred. In an embodiment the sighting message may include authentication data such as a digital certificate or code that may be used by a central server to confirm the identity of the proximity broadcast receiver. For example within the metadata of the sighting message the proximity broadcast receiver may include a special hash code known only to the proximity broadcast receiver and the central server.

In block the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit the sighting message to a central server such as via a cellular e.g. an LTE 3G or 4G network or other network and the Internet as discussed above with reference to . Upon reporting a contact event by transmitting the sighting message the proximity broadcast receiver may promptly return to perform the operations in determination block and await further broadcasts from wireless identity transmitters. This enables the proximity broadcast receiver to continuously report contact events to the central server.

In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a broadcast message is received. If the proximity broadcast receiver does not receive a broadcast message i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in determination block . If the proximity broadcast receiver receives a broadcast message i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may generate a sighting message based on information from the received broadcast message and other associated data. In block the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit the sighting message to a central server such as via a cellular e.g. an LTE 3G or 4G network or other network and the Internet as discussed above with reference to .

In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may detect a connectable device such as Bluetooth paired or bonded wireless identity transmitters. The proximity broadcast receiver may detect such a connectable device by performing periodic scanning operations for nearby devices having compatible functionalities such as Bluetooth radios configured to engage in paired or otherwise secure communication links. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may perform operations for scanning for Bluetooth capable wireless identity transmitters that are pre authenticated bonded or otherwise known to the proximity broadcast receiver based on previously communications or user supplied data e.g. an address book etc. . In an embodiment connectable devices may be those nearby devices that are configured to be discoverable by nearby devices such as the proximity broadcast receiver and already known e.g. paired to the proximity broadcast receiver.

If it is determined that no connectable device is detected within proximity of the proximity broadcast receiver i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may then return to perform the operations in determination block to determine whether broadcast messages are received. However if it is determined that at least one connectable device is detected within proximity of the proximity broadcast receiver i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may establish a secure link with the detected connectable device. Such a link may enable two way communications between the proximity broadcast receiver and the detected connectable device such as a secure Bluetooth link between paired devices. In embodiments in which pairing takes place the pairing may be established automatically if the proximity broadcast receiver is set to pair with any wireless identity transmitter without using a key by using a key saved from a previous pairing with the wireless identity transmitter or by using a key received from a central server.

In block the proximity broadcast receiver may receive data such as a movement indicator from a wireless identity transmitter via the secure link and may complete the secure link in block . In alternate embodiments the wireless identity transmitter s rolling identifier may be received via the secure link. The proximity broadcast receiver may then continue with the operations in determination block to receive broadcast messages.

If an associated action is not found locally i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit a sighting message with the identifier and or second segment to a central server in block . In an embodiment the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit a message to another device such as a user device. The proximity broadcast receiver may receive an instruction message in block . This instruction may be sent by the central server or other device in response to the sighting message with the identifier and or second segment. In block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform an action based on the received instruction message such as access content by going to a web page or other online resource. In alternate embodiments the proximity broadcast receiver may skip the determination block and automatically proceed to either transmit a sighting message in block or attempt to perform an action stored locally.

As described above the central server may be configured to receive store and otherwise process data corresponding to wireless identity transmitters. For example the central server may be configured to exchange communications with various devices via the Internet such as proximity broadcast receivers e.g. mobile or stationary proximity broadcast receivers etc. third party systems and other support systems and or services .

The core component may also include an alert engine module for generating alert messages for transmissions to proximity broadcast receivers and initiating searches of various wireless identity transmitters. The core component may further include a data anonimizer module that may generate generic anonymous or otherwise processed data based on privacy policies or profile preferences of users. For example the data anonimizer module may strip personal information from return messages transmitted to a proximity broadcast receiver associated with a store so that a consumer user of a wireless identity transmitter is not identified to the store but the fact that the user is within the store is still reported to the store. The core component may also include a privacy manager module that may maintain privacy permission information for various users. For example the privacy manager module may include a database of privacy parameters provided by users at registration.

The core component may also include a search manager module for assisting in organizing and administering searches and an authorization system module .

The rolling identifier or ID resolver component may be configured to exchange data with the sightings resolver module of the core component .

In various embodiments the modules and components described with reference to such as the rolling ID resolver component may be performed or otherwise enabled by software instructions applications routines threads circuitry or hardware units.

In particular through registration a timing mechanism may be synchronized between each wireless identity transmitter and the central server i.e. a counter . With such a counter a wireless identity transmitter and the central server may encode or roll and decode identifiers respectively keeping the identity associated with the wireless identity transmitter and its users concealed and private. The most appropriate time to synchronize such a timing mechanism or counter may be during a device registration and or account creation process as described below. For the purpose of a mobile device such as a smartphone is described as being used by a user to perform account creation and registration operations e.g. the mobile device accesses a web portal to register with the central server etc. . However any computing device connected to the Internet and capable of exchanging communications with the central server via a registration web portal or website may be relevant.

In block a user s mobile device e.g. an iPhone Android tablet device etc. may install an application for use with wireless identity transmitters. Such an application or app may execute on the mobile device s processor as a background service or alternatively may be activated for selective use by the user. As described throughout this disclosure such an application may enable the mobile device to process short range broadcast messages from nearby wireless identity transmitters such as by identifying received signals as broadcast messages and relaying sighting messages having location information to the central server in response.

In block the mobile device may transmit a registration request with user information e.g. a device identity or deviceID . The registration request may be sent to the central server via Internet communications with a web portal web site or web server controlled or otherwise accessible by the central server. In other words the mobile device may invoke the registration process or by providing user information e.g. device ID through the installed app by providing the device ID deviceID and other information the central server may utilize to bind the registration request to an account. For example the user s mobile device may access a registration website receive inputs from the user and transmit the user input as data to the registration website for use by the central server as described above with reference to .

In an embodiment the user information may include personal information about the user such as name address contact information e.g. social network sites cell phone number email address telephone number etc. age and other demographic information as well as identifying information about wireless identity transmitters and or proximity broadcast receivers that may be associated with the user s account. For example the user information transmitted to the central server may include the serial number on a wireless identity transmitter and or a confirmation code produced by the mobile device in response to installing the application with the operations in block . The user information may also include preference information such as the user s preferred retails stores product lines and areas to eat or shop or work.

The user information may further include privacy permissions that indicate how personal information may be distributed or used by the central server. In an embodiment users may register as anonymous users such that the central server does not store any identifying information about the users. For example an account may be registered that is linked to a non descript post office box a disposable cellular telephone number or other contact information that does not directly identify the user or the holder of the account. This may be important for those who may choose to utilize services provided by the central server but who are concerned about leaked private or identifying information.

In block the user s mobile device may store account information such as authentication information e.g. codes messages from the central server or device ID associated with an owned wireless identity transmitter.

In block the central server may receive the user information for account registration. In block the central server may register an account for the user. For example the central server may store the user s information including provided device identifications in a database of all registered users. In block the central server may provide account creation information to the user. The account creation information may include an authentication code or other information the user s mobile device may store for future use. For example the central server may display confirmation of account creation on a website accessible by the user s mobile device or alternatively may transmit a confirmation signal text message email or other communication to the user s mobile device.

In block the wireless identity transmitter may boot up such as in response to the user inserting a battery. When the wireless identity transmitter boots a nonce or counter value may be initialized. For example the wireless identity transmitter may begin to increment a value that represents the passage of time starting from a zero value.

In block the wireless identity transmitter may broadcast a message i.e. a broadcast message that includes an encoded or rolling identifier. For example the wireless identity transmitter may begin transmitting broadcast messages every few seconds. The wireless identity transmitter may generate rolling identifiers with the embodiment methods described in the related applications incorporated herein. In an embodiment the broadcast message may include an initial or default movement indicator value. The broadcast message may include a payload that includes data generated by performing a pseudo random function. For example the wireless identity transmitter may perform a pseudo random function to generate encoded data based on input values of the wireless identity transmitter s device ID a nonce or counter value and a secret key seed or other value known only to the wireless identity transmitter and the central server. In an embodiment the pseudo random function may be a polynomial time computable function that may utilize a randomly selected seed value only known to the wireless identity transmitter and the central server such that the pseudo random function may be computationally indistinguishable from a random function defined on the same domain with output to the same range as the pseudo random function. In an embodiment the keyed hash Message Authentication Code HMAC or the cipher based Message authentication Code CMAC may be used as the pseudo random function.

In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may be required to be activated within a predefined number of seconds within the time the mobile device begins the registration process with the operations in block . In other words once the wireless identity transmitter begins incrementing its nonce or counter value the user must register with the central server within a certain period. This enables the central server to try at only a certain number of values when trying to determine the nonce or counter value at the wireless identity transmitter during registration.

In an embodiment the wireless identity transmitter may indicate an initial broadcast by adjusting data within a broadcast message s payload. For example the wireless identity transmitter may change a bit within a broadcast message that the central server may recognize as indicating an initialization time period for the wireless identity transmitter. If there are initialization indicators within payloads the central server may expedite comparisons between received payloads and stored payloads by avoiding comparisons to payloads corresponding to already registered or recognized wireless identity transmitters within a central server lookup data table.

In block the user s mobile device may receive the broadcast message. In other words based on the installed application or app the mobile device may function as a proximity broadcast receiver. An installed application may such as the app installed with the operations in block may be waiting to receive such a broadcast message in response to initiating registration operations with the central server via the registration request. In block the mobile device may transmit the wireless identity transmitter s rolling identifier and other information such as the stored device ID and authentication information. In an embodiment the mobile device may extract encoded information from the received broadcast message such as by using text comparison and or parsing operations. For example the mobile device may perform a most significant bit operation.

In block the central server may receive the message with the encoded information as well as the authentication information and the device ID. In block the central server may validate authentication information such as in the received message from the mobile device. In particular the central server may compare the authentication information to information generated in the operations in blocks .

In block the central server may generate a set of rolling identifiers using the device ID and possible nonce or counter values. The central server may compare the encoded identifiers of the set with the rolling identifier received from the mobile device. In an embodiment the central server may compute a set of encoded data by using a pseudo random function such as described above along with the device ID and a number of nonce or counter values. For example the central server may execute the pseudo random function with a seed shared with wireless identity transmitters the device ID indicated by the mobile device and many nonce or counter values starting with 0.

In block when the central server matches the received rolling identifier to one of the rolling identifiers in the generated set the central server may store relevant nonce or counter value and time in relation to the WIT. The central server may use the nonce or counter value used to generate the matching rolling identifier to sync with the nonce or counter running on the wireless identity transmitter. In an embodiment the central server may store an indicator that describes the wireless identity transmitter as having been successfully registered and or synced.

In optional block the central server may then transmit a registration result message to the user such as by transmitting a message to the mobile device. The registration result message may indicate whether or not the central server was able to match the received encoded identifier with a generated identifier. Further the registration result message may indicate an initial or default movement indicator value.

In optional block the mobile device may receive the registration result message. In an embodiment the registration result message indicates that the registration process failed e.g. the received broadcast message received by the mobile device did not correspond to the user s wireless identity transmitter the mobile device may re attempt the registration by receiving and relaying another broadcast message.

The operations described above particularly within blocks assume that message processing operations performed by the various devices as well as any propagation delay may be much smaller than the time required to increment or update the nonce or counter value at the wireless identity transmitter. This ensures that the nonce or counter values at the wireless identity transmitter and central server do not differ by more than 1.

If the central server receives a sighting message i.e. determination block Yes in block the central server may identify wireless identity transmitter information proximity broadcast receiver information and associated data based on the sighting message. The central server may evaluate parse and otherwise make accessible various data and information segments within the received sighting message. For example the central server may parse the sighting message to identify an included broadcast message from the wireless identity transmitter. As another example the central server may identity encoded data corresponding to a wireless identity transmitter identity i.e. rolling identifier proximity broadcast receiver identification information e.g. a receiver ID location information timestamp information sensor data e.g. accelerometer sensor data etc. identifiers of applications or apps associated with a proximity broadcast receiver e.g. a list of installed applications an identifier for a relevant app executing on the proximity broadcast receiver etc. . In an embodiment the central server may perform the operations of block with a sightings resolver module as described above.

In block the central server may obtain the wireless identity transmitter identity based on the rolling identifier within the sighting message. The central server may perform operations to decode descramble decrypt or otherwise make accessible the rolling identifier. For example the central server may perform operations to apply a secret key or decoding algorithm to obtain the identity of the wireless identity transmitter. In an embodiment the operations of block may be performed by the central server by way of a rolling ID resolver component as described above. For example the central server may cause a sightings resolver module to exchange data with the rolling ID resolver component to obtain a decoded wireless identity transmitter identifier.

In block the central server may obtain or retrieve the wireless identity transmitter user information based on the obtained wireless identity transmitter identity. For example the central server may retrieve user account information related to the wireless identity transmitter such as demographics information stored data indicating previous behaviors e.g. travel paths location history etc. and a last known movement indicator. In an embodiment the operations of block may be performed by the central server by way of an authorization system module as described above. For example the central server may cause the authorization system module to exchange wireless identity transmitter identity information with a user portal component to obtain user information as saved within user registration databases.

In block the central server may obtain or retrieve proximity broadcast receiver identification information such as proximity broadcast receiver user information and related services based on the identified proximity broadcast receiver information. For example the central server may retrieve the merchant identity associated with the proximity broadcast receiver that transmitted the received sighting message the services the proximity broadcast receiver is registered to participate in as well as any other relevant information to the proximity broadcast receiver. The central server may retrieve email addresses MAC addresses phone numbers and other contact information related to a user of related proximity broadcast receiver based on the information within the sighting message. For example the central server may determine the user contact information associated with a proximity broadcast receiver that may be used for subsequent transmissions from the central server such as emails or SMS text messages that indicate proximity to an item of interest. In an embodiment the central server may determine the identity of a user of a smartphone that is configured to perform operations of a proximity broadcast receiver.

In an embodiment the operations of block may be performed by the central server by way of an authorization system module as described above. For example the central server may cause the authorization system module to exchange proximity broadcast receiver information with a developer or user portal component to obtain information about related registered services e.g. merchants stores vendors services etc. as saved within developer registration databases.

In optional block the central server may authenticate the sighting message. Based on authentication information within the received sighting message the central server may perform authentication operations that confirm the legitimacy of the sighting message as coming from a known or otherwise valid proximity broadcast receiver. As described above sighting messages may include data such as secret codes certificates or hash data that can be used to confirm the identities of valid proximity broadcast receivers.

As third parties may attempt to spoof proximity broadcast receivers associated with registered services e.g. a nefarious spammer may attempt to imitate a merchant s store proximity broadcast receiver by sending a fraudulent sighting message the central server may check for authentication information that confirms the information within the sighting message is useful and related to a registered service e.g. a registered merchant a valid developer or other party that deploys legitimate proximity broadcast receivers . For example the central server may detect obscured header information within the sighting message that relates to a merchant established within the central server as a registered developer.

When the sighting message does not include authentication information expected by the central server such as a special code that all proximity broadcast receivers within a certain building possess or does include authentication information that does not match information stored in the central server the central server may disregard the sighting message and all included information. For example a sighting message with out of date or incomplete authentication information may be disregarded by the central server or alternatively stored in a list for potentially fraudulent proximity broadcast receivers.

In optional block the central server may generate hashed data based on the obtained and or retrieve data. In an embodiment the operations of optional block may be performed by the central server by way of a data anonimizer module as described above. In block the central server may store data based on the sighting message in relation to the wireless identity transmitter identity. For example the central server may store identified associated data from the sighting message in a database in relation to the wireless identity transmitter s decoded identity. In an embodiment the operations of block may be performed by the central server by way of a data layer module as described above.

As described above various messages such as return messages alerts or search activation messages may be transmitted by the central server to various recipients such as mobile devices associated with a user. For example the central server may transmit messages to a user s tablet smartphone wireless receiver computing device or other computing device. A recipient may also include an application or app executing on a mobile device. In an embodiment the central server may also transmit messages to other third party recipients or devices such registered services that may include EMT fire local police retail store merchant computing devices and ad servers.

Messages transmitted by the central server in response to receiving sighting messages may be transmitted to inform devices such as a mobile phone or mobile proximity broadcast receiver carried by a user of the location of proximity of known wireless identity transmitters. For example when a proximity broadcast receiver such as a stationary proximity broadcast receiver within an office relays a broadcast message from a wireless identity transmitter associated with a user the central server may respond by transmitting a message back to a mobile device of the user indicating the user is near the office s receiver computing device. Further a third party application running on the user s device may use information within the message. For example a retail store app running on a user s smartphone may receive a notice that the user has moved within proximity of a display area within proximity of a retail store building. In various other embodiments the third party applications may be utilized to track owned items associated with wireless identity transmitters. For example a particular third party application may perform a ring tone when the user is within proximity of a searched for item with an affixed wireless identity transmitter.

Returning to in optional determination block the central server may determine whether a third party application or app is allowed to have obtained proximity broadcast receiver information. In other words based on data stored in the central server that is associated with the user of the wireless identity transmitter the central server may detect any registered services or third party applications that are associated with the user s devices. For example the central server may evaluate database information to identify the user has installed a third party application on his her smartphone that corresponds to a retail store. The proximity broadcast receiver information may include proximity broadcast receiver identification e.g. an ID code or identifier and the user identity of the proximity broadcast receiver. In an embodiment the central server may identify whether third party applications are allowed such information based on the third party s developer rights such as indicated when the third party registered as a developer or registered service or alternatively based on the user s permission settings stored within the user s profile within the central server. In an embodiment the central server may use application identification information provided within the received sighting message to determine whether the third party applications on the user s device may receive proximity broadcast receiver information. For example the sighting message may contain indicators of applications e.g. app IDs that correspond to the sighting message and thus are allowed to receive any proximity broadcast receiver information from the central server.

If the third party app is not allowed to have the obtained proximity broadcast receiver information i.e. optional determination block No in optional block the central server may transmit a message to the user s device that includes only wireless identity transmitter identification information and associated data from the sighting message. For example the message transmitted by the central server may include the obtained wireless identity transmitter identity user information timestamp data and location information from the sighting message.

If the third party app is allowed to have the obtained proximity broadcast receiver information i.e. optional determination block Yes in optional block the central server may transmit a message to the user s device that includes wireless identity transmitter identification information proximity broadcast receiver information and associated data from the sighting message. For example the message transmitted by the central server to the user s smartphone may include indicators of the obtained proximity broadcast receiver identification e.g. serial code group affiliation merchant category etc. . The central server may then continue with the operations in determination block . In an embodiment the central server may utilize an alert engine module such as described above with reference to to transmit and or generate messages for transmission to various devices.

Generating rolling identifiers or other methods of obfuscating identifiers is important in that it may prevent sniffing attacks from a third party. For example if the identifier was static a third party could sniff the identifier such as by impersonating a proximity broadcast receiver and then use the identifier to track the wireless identity transmitter. A rolling identifier may hinder such an attack impossible if the third party lacks the pseudo random number generator or other means of generating the latest rolling identifiers.

In block the central server may receive a wireless identity transmitter s rolling identifier in a sighting message from a proximity broadcast receiver. In block the central server may compare the rolling identifier with code calculated by an algorithm shared with the wireless identity transmitter such as a pseudo random function or an encryption algorithm e.g. AES CTR etc. with shared secret keys. The algorithm may be software instructions routines algorithms circuitry or modules that are utilized by the central server to calculate codes that are expected to align with rolling identifiers generated and broadcast by the wireless identity transmitter over a period. In various embodiments the central server may compare the received identifier with the next several codes in case some identifiers were missed. If the received identifier matches any codes generated or expected by the central server in block the central server may associate the matching identifier and any associated data with a serial code corresponding to the wireless identity transmitter. This way if the central server later receives a user request with the wireless identity transmitter s serial code such as a request from a parent to locate the wireless identity transmitter carried by a child then the central server can find all the prior matches and any associated data without having to search for every previous rolling identifier.

In block the proximity broadcast receiver may process the received signal to obtain a movement indicator. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may parse decode decrypt and otherwise evaluate information or data within the received signal to identify a code value number or other information representing whether the nearby wireless identity transmitter has been moved as described above. In an embodiment the proximity broadcast receiver may obtain information such as the movement indicator from a central server in response to transmitting a sighting message based on the received signals. For example the central server may return a decoded movement indicator from obscured information within a sighting message or other payload transmitted by the proximity broadcast receiver when the proximity broadcast receiver is not configured to decode the obscured information locally.

In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether the obtained movement indicator matches stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter. Such stored data may be locally stored data such as a database on the proximity broadcast receiver that includes records or entries of the movement indicators of various wireless identity transmitters. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may compare the obtained movement indicator from the received signal to a database entry associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter to determine whether the obtained movement indicator matches the stored information which would indicate that the wireless identity transmitter has not been moved since the last time the movement indicator was received and stored in memory. Alternatively the stored data may be stored on a central server. For example in response to transmitting the movement indicator to a central server such as within a sighting message the proximity broadcast receiver may receive a message from the central server indicating whether the movement indicator is valid or validated for the nearby wireless identity transmitter.

If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator matches the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes then the nearby wireless identity transmitter that transmitted the received signal has not been moved and thus the received signal can be used to trigger pre associated operations. Accordingly in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform abbreviated authentication operations to access functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. Abbreviated authentication operations may include the automatic use of stored passwords log ins configurations scripts or other secure information. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may use stored credentials e.g. username password PIN etc. to automatically log in to a WiFi router network intranet website application etc. associated with a known location e.g. an office at work . The functionality that may be accessed with abbreviated authentication operations may include executing software routines apps etc. transmitting communications and or setting operating or configuration modes of the proximity broadcast receiver. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may automatically enable a security configuration mode to unlock a screen when it is determined to be within a home area. As another example the proximity broadcast receiver may automatically bypass a log in screen on a laptop when it is determined to be within a trusted location like a home or office. The proximity broadcast receiver may store data tables or other stored information to associate various functionalities with a known wireless identity transmitter and or its identifier. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may perform a look up on a database using the wireless identity transmitter s unique device identifier to determine that a workplace intranet auto login functionality is associated. Such stored information may be defined by a user such as via user inputs to add database entries and associations. In an embodiment the stored information may be downloaded to the proximity broadcast receiver from another device such as the central server. In another embodiment the functionality may be indicated within the received signal such as a code script number or other data broadcast by the wireless identity transmitter that indicates what abbreviated operations may be performed to access particular functionalities when it is determined the wireless identity transmitter has not been moved.

If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator does not match the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No then the nearby wireless identity transmitter that transmitted the received signal has been moved and thus the received signal cannot be used to trigger pre associated operations. Accordingly in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform normal authentication operations to access the functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may request a user to input a username and password in order to log into an intranet website and or application. As another example because the proximity broadcast receiver has determined it is not near a known wireless identity transmitter that has not been moved e.g. the proximity broadcast receiver is in the park as opposed to within an office etc. the proximity broadcast receiver may continue to operate in a normal security configuration mode that requires a finger print facial recognition input password or other user supplied information before opening a work related email client application.

In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may present a display to a user based on the performed authentication operations. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may render on an attached LCD display a message indicating that an automatic login to an intranet was performed due to the proximity broadcast receiver being located within an office. As another example the proximity broadcast receiver may render a message to the user indicating that a full security mode is in effect requiring credentials and other manual inputs in order to login to a network while the proximity broadcast receiver is not within the office. The proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in block for receiving subsequent signals.

Accordingly in optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may obtain a new movement indicator related to a known wireless identity transmitter e.g. via a user input . The new movement indicator may be input into a user interface on the proximity broadcast receiver such as by the user adding a new database entry associated with a certain wireless identity transmitter of a location e.g. an office etc. . For example during a set up or updating process the proximity broadcast receiver may receive new or updated values for movement indicators for one or more wireless identity transmitters within known locations e.g. home office etc. . Alternatively the proximity broadcast receiver may obtain the new movement indicator from a message received from another device such as a central server. For example based on new information received at the central server from a user via a web portal the proximity broadcast receiver may receive an updated movement indicator from the central server. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may store the obtained new movement indicator as stored data related to the known wireless identity transmitter. For example the proximity broadcast receiver may store the obtained new movement indicator in a database entry associated with the known wireless identity transmitter. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit to a server obtained new movement indicator as stored data related to the known wireless identity transmitter. For example when the new movement indicator is originally obtained locally such as via user inputs on a touchscreen coupled to the proximity broadcast receiver the new movement indicator may be transmitted to a cloud data storage device or server for record keeping purposes.

As described above in block the proximity broadcast receiver may receive a signal from a nearby beacon device such as a wireless identity transmitter as described above and may authenticate the nearby wireless identity transmitter based on identification information within the received signal in block . In block the proximity broadcast receiver may process the received signal to obtain a movement indicator and may determine whether the obtained movement indicator matches stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter in determination block . If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator matches the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform abbreviated authentication operations to access functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator does not match the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform normal authentication operations to access the functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may present a display to a user based on the performed authentication operations and may continue with the operations in optional block for obtaining new movement indicators.

As described above in optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may obtain a new movement indicator related to a known wireless identity transmitter e.g. via a user input and may store the obtained new movement indicator as stored data related to the known wireless identity transmitter in optional block . In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a broadcast message is received from a nearby wireless identity transmitter. If the proximity broadcast receiver does not receive a broadcast message i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in optional block for obtaining new movement indicators. However if the proximity broadcast receiver receives a broadcast message i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may generate a sighting message based on info from the received broadcast message e.g. rolling identifier and other associated data and may transmit the sighting message to a central server in block . For example the proximity broadcast receiver may transmit a sighting message to the central server that includes a rolling device identifier of the nearby wireless identity transmitter and a movement indicator or simply the rolling device identifier.

In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a message that authenticates the wireless identity transmitter related to the received broadcast message is received from the central server such as by monitoring an incoming message buffer. In other words the central server may transmit messages that verify or deny whether the wireless identity transmitter can be trusted by the proximity broadcast receiver. Messages from the central server may include codes language flags or other data that indicate whether the wireless identity transmitter related to the transmitted sighting message is authenticated. For example a message may include a bit that is set to indicate whether the central server could resolve the identity of a known wireless identity transmitter based on the information in the transmitted sighting message. Further the proximity broadcast receiver may compare unique codes or other information e.g. metadata header information etc. within incoming messages to determine whether the messages are related to the transmitted sighting message. If it is not determined that a message from the central server is received that authenticates the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in optional block for obtain new movement indicators.

However if it is determined that a message from the central server is received that authenticates the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may process the received broadcast message to obtain a movement indicator from the received signal such as by perform operations similar to those described above with reference to block . In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether the obtained movement indicator matches stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter. If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator matches the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform abbreviated authentication operations to access functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator does not match the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform normal authentication operations to access the functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may present a display to a user based on the performed authentication operations and may continue with the operations in optional block for obtaining new movement indicators.

As described above in determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a broadcast message is received from a nearby wireless identity transmitter. If the proximity broadcast receiver does not receive a broadcast message i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in determination block for determining whether new broadcast messages are received. However if the proximity broadcast receiver receives a broadcast message i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may generate a sighting message based on info from the received broadcast message e.g. rolling identifier and other associated data and may transmit the sighting message to a central server in block .

In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a message that authenticates the wireless identity transmitter related to the received broadcast message is received from the central server such as by monitoring an incoming message buffer. If the proximity broadcast receiver determines that a message from the central server is not received that authenticates the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No the proximity broadcast receiver may continue with the operations in determination block for determining whether new broadcast messages are received. However if it is determined that a message from the central server is received that authenticates the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a movement indicator associated with the wireless identity transmitter e.g. a movement indicator received via the received broadcast message was determined to be valid by the central server. In other words the proximity broadcast receiver may receive a code or other information from the central server such as in a return or response message from the central server that indicates stored data stored at the central server matches the movement indicator broadcast by the nearby wireless identity transmitter.

If it is determined that the movement indicator is validated by the central server based on the received message i.e. determination block Yes in optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may store the validated movement indicator for the nearby wireless identity transmitter such as by updating a local database and may perform abbreviated authentication operations to access functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter in block . If it is determined that the obtained movement indicator does not match the stored data related to the nearby wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform normal authentication operations to access the functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may present a display to a user based on the performed authentication operations and may continue with the operations in determination block for determining whether new broadcast messages are received.

In block the proximity broadcast receiver may receive a broadcast message from a nearby wireless identity transmitter. In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether the received broadcast message includes a previously authenticated identifier. The proximity broadcast receiver may compare data such as rolling device identifiers an encrypted code or other data extracted from the received broadcast message to stored data corresponding to known or authenticated wireless identity transmitters. For example proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a device identifier from the received broadcast message is within a stored data table of devices associated with locations of interest the proximity broadcast receiver s user. In various embodiments the previously authenticated identifiers may have been received from a central server in previous executions of the method or otherwise from user inputs such as user confirmations of identities via a user interface or application executing on the proximity broadcast receiver. The operations in determination block may be beneficial in avoiding unnecessary communications to the central server to authenticate already known beacon devices that are configured to only broadcast different identifiers when moved.

If it is determined the received broadcast message does not include a previously authenticated identifier i.e. determination block No in block the proximity broadcast receiver may generate a sighting message based on info from the received broadcast message e.g. rolling identifier and other associated data and may transmit the sighting message to a central server in block . In determination block the proximity broadcast receiver may determine whether a message that authenticates the wireless identity transmitter related to the received broadcast message is received from the central server. If it is determined that a message authenticating the wireless identity transmitter is received from the central server i.e. determination block Yes in block the proximity broadcast receiver may store the authenticated identifier for the nearby wireless identity transmitter such as by updating a locally stored database.

If it is determined the received broadcast message does include a previously authenticated identifier i.e. determination block Yes or the operations in block have been performed in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform abbreviated authentication operations to access functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. If it is determined that no message authenticating the wireless identity transmitter is received from the central server i.e. determination block No in block the proximity broadcast receiver may perform normal authentication operations to access the functionality associated with the nearby wireless identity transmitter. In optional block the proximity broadcast receiver may present a display to a user based on the performed authentication operations and may continue with the operations in block for receiving new broadcast messages.

In determination block the central server may determine whether a wireless identity transmitter is authenticated based on sighting message. In other words when an identity is successfully found based on the data within the sighting message i.e. a rolling identifier may be decoded to reveal a known device identifier of a registered wireless identity transmitter the central server may have authenticated that the wireless identity transmitter related to the sighting message is trustworthy for the proximity broadcast receiver. Therefore if it is determined that a wireless identity transmitter is not authenticated based on the received sighting message i.e. determination block No in optional block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that indicates the wireless identity transmitter that transmitted the related broadcast message is not authenticated. The operations in optional block may be optional as by default the proximity broadcast receiver may determine a wireless identity transmitter is not authenticated unless contrary information is received from the central server within a predefined period. However if it is determined that a wireless identity transmitter is authenticated based on the received sighting message i.e. determination block Yes in block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that indicates the wireless identity transmitter is authenticated.

In an embodiment a wireless identity transmitter may not be authenticated when the central server determines that a device identifier within the received sighting message has been rolled or otherwise changed from its default or last authenticated value. For example when a wireless identity transmitter is configured to roll its identifier in response to detecting motion activity based on accelerometer sensor data the central server may determine the wireless identity transmitter is not authenticated due to being moved.

In optional block the central server may receive a message with a new movement indicator related to a known wireless identity transmitter and may store the obtained new movement indicator as stored data related to the known wireless identity transmitter in optional block such as by updating a related database entry. Messages with new movement indicators may be received from proximity broadcast receivers such as in response to the operations of optional block described above. Alternatively new or updated movement indicators may be received via a web portal such as when a user accesses a web service related to the central server using a computer connected to the Internet.

As described above in block the central server may receive a sighting message from a proximity broadcast receiver such as a sighting message that includes a rolling device identifier of a wireless identity transmitter. In block the central server may identify a rolling identifier proximity broadcast receiver info and associated data e.g. timestamp info app ID and location information based on the received sighting message. In block the central server may obtain a wireless identity transmitter identity based on the rolling identifier within the received sighting message. In determination block the central server may determine whether a wireless identity transmitter is authenticated based on sighting message. If it is determined that a wireless identity transmitter is not authenticated based on the received sighting message i.e. determination block No in block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that indicates the wireless identity transmitter that transmitted the related broadcast message is not authenticated.

If it is determined that a wireless identity transmitter is authenticated based on the sighting message i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the central server may determine whether there is a movement indicator in the received sighting message as well as stored within related stored data. For example the central server may determine whether a representation e.g. a 64 bit movement indicator is within the sighting message and may also perform a look up on a database associated with registered wireless identity transmitters using the obtained identity and determine whether a default or updated movement indicator is stored for the wireless identity transmitter. In other words the central server may determine whether it has enough information available to validate a movement indicator and thus determine whether the wireless identity transmitter has moved. If it is determined that there are not both a movement indicator in the sighting message and related data stored in the central server i.e. determination block No in block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that only indicates the wireless identity transmitter is authenticated without validating whether there has been any movement of the wireless identity transmitter.

If it is determined that there are both a movement indicator in the sighting message and related data stored in the central server i.e. determination block Yes in determination block the central server may determine whether the movement indicator in the received sighting message matches the stored data related to the wireless identity transmitter such as the last stored movement indicator in a database entry associated with the obtained identity. If it is determined that the movement indicator in the received sighting message matches the stored data related to the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block Yes in block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that indicates the wireless identity transmitter is authenticated and that the movement indicator is valid. If it is determined that the movement indicator in the received sighting message does not match the stored data related to the wireless identity transmitter i.e. determination block No in block the central server may transmit a message to the proximity broadcast receiver that indicates the wireless identity transmitter is authenticated but that the movement indicator is not valid.

After determining the movement indicator matches an expected or initial value the central server may transmit a message to the smartphone e.g. via a cellular network connection confirming that the laptop computing device is still in the same position it was previously and so the smartphone may perform an abbreviate authentication operation to access a local access point e.g. WiFi router .

For example the central server may transmit a message over a wide area network that indicates whether the stationary proximity broadcast receiver has moved and thus whether it may be trusted to indicate a known location. In block the processor of the user s mobile device may receive the transmitted message from the central server. In other words the user s mobile device may receive a message that indicates whether the stationary proximity broadcast receiver that received the user s mobile device s broadcast signal has been moved. In response in block the processor of the user mobile device may perform either abbreviated authentication operations or normal authentication operations based on the received message. The authentication operations in block may be considered similar to those described above with reference to block and or block in .
