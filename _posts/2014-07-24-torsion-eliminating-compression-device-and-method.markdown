The following description relates generally to a method and device for eliminating torsion during the servicing of cable heads.

The assembling of connectors both on land and underwater is a necessary function during marine vessel operations. When handing cables for example it is imperative to avoid abrasion crushing twisting or kinking. It is known to use strap wrenches to assemble cable connectors. However this known method of assembly although effective also presents difficulties because the strap wrench method may sometimes be difficult to operate. If used improperly the strap wrenches apply opposing torsion forces on the connector moldings cause the connector pins to bend which damages the connector and allows the connector to leak. In cables for example kinks and bends cause increased voltage standing wave ratio and signal loss during system operation. It is desired to have a tool for assembling connectors without the undesired effect of producing torsion forces that damages connector moldings.

Step is the providing a tool for eliminating torsion and for holding the opposed cable heads during the secure attachment and detachment of the cables. As shown in the tool includes a handle arrangement having pivotally attached first and second substantially L shaped links and the handle arrangement operable by only one hand of a user. The tool also includes first and second clamping members wherein the first clamping member is fixedly attached to the first substantially L shaped link and the second clamping portion is fixedly attached to the second substantially L shaped link . As illustrated in and as outlined above each clamping member includes an opening and a gripping surface .

Step is the securing of the first and second connector moldings and to the first and second clamping members respectively by receiving the cable connector moldings through the opening and gripping the connector moldings with the respective gripping surfaces as shown in .

Step is the squeezing and holding together of the pivotally attached first and second substantially L shaped links and of the handle arrangement thereby moving the first and second clamping members together. As outlined above this squeezing and holding may be performed with only one hand of a user. This movement pulls the respective connector moldings and together from the orientation shown in to the position shown in . When the first and second connector moldings and are pulled together and the first and second substantially L shaped links and are held together as shown in compression forces are applied to the connector moldings and . As outlined above because of the structure of the tool the compression forces are substantially parallel to a common central axis X of the connector moldings.

Step is the rotating of the female thread arrangement of the second cable head in a first direction over the male thread arrangement of the first cable head connecting to properly attach the first and second cables. As stated above according to an embodiment of the invention the holding of the handle portion and the rotating of the female thread arrangement over the male thread arrangement maybe performed simultaneously by a single user. Additionally the user may use one hand to hold the handle arrangement and the other hand to rotate the cover . As stated above because of the resulting compression forces Cand Csubstantially parallel to a common longitudinal axes X the user is able to rotate the coupling ring over the receiving portion so that the thread is under no load. This ensures free rotation of the ring with no binding.

It should be noted that alternatively the tool may be used to detach already attached connectors. According to this embodiment the male and female connection moldings and would be held against the surface by the tool in the orientation as shown in . Holding forces Fand F as shown in are applied to the handle portion which creates the compression forces Cand Con the cable heads in a direction substantially parallel to the common axis X. This eliminates torsion forces so the thread is never under load thereby ensuring free rotation of the ring with no binding. This makes it easier for the user to disconnect the connector moldings and from each other. As outlined above a single user may use one hand to hold the handle arrangement and the other hand to rotate the coupling ring for disconnection.
