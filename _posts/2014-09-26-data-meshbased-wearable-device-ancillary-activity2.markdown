The headings provided herein are merely for convenience and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the terms used.

The description that follows includes systems methods techniques instruction sequences and computing machine program products that embody illustrative embodiments of the disclosure. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident however to those skilled in the art that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general well known instruction instances protocols structures and techniques are not necessarily shown in detail.

Modern users of technology typically have a variety of devices to perform various tasks such as laptop computers smart televisions smart phones wearable devices. Traditionally a user of such devices operates a single device to perform a task at one time. The discussion below describes systems and methods that in some embodiments utilize multiple devices to perform in real time an ancillary complementary or supplemental activity associated with a particular activity or task. In some embodiments the systems and methods distribute a portion a particular activity or task across multiple devices. The ancillary or supplemental activity associated with a particular device activity may be determined based on a variety of factors including an inferred user preference device functionality and the device activity. Thus the ancillary activity is dynamically determined and performed for the user in real time to assist the user with the device activity.

In various example embodiments a device activity being performed in real time by a user device of a user is detected. For example the user may be browsing a website on a mobile device or a laptop computer. Once the device activity is detected attribute data associated with the user from a plurality of attribute sources is accessed. In various example embodiments the attribute data is received or accessed from a broad range of attribute sources such as for example from mobile devices smart devices smart homes social network services user profiles browsing histories purchase histories and so forth.

A user preference indicating a preference or desire of the user for performing on a secondary user device an ancillary supplemental complementary or companion activity corresponding to the device activity. For example an analysis of the attribute data can indicate the user would like to view supplemental content corresponding to the device activity. In this example the ancillary activity comprises presenting the supplemental content to the user on the secondary user device.

Based on the inferred user preference the secondary user device can be identified according to a device status of the secondary user device according to some example embodiments. In various implementations the device status indicates a device capability to perform the ancillary activity in real time. For example if the ancillary activity comprises presenting content to the user the secondary user device may be incapable of performing such a task if the secondary user device is not within a vicinity of the user e.g. within a presentation distance of the user .

Once the secondary user device is identified the ancillary activity to be performed in real time on the secondary user device is generated by analyzing the device activity a device functionality of the secondary user device and the user preference. For example if the device activity comprises providing directions to the user the ancillary activity may comprise providing content associated with providing directions such as a current heading or distance to destination readout. In various implementations the ancillary activity is caused to be performed on the secondary user device or transmitted to the secondary user device with instruction to perform in real time the ancillary activity.

The attribute module can receive access or retrieve a wide variety of attribute data from many different attribute sources. For example the attribute module receives retrieves or accesses the attribute data from user devices or machines e.g. the client device social network services the third party server s the publication system s the payment system s other applications servers or other attribute sources. The attribute data as used herein is intended to include raw data such as sensor data profile data social network content and so on.

In some example embodiments the attribute module extracts the attribute data from various sources. For instance a payment history log of the user can include a tremendous amount of extraneous data. The attribute module can extract purchase information such as item purchased time purchase price seller location brand and so forth from the payment history log of the user.

In further example embodiments the attribute module performs various functions to prepare or condition the attribute data for analysis. For instance the attribute module standardizes the attribute data to facilitate analysis of the attribute data e.g. determine a normal form for the data to allow for comparison and other mathematical analysis . The attribute module performs many other functions to prepare the attribute data for analysis.

In various example embodiments the attribute module stores the attribute data in association with the user for subsequent analysis. For example the attribute module stores the attribute data in the database s . The attribute data can be stored in conjunction with a user identifier such that the attribute module subsequently uses the user identifier to access the attribute data corresponding to a particular user. The attribute module accesses the stored attribute data using other schemes. For instance the attribute module accesses a portion of the attribute data associated with a time an item a user a type of user a particular attribute source and so forth. In this way the attribute module accesses a portion of attribute data according to various parameters from among a large quantity of the attribute data to access identify or find pertinent and relevant data.

The characteristic module infers a user characteristic or multiple user characteristics corresponding to the user based on an analysis of at least a portion of the attribute data. Many schemes and techniques can be employed to infer the characteristic from the attribute data. For example a particular user characteristic can be a work location of the user. The attribute data can include a plurality of locations e.g. as determined by a GPS component of a user device used by the user that include time stamps. The work location of the user can be inferred based on the consistency and timing of the locations included in the attribute data e.g. during normal working hours the user is typically at a particular office building . Many different portions of attribute data and combinations of portions of attribute data can be analyzed to infer a wide variety of characteristics.

In various example embodiments characteristics e.g. the user characteristics as used herein are intended to include traits qualities actions activities attitudes habits behaviors and the like pertaining to a person or people. Inasmuch as the attribute data may not necessarily pertain to a person e.g. raw data such as coordinates of a particular location a characteristic e.g. current location of the user disliking spicy food having young children being a Star Trek fanatic can be distinct from the attribute data.

The management module provides management functions associated with the attribute data. For example the management module provides the user with functionality to edit modify update or otherwise control the attribute data. For instance the user removes undesired attribute data via the functionality provided by the management module . In a further instance the user specifies permissions for portions of the attribute data using the functionality provided by the management module . The permissions allow or prohibit certain access or uses for the attribute data e.g. the permission prohibits access to the attribute data by third parties . Various levels of access and abilities can be granted. In some example embodiments the permissions persist for a period of time and after expiration of the time period the permissions are revoked.

In further example embodiments the management module requests consent from the user to access portions of the attribute data or to request permission for certain uses of the attribute data. For example the management module requests consent from the user to allow third parties to access portions of the attribute data. The management module requests a variety of other consents associated with various actions corresponding to the attribute data.

In still further example embodiments the management module provides functionality to allow third parties to access the attribute data or user characteristics. For example the management module provides a set of APIs that can be invoked by third parties to access the attribute data or user characteristics. As discussed above in some example embodiments permission or consent of the user is determined prior to providing access to the attribute data.

Referring now to the activity module in the ancillary activity system provides functionality to generate the ancillary supplemental complementary or companion activity corresponding to the device activity. For example the user can be browsing a website and the activity module generates the ancillary activity comprising providing the user interactive content such as an option to share like post e.g. tweet and so forth the website. The activity module generates many other ancillary activities corresponding to the device activity based on various triggers and information.

The preference module provides functionality to infer a user preference from the attribute data indicating a preference of the user associated with performing on the secondary user device the ancillary activity corresponding to the device activity. For example the preference module infers that the user desires or prefers a particular type of content associated with a particular device activity. The preference module also identifies other users that are similar to the user and infer the user preference based on the identified similar users. The preference module employs a variety of schemes and techniques using a wide range of data to infer the user preference.

The device module provides functionality to identify the secondary user device according to a device status of the secondary user device. In various implementations the device status indicates a device capability to perform the ancillary activity in real time. The device module retrieves derives determines or otherwise obtains a variety of information associated with the user device and the secondary user device to facilitate the functionality herein. For example the device module determines available functionality of the secondary user device.

The user may be operating or using the user device . The terms operating using in service or in use as used herein are intended to include a particular user physically interacting with a particular device being capable of operating the particular device within a short time period such as dormant device or a device in standby e.g. a particular user carrying a mobile device on their person without present physically interaction is included in the terms operating using or in use or otherwise utilizing the particular device e.g. a smart refrigerator that is not within a vicinity of the user configured to track inventory levels and provide inventory data .

In the example diagram the user is carrying the user device that is communicatively coupled to the ancillary activity system . The activity module detects the device activity of the user device . For instance the user can be browsing a webpage receiving directions to a particular location monitoring fitness activity such as a number of steps taken and so forth using the user device .

Once the activity module detects the device activity the preference module infers the user preference from the attribute data accessed by the attribute module . The user preference indicates a preference of the user or desire of the user for performing on a particular user device a particular ancillary activity corresponding to the device activity. For example the preference module infers that the user would like an option presented on a particular wearable device to favorite share post e.g. tweet associated with a webpage the user is browsing on the device .

Based on the inferred user preference the device module identifies the secondary user device according to the device status of the secondary user device. The device status indicates that the device is capable of performing the ancillary activity. For example the device module identifies the wearable device as the secondary user device based on the device status corresponding to the wearable device . In this example the device module determines the device status of the wearable device as being in use by the user e.g. the user wearing the wearable device . Thus the wearable device is operable to perform the ancillary activity since providing the option for the user to select can be effectuated by the wearable device as the user is within an operating distance of the wearable device .

After the device module identifies the secondary user device the activity module generates the ancillary activity to be performed in real time on the secondary user device. The activity module generates the ancillary activity by analyzing the device activity a device functionality of the secondary user device the user preference and other data. The device functionality indicates options available for input and output on the secondary user device. For example the identified secondary user device is the wearable device that has a small screen area to display user interfaces or has reduced options for output e.g. no speakers . In a specific instance the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include abridged activity content according to the device functionality e.g. small display size . After the activity module generates the ancillary activity the activity module transmits or otherwise communicates to the secondary user device to perform the ancillary activity in real time.

In various embodiments the device activity includes a wide variety of activities such as browsing a webpage monitoring fitness activity e.g. steps the user has taken heart rate monitoring inventory level monitoring e.g. a smart refrigerator that monitors inventory and so on. In some implementations the activity module detects the device activity being performed by monitoring devices of the user. For instance a smart appliance of the user provides a continuous or periodic stream of data indicating various device activities.

At operation the attribute module accesses the attribute data associated with the user from the plurality of attribute sources. In various example embodiments at least a portion of the attribute data includes real time data or near real time data. For example the real time data includes user input data or sensor data communicated to the attribute module after a delay interval e.g. due to transmission delay or other delays such as being temporarily stored at an intermediate device between capturing the data and the attribute module receiving the data.

As will be discussed in connection with the attribute data is received from a broad spectrum of attribute sources e.g. devices sensors servers databases and other sources . Additionally the attribute module receives or accesses the attribute data via many pathways resulting from an assortment of configurations of the attribute sources as further discussed in connection with . In an example embodiment the attribute module receives the attribute data directly from the attribute sources. In other example embodiments the attribute module receives the attribute data from a central device that receives attribute data from a plurality of user devices. In still other example embodiments various user devices are communicatively coupled in a decentralized device to device mesh and the attribute module receives the attribute data corresponding to a particular device in the mesh from any of the devices in the mesh. The attribute module receives the attribute data from the attribute sources in many other configurations including various suitable combinations of configurations.

In various example embodiments the attribute module stores the attribute data in association with the user e.g. indexed based on a user identifier for subsequent analysis. The attribute module stores the attribute data in a storage device such as the database s for example. The attribute module accesses the stored attribute data using a variety of search or find schemes. For instance the attribute data associated with a particular user is accessed using a user identifier that corresponds to the particular user. It will be noted that the collective aggregated attribute data is sometimes referred to as a data mesh. 

At operation the preference module infers the user preference or desired user setting from the attribute data indicating a preference of the user for performing on the secondary user device the ancillary activity corresponding to the device activity. For example the attribute data includes engagement data of the user e.g. particular websites the user visits taps clicks or other interactions with various notification indicative of the types of information the user is interested in. In a specific example the preference module infers the user preference for receiving notifications associated with a particular sporting event based on the engagement data.

In this specific example the activity module detects from the user device e.g. a smart television that the device activity includes watching a sporting event. In continuing with this example the preference module infers the user preference to indicate the user has an affinity for notification associated with watching a sporting event on a particular secondary device based on past notifications the user showed interest in that are included in the attribute data.

Referring now to a flow diagram is shown illustrating further operations for inferring a user preference from the attribute data according to some example embodiments. As discussed above subsequent to the operation at the operation the preference module infers the user preference from the attribute data.

At operation the characteristic module infers or directly measures user characteristics pertaining to the user from the attribute data. In some example embodiments the characteristic module stores the inferred user characteristics for subsequent analysis for example in a storage device such as database s . The characteristic module infers a vast spectrum of the user characteristics from the attribute data. A few specific examples of user characteristics include demographic data e.g. age gender marital status number of children user preferences e.g. being a morning person favorite locations enjoying spicy food idiosyncrasy e.g. being forgetful such as draining the battery on a mobile device or being impatient such as a line breaker that will leave a store if the line is too long qualities e.g. being athletic being tall having a large vocabulary personality traits e.g. being a risk taker actions activities e.g. working for a non profit attitudes habits e.g. being a coffee drinker behaviors beliefs biases demeanor and physical characteristics of the user e.g. height weight garment sizes eye color hair color . The specificity of the characteristics ranges from very narrow e.g. drinks a particular brand of soda to very broad e.g. being generally philanthropic . To illustrate inferring the user characteristic from the attribute data in an example the attribute data includes user location data that indicates frequent visits to a local school local soccer fields and the like. In this example the characteristic module infers that the user has children based on the types of locations the user may be frequently visiting.

In some instances the characteristic module performs varying degrees of inferential analysis of the attribute data to derive the user characteristics. For example the characteristic module infers the user s wake up time based on user device activity or other activity e.g. connected alarm clock settings logins to accounts and various other user activities that indicate a wake up time . In this example the characteristic module infers a particular user characteristic that can be of a larger inferential jump such as the user being a morning person or a person that likes to sleep in. The degree of inferential jump can be configurable. In some example embodiments the characteristic module employs various techniques to minimize or otherwise control incorrect inferences e.g. machine learning other learning algorithms .

In further example embodiments the characteristic module learns adapts or evolves as more of the attribute data is received e.g. via machine learning techniques or other learning algorithms . For example the attribute data includes location data of the user. The characteristic module infers a favorite location of the user based on a pattern e.g. frequently visited locations in the location data. However the characteristic module subsequently receives employment data of the user that indicates a current employer including an employer location. The characteristic module learns updates or otherwise adapts to account for the new attribute data. Thus in this example the characteristic module may not infer a favorite location of the user if the location is a work location of the user. In some instance the user may provide input directly e.g. via a user interface configured to receive inferential guidance from the user to facilitate the characteristic module in inferring characteristics from the attribute data e.g. user input indicating that a particular inferred characteristic is incorrect or providing input to be used as a basis for future inferences .

In other instances the characteristic module performs very little or no analysis to derive the user characteristic from the attribute data. For example the attribute data includes an alarm time setting from a connected alarm clock e.g. a smart phone with an alarm clock app . The alarm time setting can directly indicate a wake up time. Since the attribute data directly relates to a particular user characteristic the characteristic module need not perform analysis to derive the user characteristic.

In some example embodiments the user characteristic comprises predefined characteristics or dynamically determined characteristics. For instance a particular set of characteristics is predefined e.g. work location home location marital status socio economic level . In this instance the characteristic module determines that particular predefined characteristics are associated with the user based on an analysis of the attribute data. In other instances the characteristic module dynamically determines characteristics based on the attribute data. For example the attribute data indicates that the user owns a particular exotic pet. Although there may not be a predefined characteristic associated with the particular exotic pet the characteristic module determines the user characteristic of owning an exotic pet from the attribute data.

At operation the preference module identifies similar users that are similar to the user based on the inferred user characteristics and respective user characteristics of a plurality of other users. The preference module identifies similar users that are similar to the user based on a variety of factors. In some example embodiments the preference module accesses the attribute data or stored user characteristics corresponding to the plurality of other users. For example the preference module identities the similar users from among the plurality of other users that are similar to the user based on the inferred user characteristics of the user and respective user characteristics of the plurality of other users. The preference module correlates matches or otherwise compares the inferred user characteristics with respective user characteristics of the plurality of other users to identify the similar users. In various example embodiments the preference module identifies the similar users based on same or similar demographic data e.g. same or similar age marital status gender geographic location etc. same or similar user characteristics e.g. same or similar brand purchases same or similar attribute data and so on.

At operation the preference module infers the user preference or desired user setting based on the identified similar users. For example the preference module analyzes the user characteristics of the identified similar users to determine the user preference. In a specific example if the user characteristics of the identified similar users indicate a preference for viewing particular content on a particular secondary user device the preference module infers that the user also has the same or a similar preference tier viewing the particular content on the particular secondary user device. In this way the preference module infers the user preference based on the identified similar users.

Referring back to at operation the device module identifies the secondary user device according to the device status of the secondary user device. The device status indicates a device capability to perform the ancillary activity in real time. The device capability includes various metrics and features associated with the secondary user device. In various implementations the device module identifies the secondary user device based on the device status that includes various combinations of factors discussed below. For example the device status can be based on the device capability including a distance of the secondary user device to the user as further discussed in connection with below. For instance the secondary user device is capable of presenting information or notification to the user if the secondary user device is within a vicinity of the user.

In another example the device status is based on a particular functionality of the device. The device module queries the secondary user device to determine the functionality of the secondary user device. In other instance the device module determines the functionality of the secondary user device via a lookup of functionality for the same or similar device as the secondary user device. For instance if the secondary user device is a particular type of wearable device the device module can lookup available functions for the particular type of wearable device from the third party servers s . For instance if the secondary user device has an audio output then the device module identifies the secondary user device as capable of performing a particular ancillary activity that includes audio output e.g. voice directions for hands free navigation . Thus in some cases the device module deter nines the device status in conjunction with a particular ancillary activity.

In still another example the device status is based on whether the secondary user device is active as further discussed in connection with below. For example if the secondary user device is not currently being used e.g. as determined via a sensor on the device such as an accelerometer that indicates the device is perfectly still then the device module determines that the device is not active and does not identify the inactive secondary user device as being capable of performing the ancillary activity.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates further operations for identifying a secondary user device according to some example embodiments. Specifically is directed to the device module identifying the secondary user device by determining that the device status of the secondary user device includes the secondary user being within a distance of the user. Subsequent to the operation the device module receives sensor data from the secondary user device at operation . The sensor data includes for example data received from any of the sensors discussed in connection with below. In a specific example the sensor data includes location data as determined by a GPS component of the secondary user device. The sensor data represents a real time physical environment of the secondary user device. As discussed below the device module determines the device status of the secondary user device based on the sensor data received from the secondary user device.

At operation the characteristic module or the device module infers the current user location based on location data received from the user device. For example the attribute data includes real time data from the user device corresponding to the location of the user e.g. location data as determined by a GPS component of a mobile device corresponding to the user .

At operation the device module extracts a current device location from the sensor data received from the secondary user device. For instance the secondary user device can be equipped with a GPS component that provides location data. In other instances the device module extracts the current device location based on Wi Fi triangulation NFC beacon detection or other location services.

At operation the device module compares the current user location and the current device location to determine that the secondary user device is within a distance e.g. an operating distance of the current user location. The distance may be a short distance such as a reasonable distance to allow the user to physically operate the secondary user device e.g. an arm s length .

Although is directed to determining that the secondary user device is within a distance of the user location based on an inferred location of the user and the secondary user device the device module employs other schemes to determine whether the user is within an operating distance of the secondary user device. For instance if the secondary user device is equipped with biometric identification sensors and the device module receives biometric sensor data from the secondary user device indicating the identity of the user the device module can in that situation infer that the user is within an operating distance of the secondary user device.

Referring now to a flow diagram illustrates further operations for identifying the secondary user device according to some example embodiments. Subsequent to the operation the device module receives sensor data from the secondary user device at operation similar to the operation described above. The sensor data represents a real time physical environment of the secondary user device. For instance the sensor data includes thermal data e.g. data that indicates a current temperature motion data e.g. as determined by an accelerometer component position data e.g. as determined by a GPS component biometric data e.g. heart rate data or fingerprint identifications communication data e.g. NFC beacon detections or Bluetooth device detections and other sensor data see below for additional sensors and data .

At operation the device module calculates an active metric from the sensor data. In various implementations the active metric indicates the secondary user device is in use by the user. In some implementations the active metric comprises a probability or likelihood that the secondary user device is active. In these implementations a higher value for the active metric is associated with a higher probability that the secondary user device is active. In a specific instance if the secondary user device is a wearable device such as a smart watch the sensor data indicates that a particular user is wearing the wearable device based on a heart rate sensor when the user is not wearing the wearable device the heart rate sensor indicates no heart rate .

Similarly if the secondary user device is a smart phone that provides ambient temperature data the device module calculates the active metric based on the temperature data. For example if the temperature data is fluctuating or is above an expected ambient temperature this indicates that the user is carrying the smart phone in their pocket. Conversely if the temperature is near expected ambient temperature and there is little fluctuation in the temperature the device module calculates a low probability corresponding to a lower active metric indicating that the particular device is not active or in use by the user.

At operation the device module determines that the secondary user device is active based on the active metric. For example if the calculated active metric exceeds a threshold value the device module deter nines that the secondary user device is active. The threshold value can be predetermined or dynamically determined by the device module . For example the device module employs various statistical models based on historical values of the active metric to determine whether the current active metric is anomalous. In a simple non limiting example the device module determines the threshold value to be an average of historical values for the active metric and the device module determines that the secondary user device is active if the active metric exceeds the average of the historical values of the active metric. The device module employs many other schemes and techniques to determine that the device is active based on the active metric.

At operation the device module identifies the secondary user device as being capable of performing the ancillary activity in real time based on the secondary user device being active. That is to say the device module identifies a particular secondary user device based on the particular secondary user device being active. The reasoning being that if the secondary user device is inactive the secondary user device is not capable of presenting information to or receiving input from the user and therefore is not capable of performing the ancillary activity in some cases.

Referring again to at operation the activity module generates the ancillary activity to be performed in real time on the secondary user device by analyzing the device activity a device functionality of the secondary user device the user preference and other factors and data. The ancillary activity can include a wide range of tasks content and functionality. For example the ancillary activity comprises a notification that includes notification content associated with the device activity. For instance if the device activity is viewing a sporting event on a smart TV the ancillary activity comprises a notification including notification content associated with the sporting event e.g. information about the players the current score sporting statistics .

In some implementations the ancillary activity includes a portion of the device activity. For example if the device activity comprises browsing a particular website the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include content that is a portion of the website. Thus in these implementations the activity module is distributing a portion of the device activity to the secondary user device.

At operation the device module determines a display size corresponding to the secondary user device. For example the device module queries the secondary user device directly to retrieve data associated with the display size. In another example the device module queries a particular third party server e.g. the third party server s using an identifier associated with the secondary user device to determine the display size of the secondary user device. In a specific example the device module determines a particular device model for the secondary user device and performs a lookup of the display size for the particular device model.

At operation the device module determines the display size corresponding to the secondary user device is below a threshold size. For example the display size may be too small for particular content of the ancillary activity. In this situation the device module determines that the display size is below the threshold size.

At operation the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include abridged activity context according to the display size corresponding to the secondary user device. For instance the device module shortens or reduces content or functionality of the ancillary activity to accommodate the display size of the secondary user device.

At operation the device module compares the device functionality of the secondary user device with a device functionality of the user device to identify non mutual functionality of the secondary user device that is not available on the user device. For example the user device comprises a mobile computer that the user is browsing a website on. The secondary user device can be a wearable device affixed to the user. In this example the device module identifies haptic output for instance of the secondary user device as being non mutual functionality as the mobile computer may not have haptic output functionality. In another example a particular wearable device may not include a GPS component while a smart phone device of the user may include a GPS component to determine current location. In this example the device module identifies use of the GPS component as non mutual functionality.

At operation the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include an activity component that utilizes the non mutual functionality of the secondary user device. In the examples discussed above if the device module determines that the secondary user device includes a GPS component while the user device does not include a GPS component the activity module utilizes location data from the secondary user device in generating the ancillary activity. In a specific example if the user is browsing a particular webpage associated with a particular merchant or location the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include mapping directions to the particular location using the GPS component of the secondary user device to access the user s current location. Thus the activity module receives the particular location from the user device and communicates to the secondary user device the location and instructions to map directions to that location from the current location.

Turning again to at operation the activity module transmits or otherwise communicates to the secondary user device instructions to perform in real time the complementary activity. For example the activity module communicates instructions to the secondary user device to present a user interface that facilitates or effectuates the ancillary activity e.g. a user interface including functionality to carry out the ancillary activity . In a specific example if the ancillary activity comprises a notification including notification content the activity module transmits the notification including the notification content to the secondary user device to be presented to the user. Thus in this example the activity module caused presentation of the notification on the secondary user device.

Although the operations are directed to performing a single ancillary activity on a single secondary user device other embodiments include identifying multiple secondary devices and generating multiple ancillary activities to be performed in real time on one or more of the identified secondary user devices. For example if the user is carrying a smart watch and wearing smart glasses the generated ancillary activities can be distributed among the identified ancillary activities. For instance haptic based notifications can be directed to the user s smart watch while visual notification is directed to the user s smart glasses. this instance the activity module distributes the multiple ancillary activities among the multiple secondary user devices based on respective device functionalities of the multiple secondary user devices. The activity module employs other factors to distribute the multiple ancillary activities such as the user preference.

To help illustrate the concepts described above illustrates examples of generating the ancillary activity for the secondary user device according to some example embodiment. includes a scene that depicts a living room attached to an open kitchen. The scene includes a smart television TV a media entertainment device a lamp a mobile computer a wearable device a user a mobile device a smart refrigerator and a kitchen display . Each of the devices of can be attribute sources coupled to a network e.g. the network and operable to communicate with the data mesh system . In various example embodiments the user may be carrying or wearing a smart device such as the wearable device e.g. a mobile device a wearable device a NFC enable smart ring on their person that provides real time data corresponding to the user . For instance the user may be carrying a mobile device that provides real time location data e.g. as determined by a GPS component beacon location detect or other location services .

In an example embodiment the user may be browsing a webpage using the mobile computer . The mobile computer can be coupled to the network and the activity module detects the device activity of browsing a particular webpage. The preference module infers a user preference associated with the device activity of browsing a particular webpage. For instance the activity module infers that the user has a preference for viewing supplemental content associated with the particular webpage the user is browsing or supplemental functionality associated with the particular webpage e.g. liking favoriting or sharing the particular webpage .

Based on the inferred user preference the device module identifies the secondary user device such as the wearable device that is capable of performing the ancillary activity. The device module identifies the wearable device based on the wearable device being within an operating distance of the user the reasoning being that if the wearable device is within a short distance of the user then the wearable device is capable of providing information or receiving input from the user . For example the device module determines the user is wearing the wearable device based on various sensor data received from the wearable device e.g. biometric data that indicates a particular user is wearing the device accelerometer data that indicates the device is in use. Bluetooth device detections that indicates the wearable device is within short range communication range of another user device that the device module has inferred the user is using .

Once the device module identifies the wearable device the activity module generates the ancillary activity based on the device functionality of the identified secondary user device the device activity the user preference and other data. For example the wearable device may not have an audio output in that case content including an audio component can be altered or modified to accommodate the functionality of the wearable device . In continuing with the example above the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include options to favorite like share e.g. tweet the particular webpage the user is browsing. In some instances the activity module generates the ancillary activity based on the device activity. For example if the device activity of browsing a particular webpage already includes options to favorite or share the webpage the activity module generates the ancillary activity to include functionality not already available at the user device the mobile computer in this case . After the activity module generates the ancillary activity the activity module transmits or otherwise communicates to the wearable device to perform the ancillary activity. In this example the activity module transmits instructions to the wearable device to present a user interface including the options to favorite like or share the particular webpage the user is browsing on the mobile computer .

In some cases the ancillary activity comprises a notification. In these cases the activity module causes presentation of the notification to the user. For instance the activity module communicates to the device instructions to present the notification. In some instances the instructions include notification content generated by the activity module such as a message e.g. pertinent information to be presented to the user. In example embodiments the notification comprises a text message such as Short Message Service SMS messages Multimedia Messaging Service MMS Enhanced Messaging Service EMS and so forth. In other example embodiments the notification comprises a push notification or another similar type of notification. In further example embodiments the notification comprises interactive user interface elements.

As will be discussed further in connection with the attribute data corresponding to the user device sources may include data associated with sensors gauges or other measurement components such as environmental sensor data e.g. ambient temperature data associated with an environment of the user biometric sensor data e.g. heart rate data of the user detection data e.g. detection of a Near Field Communication NFC beacon motion data e.g. acceleration data position data e.g. location as determined by a GPS of a mobile device and so forth.

For instance the home sources may include smart appliances consumables utilities and many other smart devices. In a few specific instances the attribute data may include consumable inventories and consumption rates of various consumable goods e.g. perishables such as milk or bread tracked monitored or otherwise observed by smart refrigerators. In another instance the attribute data may include utility usage data e.g. electricity water . Analysis of the utility usage data may indicate patterns or a status of the user such as the user being on vacation the user being ill e.g. increasing house thermostat set temperature to cope with a cold the user being an energy conscious consumer and so on.

Certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of components modules or mechanisms. Modules may constitute either software modules e.g. code embodied on a machine readable medium or in a transmission signal or hardware modules. A hardware module is a tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain physical manner. In various example embodiments one or more computer systems e.g. a standalone computer system a client computer system or a server computer system or one or more hardware modules of a computer system e.g. a processor or a group of processors may be configured by software e.g. an application or application portion as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.

In some embodiments a hardware module may be implemented mechanically electronically or any suitable combination thereof. For example a hardware module may include dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may be a special purpose processor such as a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA or an Application Specific Integrated Circuit AMC . A hardware module may also include programmable logic or circuitry that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. For example a hardware module may include software encompassed within a general purpose processor or other programmable processor. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry or in temporarily configured circuitry e.g. configured by software may be driven by cost and time considerations.

Accordingly the phrase hardware module should be understood to encompass a tangible entity be that an entity that is physically constructed permanently configured e.g. hardwired or temporarily configured e.g. programmed to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein hardware implemented module refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured e.g. programmed each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example where a hardware module comprises a general purpose processor configured by software to become a special purpose processor the general purpose processor may be configured as respectively different special purpose processors e.g. comprising different hardware modules at different times Software may accordingly configure a particular processor or processors for example to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.

Hardware modules can provide information to and receive information from other hardware modules. Accordingly the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple hardware modules exist contemporaneously communications may be achieved through signal transmission e.g. over appropriate circuits and buses between or among two or more of the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times communications between such hardware modules may be achieved for example through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then at a later time access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices and can operate on a resource e.g. a collection of information .

The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed at least partially by one or more processors that are temporarily configured e.g. by software or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations.

As used herein processor implemented module refers to a hardware module implemented using one or more processors.

Similarly the methods described herein may be at least partially processor implemented with a particular processor or processors being an example of hardware. For example at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor implemented modules. Moreover the one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a cloud computing environment or as a software as a service SaaS . For example at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers as examples of machines including processors with these operations being accessible via a network e.g. the Internet and via one or more appropriate interfaces e.g. an Application Program Interface API .

For example the communication components include Radio Frequency Identification MD tag reader components NEC smart tag detection components optical reader components e.g. an optical sensor to detect a one dimensional bar codes such as Universal Product Code UPC bar code multi dimensional bar codes such as Quick Response QR code Aztec code Data Matrix Dataglyph MaxiCode PDF417 Ultra Code Uniform Commercial Code Reduced Space Symbology UCC RSS 2D bar code and other optical codes acoustic detection components e.g. microphones to identify tagged audio signals or any suitable combination thereof. In addition a variety of information can be derived via the communication components such as location via Internet Protocol IP geo location location via Wi Fi signal triangulation location via detecting a NFC beacon signal that may indicate a particular location and so forth.

In various example embodiments one or more portions of the network may be an ad hoc network an intranet an extranet a virtual private network VPN a local area network LAN a wireless LAN WLAN a wide area network WAN a wireless WAN WWAN a metropolitan area network MAN the Internet a portion of the Internet a portion of the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN a plain old telephone service POTS network a cellular telephone network a wireless network a Wi Fi network another type of network or a combination of two or more such networks. For example the network or a portion of the network may include a wireless or cellular network and the coupling may be a Code Division Multiple Access CDMA connection a Global System for Mobile communications GSM connection or other type of cellular or wireless coupling. In this example the coupling may implement any of a variety of types of data transfer technology such as Single Carrier Radio Transmission Technology 1 RTT Evolution Data Optimized EVDO technology General Packet Radio Service GPRS technology Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution EDGE technology third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP including 3G fourth generation wireless 4G networks Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS High Speed Packet Access HSPA Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE standard others defined by various standard setting organizations other long range protocols or other data transfer technology.

In example embodiments the instructions are transmitted or received over the network using a transmission medium via a network interface device e.g. a network interface component included in the communication components and utilizing any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP . Similarly in other example embodiments the instructions are transmitted or received using a transmission medium via the coupling e.g. a peer to peer coupling to devices . The term transmission medium shall be taken to include any intangible medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying instructions for execution by the machine and includes digital or analog communications signals or other intangible medium to facilitate communication of such software.

Furthermore the machine readable medium is non transitory in other words not having any transitory signals in that it does not embody a propagating signal. However labeling the machine readable medium as non transitory should not be construed to mean that the medium is incapable of movement the medium should be considered as being transportable from one physical location to another. Additionally since the machine readable medium is tangible the medium may be considered to be a machine readable device.
