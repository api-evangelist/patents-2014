This application claims priority from prior U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 816 649 filed Apr. 26 2013 entitled FIBROUS STRUCTURED AMORPHOUS SILICA INCLUDING PRECIPITATED CALCIUM CARBONATE COMPOSITIONS OF MATTER MADE THEREWITH AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety including the specification drawing and claims by this reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The patent owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This application relates to novel fillers and pigments to compositions of matter including such compositions and to methods of use of such compositions.

Fillers and pigments are key components in many industrial markets such as paper paints plastics concrete and pharmaceuticals. Fillers and pigments are utilized to reduce cost improve functionality and to improve the end use performance. One widely used pigment is titanium dioxide TiO which is used to provide brightness and light scattering properties. Another widely used pigment is fumed silica which may be added to some compositions to provide thixotropic attributes for example in paint products. A different product but with a similar sounding name is silica fume which will also be further discussed below.

In paper products commodity filler or pigment products such as synthetic precipitated calcium carbonate PCC or ground calcium carbonate GCC are often used. Various forms of PCC used include calcite crystalline structures aragonite crystalline structures and rhombohedral crystalline structures. Such crystalline structures are generally characterized by low aspect ratios moderate brightness and moderate light scattering power. Some of such materials provide improved optical properties. And some of such materials enhance desired finished product attributes such as paper strength when used in paper furnish or print qualities when used in paper coatings. However there remains a significant need in various paper products for fillers and or pigments which might improve light scattering power. Similarly in certain paint products and uses thereof there remains a need for improved light scattering power in fillers and or pigments.

Titanium dioxide is one of the most widely used pigments in many industries such as paints paper coatings and in some composites. Such use may often be to improve brightness and or to improve opacity. The property of improved opacity means that light scattering properties are improved which provides a product that is harder to see through. For example thin papers may be made more opaque i.e. made with see through properties that make it look as if it were actually thicker by the use of fillers with opacifying properties. The provision of such properties in products using titanium dioxide is primarily due to a combination of characteristics of titanium dioxide such as a high refractive index in the range of from about 2.49 to about 2.61 a small particle size often in the 0.2 micron to 0.4 micron size and in the manner in which adjacent particles of titanium dioxide pack together when used in various products. However despite having a unique shape size and crystal structure titanium dioxide has certain limitations. First it has a very high density of about 4.2 grams per cubic centimeter. Further in order to keep small titanium dioxide particles from agglomerating in various compositions dispersants must often be used. Such dispersants usually have deleterious effects on strength properties especially in the case of coated paper. Also titanium dioxide particles are highly abrasive. Finally due to the complexity of some widely used titanium dioxide manufacturing processes which may include complex separation and purification processes titanium dioxide is one of the most expensive fillers and or coating pigments currently available.

Another filler and or pigment that may be utilized in some applications is fumed silica. Fumed silica also called pyrogenic silica is generally manufactured from flame pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride or by the vaporization of quartz in a 3000 C. arc furnace. The primary particle surface area of most fumed silica is broadly in the range of from about 50 to about 600 square meters per gram. Furthermore amorphous fumed silica particles may be fused into chainlike secondary particles which in turn agglomerate into tertiary 3 dimensional particles. One limitation of fumed silica material is that it is non porous. Also fumed silica is generally highly thixotropic and consequently may cause high viscosity compositions for example when added to paints and coatings. Also the environmental impacts of the manufacturing processes for fumed silica and the usually high cost of fumed silica limit its use.

Silica fume also called micro silica and not to be confused with the just discussed fumed silica is an amorphous i.e. non crystalline material. Silica fume is often collected as an ultra fine powder as a by product of silicon or ferro silicon alloy production. Silica fume is generally in the form of spherical particles with an average particle size of about 150 nanometers. Silica fume has a surface area in the range of from about 15 to about 30 square meters per gram. Also silica fume is a highly pozzolinic material and thus may be used in cement and concrete to enhance compressive strength bond strength and abrasion resistance. However at this time silica fume being a byproduct of production of other materials is in relatively short supply.

With respect to the manufacture of amorphous silica compounds U.S. Pat. No. 4 230 765 issued Oct. 28 1980 to Takahashi et al. for NOVEL AMORPHOUS SILICA and PRODUCTS THEREOF describes methods for manufacture of various types of amorphous silica compounds from calcium silicate hydrates. However he did not develop products of size and of certain characteristics to provide suitable performance for use in high performance paper coatings of that are described herein. Further he did not recognize that by carefully controlling the reaction conditions fixation of calcium carbonate phases to an amorphous silica substrate could be selectively determined and in so doing enhance properties provided by such products especially for high performance paper coating compositions.

In summary the just discussed fillers and or pigments are generally of limited purpose. In many applications each may have a single or limited number of product enhancing properties. Thus there remains an as yet unmet need for a multi functional filler and or pigment that may in many applications replace expensive fillers and pigments such as titanium dioxide fumed silica or silica fume. It would be advantageous if such a new filler and or pigment provided a combination of at least some ideal properties such as 1 high surface ratio 2 high aspect ratio 3 high brightness and 4 high light scattering coefficient. And it would be even more advantageous if such a multi functional filler and or pigment were environmentally safe and available at prices competitive with expensive fillers such as titanium dioxide fumed silica or silica fume. Consequently it is believed that provision of a unique multi functional filler and or pigment would be an interesting and significant contribution to the art and science of fillers and pigments.

In the various figures of the drawing like features may be illustrated with the same reference numerals without further mention thereof. Further the foregoing figures are merely exemplary and may contain various elements that might be present or omitted from actual implementations of various embodiments depending upon the circumstances. An attempt has been made to provide the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the various embodiments and aspects of the developments described herein. However various other elements for a multi functional filler and or pigment especially as applied for various compositions using the same may be utilized in order to provide useful reliable and highly functional fillers and or pigments.

I have now developed a novel multi functional nano composite filler. The filler includes a synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica SAS component and a nano fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate FCA component which together may be abbreviated as a SAS FCA nano composite. In an embodiment such a nano composite filler maybe characterized as having high surface area from about 40 to about 200 meters squared per gram . In an embodiment when mixed with water such a nano composite filler and water mixture results in a pH in a relatively neutral range of from about 6.5 to about 7.5. In an embodiment such unique nano composites SAS FCA may have a high water absorption rate for example in the range of from about 100 to about 300 . In an embodiment such unique nano composites SAS FCA may have a high oil absorption rate for example in the range of from about 150 to about 300 .

In an embodiment as shown in a nano composite SAS FCA material may include at least two distinct components. As shown in a first component having a globular haystack or pillow shaped structure may be provided. The globular haystack or pillow shaped structure may be provided in a configuration that presents a fibrous interstitial appearance having inner layers and outer layers with irregular interlacing fibers or filaments which are fixed and disposed in relation to each other wherein the interlacing fibers or filaments of at least some of said inner layers are visible to a greater or less degree through the interstices of said outer layers when said fibrous structure is viewed via microscope. In an embodiment such globular or haystack or pillow shaped structure may be sized from about ten 10 microns to about forty 40 microns in size. In an embodiment such globular hay stack type structure may be composed of hair like nano fibers of amorphous silica each having a selected diameter and a selected length. In an embodiment the diameter of such amorphous silica fibers of may be in the ten 10 nanometer nm range. In an embodiment the amorphous silica fibers may be in the range of from about three 3 to about four 4 microns in length. In an embodiment the aspect ratio of such amorphous silica nano fibers may be approximately 100 1.

In an embodiment a second component may be provided in a nano composite SAS FCA material. In an embodiment a second component may be provided as an aragonite crystal. In an embodiment such an aragonite crystal may have a needle shaped fiber structure. In an embodiment or in various embodiments such aragonite crystals may have an estimated diameter of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm. In an embodiment or in various embodiments such aragonite crystals may have a length of from about 3 microns to about 10 microns.

In summary a novel nano composite material is described herein. Such nano composite material includes a synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica component the SAS component and a nano fibrous crystalline precipitated calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase component the FCA component . As set forth in the drawing figures an X ray diffraction pattern XRD analysis of the unique nano composite material identified only a single crystalline constituent which matched the X ray diffraction XRD pattern of an aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate see with major peaks at 3.276 3.398 and 1.977 D spacing angstroms . Thus the first structure is amorphous silica rather than a crystalline calcium silicate hydrate. Further as noted in an EDAX analysis confirmed the first component to be silica. Thus the unique nano composite material described herein includes first component of amorphous silica and a second component of crystalline aragonite.

Further the nano composite SAS FCA is believed useful as filler for example in paints and coatings. And initial tests have indicated that the nano composite SAS FCA material is useful as a component of coating compounds especially in the manufacture of paper and paper products. A myriad of uses may be developed based on the unique properties of such synthetic nano composite SAS FCA materials as indicated in evaluations thus far conducted.

The foregoing briefly describes a novel unique nano composite that includes a first component of amorphous silica and a second component of aragonite crystals. As described herein such aragonite crystals may advantageously be synthesized by way of pressure carbonation technique. However the various objectives features and advantages of the novel nano composite materials described herein will be more readily understood upon consideration of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with careful examination of the accompanying figures of the drawing.

A unique nano composite material has been developed which includes both a nano fibrous structured amorphous silica SAS and b nano fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate FCA . Thus this novel nano composite material may be referred to herein by the abbreviation SAS FCA . In one aspect the SAS FCA nano composite material may be characterized by having high surface area approximately 40 to 200 m gram . The pH of the SAS FCA nano composite material when mixed with water is generally in the neutral range of from about 6.5 to about 7.5. In an embodiment an SAS FCA nano composite material may have very high water absorption and very high oil absorption ability in the range of from about 100 to about 300 for water absorption and from about 150 to about 300 for oil absorption. As seen in a scanning electron microscope SEM picture clearly shows two distinct components for a SAS FCA nano composite material. The first components an example is seen prominently at the upper right are globular or haystack or pillow shaped structures which may in an embodiment be from approximately 10 microns to approximately 40 microns in size. Such first components includes hair like nano fibers which in an embodiment may be approximately 10 nanometers nm in diameter. In an embodiment those hair like nano fibers may be from about 3 microns to about 4 microns in length. An energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy EDAX analysis confirmed the presence of SiOin such hair like nano fibers. As also seen in the second components are needle shaped fiber like structures with an estimated diameter but not limited thereto of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm and with a length generally ranging in size but not limited thereto from about 3 microns to about 10 microns. As shown in it is significant to note that the X Ray Diffraction pattern XRD analysis identified only a single crystalline component which matched the XRD pattern of a precipitated calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase see with major peaks at 3.276 3.398 and 1.977 D spacing in angstroms . Such analysis confirms that in an embodiment the nano composite material described herein may include structured amorphous silica SiO and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate. Consequently it can be appreciated that the substances comprising the structures provided by selected precursor crystalline calcium silicate hydrates CSH such as xonotlite react and are converted substantially in place into amorphous silica. Thus precursor crystalline calcium silicate hydrates may under conditions described herein be replaced by amorphous silica. Thus the amorphous silica structures and the associated fibrous crystalline calcium carbonate structures which is in an aragonite phase are produced as a nano composite material. In further detail the structure of the nano composite SAS FCA material includes an amorphous silica portion having a haystack or pillow shaped configuration that presents a fibrous interstitial appearance having inner layers and superimposed outer layers with irregular interlacing fibers or filaments which are fixed and disposed in relation to each other wherein the interlacing fibers or filaments of at least some of the inner layers of the structured amorphous silica are visible to a greater or less degree through the interstices of outer layers of the structured amorphous silica when the nano composite material is viewed via scanning electron microscope. Further the crystalline calcium carbonate portion includes crystalline aragonite structures built within or on or within and on or at least in part extending from the amorphous silica portion of the nano composite material. Thus in an embodiment the just described nano composite material simultaneously provides certain characteristics that enable filler and or pigment performance both of amorphous silica and of a crystalline calcium carbonate in an aragonite phase as will be further understood below in relation to examples provided.

In an embodiment one unique aspect of the developments described herein may involve the use of various phases of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates CSH and the use of carbon dioxide CO under pressure to manufacture a nano composite material including both a amorphous silica and b fibrous crystalline calcium carbonate which in an embodiment is provided in the aragonite phase .

A novel development described herein is a process to convert a crystalline silicate hydrate such as xonotlite into amorphous silica. In an embodiment such conversion may be achieved while concurrently producing a synthetic crystalline calcium carbonate in the aragonite phase. Such a process may involve the reaction of xonotlite with carbon dioxide CO under pressure and thus may generally be referred to as a process for pressure carbonation of nano fibrous calcium silicate hydrates. The SEM photograph and XRD patterns of the carbonated product resulting from reaction with xonotlite calcium silicate hydrate as a starting material are given in respectively. Here again the SEM photograph shows two distinct components in the nano composite material namely amorphous silica within the solid circle and fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate within the dashed oval . In spite of the appearance of the structures the XRD of the nano composite material identifies only a single crystalline phase namely aragonite phase calcium carbonate.

In one aspect the process described herein includes the use of seed materials for enhancement of reactions as such materials may promote conversion efficiency. The efficiency of a pressure carbonation process may be enhanced by using seed materials and or promoters or catalysts such as pre formed amorphous silica which may be provided with or without the use of an aragonite crystal. In an embodiment reaction promoters and or catalysts may include calcium hydroxide and or magnesium hydroxide.

Another aspect of the developments described herein is mineral fixation of carbon dioxide by the manufacture of synthetic calcium carbonate compositions as a component of a nano composite SAS FCA material. Thus a novel process for producing precipitated calcium carbonate is described herein which enables the efficient use of free carbon dioxide found in flue gas and more particularly which may use carbon dioxide from flue gas containing relatively low concentrations of carbon dioxide. Prior work involving simply the production of precipitated calcium carbonate under pressurized conditions was described in prior U.S. Pat. No. 6 125 356 entitled High Speed Manufacturing Process for Precipitated Calcium Carbonate employing Pressure Carbonation was issued Jun. 26 2001 the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference. That process was capable of providing a variety of precipitated calcium carbonate PCC morphologies. Various precipitated calcium carbonates that can be manufactured by that process include distinct crystal morphologies such as calcite scalenohedral as well as calcite rhombohedral of various aspect ratios and aragonite. SEM photographs of such crystals may be seen in . A PCC product manufactured under a pressure carbonation system may be referred to herein as a Super Precipitated Calcium Carbonate S PCC .

The basic chemistry for producing precipitated calcium carbonates includes the steps of calcination slaking and carbonation. The following chemical reactions describe such steps 

In order to produce the nano composite product s described herein an additional step is required as follows 

The carbonation reaction equation 3 above is an equilibrium reaction. Therefore as the soluble calcium ion is converted to calcium carbonate CaCO precipitate more dissolution of the calcium hydroxide Ca OH takes place from the slurry to increase the concentration of the calcium ion up to the solvent solubility limits inverse temperature dependent phenomenon until all of the available calcium hydroxide is dissolved and all available calcium ions have been converted into calcium carbonate. When the process is further conducted to form nano composite SAS FCA material as set forth in equation 4 it is of interest that carbon dioxide fixation using synthetic silicates under pressure is a novel method of carbon capture i.e. fixation by mineralization.

Another aspect the developments described herein is the application of such dual component nano composites in paper as in substitution for conventional pigments and fillers and in paperboard coatings and in other industrial applications such as fillers or pigments for paints and or coatings. As further described herein the novel nano structured materials described herein have some unique properties. In an embodiment such properties may make it useful as filler in papermaking operations. In various embodiments such use may provide some unusual and beneficial paper properties or in unusual and beneficial paper coating properties resulting in superior paper products when made with the nano structured materials described herein.

In various embodiments the nano structured composite materials described herein may be used at various degrees of substitution for currently used high performance coating pigments such as titanium dioxide TiO . In various embodiments the nano structured composite materials described herein may be used at various degrees of substitution for calcined and other naturally occurring clays. The unique nano composites described herein may also be used to enhance the performance of various paper properties such as to improve surface strength of coatings pick strength smoothness appearance shade matte finish lower sheet gloss print quality wet pick and the like. In short the nano composite material described herein including nano structured amorphous silica and nano fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate fits nearly all of the applicable criteria of an ideal pigment.

In an embodiment a unique nano composite including synthetic fibrous structured amorphous silica SAS and a nano fibrous crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate FCA is provided. In an embodiment such nano composite may be characterized by having high surface area approximately 40 to 200 meters squared per gram . In water suspension an embodiment of such unique nano composite material may have a pH in the neutral pH range of 6.5 to 7.5. In an embodiment such nano composite may have a very high water absorption say in the range of from about 100 to about 300 . In an embodiment such nano composite may have a high oil absorption say in the range of from about 150 to about 300 . The scanning electron microscope SEM photograph set forth in clearly shows two distinct components. The first component shown in the photograph is a globular haystack or pillow shaped structure of approximately 10 microns to 40 microns in size. The first structure includes hair like nano fibers which in an embodiment may be approximately 10 nm in diameter. In an embodiment such fibers may be about 3 microns to about 4 microns in length. Thus in an embodiment the aspect ratio of nano fiber SAS FCA may be approximately 100 1. The second and prominent components in the SEM photograph provided in are the needle shaped fiber structures. In an embodiment those prominent components have an estimated diameter of from about 100 nm to about 200 nm and length ranging from about 3 microns to about 10 microns. Note that the X Ray Diffraction XRD pattern analysis shown in identified only a single crystalline component which component matches the XRD pattern of calcium carbonate in the form of aragonite with major peaks at 3.276 3.398 and 1.977 D spacing in angstroms . Thus the other structure was amorphous rather than crystalline. An energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy EDAX analysis see confirmed that the amorphous structure was silica. Thus nano composite SAS FCA which has been developed is a composite of structured amorphous silica SAS and fibrous crystalline aragonite FCA .

In an embodiment unique nano composite materials may be produced by the pressure carbonation of one or more of selected synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrates CSH . Suitable synthetic crystalline calcium silicate hydrates may include riversidite see or foshagite see or tobermorite see or xonotlite see .

Several process steps may be utilized in the preparation of the unique nano composite materials described herein. In a very basic view there are two steps as noted in the two blocks set forth in . In a first step one or more selected synthetic silicate hydrates are prepared by using hydrothermal reaction of calcareous materials such as lime with siliceous materials such as quartz or diatomaceous earth DE . In a second step the just prepared one or more selected calcium silicate hydrates are subjected to carbonation under pressurized conditions to produce a nano composite structure that includes amorphous silica generally shaped in the form of the prior crystalline calcium silicate hydrate and additionally crystalline calcium carbonate which in an embodiment appears in the aragonite phase. In an embodiment the process es may be carried out in pressurized reactors.

The manufacturing process of suitable nano composite materials involves reacting carbon dioxide reaction with synthetic calcium silicate hydrate under pressure. In an embodiment the reaction of carbon dioxide under pressurized conditions provides carbonic acid in liquid solution for reaction with the one or more selected calcium silicate hydrates. In an embodiment such the second step of formation of nano composites i.e. pressurized carbonation may be carried out in the presence of one or more seed materials such as a selected amount of a previously prepared nano composite e.g. a selected amount of aragonite . Further in an embodiment reaction rates may be enhanced by utilization of a combination of selected amounts of calcium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. In an embodiment the process of pressurized carbonation may be carried out by controlling the starting pH to the range of from about 10 to about 11.

The chemical reaction that occurs when synthetic calcium silicate hydrates are exposed to COis given in equation 4 above. In an experimental nano composite manufacturing process the carbonation of selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrates was carried out in a pressurized reactor using a pressure carbonation process. The experimental process variables included a initial reactor pressure b initial reactor temperature and c carbon dioxide flow rate to the reactor. In an embodiment some process parameters and their ranges may be considered as follows 

Set out below is a written description of a process for the production of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates CSH used as precursor materials for the production of novel nano composite materials including the SAS FCA composite described herein and the manner and process of making and using such calcium silicate hydrates in full clear concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same including the best mode presently contemplated by the inventor for carrying out such process. However for additional reference various additional embodiments for manufacturing and preparation of various phases of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates are taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6 726 807 B1 issued on Apr. 27 2004 and entitled Multi Phase Calcium Silicate Hydrates Methods for Their Preparation and Improved Paper and Pigment Products Produced Therewith and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 048 900 B2 issued on May 23 2006 and entitled Method and Apparatus for Production of Precipitated Calcium Carbonate and Silicate Compounds in Common Process Equipment . The reader is referred thereto for additional information and the disclosures of each of the just mentioned patents including their specification claims and drawing figures are incorporated herein in their entirety by this reference in those states countries where such incorporation by reference is permitted under applicable treaty statute or regulation.

Lime slurry is prepared according to generally accepted slaking processes. However for purposes of further preparation of novel nano composite SAS FCA materials an exception to commonly used methods may be advantageously utilized. For preparation of nano composite SAS FCA compositions as described herein the lime slurry need not be cooled. Instead hot lime slurry usually at approximately 93 C. may be screened and transferred directly to a pressurizable reactor vessel. It should be noted that the solubility of calcium hydroxide is very low in water and is inversely proportional to the temperature of that water. For example the concentration of lime as calcium oxide CaO in pure water at 0 C. is reported to be 0.14 . When the temperature of the water rises to the atmospheric boiling point 100 C. the solubility of the lime as calcium oxide CaO falls to 0.05 .

Various siliceous materials such as quartz water glass clay pure silica natural silica sand natural diatomaceous earth fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth or combinations thereof may be used as source s of siliceous material. In an experimental preparation of calcium silicate hydrates an ultra fine grade of fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth FCDE was utilized and was made into a water slurry at approximately 146.2 grams FCDE per liter of slurry. More generally an aqueous slurry of siliceous material at a concentration of from about 120 grams to about 180 grams of silica per liter of slurry can be used. It should be noted that the solubility of silica quartz unlike that of calcium hydroxide Ca OH is directly proportional to temperature. For example quartz is only slightly soluble up to about 100 C. From about 100 C. to about 130 C. quartz starts solubilizing and around 270 C. a maximum solubility is reached at about 0.07 . The dissolution of silica may be represented as per the reaction described in equation 5 5 SiO 2HO Si OH 

The solubility of silica in water may be increased by raising pH such as by using various additives e.g. sodium hydroxide . The solubilization of silica is also at least to some extent a function of particle size thus in an embodiment a smaller particle size such as may be provided by use of ultra fine fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth FCDE may be advantageous.

First the amount of CaO in a lime slurry and the amount of SiOin a diatomaceous earth slurry may be adjusted to give a selected CaO SiOmole ratio. Second the concentration of the two slurries CaO and SiO and the final concentration of the mixture may be adjusted by using water so as to provide a selected final concentration e.g. in an autoclave in experimental apparatus of between about 24 and about 120 grams liter.

In an experimental embodiment a pressurized reactor vessel was cooled down by passing quenching water through an internal cooling coil and external jacketed cooling system. The cool down process took from about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes in order to reduce the temperature from 230 C. to 80 C. Generally the inverse solubility of lime in water with respect to temperature has been recognized and thus utilized in an effort to produce the desired composition and phases of calcium silicate hydrate material.

Without limiting the developments described herein to any particular mechanism or theory in some respects it is presently believed that certain reactions occur during the hydrothermal reaction between calcious material and siliceous material. More particularly solid calcium hydroxide Ca OH particles may react with SiOin a gel phase to yield a calcium silicate hydroxide whose crystallochemical structure can be written as CaSiO OH xonotlite . As the temperature is further raised from about 180 C. to about 250 C. calcium silicate hydrate condenses with the remaining Ca OH particles to give yet another calcium silicate hydrate this time with a distinct X ray diffraction pattern and a crystallochemical formula of Ca SiO OH foshagite . Thus the process es described herein may produce not only single phase calcium silicate hydrates but may also produce calcium silicate hydrates having multiple phases therein. Different calcium silicate hydrates may be made by changing the lime silica ratio slurry concentration reaction temperature and reaction time. The use of different additives like sodium hydroxide sugar and chelating compounds may also be utilized and manipulated to create diverse products. More generally a variety of calcium silicate hydrates including xonotlite tobermorite riversidite and foshagite may be prepared by manipulating the following process parameters 

Various phases of calcium silicate hydrates were produced by changing the calcium to silica molar ratio e.g. from 0.75 to 1.35 by changing the reactant concentrations e.g. from 48 to 120 grams per liter and by changing the reaction temperature e.g. from 180 C. to 260 C. and by changing the reaction time e.g. in the range of from about 2 hours to about 4 hours . Generally for further production of nano composite SAS FCA products the CSH products from a selected set of reaction conditions may be cooled from a maximum of 260 C. to a minimum of between about 180 C. and 70 C.

In an embodiment the process described herein utilizes a hydrothermal reaction that may be carried out under super atmospheric conditions using pressurized reactor equipment. As an example a reactor used in the lab was a specialized high pressure high temperature two liter reactor vessel. It was fitted with an outside jacketed heater and internal cooling coil system. The reactor was also fitted with an impeller to provide mixing in the reactor e.g. Rustin 200 impeller . In a laboratory reactor embodiment the agitator impeller was connected to a variable speed magnetic drive motor. Additionally the reactor was fitted with a sample dip tube and with a vent system which was used to maintain pressure at a desired level. The completely assembled reactor was capable of pressures of up to 68.95 bar. All heating and cooling processes of the reactor were controlled via an external controller.

In an embodiment the process included reacting lime at approximately 240 grams liter with a silica source e.g. diatomaceous earth and or quartz at about 180 grams liter. The reactions were made in a pressurized reactor over temperature range of 180 C. to 250 C. and the corresponding steam pressure ranging from 13.8 bar to 41.37 bar. The total reaction time was approximately 4 to 6 hours. The resulting slurry concentration ranged from 36 grams per liter to 120 grams per liter.

The process conditions for the hydrothermal reaction such as calcium to silica ratio slurry solids percentage and temperature of reaction were varied as shown in Table 1 below to prepare different crystal phases of calcium silicate hydrates such as riversidite tobermorite xonotlite and foshagite. For further specific examples see U.S. Pat. No. 6 726 807 B1 issued on Apr. 27 2004 for Multi phase Calcium Silicate Hydrates Methods for Their Preparation and Improved Paper and Pigment Products Produced Therewith as noted herein above.

Some of the characteristics of the above noted phases of crystalline calcium silicate hydrates CSH are provided in Table 2. Such crystal phases may be characterized at least in part by their 1 X Ray diffraction pattern 2 surface area 3 water absorption 4 aspect ratio and 5 bulk density. A graphical representation of typical surface areas of the noted phases of calcium silicate hydrates is provided in . A graphical comparison of the surface area of calcium silicate hydrates CSH with titanium dioxide TiO and with precipitated calcium carbonate PCC is shown in . A graphical comparison of the aspect ratio of calcium silicate hydrates SCH with titanium dioxide TiO and with precipitated calcium carbonate PCC is shown in . A graphical comparison of the bulk density of calcium silicate hydrates CSH and titanium dioxide TiO pulp fibers and calcium carbonate is shown in .

The scanning electron microscope SEM photographic images and corresponding x ray diffraction XRD patterns of the above noted four different phases of calcium silicate hydrate CSH products are shown in . The reaction conditions clearly influence the crystal structure and habit as well as the chemical composition and some physical properties including surface area water absorption aspect ratio brightness and bulk density. Depending on reaction conditions such calcium silicate hydrates CSH may be produced as macro particles or as nano fibers or as macro fibers with a broad range of surface area particle sizes shapes and aspect ratios as can be seen in the above referenced drawing figures and as indicated in the above Tables 1 and 2. Additional SEM photographs provided in illustrates an embodiment that provides an example of a structure in the form of a haystack or pillow fur ball or similar structure that is suitable as a calcium silicate hydrate CSH that may be useful as a starting material i.e. a precursor for replacement of material therein with amorphous silica in the manufacture of a nano composite SAS FCA containing structured amorphous silica and fibrous calcium carbonate crystals in the form of aragonite.

A specific example of the experimental preparation of a selected synthetic nano fibrous calcium silicate hydrate namely xonotlite is now provided. The reaction was carried out at selected conditions in order to produce xonotlite. The reaction was carried out in a high pressure reactor having a volume of 7.5 liters available from Parr Instrument Company. The hydrothermal process conditions are given in Table 3 below. The resulting xonotlite properties are summarized in Table 4.

The xonotlite slurry had a pH of 11.6. The surface area BET measurement for the dry xonotlite was 137 square meters per gram. The water and oil absorption of the dry xonotlite were 315 and 379 respectively. The scanning electron microscope SEM photograph and X ray diffraction XRD pattern of the manufactured xonotlite are shown in respectively. The X ray diffraction pattern set forth in shows the predominate presence xonotlite. In the SEM photograph shows in the circled area a secondary structure having a haystack or pillow configuration that provides a fibrous hollow macrosphere structure made up primarily of nano fibers with layers having interstitial spaces and wherein inner fibers are seen through outer layers of fibers.

Cogeneration of a nano composite including structured amorphous silica SAS and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate FCA by pressure carbonation may be accomplished once one or more selected calcium silicate hydrates are available as a raw material and a supply of carbon dioxide is available. The manufacture of a nano composite SAS FCA material involves pressure carbonation. In an embodiment the manufacture of a nano composite SAS FCA material may be done in a cogeneration fashion that is the reaction with the xonotlite substrate to replace the same with amorphous silica is carried out at the same time and under the same reaction conditions while fibrous crystalline aragonite is manufactured on in or protruding from the substrate CSH starting material here the xonotlite substrate.

It has been found that efficiency of the carbonation of fibrous calcium silicate hydrate may be significantly improved by adding certain seed materials and or reaction promoter materials and or catalysts and or pH modifiers as further described below. In an embodiment a suitable seed material may include previously generated nano composite SAS FCA material. In an embodiment a suitable seed material may include one or more additional calcium silicate hydrate precursors. Additional seed materials may include commercially produced calcium carbonates CaCO in the aragonite phase. The total quantity of seed materials to be added may range from about 2 to about 20 of the total weight of reactants.

Catalysts may include a mixture of calcium hydroxide Ca OH and magnesium hydroxide Mg OH . The total quantity of catalytic material may range from about 2.0 to about 10.0 of the total weight of reactants. The ratio of calcium hydroxide to magnesium hydroxide may range from about 1 1 to about 2 1. Such catalysts also serve as pH buffers and promoters and may also help to remove certain impurities from process water. In an embodiment before the start of pressure carbonation the described seed materials and catalysis promoters were added to a xonotlite slurry produced as described above.

During reaction the incoming carbon dioxide CO was continuously consumed by the calcium constituents of the calcium silicate hydrate CSH . Thus while the COwas initially introduced at a pressure of approximately 70 psig and while the temperature increased due to the exothermic nature of the carbonation reaction the pressure in the reactor remained fairly close to the initial pressure. However at the end of the reaction the calcium ions Ca and carbonate ions CO were fully consumed. In the experimental apparatus the excess carbon dioxide at the end of the reaction started to increase the pressure of the reactor. Thus while the end of the reaction was indicated by a plot of temperature versus time another indicator was an increase in the rate of change in the pressure in the reaction vessel versus time.

Thus the completion of the carbonation of calcium silicate hydrates was indicated by the temperature reaching a plateau and by the pressure increasing significantly. The progress of the pressure carbonation reaction was also monitored by following the pH and conductivity of the slurry. The pH as per equation 2 above decreased from an initial pH of approximately 11 to a final pH between about 6.5 and about 7.5. The conductivity also fell as the free calcium Ca ions were used up to produce non ionic CaCO. The just noted pH was measured after the temperature reached a maximum and the rate of change of pressure started to increase.

One test utilized to establish the nature of products actually manufactured was the Mohr s Salt test. That test involved applying a solution of ammonium iron II sulfate Mohr s Salt namely NH Fe SO .6HO to a sample of the nano composite slurry. The development of a green color indicated the presence of aragonite crystal phase. This test was further confirmed by an X ray diffraction XRD analysis. Another test conducted was the surface area of the final product using the BET method. In an embodiment a range of surface areas was found from about 50 square meters per gram to about 150 square meters per gram.

An example of cogeneration of a nano composite SAS FCA namely structured amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate is now provided in further detail. A reaction was carried out according to the conditions necessary to produce a nano composite of structured amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite carbonate. The reaction was carried out in a high pressure 7.5 L reactor manufactured by Parr Instrument Company. The pressure carbonation process conditions are given in Table 5 below. The resulting nano composite SAS FCA material properties are summarized in Table 6. Previous work has shown that different sources of silica Flux calcined diatomaceous earth ground quartz and regular diatomaceous earth will result in different silicate properties. The xonotlite formation reaction example above was conducted using a flux calcined Diatomaceous Earth product as a silica source. The X Ray Diffraction pattern and SEM photograph of a resulting nano composite SAS FCA material are provided in respectively.

As shown in the XRD pattern for nano composite SAS FCA material showed that aragonite was predominantly present as well as a trace of tobermorite. Thus the nano composite SAS FCA includes both fibrous amorphous silica and fibrous crystalline aragonite. In the photographs taken with a scanning electron microscope show two distinct structures in the nano composite SAS FCA. A first structure resembles the shape of one of the raw materials namely the xonotlite calcium silicate hydrate. The second structure resembles crystalline aragonite precipitated calcium carbonate. However since crystalline silica was virtually absent in the X Ray diffraction pattern it may be inferred that the silica component was after the carbonation reaction essentially in a non crystalline i.e. amorphous form. The SEM photograph of the raw materials namely synthetic xonotlite and its corresponding XRD are given in . The SEM photograph of the resulting nano composite material SAS FCA compound after the pressure carbonation process as well as its corresponding XRD are shown in respectively.

A comparison of a selected raw material and of a sample of the finished product namely a nano composite SAS FCA may be instructive. An SEM photograph of a selected raw material namely xonotlite crystals is shown in . The XRD for those xonotlite crystals is provided in . As illustrated in after carbonation of the xonotlite raw materials the SEM of the carbonated xonotlite showed two distinct structures namely aragonite dashed oval and SiO solid circle . However as shown in the X Ray diffraction pattern of the novel nano composite materials SAS FCA showed the presence of a single predominant crystalline component namely aragonite calcium carbonate. Thus it can be inferred that the remaining SiOwas in an amorphous form. Thus it has been determined that the carbonation of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates is technically feasible and the work described herein has resulted in a novel unique nano composite SAS FCA product.

In one aspect the pressure carbonation of synthetic calcium silicate hydrates resulted in the unexpected formation of a nano fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate FCA . Such crystal structure was also confirmed by the chemical chromatic test using Mohr s Salt green color . And since the xonotlite i.e. the silica portion of the XRD shown in was not detected in the XRD pattern of the nano composite illustrated in the XRD shown in it is postulated that the final carbonated nano composite SAS FCA material was mostly nano fibrous structured amorphous silica SAS which was produced from the crystalline calcium silicate hydrate xonotlite.

Initially 117.4 grams of rotary pebble lime from Graymont Lime Co. was accurately weighed and slaked in 350 milliliters of high purity water prepared by reverse osmosis treatment. The slaking reaction is exothermic and caused the slurry temperature to rise to near boiling. When the slurry temperature was very near boiling and before much of the water had evaporated an additional 90 milliliters of water was added to both dilute and cool the slurry. The slurry was then agitated for 30 minutes to insure slaking completion. Then the slurry was screened through a 100 mesh screen. The slurry was then transferred to a 5 liter autoclave and tested for lime availability in accordance with ASTM method C25 entitled Standard Test Methods for Chemical Analysis of Limestone Quicklime and Hydrated Lime. Approximately 137.2 grams of fine fluxed calcined diatomaceous earth FCDE from Eagle Picher Minerals Reno Nev. namely Celatom brand product designation MW 27 was weighed and added to 750 ml of hot water concentration of approximately 182 grams liter . The silica slurry was added to the screened and tested lime slurry. The exact amount of silica slurry added to lime slurry was determined by the lime availability such that a CaO SiOmol ratio of approximately 1.05 would be maintained. The total slurry volume was also adjusted by adding water to a final concentration of 54 grams per liter. The autoclave was continuously agitated at a constant speed of 250 rpm. The starting temperature of the slurry was approximately 25 C. The reactor was heated for approximately 100 minutes in order to reach the target temperature of 230 C. The temperature was maintained at 230 C. for 2 hours after which quenching water was flushed through the cooling coil built inside the reactor. The cooling process was maintained until the temperature in the reactor reached approximately 80 C. roughly 30 minutes at which point the reactor was depressurized and opened. Then the reaction products were transferred to a holding vessel for storage. One portion of the resultant slurry was tested for pH. Another portion of the resultant slurry was dried in an oven at 105 C. for 12 hours. During the drying process the slurry formed hard lumps which had to be broken up through the use of a mortar and pestle. The powdered dry product was brushed through a 100 mesh screen to insure product uniformity during testing. The pigment in this example was designated sample batch MW 2.

The process conditions for xonotlite formation are given in Table 7 below. The pigment properties of xonotlite are given in Table 8 below.

The x ray diffraction pattern of this synthetic multiphase calcium silicate hydrate namely xonotlite is given in . This product gave a unique x ray pattern. The pattern indicated that the powder had one major phase. The summary of the characteristic peaks is shown in Table 9. The major peaks for phase I were found to indicate the presence of calcium silicate hydrate xonotlite CaSiO OH with major peaks at d 3.107 d 1.75 and a minor peak at d 3.66.

Some SEM pictures at 1500 times magnification are shown in . The SEM clearly shows the fibrous structure of xonotlite. The diameter of the nano fibers ranges from about 10 nm to about 20 nm while the length ranges from about 1 microns to about 5 microns. Such dimensions result in a material having an aspect ratio of about 100 1. The SEM also depicts the three dimensional structure of the secondary particles of calcium silicate hydrates. Such secondary structure has a pillow or haystack or globular type appearance. The structure appears to have been formed by an interlocking of the primary fibrous crystals and some inter fiber bonding due to hydro gel of silica formed during the initial stages of hydro thermal reaction. Because of these two main reasons the secondary particles are fairly stable and do not significantly lose their 3 d structure when subjected to process shear. In addition these particles also seem to withstand the pressure encountered during the calendaring or finishing operations integral to papermaking and coating. The median size of the secondary particles as seen ranges from about 10 microns to about 40 microns.

Step 2 Cogeneration of Nano Composite SAS FCA Having a Structured Amorphous Silica Component and a Fibrous Crystalline Calcium Carbonate Aragonite Component by Pressure Carbonation.

The xonotlite slurry produced in step 1 was placed into a reactor at a slurry concentration of 0.45 pounds per liter. The starting carbonation temperature was 60 C. The reaction was carried out under a starting pressure of 70 psig. Carbon dioxide gas was bubbled through the reactor. The flow of carbon dioxide was at the rate of 3.6 liters per minute. As the reaction proceeded the reaction temperature increased with the temperature starting at 60 C. and ending at approximately 70 C. The end of the reaction was indicated when the temperature reached a maximum and then declined. The point of inflection in the temperature curve was taken as the completion point of the carbonation reaction. The pressure in the vessel spiked due to the incoming but unreacted CO. The reactor was first depressurized. Then the reactor was opened and the reaction products were transferred to a holding vessel for storage. A portion of the resultant slurry was dried in an oven at 105 C. for 12 hours. During the drying process the slurry formed hard lumps which had to be broken up through the use of a mortar and pestle. The now powdered dry product was brushed through a 100 mesh screen to insure product uniformity when testing. The pigment in this example was designated batch MW 2 ARA.

The process conditions for cogeneration of nano composites designated as batch MW 2 ARA are given in Table 10. The product properties for the nano composites designated as batch MW 2 ARA are given in Table 11.

The XRD pattern given in for an embodiment of the nano composite SAS FCA material clearly identifies the presence of crystalline aragonite as a predominant component of the material. However no XRD peak for a crystalline silica composition SiO was observed.

As also seen in the XRD pattern for a nano composite SAS FCA material showed a peak for precipitated calcium carbonate namely aragonite fibrous crystalline aragonite and a peak for a trace of synthetic calcium silicate hydrate namely tobermorite . As seen in however the SEM photographs for the nano composite SAS FCA shows two distinct structural features namely SiO in the solid circle and aragonite in the dashed oval . The first structural feature SiO resembles the original starting material namely a haystack pillow or globular structure similar to the structure seen in the xonotlite see the large circle illustrated in above . The second structural feature resembles a crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate see . The presence of a silica product was confirmed by an EDAX analysis see . Since the silica product was virtually absent in the X Ray diffraction XRD pattern of the nano composite SAS FCA as shown in it may be inferred that the silica component was essentially non crystalline or amorphous.

Thus as generally described above it can be appreciated that a novel composition of matter has been created in the nature of a nano composite SAS FCA including a fibrous amorphous silica component and a crystalline calcium carbonate component. In an embodiment the fibrous amorphous silica component may be provided in three dimensional haystack which may alternately be said to be a pillow shaped or globular shape three dimensional structure .

In an embodiment the carbon dioxide may be present in the gas about from about 10 to about 20 .

During reaction calcium is extracted from the selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate that provides the base structure.

In various embodiments the fibrous amorphous silica component is provided in three dimensional haystack configuration may also be described as globular or pillow shaped that presents a fibrous structure having interstitial spaces between amorphous silica fibers with inner layers and outer layers with irregular interlacing amorphous silica fibers or filaments that are fixed in relation to each other. Such reaction proceeds under reaction conditions known to be conducive to the formation of precipitated calcium carbonate in the form of crystalline aragonite. In an embodiment the crystalline aragonite are attached to the fibrous amorphous silica component.

In an experimental apparatus after a batch of nano composite SAS FCA material had been manufactured validated and approved by the tests described above a slurry was then run through a 100 152 micron to 200 mesh 75 micron screen to remove large particles inert material and reactor scale. After the oversized material was removed the slurry was then run through a series of unit operations to remove the excess water. In industrial practice such processes may include use of a drum filter and or press filters and or vacuum filtration and or spray drying and or oven drying or the like. In an embodiment a dry final product may be obtained. Such dry material may be ground up e.g using a ball mill or the like so that the dried solid nano composite material will pass through a screen of selected size such as a 100 mesh screen.

After a dry pigment sample was screened it was then mixed with water to make a high solids slurry with solids ranging from about 40 to about 60 . That was accomplished with the use of a high shear mixer such as a Cowlez mixer or Silverson Unit . Before the dry pigment was mixed with the water a dispersing agent was added to the water e.g. a sodium polyacrylamide . The amount of dispersing agent added per pound of dry pigment may vary widely depending upon the selected dispersant but for the stated example may range from about 0.5 to about 4 . The resulting slurry was passed through a 100 mesh screen to remove large agglomerated particles.

Several different coating pigments may be combined to make a coating formulation. Such coating pigments may include coating clays calcined clays various forms of calcium carbonates titanium dioxide and other materials. Different coating pigments may be dispersed individually either at the manufacturer s plant or the consumer s plant. The order of mixing the various coating pigments is generally not too important but care should be taken to insure that agglomeration with different pigments does not occur. With the different coating mixtures the dispersed pigments described above were blended based on a parts method by weight. Exemplary coating formulations are given in specific examples set forth below.

After the various coating pigments were added to together various binding agents were added to the blend. Some synthetic binding agents may include but are not limited to styrene butadiene latex SB latex styrene acrylate latex polyvinyl acetate polyvinyl alcohol vinyl acrylic latex and vinyl acetate ethylene latex.

Also various soy proteins modified by adding carboxyl groups may be utilized.

After the final material components were added the coating formulation was screened through a selected screen and in this embodiment through a 100 mesh screen.

For example in a selected coating composition wherein as a base case a specific target brightness may be achieved with selected amount of titanium dioxide in the absence of nano composite material it may be noted that such specific target brightness may also be achieved by replacement of up to 75 of the selected amount of titanium dioxide by addition of an effective amount of the nano composite material in the coating composition. Similarly in a selected coating composition wherein as a base case a specific target brightness may be achieved with selected amount of titanium dioxide in the absence of said nano composite material it may be noted that such specific target brightness may also be achieved by replacement of 50 of the selected amount of titanium dioxide by addition of an effective amount of the nano composite material.

More generally it can be said that in many cases where a coating composition further includes any one or more of a titanium dioxide b calcined clay c natural clay and d ground calcium carbonate and providing an effective amount of the nano composite material in the coating composition may allow a decrease in the quantity of a selected one or more of a titanium dioxide b calcined clay c natural clay and d ground calcium carbonate in the coating composition as necessary to meet selected performance or cost objectives.

In an embodiment the nano composite material comprises a surface finish agent in a coating composition whereby a low gloss matte finish may be provided in a coated sheet. In an embodiment the nano composite material comprises a caliper enhancing constituent in a coating composition wherein a coated sheet of increased caliper is provided.

In various embodiments an exemplary coating composition may be provided by using the combination of a novel nano material SAS FCA and a selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate. In an embodiment an exemplary selected synthetic calcium silicate hydrate includes aragonite.

After the coating formulations were made a coating was then applied to a substrate base in one of several methods. These methods included air knife rod blade and other coating methods. In the lab a lab rod coater RK Control Coater was used. After the coating is applied based on the end user s requirements the coated sample was dried generally using a heated drum Regal Arkay ST 22 . After the coating was dried the resulting coated sample was examined for defects or gaps in the coating.

When a sample coating passed initial examination as just noted above it was then tested for the following properties 

A coating operation was conducted at a laboratory in Tacoma Wash. The pigment slurries were dispersed using a Silverson disperser then screened through a 100 mesh screen. Coating binders were added to the pigment slurry first a soybean based protein followed by a latex and the coating formulation was blended with a Silverson low shear mixer. The coatings were applied to the paperboard using a RK rod coater and dried in a drum dryer having a Teflon coated non stick surface Regal Arkey ST 22 . Coatings were applied over a range of coat weights and then soft nip calendared. The test data for each coating condition including the lab control were plotted as a function of coat weight and normalized to a target coat weight for comparison.

For Example 5 an unbleached Kraft paperboard having a production base coating was as a substrate on which a top coating was applied in the laboratory. The TiOrange for the top coat control was in the 15 parts to 20 parts range per 100 parts of total dry pigment by weight which included calcined clay and 1 coating clay with soybean based protein and SB Latex as binder. In this case study 25 50 and 75 of the TiOwas replaced with a nano composite SAS FCA material in the coating formulation. The coating formulation is given below in Table 24.

The high surface area high aspect ratio and low bulk density of prior art materials similar to the tested nano composite SAS FCA generally results in a high binder demand high viscosity higher immobilization time and low pick strength. However it was surprising to find just the opposite results with respect to the tested nano composite SAS FCA material. One of the unique characteristics of the nano composite SAS FCA material described herein was that it performed equal or better than the TiOcontaining control formulation. is a plot of Brookfield viscosity over a solids range of 30 to 50 for both the TiOcontrol and the use of the nano composite SAS FCA based coating and shows that in the 40 to 45 solids range where an air knife coater would most likely operate we see that the viscosities are nearly identical. Thus it is anticipated that such a coating composition including the novel nano composite SAS FCA may be utilized as a drop in substitution in some coating applications.

Coating immobilization study results are shown in . The tests were performed using a Dynamic Water Retention DWR device. shows how long it takes for the coating to immobilize. There is a distinguishable difference between the control coating with TiOand the nano composite SAS FCA based coatings. The data shows that the nano composite SAS FCA based coatings have a much faster immobilization rate as compared to the control TiOcoatings.

The coated sheets were soft nip calendared to a target Parker Print Smoothness of 3.0 PPS 10S . The calendared sheets were then tested as per the protocol described above. The test results are given in Table 25. Then the test data was plotted as a function of coat weight and normalized to a target coat weight of 17 to 19 grams per square meter for comparison.

The IGT Pick strength and IGT Blister shown in respectively show the coating strength for the nano composite SAS FCA is significantly better 28 and 33 respectively than the TiOcontrol. It is believed silanol bonding sites may play a role in this strength improvement which could potentially translate into a lower binder demand.

The APT Appearance test shown in shows that the nano composite SAS FCA based coating coverage is comparable to the TiOcontrol.

The ISO Brightness of the nano composite SAS FCA based coating was several points lower than the TiOcontrol as indicated in . However such characteristics do offer an advantage for reducing dye costs where dye back methods are sometimes used to improve appearance.

The gloss of the sheets coated with the nano composite SAS FCA based coating showed a shift towards a matte finish in both the machine direction MD and cross direction CD as seen in respectively.

The addition of the nano composite SAS FCA in the coating formulation did increase the caliper as shown in . Coated paperboard samples were sent to Nancy Plowman Associates for print testing to understand the potential print performance of the various nano composite SAS FCA based coatings as compared to the TiOcontrol. For the print tests performed the print results Table 26 indicated the nano composite SAS FCA based coating was comparable to the TiOcontrol.

Example 6 used an unbleached Kraft paperboard which was base coated with a 75 25 blend of aragonite S PCC and nano composite SAS FCA . Together these two components completely replaced the 2 clay that had been utilized in the base coating control formulation. The base coat weight target was 14 to 16 grams per square meter. The top coating was a 65 35 blend of aragonite S PCC and nano composite SAS FCA at a top coat weight target of 17 to 20 grams per square meter. Both base coatings used the same blend of soybean based protein and SB latex. Both top coatings used the same blend of soybean based protein and SB latex. Finally the coated sheets were soft nip calendared to a target Parker Print Smoothness PPS 10S of 3.0.

IGT Pick strength and IGT Blister resistance as indicated in respectively showed a significant improvement 73 and 44 respectively for the coating composition utilizing 1 aragonite super precipitated calcium carbonate S PCC and 2 nano composite SAS FCA based coating over the control coating. The nano composite SAS FCA structures as indicated in the photomicrograph illustrated in may retain a hollow macrosphere structure sized and shaped similar to the size and shape of a synthetic calcium silicate hydrate used as a raw material. For example compare nano composite SAS FCA with the structures seen in selected substrate calcium silicate hydrates that may be utilized as substrates for the production of nano composite SAS FCA as indicated in or . In any event the surface strength improvement offers an opportunity to reduce binder demand when the novel coating formulations including nano composite SAS FCA materials are utilized.

The APT Appearance was slightly better for the control as noted in . However the ISO Brightness showed a distinct improvement when 100 of the TiOwas replaced by the nano composite SAS FCA as indicated in .

The L value whiteness showed a slight drop when 100 of the TiOwas replaced with nano composite SAS FCA see .

The a value red green color balance showed a shift of the coating color to the red when 100 of the TiOwas replaced with nano composite SAS FCA see .

The b value yellow blue color balance showed a significant shift to a blue white shade when 100 of the TiOwas replaced with nano composite SAS FCA see .

In this example a bleached uncoated wood free sheet with a basis weight of 70 grams per square meter was used. As shown in Table 29 the control coating was made up of 64 dry parts by weight of 1 high brightness clay supplied by Theile 8 parts by weight calcined clay also supplied by Theile and 24 parts by weight Ground Calcium Carbonate supplied by OMYA . The remaining 4 parts by weight of the coating was made up of TiO supplied by DuPont . Novel coating formulations that were tested were identified as condition 1 or as condition 2 or as condition 3 . In various embodiments coating formulations included pigments that contained mostly the novel nano composite structured amorphous silica SAS and nano fibrous crystalline aragonite calcium carbonate FCA . In various embodiments some of the coating compositions also included calcium silicate hydrate foshagite CSH from GR Nano Materials Tacoma Wash. USA 3 parts and Aragonite S PCC from GR Nano Materials Tacoma Wash. USA 3 parts all parts are by weight. Binder in the form of 15.5 parts of SBIR Latex was added with constant stirring to a coating formulation mixture in some embodiments. In various embodiments the coating formulation slurry was thoroughly mixed in a Silverson unit for 5 minutes. The thoroughly mixed coating formulations were screened through a screen of selected size normally through a 100 mesh screen to provide a finished coating composition ready for use. Thus 100 of the TiO2 only 4 parts was replaced by GR Nano Materials pigments with 6 parts by weight of GR Nano Materials products which alternately was by 1 a mixture of calcium silicate hydrate foshagite CSH and nan composite SAS FCA or 2 by a mixture of calcium silicate hydrate foshagite CSH and aragonite S PCC or 3 by calcium silicate hydrate foshagite CSH alone.

Table 29 shows the blend procedure and composition utilized for the coating formulations utilized in the embodiments set out in this example. The actual coating and drying of the samples was carried out the same as described above. As per the testing profile the coated sheets were tested for TAPPI Opacity ISO Opacity as well as scattering coefficient and absorption coefficient see Table 30 .

One finding was that it appears that 100 of the titanium dioxide TiO in such coating formulations can be replaced either by a combination of the nano composite SAS FCA with a calcium silicate hydrate CSH condition or by a calcium silicate hydrate CSH alone condition or by a combination of calcium silicate hydrate and aragonite S PCC condition . See Tables 29 and 30. Also show the results of TAPPI Opacity and ISO Opacity respectively for the high basis weight label stock coated paper samples.

The coating formulation utilized in Example 8 was generally prepared as set forth in Example 7. However the label stock paper had a basis weight of 67 grams per square meter of paper. Also the amounts utilized for the different coating pigments were changed as shown in Table 31. The making of the coating and the testing of the sheets was generally the same as set forth in Example 7. Table 32 shows the results of opacity testing.

As seen in see also Tables 31 and 32 one finding was that in an embodiment 50 of the titanium dioxide TiO may be replaced by the combination of 12.0 parts by weight of a foshagite calcium silicate hydrate CSH and aragonite S PCC . show the results of TAPPI Opacity and ISO Opacity respectively. While the use of the combination of nano composite SAS FCA with a foshagite calcium silicate hydrate CSH did not yield the desired opacity the data shows that by replacing the GCC with aragonite S PCC see condition 3 it may be possible to replace 50 of the TiO.
