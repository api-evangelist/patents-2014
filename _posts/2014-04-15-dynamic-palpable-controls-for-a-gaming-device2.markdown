This application is a continuation in part of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 619 635 filed Nov. 16 2009 and U.S. application Ser. No. 13 285 823 filed Oct. 31 2011 and claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 812 636 filed Apr. 16 2013 which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The disclosure generally relates to player interface controls for gaming machines and more particularly to a system for improving player interfaces by augmenting a flat touch screen game control panel to provide palpable tangible features to an otherwise featureless surface.

Playing gaming machines is an enjoyable pastime for many people. Gaming machines include machines that are typically operated by a user by inserting coins tokens credit cards smart cards tickets or coupons with monetary value. The machines may include e.g. slot machines pinball machines video games and computer stations for playing games alone or with other users such as bingo card games and the like. The machines may operate based on both luck and the user s skill. Such gaming machines may be located in casinos video arcades gas stations bars or any other location. The gaming machines may be used for gambling where the user receives a monetary or other prize when the machine pays off or simply for amusement.

Historically electronic gaming wagering machines have provided players with user interfaces for placing bets and initiating game play that are composed of physical buttons. These buttons are typically composed of a spring and plunger mechanism that actuates an electronic switch. As technology has progressed the use of touch screens over the main video display has allowed players to interact with the wagering game by touching the video screen. In most cases these machines have retained the physical button panel and its array of push button switches.

More recently wagering machines have been introduced that use video display with a touch screen interface to replace the physical button panel. While this has enabled machines that are more configurable electronically it has done so at the expense of the player experience. Touch screen interfaces over video displays are built on flat substrates typically glass. As a result the player has no palpable reference point to locate graphic touch areas and must rely on visual location.

This can be a disadvantage since to make a visual reference the player must take their focus off the main gaming display and look at the button panel to ensure they are touching the correct area. In looking at the button panel they are taking their focus off the wagering game. This is something that is not a problem with traditional button panels since players have a raised physical button that they can use touch to maintain a reference point and do not need to take their focus off the main video display.

Accordingly there is a need for and the present disclosure provides a system to overcome the above limitations.

The present disclosure provides methods for incorporating palpable reference features onto a flat touch screen interface. These features may be configurable or static.

In one embodiment the touch screen incorporates a flat transparent or nearly transparent layer that contains a series of active elements actuators chambers that enable a vertical displacement of the touch screen top surface. These active elements displace the top surface of the touch screen upon command of the gaming machine to provide features perceptible to the player s touch. These features may take the form of but are not limited to button shapes button outlines reference lines demarcating regions or boundaries of the touch surface braille characters for the visually impaired and or figures game pieces characters

The disclosure further relates to machine readable media on which are stored embodiments of the present disclosure. It is contemplated that any media suitable for retrieving instructions is within the scope of the present disclosure. By way of example such media may take the form of magnetic optical or semiconductor media. The disclosure also relates to data structures that contain embodiments of the present disclosure and to the transmission of data structures containing embodiments of the present disclosure.

In one aspect there is provided a device with a button panel comprising a touch interface display including a flat surface and having structure enabling vertical displacement of the flat surface displaying one or more palpable buttons a processor in communication with said display at one of said touch screen interface and processor configured to change the configuration of at least one displayed palpable button in response to interaction between the user and the display.

Further advantages of the disclosure will be brought out in the following portions of the specification wherein the detailed description is for the purpose of fully disclosing the preferred embodiment of the disclosure without placing limitations thereon.

Persons of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description of the present disclosure is illustrative only and not in any way limiting. Other embodiments of the disclosure will readily suggest themselves to such skilled persons having the benefit of this disclosure.

In one or more embodiments the control deck may be an enhanced game interface system similar to a Bally iDeck that includes a display system a sensor system a feedback system and one or more computing systems disclosed in at least U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 619 635 entitled Gesture Enhanced Input Device filed Nov. 16 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

In accordance with one or more embodiments illustrates an example of a gaming machine control panel in which the touch screen actuator layer provides the ability to raise the flat touch screen surface in fixed or configurable areas a defined distance d to enable the player to locate the button on the panel through touch rather than visual search. The overlay actuator layer active areas may be left in a flat standard appearance and activated for selected events dynamic mode .

Alternately the features may be a static permanent feature of the deck surface. Such a feature may be the bounds of the deck active touch area. This is advantageous for interactive games where a player s success requires focus on the main game screen while interacting with the deck. In these games providing the player with a physical touch reference point s enhances game play and helps ensure the player maintains touch contact with the deck. The bounds of the deck may also be dynamic features enabling a player to focus on the main display and not lose orientation with the touch interface.

In accordance with one or more embodiments illustrates an example of incorporation of Braille or other physical raised icons on the touch surface to augment usability for player with low vision. With a player demographic including a large number of players over the age of 50 visual impairments may be common among players. Visual impairments as well as reduction in tactile dexterity may conspire to make flat touch interfaces more difficult to use vs. traditional mechanical buttons. Adding raised icons Braille characters and other raised physical reference features to the typically flat touch surface aids in player usability game play accuracy and enjoyment.

To further enhance the player experience haptic feedback either by use of the button raising actuator itself or other haptic actuator technology can be incorporated to provide additional player sensation and feedback. Additional enhancements can be made with visual and or audio feedback synchronized to the player s actions. These events may be used in conjunction with haptic feedback or as separate events or in any combination thereof.

In another embodiment the features may be used to provide touch feedback such as that of a rough surface or obstruction. For example in a driving game where players must stay on a road and not drive off the roadway the overlay may raise up to help the player maintain course.

The overlay may also be used to define the controls of the game such as a steering wheel outline. This provides the player with a physically present object that helps maintain proper touch alignment while they are focused on the main game screen.

The overlay layer active areas may be programmatically controller and interactive with game play or other events. Active areas may be defined as shapes such as rectangular bet buttons card suits spade heart club diamond or may be a matrix of programmable controllable elements allowing dynamic features to be represented.

Various technologies may be used to present game controls as described above such as electromagnetics fluid hydrodynamics or pneumatics. These elements may also be programmatically controlled to provide haptic feedback to the player via modulation. In some embodiments this can be synchronized with game video and or audio events.

Referring to and B electronic gaming machine is shown in accordance with one or more embodiments. Electronic gaming machine includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated circuit board PIB connected to player interface devices over bus lines . Printer is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . Base game integrated circuit board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system SMS and a casino management system CMS network over bus line . GMU also may connect to the SMS and CMS network over bus line . Speakers connect through audio mixer and bus lines to base game integrated circuit board and PIB . The proximity and biometric devices and circuitry may be installed by upgrading a commercially available PIB such as a Bally iView unit. Coding executed on base game integrated circuit board PIB and or GMU may be upgraded to integrate a game having adjustable multi part indicia as is more fully described herein.

Peripherals connect through i o board to base game integrated circuit board . For example a bill ticket acceptor is typically connected to a game input output board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU base game integrated circuit board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. 110 board may be connected to base game integrated circuit board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. Base game integrated circuit board executes a game program that causes base game integrated circuit board to play a game. In one embodiment the game program provides a slot machine game having adjustable multi part indicia. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming machine cabinet examples of which are described above.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of 110 board to base game integrated circuit board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via electromechanical or touch screen buttons. The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as a handle or touch screen icon including the icons described above with respect to the Bally iDeck . The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays. In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming machine for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Thereafter the player mayor may not interact with the game through electromechanical or touch screen buttons to change the displayed indicia. Finally base game integrated circuit board under control of the game program and OS compares the final display of indicia to a pay table. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering of a feature game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset base game integrated circuit board under control of the game program and by way of 110 Board may cause feature game play to be presented on a feature display.

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from base game integrated circuit board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via 110 board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In one embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the EGM are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the EGM using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player card information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the base game integrated circuit board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PIB includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output drivers for respective devices which connect to PIB such as player interface devices and which may further include various games or game components playable on PIB or playable on a connected network server and PIB is operable as the player interface. PIB connects to card reader through bus display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PIB such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PIB either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PIB . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PIB and operate together with display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PIB in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

Player interface devices are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming machine . The system components include the iView processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to install on the system components.

The system components include the iView processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iView can combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iView device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iView display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of base game integrated circuit board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the disclosure.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an base game integrated circuit board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 11 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for payout requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

In various embodiments any of the gaming machines may be a mechanical reel spinning slot machine or a video slot machine or a gaming machine offering one or more of the above described games including a group play game. Alternately gaming machines may provide a game with a simulated musical instrument interface as a primary or base game or as one of a set of multiple primary games selected for play by a random number generator. A gaming system of the type described above also allows a plurality of games in accordance with the various embodiments of the disclosure to be linked under the control of a group game server not shown for cooperative or competitive play in a particular area carousel casino or between casinos located in geographically separate areas. For example one or more examples of group games under control of a group game server are disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11 938 079 entitled Networked System and Method for Group Play Gaming filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

All or portions of the present disclosure may also be implemented or promoted by or through a system as suggested in . At is the gaming system of and B which may be hosted at a casino property enterprise across several casino enterprises or by a third party host. As described above the gaming system has a network communication bus providing for communication between the gaming terminals and various servers. To provide the functionality illustrated in a bonusing server such as a Bally Elite Bonusing Server is connected to the network communication bus and B for communication to the gaming system the gaming terminals and the various servers and other devices as described above. Through a secure network firewall the bonusing server is in communication with a cloud computing storage service which may be hosted by the casino enterprise a licensed third party or if permitted by gaming regulators an unlicensed provider. For example the cloud service may be as provided by Microsoft Private Cloud Solutions offered by Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash. USA. The cloud service provides various applications which can be accessed and delivered to for example personal computers portable computing devices such as computer tablets personal digital assistants PDAs and cellular devices such as telephones and smart phones. As but an example the cloud service may store and host an eWallet application casino or player centric applications such as downloadable or accessible applications including games promotional material or applications directed to and or affecting a casino customers interaction with a casino enterprise such as accessing the players casino account establishing casino credit or the like providing bonuses to players through system wide bonusing SMB or specific bonusing or comps to players or other applications. The cloud service includes security provide for secure communication with the cloud service between the player users and the cloud service and between the cloud service and the gaming system . Security applications may be through encryption the use of personal identification numbers PINS or other devices and systems. As suggested in the cloud service stores player user data retrieved from players users and from the gaming system .

The players users may access the cloud service and the applications and data provided thereby through the Internet or through broadband wireless cellular communication systems and any intervening sort range wireless communication such as WiFi. The players users may access the applications and data through various social media offerings such as Facebook Twitter Yelp MySpace LinkedIn or the like.

As but an example a player user may have a player account with a casino enterprise Z. That account may include data such as the player s credit level their rating and their available comps. The account may further track any certificates and the present value thereof the player may have won as a result of the playing a game according to the present disclosure. At their smart phone the player user sends a request to the clout service perhaps through a previously downloaded application to request the status of their available comps such as how many comp points they have and what may be available through redemption of those points e.g. lodging cash back meals or merchandise . The application for the request may present casino promotions graphics or other advertising to the player user. The application to support such a request would typically require the player user to enter a PIN. The cloud service forwards the inquiry to the bonusing servicer which in turn confirms the PIN and retrieves the requested information from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . Alternatively the data may be stored in the cloud service and routinely updated from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . In this instance the request would be responded to from data residing with the cloud service . The information is formatted by the cloud server application and delivered to the player user. The delivery may be formatted based upon the player user s device operating system OS display size or the like.

The cloud service may also host game applications to provide virtual instances of games for free promotional or where permitted P2P Pay to Play supported gaming.

Other media such as advertising notices such as an upcoming tournament may also be provided to the cloud service . When a player user accesses the cloud service certain media may be delivered to the player user in a manner formatted for their application and device.

Various further aspects can be used with the presently disclosed device and method. For example in one embodiment of a gesture enhanced input device a video based button deck can be provided for use in games on the Alpha II gaming platform including stepper based games video based games card based games e.g. black jack poker and the like and ticket based games e.g. keno bingo and the like . In various embodiments the display of the gesture enhanced input device is offered as an upgrade or a standard feature. A video based selection display of the gesture enhanced input device provides simplified set up and configuration as well as new game play offerings not supported by other panel. In one embodiment the gesture enhanced input device actually moves the virtual buttons to a player s present location on the touch enabled deck. In this regard the gesture enhanced input device is customizable to an individual player s needs includes button size shape location speed of play and the like. In one embodiment a gesture enhanced input device is configured to resize a virtual button deck to compensate for the height arm length hand size finger size and finger length of a player. In one such embodiment of the gesture enhanced input device aspects of the virtual button deck are resized based upon player performance of the game being played. The importance of the player e.g. gold club member and the like may also be used as criteria for resizing button deck characteristics and or adding or deleting various button deck functions or attributes.

In another aspect of the gesture enhanced input device the deck provides an expanded set of options to support advanced types of player input known as gestures. These gestures are generally defined as any input more than a single touch e.g. touching and sliding to spin a top box wheel turn a help pay table page and the like . The system for gesture support is easily extensible by game designer to adapt to new functionality.

Referring now to components of the gesture enhanced input device in one specific non limiting embodiment the deck is a hybrid design with the main portion of the panel including a touch screen capable LCD with a resolution of 1280 by 238 pixels. Preferably a two inch round physical button for SPIN REPEAT BET is mounted to the right of the panel in this non limiting embodiment. In this embodiment the physical button is included to provide tactile movement and button feel that players are accustomed to a physical button in order to aide in acceptance of this gesture enhanced input device in the field. In other embodiments only a touch screen capable LCD or other touch screen device is utilized without any type of physical button on the panel. The video screen functionality of the gesture enhanced input device enables a player to select a wager amount and lines played using touch screen capabilities rather than physical buttons.

With respect to game level control in one aspect of a preferred embodiment the gesture enhanced input device provides support for different button states depending upon player input. In one embodiment the button states include available inactive mouse finger over and selected. The available button state demonstrates that sufficient credits are available to allow this button selection. The inactive button state demonstrates that sufficient credits are not available to allow this selection. Referring now to the Mouse finger over button state if a patron touches and slides from one button to the next this activates the button selection but does not commit to the selection. If patrons slide over an inactive button a prompt appears explaining the button activation. Such instructions may include 1 If over an Inactive selection Add more credits to activate or 2 If over an Ante Bet Activates the bonus bet option. With respect to the selected button state a player must touch and release the button to select a wager. If a player is performing a mouse finger over action a second touch selects the option.

In still another aspect of the gesture enhanced input device a sound effect package is synced with button usage. In this regard the sound design incorporates both a mechanical button sound together with a chord based tonal range e.g. C major where lower frequency tones are used for lower bet amounts and higher tones for higher amounts .

Additionally one embodiment the gesture enhanced input device provides support for an Aloha Bet which is otherwise known as ALL IN or Bet All Credits with respect to reel games. In such an embodiment this option wagers as many credits as possible based upon the available credits in the machine when selected. Preferably this bet initially attempts to cover all lines at one credit. If sufficient credits are not available or if there are remaining credits the bet is increased by one credit per line evenly across all lines in line order until Max Bet is reached. If there are not sufficient credits to cover all available lines evenly the bet is distributed in pay line order until all available credits are exhausted or Max Bet is reached. At this point the reels are spun. Any residual credits are converted to a ticket and printed prior to spinning the reels.

Referring now to the customization functionality provided by the gesture enhanced input device in one embodiment dynamic fonts are utilized with buttons that are provided. In this regard multi language support is provided by the gesture enhanced input device to support current languages and character sets as well as for ease of localization. In another embodiment the gesture enhanced input device supports various panel configurations for human interface customizations. Additional buttons and functionality may be added as needed.

Referring now to an Easy Select Style desk is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. This configuration mimics the functionality found on the Easy Select button panel. Referring now to a traditional style desk is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. This configuration mimics the functionality of a traditional button panel. Referring now to an Ante bet desk is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. This configuration is designed to enable Ante bet wagering. Referring now to a Bonus Play Gestures and new game play desk is shown using the gesture enhanced input device. The performance of the panel should be substantially identical to the mechanical buttons. In this regard button performance should be instantaneous with no delay between input and action.

Another aspect of a gesture enhanced input device comprises a multi touch virtual button deck that includes a touch screen display in the place of game buttons with a haptic feedback response that registers when a selection has been made. The multi touch embodiment includes a similar display but employs a touch screen that has multi touch capabilities to enhance game play control. In one embodiment shown in the display is mounted so that the touch screen is flush with the game deck. Any function and or operation that is desired by the game requirements may be software coded to be provided by the multi touch display. Additionally the button configuration may be changed on the fly such as in the middle of a game in response to a player action a computer program action an operator action or combinations thereof.

Turning to a configuration for virtual buttons configured according t an embodiment the present disclosure. The touch screen of the user interface is shown in controlled to display a plurality of button icons and . Icons are displayed and controlled for the player to select the number of lines upon which to place a wager. As is known some gaming machines include multiple pay lines from one to R.sup.C where R number of rows and C number of columns in a R.times.C game matrix. Crouch U.S. Pat. No. 5 580 053 issued Dec. 3 1996 and titled Multi Line Gaming Machine the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference describes a basic multi line gaming machine. Each icon has displayed text indicating the number of pay lines which can be selected by touching the corresponding button icon . The row of button icons is directed to the function of selecting a wager bet amount. Again text is displayed associated with each icon to indicate the bet amount. As an example to wager 3 units on 4 pay lines the user would touch button icons and

Each button icon may be displayed in desired any shape. For purposes of this description each icon is shown as square. Each button icon as shown in and using button icon as an example defines a safe area and an unsafe area . The safe area is the area of the button icon surrounding the center and inboard of the perimeter to select the function e.g. selecting to wager 3 units. The unsafe area is the area between the button icon perimeter and the safe area which is not centered relative to the button icon . A touch in the unsafe area will still activate the function but also indicates a somewhat inaccurate touch inasmuch as it is not proximate the center of the button icon . For example a touch at is an inaccurate touch since it is not in the safe area . The one or more processors controlling the touch screen is configured to detect touches in both the safe and unsafe areas and to note the position of touches at least on the unsafe areas . In response to repeated touches in the unsafe area or a history of frequent touches in the unsafe area the processor is configured to change the configuration of the button icon such s to increase the size or a dimension of the button icon to reposition the safe area or increase its size or a dimension to render the formerly unsafe touches to fall with a reconfigured safe area as suggested in .

The re configuration of the button icons can be directed to reconfiguring the size or location of the button icons . B show the reconfiguration of one or more button icons based for example on the touch history of the player. For example the associated processor may sample the touch positions relative to the centers of the button icons and if a touch is in an unsafe area more ten touches out of twenty or other selected rate the processor would more or re configure the button icon to attempt to better the touch rate in the safe area . This process may continue throughout the player s play. In an embodiment of the present disclosure the button icon reconfiguration map may be stored at an account at a server associated with the player. Thus when a player is identified at a gaming device the reconfiguration may be instituted at the touch screen . From the instituted map the processor may continue to sample the touches to further refine and adapt the button icon shape and or position to the player s touches.

The button icons may be resized based on use. A preferred method for this automatic re arrangement process which sizes buttons inversely proportional to their use is now shown. First of all the total number of presses for each row of buttons on the virtual button deck and the grand total of all presses are computed. These totals are over the period of time being sampled say the last 1000 presses or previous hour. The pseudo code for this operation would be 

The array P would then contain totals for each row with the total button presses variable containing the grand total of presses for all buttons. In the example shown in there are two rows so P would contain a value for the first Play N Lines row and a value for the 2.sup.nd Bet row.

Then the updated heights of the rows of button icons are computed while ensuring that minimum and maximum heights are respected. The pseudo code for this operation would be 

Once the height of each row of buttons is computed the width of each individual button can be computed using a similar method. The pseudo code for this operation would be 

In the code above the horizontal and vertical separation distances are used to ensure that buttons are not directly adjacent to each other and thus limiting accidental presses.

It should be noted that the time period used for sampling presses for this algorithm and the other examples shown above such as moving the button deck in response to unsafe touches would preferably be restricted to play by a particular user so any significant idle time or an event such as the removal of a player tracking card would cause the touch screen to reset to its default configuration.

Advantageously by the use of player tracking systems the sample data could be re used across multiple player sessions so that a player could sit down at another gaming device at another time and find the player interface touch screen is automatically configured to the arrangement they are used to based upon their expected play.

In there is shown a logic diagram showing the reconfiguration described above. At the process is started and at the processor reads the coordinates of the player s touch on the touch screen . At the processor determines if the touch is within the perimeter of a defined button icon . If not at the processor is configured to generate a haptic feedback response indicating the touch is outside of a defined button icon . As shown in the haptic response may be a strong touch sensory vibration or the like. The haptic response may include sound with or without a touch sensory response. If the touch is within the perimeter of the button icon and in the safe area at the processor at generates a haptic feedback touch sensory and or sound at for example a minimal level to indicate to the player that the touch was in the safe area and at the function selection associated with the button icon is triggered. If on the other hand the touch was detected at in the unsafe area the processor determines at if the conditions set for reconfiguring the button icon and touch coordinates have been met i.e. ten of the last twenty touches have been in the unsafe area . If the conditions for reconfiguring the button icon and associated touch screen coordinates have not been met i.e. the touch was a stray misaligned touch at the function selection associated with the button icon is triggered without reconfiguration of the button. If at the conditions have been met at and buttons adjacent to the button icon touched may be moved or re sized such as reduced and the button touched is reconfigured such as by being enlarged so as to captured the touch location within the safe area of the reconfigured button. The processor reconfigures one or button icons as well as the associated touch and haptic feedback coordinates and safe and unsafe areas . At the function selection associated with the button icon is triggered. The process is finished at .

In and D there is shown another embodiment of the present disclosure. According to this embodiment the functions associated with two or more button icons may be combined into a single button icon. At the functions associated with the Play 3 button icon with the BET 1 button icon have been combined to define a combined button icon having the combined function of Play 3 Bet 1 . Similarly the functions previously associated with the Play 5 button icon with the Bet 5 button icon have been combined to defined a combined button icon having the combined function of Play 5 Bet 5 . Instead of touching button icons and to Play 3 Bet 1 the player need only to touch combined function button icon . Instead of touching button icons and to Play 5 Bet 5 the player need only touch combined function button icon . When button icons are combined the remaining button icons may be renamed revised to accommodate the new combined button icon. Button icons may be added or removed from the touch screen as well.

Combining the functions of associated with the button icons and may be done automatically by the processor based upon the player s selection history or may be done manually by selecting to combine button functions and then selecting the buttons to be combined or by a drag and drop functionality. For example if the player wants to combine the functions of Play 5 Lines and Bet 3 credits the player would touch the button icon bet 3 button icon and drag their finger to the Play 5 Lines button icon to combine the button functions. The button icon which is being dragged may be displayed in a ghost or semi transparent manner to indicate to the player that the button and its functionality are being dragged for combining. As stated above button combinations may be saved at the player s account for future application to another gaming device .

Further manual configuration could also be possible. In a player has activated a repeat window possibly by a configuration menu or may be by holding their finger down on the combined button being pointed to. The repeat window allows a player to set the gaming device to automatically play for a number of spins or even indefinitely. Once set pressing the combined button icon would initiate this number of spins in the example shown three games would be played. In the event that not enough credit was available to play for a certain number of games the options presented in the repeat window may be restricted. Optionally while the games were being played the display of the combined repeat button icon would be updated to reflect how many games were left. Players may be made aware of the existence of combined buttons by color scheme. For example the Play N Lines virtual buttons may be colored red the Bet N virtual buttons may be colored yellow and the combined virtual buttons may be diagonally split between 2 triangles of yellow and red or simply colored orange.

In and B an example video poker game is shown on a gaming machine main game display . Conventionally in video poker a player is dealt 5 cards and is then given a choice to hold or replace the 5 cards dealt. In the example shown a player has been dealt 3 Kings of spades hearts and clubs and two other cards 7 of diamonds and 3 of clubs . It is a feature of this disclosure that after a deal the displays on each virtual button icon would be updated to reflect the cards dealt. In the example shown this is represented by text e.g. Hold King Spades but it could also be a graphical icon representing the card. It is a further feature of this disclosure that a suggestion system would be employed to warn the player of a possible incorrect play. In the example shown it would be considered optimal strategy to hold the three King cards and re deal the remaining two cards. As the player presses each button icon to hold a card the display would respond haptically in an appropriate manner pressing any of the Hold King virtual button icons would generate a positive haptic or audio response from the virtual button deck whilst pressing to hold the 7 of diamonds or 3 of clubs would generate a negative haptic or audio response.

Furthermore the DRAW button may be highlighted in a red color until the player makes the optimal choices of cards to hold at which point it would turn green.

It s important to note that none of these features would prevent a player from overriding the optimum strategy the haptic audio and visual cues would only be suggestive to a player that they should consider changing their strategy.

In a virtual button touch display display is shown including a plurality of button icons . The button icons are substantially aligned with the corresponding fingertip positions of a player s hand . This makes it possible for a player for example to play a game without having to move their hand . It is a feature of the present disclosure that by use of the multi touch capability of the virtual touch screen display the five fingers of a hand may be detected and the button icons and associated touch screen coordinates and haptic feedback functionality described above may be located and configured. Preferably the processor is configured to detect multiple touches and calibrate the touch screen . A camera could be used as well to calibrate the touch screen without contact. The processor maps the button icons to the fingers of the player s hand and in the case of a video Poker game such as shown in places text associated with each button icon. A deal draw button not shown could also be placed for convenient touching by a player.

As can be appreciated the button icons could be reconfigured based upon player choice or his her historical pattern of touching as described above. Haptic reinforcement can be provided as well. Still further the text associated with any button icon may be in different languages or the button icon may display graphics to associate the button with a function or selection.
