The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to gun launched projectiles and in particular to apparatus and methods for obtaining consistent gun chamber pressure for gun launched projectiles.

It is known that the chamber pressure in a gun directly affects the velocity of a projectile. An accurate and consistent velocity requires an accurate and consistent chamber pressure. Some known methods for obtaining consistent chamber pressures include shot start rods and crimping.

A shot start rod connects the cartridge case to the projectile with grooves that are designed to break at a desired pressure. The shot start rod is secured lengthwise between the cartridge case and the projectile with a necked down section in the rod body. When the cartridge is ignited the necked down section of the rod will fail at a desired chamber pressure. Until the desired pressure is reached the rod holds the projectile in place in the gun tube. After the desired chamber pressure is reached the rod will break and the projectile will follow a normal interior projectile travel. A shot start rod adds weight to a weapon and decreases the size of the usable space in a weapon s chamber.

Crimping is common in larger ammunition and works by bending or crimping the outside shell of a cartridge case to the grooves on the projectile. Crimping has been used in 105 mm rounds. As with the shot start rod the crimp holds the projectile in place until the desired chamber pressure is reached. At that point the crimp fails and the projectile is released. The chamber pressures achieved with crimping can be inconsistent and difficult to quantify.

The lethality of a projectile is directly related to its velocity and its velocity is directly related to the gun chamber pressure. A need exists for an apparatus and method for obtaining accurate and consistent chamber pressure in a gun tube.

One aspect of the invention is a shot start ring for use with a projectile in a gun tube. The shot start ring includes an annular ring having a central longitudinal axis an axial width and a circumferential gap defined by two opposing ends of the ring. The ring includes first and second opposing faces lying in respective planes that are perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis. One of the faces has a groove formed therein. The groove extends around a complete circumference of the ring from one opposing end to the other opposing end. A plurality of notches are formed in a radially inner surface of the ring. Each notch extends completely across the axial width of the ring and radially inward to the groove.

Another aspect of the invention is an apparatus including a novel shot start ring and a sabot. The sabot may have a plurality of circumferential sections. Each section of the sabot includes a groove for the shot start ring. The apparatus may include a projectile. The sabot is disposed on an exterior surface of the projectile.

The apparatus may also include a gun tube having a groove extending completely around an interior circumference of the gun tube and lying in a plane normal to a longitudinal axis of the gun tube. The shot start ring may be partially disposed in the groove in the gun tube.

In another aspect the invention includes a method of obtaining consistent chamber pressure in a gun. The method includes providing a gun tube having a groove extending completely around an interior circumference of the gun tube and lying in a plane normal to a longitudinal axis of the gun tube. Further provided is a projectile and a sabot disposed around the projectile. The sabot includes a second groove extending completely around a circumference of the sabot. Additionally provided is a shot start ring. The shot start ring is placed in the second groove in the sabot. The projectile sabot and shot start ring are placed in the gun tube with the shot start ring being disposed partially in the groove in the gun tube and partially in the second groove in the sabot.

The method may include igniting propellant behind the projectile and then shearing the shot start ring along a third groove extending around a complete circumference of the shot start ring.

The method may include breaking the shot start ring into a plurality of pieces at notches formed in an inner surface of the ring.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

An apparatus and method to provide a consistent chamber pressure in gun tube includes a shot start ring . Prior to launch of projectile a portion of shot start ring is disposed in a groove formed in sabot sections and a portion of ring is disposed in a groove formed in the interior of gun tube . At a predetermined pressure ring fails or breaks and releases sabot sections and projectile . Ring may be made of for example steel.

Referring to shot start ring is an annular ring having a central longitudinal axis B and an axial width C . Ring does not form a complete circle. Ring includes a circumferential gap defined by two opposing ends . Ring includes first and second opposing faces lying in respective planes that are perpendicular to the central longitudinal axis B of ring .

Face has a groove formed therein. Groove may be generally V shaped. Groove extends around the complete circumference of the ring from one opposing end to the other opposing end . A plurality of notches are formed in the radially inner surface of the ring . Each notch extends completely across the axial width C of the ring and radially inward to the groove .

Notches maybe circumferentially equally spaced around the ring . Notches are spaced to correspond to the abutting edges of sabot sections . Thus the number of notches equals the number of sabot sections . In the embodiment shown in the Figs. the number of notches and sabot sections is three but other numbers may be used. To properly locate notches on ring with respect to the abutting edges of sabot sections a locating tab may be provided on ring . Locating tab may include one or more protrusions that extend from the radially inner surface of the ring . The locating tab may be disposed in a mating opening not shown in a sabot section . Alternatively openings may be formed in ring for receiving locating pins not shown that penetrate into sabot sections .

Referring to the area of minimum thickness of ring at the base of groove has an axial width D. Dimension D may be varied to alter the predetermined pressure at which ring will fail and projectile will be launched. Varying dimension D varies the depth of groove .

When the propellant is ignited pressure increases in gun tube . At a predetermined pressure ring will fail at groove as ring is pressed against the forward wall of gun tube groove and the forward wall of sabot groove . After failure of ring the radially outer portion of the ring disposed in the gun tube groove will remain in the gun tube groove . The radially inner portion of the ring disposed in the sabot groove will remain in the sabot groove and travel with the projectile .

In addition to failing circumferentially at groove . ring will also fail at the notches so that the portion of the ring that remains in the sabot grooves will be in a plurality of pieces. The plurality of pieces of ring enable the sabot sections to separate from the projectile after exiting the muzzle of the gun tube without being constrained by the remaining portion of the ring . In the embodiment shown in the Figs the number of notches is three so the radially inner portion of the ring will separate into four pieces. The presence of gap results in four pieces rather than three.

During testing the shot start ring held the projectile in place until the desired chamber pressure was reached. The ring then failed and the projectile exited the muzzle. In the first five to ten meters after muzzle exit the sabot sections discarded from the projectile providing verification that the ring had also failed at the notches .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
