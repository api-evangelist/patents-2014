This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14 023 056 filed Sep. 10 2013 which is a continuation of and claims priority to PCT US2012 053127 filed Aug. 30 2012 the content of which are incorporated by reference as if set forth in their entirety herein.

Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to natural language generation technologies and more particularly relate to a method apparatus and computer program product for situational analysis text generation.

In some examples a natural language generation NLG system is configured to transform raw input data that is expressed in a non linguistic format into a format that can be expressed linguistically such as through the use of natural language. For example raw input data may take the form of a value of a stock market index over time and as such the raw input data may include data that is suggestive of a time a duration a value and or the like. Therefore an NLG system may be configured to input the raw input data and output text that linguistically describes the value of the stock market index for example securities markets rose steadily through most of the morning before sliding downhill late in the day. 

Data that is input into a NLG system may be provided in for example a recurrent formal structure. The recurrent formal structure may comprise a plurality of individual fields and defined relationships between the plurality of individual fields. For example the input data may be contained in a spreadsheet or database presented in a tabulated log message or other defined structure encoded in a knowledge representation such as the resource description framework RDF triples that make up the Semantic Web and or the like. In some examples the data may include numerical content symbolic content or the like. Symbolic content may include but is not limited to alphanumeric and other non numeric character sequences in any character encoding used to represent arbitrary elements of information. In some examples the output of the NLG system is text in a natural language e.g. English Japanese or Swahili but may also be in the form of synthesized speech.

Methods apparatuses and computer program products are described herein that are configured to generate a situational analysis text. In some example embodiments a method is provided that comprises generating a set of messages based on one or more key events in a primary data channel and one or more significant events in one or more related data channels in response to an alert condition. The method of this embodiment may also include generating a situational analysis text based on the set of messages and the relationships between them. In some example embodiments the situational analysis text is configured to linguistically express the one or more key events the one or more significant events and the relationships between the one or more key events and the one or more significant events.

Example embodiments will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings in which some but not all embodiments are shown. Indeed the embodiments may take many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The terms data content information and similar terms may be used interchangeably according to some example embodiments to refer to data capable of being transmitted received operated on and or stored. Moreover the term exemplary as may be used herein is not provided to convey any qualitative assessment but instead merely to convey an illustration of an example. Thus use of any such terms should not be taken to limit the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present invention.

In many instances a user may be required to interpret data symbols or information in order to make a decision or otherwise gain an understanding of a current context a situation or an event. In order to make such a decision or to otherwise react to an event a user may need to obtain an awareness e.g. situational awareness of the current context the situation or the event before taking an action. Situational awareness may be defined as the perception of environmental elements with respect to time and or space the comprehension of their meaning and the projection of their status after some variable has changed such as time or based on the happening of an event such as an alarm or alert. In other words situational awareness is a state achieved when information that is qualitatively and quantitatively determined as suitable for a particular purpose is made available to a user by engaging them in an appropriate information exchange pattern or mental model. Situational awareness involves being aware of what is happening in the vicinity of a person or event to understand how information events and or one s own actions may impact goals and objectives both immediately and in the near future. Situational awareness may also be related to the perception of the environment critical to decision makers in complex dynamic areas from aviation air traffic control power plant operations military command and control engineering machine monitoring oil and gas power plant monitoring nuclear energy and emergency services such as firefighting and policing. The lack of or inadequate situational awareness has been identified as one of the primary factors in accidents attributed to human error.

Accurate mental models are one of the prerequisites for achieving situational awareness. A mental model can be described as a set of well defined highly organized yet dynamic knowledge structures developed over time from experience. As such in order to assist a user such as a decision maker in achieving situational awareness a situational analysis text may be generated as is described herein that when combined with a user s mental model may enable the user to achieve a level of situational awareness and or understanding. For example a doctor investigating an elevated heart rate may require a situational analysis text pertaining to related data e.g. blood pressure respiration rate or the like actions which could affect heart rate e.g. medication surgery or the like and or background information e.g. genetics medical conditions or the like . All of this information helps the doctor correctly interpret and ultimately diagnose heart rate data. In some cases the doctor may need dynamic as well as static information for example dynamic information such as how has the patient s heart rate changed in the past when a drug was administered and static information such as historical data related to a patient s conditions. Similarly in other domains a maintenance engineer needs situational awareness when trying to analyze a fault for a machine component out of a plurality of faults just as a soldier needs situational awareness when trying to interpret and react to battlefield data. In some cases without proper situational awareness a user will not trust or otherwise follow a recommendation provided by a user a computer a machine a subordinate or the like.

Further engineers technicians nurses and many other users in the modern world spend a great deal of time reacting to computer generated alarms alerts and other indications which result in a high false positive rate. In some cases the false positive rate may be over 99 . One extreme example may be found with respect to airport baggage screeners where most screeners never see a valid alert condition in their entire working career. Identifying rare events is a difficult thing for users to do well because the human brain is not well suited to dealing with this kind of situation. For example if a user has only ever seen or generally only sees certain alarms as false positives the user may have a tendency to assume that all future alarms will also be false positives. Such cases occur especially in instances in which operators deal with a large number of alarms and as such may only have a few minutes for each individual alarm. In some examples a level of validation of an alert along with situational analysis texts may provide situational awareness to a user as is described in some examples herein.

Consequently the example method apparatus and computer program product described herein is configured to produce situational analysis texts from one or more data channels to provide a user group of users or other operator with situational awareness of an event a current status a happening an alert condition or the like. As is described herein in some example embodiments an alert condition may be accessed or otherwise received from an alert source a monitoring system or by other alert detection methods. In response to the alert condition the method apparatus and computer product may select the data channel having the alert condition as the primary data channel. Further one or more related data channels may be indicated as related based on the alert condition a set of rules a domain model or the like. Patterns located in the primary data channel and or the one or more related data channels and the relationships between them may be used by the example method apparatus and computer program product to generate a situational analysis text. The situational analysis text is configured to provide in some example embodiments situational awareness related to the alert condition to the user.

Alternatively or additionally patterns located in the primary data channel and or the one or more related data channels and the relationships between them may be used by the example method apparatus and computer program product to determine whether the alert condition is a valid or invalid alert condition. In an instance in which the alert condition is determined to be valid a text may be generated that describes the reasons why the alert was deemed to be valid as well as contextual information related to the alert condition. In some cases a situational analysis text may be generated in an instance of a valid alert condition. In instances in which the alert condition is deemed to be invalid an invalid alert text may be generated that includes but is not limited to the reasons why the alert was deemed to be invalid as well as contextual information related to the alert condition. In some cases a situational analysis text may also be generated in an instance of an invalid alert condition.

In some example embodiments an alert reception system is configured to receive an indication of an alert condition e.g. an alert received from a source such as but not limited to another system a monitoring system or the like a violation of a constraint e.g. a data value over a threshold within a threshold for a period of time and or the like a user input or the like. The alert reception system may in some example embodiments be in data communication with an alert monitoring system machine monitoring systems alarm centers sensors and or the like. In examples in which the alert reception system is in communication with a monitoring system the alert reception system may receive a report that includes but is not limited to an identifier an identification of a machine or sensor that is experiencing the alert the type of alert a description a title and dates for maintenance requests related to the alert and or the date time group e.g. a set of characters usually in a prescribed format which may express the year the month the day of the month the hour of the day the minute of the hour and or the time zone for the alert. Other alert condition information may be received and or otherwise accessed in an alert database via an alert monitoring system. However in some example embodiments the methods apparatus and computer products described herein may operate without an alert reception system and or the alert reception system may be embodied by the data analysis system .

Alternatively or additionally the alert reception system may be further configured to determine whether the alert condition has been intermittently active in the period leading up to the notification time such as the notification time in a most recent alert condition. In some examples intermittent activity refers to an instance in which the alert has been cycling between on and off for a period of time. In some cases an off condition with respect to the intermittent alarm condition may be related to a threshold for example the threshold may identify a period in which the alert must be off or not active for a new alert to be generated instead of an intermittent alarm condition being triggered. The threshold may be determined based on the domain model and or may be indicated by a user as a global parameter. Alternatively or additionally the alert reception system may determine whether an alert validation was performed for a current alert condition or for a past alert condition such as by the alert validation system and if so the outcome of the alert validation.

Alternatively or additionally the alert reception system is further configured to gather information such as via raw input data historical data event log or the like on the history of an alert condition over a particular time period for example how often has the alert condition been triggered how long was the alert condition active or how often was the alert validated or not validated. In some examples the alert reception system may further identify if a maintenance request is currently pending for an alert condition and if so a current status of the maintenance request. Closed or completed maintenance requests may also be determined by the alert reception system . A time period used to search for historical information about the alert condition may be predetermined set by a user set according to a domain model and or the like. In some examples the time period may be configured to exclude intermittent alert condition activity as described herein.

Alternatively or additionally the alert reception system may further be configured to determine if there are other active alerts and maintenance requests on the unit or machine that triggered the alarm. For example a single machine may monitor heart rate blood pressure etc. and as such the alert reception system may be configured to check each sensor on a particular machine in this case a human body. Alternatively a machine may have a plurality of sensors that monitor temperature pressure vibrations or the like of various components of a machine and as such the alert reception system may be configured to check each one of the sensors for active alerts. The machine or unit definition e.g. components that belong to the machine or unit may be defined by a user the domain model or the like. In other example embodiments the alert reception system may also check if there are active alert conditions of the same alert type on other components units or machines. The alert reception system may further check if there are open maintenance requests on the components machines or the like.

Alternatively or additionally the alert reception system may further gather or otherwise access information and or data that refers to the status of a machine or unit having the alert condition. The information and or data includes but is not limited to the functionality of the machine or unit the most recent start or stop times maintenance times and or the like. For example the alert reception system may determine whether a machine or unit has been started or stopped in the last 24 hours.

In some example embodiments the data analysis system may comprise a data analyzer and or a data interpreter . The data analyzer is configured to input raw data such as the raw data contained in the raw input data historical data such as the historical data contain in the historical data and or other data determined or otherwise obtained by the alert reception system or the data analysis system . The receipt or input of the raw input data and or historical data may occur in response to an alert condition such as is indicated by or otherwise received via the alert reception system . Alternatively or additionally the data analyzer may be configured to receive or input raw input data continuously or semi continuously such as via a data stream and determine an importance of the raw input data e.g. whether the data violates a constraint satisfies a threshold and or the like in order to detect or otherwise determine the presence of an alert condition. In other words in some example embodiments the data analysis system the data analyzer and or the data interpreter may function as or otherwise embody the alert reception system and or an alert detection system.

Raw input data may include data such as but not limited to time series data that captures variations across time e.g. profits rainfall amounts temperature or the like spatial data that indicates variation across location e.g. rainfall in different regions or spatial temporal data that combines both time series data and spatial data e.g. rainfall across time in different geographical output areas . The raw input data contained or otherwise made accessible by the raw input data may be provided in the form of numeric values for specific parameters across time and space but the raw input data may also contain alphanumeric symbols such as the RDF notation used in the semantic web or as the content of database fields. The raw input data may be received from a plurality of sources and as such data received from each source sub source or data that is otherwise related may be grouped into or otherwise referred to as a data channel.

In some example embodiments the data analyzer is further configured to input historical data such as from historical data . Similar to the raw input data historical data stored on or otherwise made accessible via historical data may be provided in the form of numeric values for specific parameters across time and space. The historical data may also contain alphanumeric symbols such as the RDF notation used in the semantic web or as the content of database fields. The raw input data may be received from a plurality of sources and as such data received from each source sub source or data that is otherwise related may be grouped into or otherwise to referred to as a historical data channel. A historical data channel may include historical information relating to the current alert condition data in the primary data channel the one or more related data channels and or the like. In some cases the historical data may be related to the machine apparatus sensor device tool situation or the like that caused or is otherwise related to the alert condition. Alternatively or additionally the historical data may include additional historical data such as past events previous alert conditions contextual information about sensors machines and or the like.

In some example embodiments the data analyzer is configured to detect patterns and trends in the one or more data channels that are derived from the raw input data and or the historical data to provide a set of abstractions. For example a time series dataset may contain tens of thousands of individual records describing the temperature at various time points on a component piece of machinery over the course of a day with a sample once every two or three seconds. Trend analysis may then be used to identify that the temperature changes in a characteristic way throughout certain parts of the day. As such the trend analysis is configured to abstract those changes over time into an abstraction that is representative of the change over time.

In some example embodiments the data analyzer may be configured to fit a piecewise linear model to the data received in the primary data channel related data channel or the like. The fitting of the piecewise linear model may include filtering in some examples. For each trend in the raw input data the data analyzer may determine a start and or end time values qualitative direction e.g. up down steady qualitative stability e.g. stable unstable threshold status e.g. normal high low unknown at start end of trend and or the like . The data analyzer may be configured to perform the fitting of the piecewise linear model for one or more time scales for example over a short term e.g. 6 hours using the time of the alert condition to determine how the machine or unit was acting at the time the alert became active. A longer time period e.g. 2 months may also be analyzed. In some examples the longer time period may ignore equipment off periods and or the like.

In some example embodiments the data analyzer is further configured to determine a first or primary data channel. In some examples a first or primary data channel may be selected based on a selection by a user via a user interface may be selected based on the happening of a condition such as but not limited to an alert an alarm an anomaly a violation of a constraint a warning may be predetermined and or the like. In some cases the primary data channel is generally related to for example the raw input data and or data channel that caused the alert condition. In some example embodiments the data analyzer may also be configured to identify data channels e.g. secondary or related channels that are related to the primary data channel. Alternatively or additionally relations between data channels may be defined by the domain model and therefore accessible by the data analyzer .

In some example embodiments a secondary or related data channel is selected by the data analyzer . In other example cases a plurality of secondary or related data channels may be selected by the data analyzer . The one or more secondary or related data channels may be selected based on the detection of important anomalous unexpected or otherwise flagged behavior in the second or related channel. In some examples the second or related channel is compared to one or more patterns detected in the primary data channel over a similar or related time period. For example a first data channel may indicate a rise in heart rate whereas a second data channel may indicate a stable or even a decline in respiration rate. Generally a medical professional may expect a respiration rate to rise along with heart rate and as such a stable respiration rate when heart rate is rising is generally unexpected. In some examples unexpected behavior may lead to a life threatening condition be indicative of a dangerous condition or the like. Alternatively or additionally a plurality of related channels may also be considered for example oxygen levels blood pressure and or the like.

Relationships between data channels may be defined as important or unexpected or may represent anomalous behavior as defined by a qualitative model such as the domain model . In some examples the domain model is a representation of information about a particular domain. For example a domain model may contain an ontology that specifies the kinds of objects concepts and or the like that may exist in the domain in concrete or abstract form properties that may be predicated of the objects concepts and the like relationships that may hold between the objects concepts and the like and representations of any specific knowledge that is required to function in the particular domain. In some cases the domain model represents the mental model used for situational awareness in a particular domain. In some examples multiple domain models may be provided for a single domain. For example domains may include but are not limited to medical oil and gas logistics news and reporting industrial power weather legal financial nuclear and or the like.

In some examples relationships may be defined with respect to one or more sensors sensor types monitoring equipment or the like. For example an alert on a first sensor may have a relationship with another sensor on the same machine or on other related machines. The relationship may further include an indication that the related sensor generally detects movement in the same direction as the primary sensor or that the related sensor generally moves in an opposite direction from the primary sensor. An importance level may be also be assigned to a particular sensor such as by a user the domain model or the like. In some examples this importance level may be used to determine an importance of a particular sensor event. In some cases one or more sensors may be indicated as always to be included in a text.

Alternatively or additionally a diagnostic model may be configured to determine or otherwise identify one or more possible causes of an alert condition see e.g. . Based on the one or more possible causes of the alert condition the diagnostic model may be further configured to determine which of the one or more data channels should be examined to verify and or disprove the one or more possible causes. These data channels may be related data channels. For example the diagnosis model may identify allergic reaction to medication as one reason for a spike in heart rate. It may also determine that if allergic reaction is suspected a respiration rate data channel should be examined to verify and or disprove this diagnosis because respiration rate would become erratic if the underlying cause was allergic reaction. As such in this example respiration rate may be identified as a related data channel.

Alternatively or additionally the method apparatus and computer program product described herein may further provide and or otherwise access a rule language that is configured to qualitatively specify expected relationships between data channels e.g. a primary data channel and one or more related data channels . The rule language may further be configured to specify or otherwise indicate instances in which related data channels related events and or the like are mentioned in a situation analysis text. In some examples the rules may be built via a user interface using the rule language that may extract or otherwise receive information related to the data channels and the relationships between them. In some cases the data channels and or relationships may be discovered by analyzing one or more data sources. The rule language may further provide information related to the context of one or more data channels and alerts that may be generated or accessed based on those data channels for example equipment status alert history and status of similar equipment elsewhere.

The data analyzer may then identify trends spikes steps or other patterns in the data channels to generate abstractions that summarize the patterns determined in the primary data channel and or the other related data channels. Alternatively or additionally the data analyzer may also be configured to perform pattern detection on the raw input data irrespective of data channels or the receipt of an alarm condition.

In some example embodiments a contextual channel may also be selected by the alert reception system the data analysis system the data analyzer or the like. A contextual channel is a data channel that provides a background or circumstance that led to or otherwise influenced the one or more key events and or the one or more significant events e.g. a patient is 43 years old and male or information on a type of sensor that detected the alert condition . For example a contextual channel may indicate an event such as a medical treatment that was applied at the time of or just prior to the rise of the heartbeat and the fall or steady state of the respiration rate. Alternatively or additionally a plurality of data channels may also be included based on an anomaly or unexpected behavior. In some examples one or more data channels may be selected even though the one or more data channels are representative of expected behavior. For example in the medical domain a medical professional may expect to see a description of both heart rate and respiration rate in a text even if both are behaving in expected ways since expected behavior may be indicative of an important result namely a clean bill of health.

In yet further example embodiments events may also be determined by the alert reception system the data analysis system the data analyzer or the like. For example in the medical profession an event may be the application or injection of some medication whereas in the machinery domain an event may be the startup of a particular machine. An event may be described in a contextual channel may be entered into an event log such as event log e.g. an explicit listing of events that is input with the raw input data may be detected within a data channel e.g. application of a medication received via an IV line data channel and or may be inferred based on the raw input data e.g. alert occurred shortly after startup .

Alternatively or additionally the data analysis system the data analyzer or the like may be configured to determine one or more problems or inconsistencies with the raw input data historical data or other data input in the data analysis system . In some cases the data problems may be in the raw input data however in other cases the data problems may be a result of a communications error. In some examples the data analyzer may detect missing data in an instance in which data was not received over a predetermined duration e.g. exceeds the time in which values are reported . In other examples a sensor s values may not have changed over a predetermined period before an alert condition was indicated such a case may indicate a frozen data condition. Frozen data may be identified in an instance in which a machine or unit is determined to be running during a period e.g. based on a determined equipment status the sensors are float valued and or the sensor is not excluded from the frozen check. In other examples raw input data may be checked to determine if the values fall outside those physically possible e.g. temperatures that would cause melting . Other verification may include error tokens inconsistent values and or the like.

A data interpreter such as data interpreter may then be configured to input the abstractions and generate one or more messages based on a determined importance level and or relationships between the abstractions identified in the one or more data channels e.g. primary data channel one or more related data channels historical data channels and or the like . The one or more messages may be generated based on a domain model a requirements analysis a corpus analysis and or the like. The one or more messages may then be populated or otherwise instantiated based on data or information in the primary data channel the one or more related data channels the historical data the contextual channel one or more events and or the like.

In some examples messages are language independent data structures that correspond to informational elements in a text and or collect together underling data in such a way that the underlying data can be linguistically expressed. In some examples messages are created based on a requirements analysis as to what is to be communicated for a particular scenario e.g. for a particular domain . A message typically corresponds to a fact about the underlying data for example the existence of some observed event that could be expressed via a simple sentence although it may ultimately be realized by some other linguistic means . For example to linguistically describe wind a user may want to know a speed a direction a time period or the like but also the user wants to know changes in speed over time warm or cold fronts geographic areas and or the like. In some cases users do not even want to know wind speed they simply want an indication of a dangerous wind condition. Thus a message related to wind speed may include fields to be populated by data related to the speed direction time period or the like and may have other fields related to different time points front information or the like. The mere fact that wind exists may be found in the data but to linguistically describe light wind or gusts different data interpretation must be undertaken as is described herein.

In some examples a message is created by the data interpreter in an instance in which the raw input data or the historical data warrants the construction of such a message. For example a wind message would only be constructed in an instance in which wind data was present in the raw input data. Alternatively or additionally while messages may correspond directly to observations taken from the raw data input others however may be derived from the observations by means of a process of inference. For example the presence of rain may be indicative of other conditions such as the potential for snow at some temperatures. Alternatively or additionally in some example embodiments the natural language generation system may embody all or portions of the data analysis system the data analyzer and or the data interpreter . In some example embodiments the natural language generation system may be configured to instantiate messages.

The concepts and relationships that make up messages may be drawn by the data interpreter from an ontology e.g. a domain model that formally represents knowledge about the application scenario. For example message structures may be defined by the domain model based on a particular alert condition and or the raw input data such as but not limited to the primary and or related data channels. Messages may also be derived from another data structure may be user defined and or the like. Each type of message may also be represented by a message template which expresses a relationship between instances of a number of concepts the message template contains slots which may be filled in or instantiated using particular values that are derived from the raw input data.

As such the data interpreter is configured to instantiate a plurality of messages based on the raw input data derived from the key events the significant events the primary data channel the one or more related data channels the historical data the events the contextual channel and or the like. In order to determine the one or more messages the importance level of each of the messages and relationships between the messages the data interpreter may be configured to access the domain model directly or indirectly via the data analyzer or the like. The domain model may contain information related to a particular domain or industry. In some examples the domain model may provide importance levels single data channel limits related to normal behaviors in a domain e.g. normal ranges information related to anomalous behaviors and or the like. In other examples the domain model may describe relationships between various events and or phenomena in multiple data channels. For example in a weather domain a domain model may indicate or otherwise instantiate an extreme weather message in an instance in which wind speeds that are related to hurricane type events or temperatures that may cause harm to humans or other animals or may cause damage or interference to shipping are present in the data. The extreme weather message may then be labeled as important whereas typical temperatures or a typical wind message may not be marked as important in some examples. Alternatively or additionally the domain model may be configured to contain or otherwise have access to the diagnostic model.

In some example embodiments the data interpreter may be configured to annotate messages with an indication of their relative importance this information can be used in subsequent processing steps or by the natural language generation system to make decisions about which information should be conveyed and which information may be suppressed such as by using the domain model . The data interpreter may assign an importance level to the one or more messages based on the pattern itself e.g. magnitude duration rate of change or the like defined constraints e.g. defined thresholds constraints or tolerances temporal relationships between the pattern in the primary data channel and patterns in other related data channels and or the like. For example a heart rate over 170 beats per minute or 100 mile per hour winds may be assigned a high level of importance. In some examples messages that describe other patterns and or constraints may be defined by the domain model . Alternatively or additionally the data interpreter may also be configured to annotate messages with information about how they are related to each other for example the data interpreter might indicate that an event described in one message is assumed to have been caused by the event described in another message.

Using the importance level the data interpreter may assign certain ones of the messages that describe or are otherwise are instantiated with patterns or other data in the primary data channel as including key events. A key event may be selected or otherwise identified based on a pre determined importance level threshold such as a threshold defined by a user a constraint defined by the domain model or the like. Alternatively or additionally key events may be selected or otherwise identified based on those patterns in the primary data channel with the highest level of importance those patterns that exceed or otherwise satisfy the pre determined importance level threshold and or the like. For example a domain model or user preference may indicate that any messages having wind readings over 50 miles per hour may be designated as key events whereas in other examples only a message with highest wind reading over a defined time period may be a determined to include a key event. In further examples the importance level determination may be performed over a plurality of time scales that may be user defined defined by the domain model or the like e.g. one hour one day one week one month and or the like .

In some example embodiments the data interpreter may also be configured to determine the importance of messages that describe patterns or events detected in one or more secondary or related data channels. In some examples the data interpreter may determine one or more messages that describe patterns or events in the related data channels that overlap time wise or occur within the same time period as the patterns in the primary data channel. For example during the same time period as rain is detected another data channel may detect temperature falling below the freezing point. The data interpreter may then mark the one or more messages that describe patterns or events in the related channels as important expected unexpected or as having or not having some other property based on the domain model . For example the domain model may suggest that the one or more patterns in the related data channel were expected to rise as they did in the primary channel. By way of example as winds are rising a wave height may then be expected to rise. In other cases the behavior of the one or more related channels may be unexpected or may be anomalous when compared to the behavior of the primary data channel.

The one or more messages may be marked as including significant events based on the importance level domain model constraints user settings or the like. For example messages that include patterns or events in the related data channel that have an importance level above a predetermined threshold defined by the domain model a user or the like and may be marked as including significant events. In some example embodiments messages including unexpected patterns or messages may also be categorized as significant events as they are suggestive of a particular condition or fault. Other messages including patterns or events may be determined to be significant events based on one or more constraints on channel value e.g. expected range of values or the like data anomalies patterns marked as neither expected or unexpected that satisfy an importance level and or the like.

In some example embodiments the data interpreter may also be configured to determine the importance of messages built or otherwise instantiated using historical data such as historical data background information event data and or the like. For example historical data may contain information related to a previous alert condition and the actions taken or a result. Historical data may also provide indicators of the validity of an alert and or provide additional information that may provide additional situational awareness.

In further example embodiments the data interpreter may be configured to generate one or more messages based on determined or otherwise inferred events from the one or more data channels historical data event data and or the like. Events may include specific activities that may influence the one or more key events and or may have caused the one or more significant events. In some examples the one or more events may be inferred based in context with the one or more patterns in the primary and or related data channels. Alternatively or additionally events may be provided as a separate channel such as a contextual channel in the raw input data the event log or may be provided directly to the data interpreter . Alternatively or additionally one or more messages may be generated based on the contextual channel.

In some examples the data analysis system the data analyzer or the like may receive raw input data such as the data in the following table that illustrates a primary data channel e.g. heart rate and a related data channel e.g. respiration rate 

As is demonstrated by the raw input data in the table above heart rate went above 115 beats per minute bpm at time point 13 thus causing an alert condition. As such the alert reception system the data analysis system and or the like may receive an indication of an alarm condition such as by a patient monitoring system patient monitoring equipment and or based on the determination by the data analysis system that the data indicates an alert situation. In response to the alert condition the data analyzer may cause the heart rate data channel to be the primary data channel. In other embodiments a user the domain model or the like may indicate that the primary data channel is the heart rate data channel. In some example embodiments the data analyzer may abstract or otherwise identify the rapid change of heart rate between time point 10 and time point 11 lasting to time point 15 for use by the data interpreter .

The data analyzer may also determine whether a secondary or related data channel e.g. respiration rate has a pattern e.g. no change when a change is generally expected in a corresponding time period. In some examples the corresponding time period may be the same time period or may be a later time period when compared to the time period of the key events. Further the corresponding time period may in some examples be defined by a domain model such as domain model . In some example embodiments the data analyzer may abstract or otherwise identify the relatively flat and or steady respiration rate between time point 10 and time point 15 for use by the data interpreter .

In some example embodiments the data interpreter is configured to generate one or more messages based on the raw input data in the one or more data channels. As described herein messages are language independent data structures that correspond to informational elements in a text and or collect together underlying data in such a way that the underlying data can be linguistically expressed. Using the heart rate example a message may include portions of the raw input data to include abstractions of the data but may also include additional distinctions necessary for the generation of text as the raw input data is likely to be insufficient for such a purpose. For example a HeartRateSpike message may be instantiated using the raw input data and such a message may include a time and relative variation in terms of heart rate change or peak heart rate a time period and a direction. In some examples another message may be generated on related channels historic data events and or the like. In some examples the HeartRateSpike message may be related to an Alert Message that contains information relating to the alert itself. For example in an instance in which caffeine was applied prior to the heart rate spike a message may be generated to identify such an event. Such a message may be an Event message that is instantiated with an event time and an event description such as from the event log for example a message that indicates that caffeine had been orally administered prior to the spike in heart rate. Other messages such as RespirationRate e.g. respiration rate stable yes HeartRateAlertHistorical e.g. previous alert condition quantity 2 time yesterday HeartRateHistorical e.g. heart rate trend no change time period 10 days may be instantiated to include information about the related data channels and or historical data. Alternatively or additionally the natural language generation system the document planner and or the like may be configured to generate the one or more messages.

In some example embodiments an alert validation system is configured to determine the validity of a current alert condition based on the one or more messages received from the data analysis system the raw input data the historical data and or the domain model . In some example embodiments alert validation may be determined based on the length an alert has been intermittently on in an instance the alert is intermittent open maintenance requests based on the alert other alarms on the same machine or unit active alert conditions on other units duration of the alert condition sensor providing input data that is trending up down steady detection of unexpected behavior data errors and or the like.

In some examples the alert validation system may use machine learning to determine the validity of an alert e.g. building a decision tree based on a domain model and historical alert validation data . As such using for example a decision tree the alert validation system may be configured to determine the validity of the alert condition. In other examples an alert may be determined to be invalid by the alert validation system in an instance in which there are data problems with a sensor or the machine that the sensor is monitoring is off or other otherwise not functioning. In an instance in which a current maintenance request is identified the current alert condition may be merged with said current maintenance request.

In some example embodiments the alert validation system may generate additional messages for use by the natural language generation system in generating an alert validation text. As such these messages may include data relating to contextual information such as the key events significant events historical data and or the like. For example context information may include data that would enable a decision maker to make a decision or understand a current situation information to be used by a mental model e.g. to satisfy a user s internal list of items to check when validating an alert information that enables a user to override a decision and or the like.

In some example embodiments a natural language generation system such as natural language generation system is configured to generate phrases sentences text or the like which may take the form of natural language text. The natural language generation system comprises a document planner a microplanner and or a realizer . Other natural language generation systems may be used in some example embodiments such as a natural language generation system as described in Building Natural Language Generation Systems by Ehud Reiter and Robert Dale Cambridge University Press 2000 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.

The document planner is configured to input the one or more messages that are generated and or instantiated by the data analysis system . The document planner is further configured to determine how to arrange those messages to describe the patterns in the one or more data channels derived from the raw input data. The document planner may comprise a content determination process that is configured to select the messages such as the messages that describe the key events and or the significant events that are be included in a situational analysis text and or an alert validation text.

The document planner may also comprise a structuring process that determines the order of messages referring to the key events and or significant events to be included in a natural language text. In some example embodiments the document planner may access one or more text schemas for the purposes of content determination and document structuring. A text schema is a rule set that defines the order in which a number of messages are to be presented in a document. For example an event message e.g. medication injection may be described prior to a key event message e.g. rise in heart rate . In other examples a significant event message e.g. falling respiration rate may be described after but in relation to a key event message e.g. rise in heart rate . By way of further example a document plan may include but is not limited to an AlertMessage a HeartRateSpike message and then a RespirationRate message. An Event message HeartRateAlertHistorical message and HeartRateHistorical message may then follow in the example document plan.

The output of the document planner may be a tree structured object or other data structure that is referred to as a document plan. In an instance in which a tree structured object is chosen for the document plan the leaf nodes of the tree may contain the messages and the intermediate nodes of the tree structure object may be configured to indicate how the subordinate nodes are related e.g. elaboration consequence contrast and or the like to each other.

In some example embodiments the document planner may be configured for generation of alert validation texts. As such the document planner may include an example paragraph containing one or more of an alert information message e.g. alert name unit time an intermittent alert message in an instance in which an alert has been on intermittently e.g. start time and or an intermittent validation summary message in an instance in which the alert has been on intermittently and alert validation has been completed such as by the data analysis system e.g. number of times validated number of times not validated .

In further examples the document planner may also be configured to generate an example paragraph relating to the behavior of the sensor via the raw input data. This paragraph may include but is not limited to messages related to data problems if there are data problems messages related to primary trends in the form of key events and or a machine status message e.g. on off on duration multiple starts or the like . In an instance in which the document planner is configured to provide a recommendation one or more recommendation messages and or explanations may be included by the document planner .

Alternatively or additionally the document planner may further include one or more of a concurrent alerts summary in an instance in which there are similar alerts on related units a similar alert summary active maintenance request messages in an instance in which there are active maintenance requests for this alert condition on the machine e.g. number status and related maintenance request messages in an instance in which there are active maintenance requests for this alert condition on related units a data problems message and or previous history messages.

In some example embodiments a situational analysis text document plan may be included with generated in addition to or include some or all of the alert validation text described herein. In some example embodiments the document plan for a situational analysis text may include but is not limited to messages describing a key event in the primary data channel key event of a paired sensor e.g. sensors monitoring the same component messages related to a machine startup in an instance in which the key event is related to the start of a machine messages related to related data channels with an importance level exceeding a threshold e.g. significant messages sorted based on direction paired sensors sensor type or the like messages related to unexpected behavior e.g. significant events also based on direction paired sensors sensor type or the like and or other messages related to events e.g. an event summary related channels historical information and or the like. A situational analysis text may further include messages as described herein for each time duration included.

In further example embodiments a situational analysis text and or an alert validation text may include a recommendation with a supporting explanation. For example a recommendation may include a recommendation to create a maintenance service on a particular piece of machinery and the supporting explanation may include but is not limited to describing via text that there are no current maintenance requests for a particular machine as well as describing that previous alert conditions similar to a current alert condition resulted in a need for a maintenance request. Other recommendations such as future actions recommended investigations and or the like may be provided via text with an explanation or data to support or otherwise provide context for the recommendation. Alternatively or additionally the recommendation may take the form of a diagnosis of the alert condition. In such cases a situational analysis text may include the diagnosis based on a diagnostic model one or more possible causes and or an explanation of the diagnosis.

A sample document plan may include but is not limited to document plan of . Document plan may include but is not limited to one or more messages such as message .

The microplanner is configured to modify the document plan from the document planner such that the document plan may be expressed in natural language. In some example embodiments the microplanner may perform aggregation lexicalization and referring expression generation. In some examples aggregation includes but is not limited to determining whether two or more messages can be combined together linguistically to produce a more complex sentence. For example one or more key events may be aggregated so that both of the key events can be described by a single sentence. For example the alert information message and the HeartRateSpike message may be combined using the term because .

In some examples lexicalization includes but is not limited to choosing particular words for the expression of concepts and relations. For example the phrase sounded an alarm may be used to describe an alert condition or administered may be used to describe the causal event. Other descriptive phrases such as respiration rate may be determined to describe one or more related channels.

In some examples referring expression generation includes but is not limited to choosing how to refer to an entity so that it can be unambiguously identified by the reader. For example in a first sentence John Smith and a heart rate alarm may be used where he or it may be used in subsequent sentences.

The output of the microplanner in some example embodiments is a tree structured text specification whose leaf nodes are phrase specifications and whose internal nodes express rhetorical relations between the leaf nodes. A tree structured text specification may include but is not limited to text specification of having one or more phrase specifications such as phrase specification . A phrase specification may correspond to a sentence or a sub sentence fragment e.g. a title and are produced from one or more messages. A phrase specification is configured to contain one or more syntactic constituents e.g. subject verb prepositional phrase and or the like and one or more syntactic features e.g. tense .

A realizer is configured to traverse the tree structured text specification to express the tree structured text specification in natural language. The realization process that is applied to each phrase specification in a text specification makes use of a grammar which specifies the valid syntactic structures in the language and further provides a way of mapping from text specifications into the corresponding natural language sentences. The output of the process is in some example embodiments a well formed natural language text. In some examples the natural language text may include embedded mark up. The output of the realizer in some example embodiments is the alert validation text. The realizer may also output situational analysis text or a narrative that is configured to describe or otherwise summarize the one or more key events the one or more significant events the one or more contextual channels and or the one or more events.

By way of example the realizer may output the following text in response to the text specification shown above 

Alternatively or additionally the natural language generation system may be configured to generate a graph to display one or more key events that are detected in a data channel. In some example embodiments the graph may also include one or more significant events in one or more related channels and or events. In further examples a time period or duration of the data shown in the graph may be selected such that the displayed graph illustrates the portion of the data channel that contains the one or more key events. The output graph is further configured to include textual annotations that provide a textual comment phrase or otherwise is configured to explain using text the one or more key events the one or more significant events and or the events in a contextual channel in natural language. In further examples the textual annotations are generated from the raw input data and further are designed in some examples to textually describe identified patterns anomalies and or the context of the graph. In some examples a narrative e.g. situational analysis text may be included with the graph that provides situational awareness or an overview of the data patterns displayed on and or off of the graph.

As is described herein the machines and the components and or the sensors may be defined in terms of relationships. For example sensor may be related to sensor with a relationship defined as the data generated by sensor moves in the opposite direction of sensor e.g. is falling and is rising . Other relationships such as a relation between sensor and may also be defined in some example embodiments. Each of the relationships may be given an importance and or otherwise may be weighted based on the importance level of the relationship between the sensors such as and components and and or the like. Relationship and importance may be determined for each machine component sub component sensor and or the like. Metadata and or an ontology may also be specified that includes a linguistic description or title for each component sub component or the like.

By way of example the data analysis system may perform one or more of the following in an instance in which an alarm condition is detected with respect to sensor . In some examples the data analysis system may determine whether the alert condition is an intermittent alert condition by determining the last active alert for sensor . In further examples the data analysis system may determine the alert history and or maintenance history for the sensor the component and the machine . Such historical information may be used to validate the alert condition and or for the purposes of generating a situational analysis text. Current event information may be determined for the machine and or the components and that includes but is not limited to current status last startup time and or the like.

The data analysis system may then check for active alerts and or maintenance requests on the same equipment such as with respect to sensor component and or machine . The data analysis system may also check for active alerts and or maintenance requests on a related machine such as machine and or related components such as components and . The data analysis system may then analyze the data received via sensors as is described with respect to .
