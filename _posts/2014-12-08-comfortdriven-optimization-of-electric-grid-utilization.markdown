The present invention is in the field of energy management and in particular in the area of market oriented energy distribution using smart grids. Yet more particularly the present invention pertains to systems for the active management and trading of energy related securities and resources via energy exchange markets and the utilization of energy market information in the adjustment of connected systems and devices with a focus on perceived comfort levels for building inhabitants or other affected users.

While a robust electric power grid is widely recognized as a vital infrastructure component of a developed economy technological progress in the field of electricity grid systems has not kept up with the pace of other important technological fields such as telecommunications. Most of the electric grid infrastructure has been in place for decades and the basic architecture conceived by Thomas Edison and enhanced by the likes of George Westinghouse and Samuel Insull still prevails. Additionally the current regulatory scheme in the United States discourages large scale investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure with the unfortunate result that the grid is often running near capacity.

A number of techniques have been devised to assist in maintaining grid stability during times of high stress which normally means peak usage hours but also includes periods during normal usage when part of the grid goes offline thus reducing the effective capacity of the grid or a region of it. It is commonplace for peaking generators often operated by independent power producers to be placed online at peak periods to give the grid greater capacity since periods of high demand tend to lead to high wholesale power prices the business model of peaking generator operators is premised on operating their generators only when the price that can be obtained is high. Large utilities desiring to avoid the use of high priced peaking generators when possible also routinely participate in demand response programs. In these programs arrangements are made by independent third parties with large commercial industrial or institutional users of power to give control to the third parties over certain electric loads belonging to large users. These third parties make complementary arrangements with electric utilities to provide negative load during peak periods on demand by shedding some portion of the loads under their control when requested by the utility. Typically the cost to the utility of paying these aggregators of negawatts negative megawatts or negative load available on demand is much less than the corresponding costs the utilities pay to peak generators for actual megawatts. That is the utilities pay for dispatchable load reduction instead of for dispatchable peak generation and they do so at a lower rate. This arrangement is attractive to the utilities not only because of the immediate price arbitrage opportunity it presents but also because by implementing demand reduction the utilities are often able to defer expensive capital improvements which might otherwise be necessary to increase the capacity of the grid.

A problem with the current state of the art in demand reduction is that it is only practical in the art to incorporate very large users in demand reduction programs. Large commercial and industrial users of electricity tend to use far more power on a per user basis than small commercial and residential users so they have both the motive large savings and the means experienced facilities management to take advantage of the financial rewards offered by participation in demand management programs. Additionally large users of electricity already are accustomed to paying a price for power that depends on market conditions and varies throughout the day and they often have already invested in advanced building automation systems to help reduce the cost of electricity by conserving.

Unfortunately a large portion roughly 33 of the electric power used during peak periods goes to small users who do not normally participate in demand management. These users often are unaware of their energy usage habits and they rarely pay for electricity at varying rates. Rather they pay a price per unit of electricity used that is tightly regulated and fixed. Partly this is due to the fact that the large majority of small businesses and homes do not have smart meters the amount of power used by these consumers of electricity is measured only once per month and thus there is no way to charge an interval price typically pricing is set at intervals of 15 minutes when interval pricing is in effect that varies based on market conditions. Furthermore the loads in the homes and businesses of small electricity users are invisible to the utilities it is generally not possible for utilities to see much less to control loads in homes and small businesses. Loads here refers to anything that uses electricity including but not limited to lighting heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC hot water white goods large appliances such as washers driers refrigerators and the like hot tubs computers and so forth.

One approach in the art to improving the situation with small users is to install smart meters at homes small businesses. While the primary motivation for doing so is to enable interval based usage measurement and the communication of interval based prices to the users it is also possible to provide the consumer with much more information on how she uses energy than was possible without a smart meter. Given this granular usage information utilities and some third parties also hope to be able to send signals either via pricing or code red messages which ask consumers to turn off unnecessary loads due to grid constraints or both. In some cases third parties seek to provide visibility and control to utilities so that when consumers allow it the utilities can turn loads off during peak demand to manage the peak. A related method involves the use of gateway devices to access a consumer s again referring to residences businesses and institutions home area networks HAN to communicate with or turn off local devices.

It is a disadvantage of the techniques known in the art that the consumers and small businesses are not in general provided with any substantial financial incentives to participate in demand reduction programs other than merely by saving because they use less power . The virtual power provider generally sells negawatts as previously described by aggregating demand response capability of many small users and selling demand response services to the utility. This method similarly discourages consumer participation because the majority of the financial rewards associated with the demand response are not generally passed along to the consumer. The companies that aggregate demand typically charge utilities for the peak reduction but the consumer is unable to sell their available negawatts directly to a utility. This is problematic because this methodology reduces consumer incentives to participate in demand side management which is a necessary component of modern grid management. And adoption is hampered by the general lack of willingness on the part of consumers to allow utilities to control significant portions of their electricity usage with the consumer having little say in the matter. And from the utilities point of view the large variations in consumer usage patterns means that it is much harder for utilities to gage how much demand reduction is enough in advance compared to large stable users such as large office buildings or industrial facilities utilities face a complex mix of user patterns that are difficult to predict and virtually impossible to control. As a result at the present time almost no demand reduction takes place among consumers and small business users of the electric grid.

Another problem in the art today is the incorporation of distributed generation and storage systems which are proliferating into grid demand management systems. In many cases consumers are unable to do more than to offset their own electric bills with generation units such as microturbines powered by wind or solar panels on a roof or plug in electric hybrid vehicles that could add energy to the grid when needed because utilities have neither the means nor the motivation to pay them for the extra electricity they generate. Many states require utilities to buy excess power generated but without an ability to sell that generated power at a price that represents a more holistic view of its value that includes embedded benefits i.e. at a rate that may consider but is not limited to the effect on enhancing local power quality proximity to loads type of power generated and the associated reduction in carbon and other negative externalities like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and the reduced capital costs resulting from the reduction of required capital investments in infrastructure most distributed power generation remains economically unfeasible to the detriment of all parties. With the growing number of markets associated with trading negative externalities associated with electrical power generation most prominently including carbon but also nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide it is necessary to fully account for the value of such energy sources and storage options and to ensure that double counting of environmental benefits that are related to the generation and distribution of the electricity itself is not conducted. Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide became regulated in the U.S. under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments which established the EPA s Acid Rain Program to implement a cap and trade method to reduce harmful emissions from the electric power industry. Additionally while storage units may allow users to avoid peak charges and to even the flow of locally generated power for instance by storing wind power during high wind conditions and returning it when the wind conditions are low it is generally not possible for users to sell stored power to the grid operator at its true value for the same reasons.

An additional challenge associated with integrating distribute energy resources with the grid is the lack of a cost effective means of aggregating distributed power generation into a form that can be traded in a manner similar to the large blocks of power that are bought and sold by more traditional commercial power plants like coal and nuclear. Complex industry rules discourage participation and even consolidators have been hesitant to enter the market given the high set up costs associated with communications staffing and industry monitoring. A mechanism is needed to enable equal participation of distributed energy generators e.g. solar panels on the roof of a home and traditional power generators in order to encourage the development of these resources.

An underlying difficulty that contributes to the problems already described is that consumers commercial industrial institutional or residential participants in energy markets have no way to differentiate between one unit of energy and another in energy distribution systems such as the electric grid that are best viewed as continuous flow energy networks . This type of network can be contrasted with discrete or packet flow energy distribution networks such as the coal distribution system. The global oil distribution network is a good example of a hybrid or mixed energy distribution network that uses both discrete flow and continuous flow techniques at various points in the network. With continuous flow energy distribution networks such as the electric power distribution system or grid and the natural gas distribution system the units of energy are indistinguishable physically one from another at the point of consumption. That is a consumer cannot differentiate one kilowatt of electricity arriving at her home or business from another and in general has no ability to differentiate between energy having desirable qualities to her such as renewability low carbon footprint derivation from local or at least domestic as opposed to foreign sources and so forth. Since the physical properties of electricity or natural gas are essentially fixed and do not vary based on the source the only attributes consumers can know are quantity and price. While in some cases utilities make available about information about the aggregate sources of their electricity and while they may in some cases make a small number of packages available to consumers based on differing mixes of sources for instance black green and in between menu choices based on percentage of renewable or low carbon sources for each option with prices varying accordingly it is in general true that consumers have no information about the particular energy they are using at any given time and no ability to make informed choices as energy consumers.

Today s energy distribution networks are information poor and treat energy as a commodity that is only differentiated by price. What is needed is an information rich energy distribution network.

One approach to addressing the information poor nature of current distribution systems that provide energy to consumers taken herein to mean residential industrial institutional and commercial consumers of energy is smart metering . Smart meters are a natural extension of the well established electricity meters that today measure electricity usage at virtually all consumer locations. Under the older pre smart meter system of measuring electricity usage human meter readers would physically go at regular long intervals monthly or bi monthly generally and read a current value typically in kilowatt hours of total energy consumption at that site since the meter last rolled over passed its maximum reading and started over at zero . This new value would have the previous value subtracted from it to give the energy used in the period since the last meter reading. There are two main problems with the older meter system first meter readers are expensive second because readings can only practically be taken at long intervals there is no way for utilities to measure usage specifically during particular time intervals such as a peak hour. Without the ability to make readings at frequent intervals a common desired target is to have fifteen minute readings it is practically impossible for utilities to offer or impose demand based pricing schemes for instance where electricity prices are set higher during periods of peak demand. For very large consumers utilities and the consumers have found common ground and the consumers have allowed sophisticated measurement systems to be put in place or have done it themselves and have switched to demand based pricing these large consumers typically have building automation and energy control systems that allow them to manage energy usage and to avoid excessive usage during peak periods. By switching to demand based pricing these consumers get a lower overall energy bill because prices during periods of low demand are typically much lower than the fixed prices used in non demand based pricing schemes usually these prices are set as fixed tariffs and reflect an average of peak and low usage prices that would have been charged in demand based pricing schemes .

While to some extent the problem of obtaining frequent usage readings has been solved for very large consumers the situation is very different for residential and small commercial users who collectively account for approximately 50 of electricity usage in the United States. A solution that is currently favored by the utility industry as a whole is to gradually shift the entire user base to smart meters which are energy meters that are connected via a data network to the utility and are able to take readings at arbitrary time intervals under the control of the utility. Deployment of smart meters among other things makes it possible for utilities to implement demand based pricing schedules for all consumers served by smart meters which is extremely important for utilities and consumers alike as demand based pricing should help to control demand especially at peak periods . But the cost of deploying smart meters is quite high typically reaching several hundred dollars per installed smart meter. With tens of millions of ratepayers in the United States alone switching completely to smart meters will likely cost many billions of dollars and it will take a considerable period of time.

Besides their high costs smart meters suffer from another disadvantage albeit one which would not trouble utilities themselves. Since smart meters are being deployed exclusively by utilities in the United States since it has always been the responsibility of the utilities to install maintain and own usage meters widespread deployment of smart meters will tend to lock in consumers with their local utility. This situation which prevails today is in sharp contrast to the situation in the telecommunications industry where many consumers have a choice of carriers even for local service. If real time markets are not developed in parallel with smart meter deployments smart meter deployment will reinforce utilities stranglehold on their consumer base which may not serve the best interests of consumers or the economy as a whole. If developed in parallel smart meter deployments and parallel market based network management can have many synergistic effects.

Another aspect of the problem of energy management in more market oriented information rich scenarios is the determination and management of risk. There are several relevant areas of risk that must be considered by market participants. These include familiar risks such as the creditworthiness of counterparties in energy transactions but these familiar risks are taken into unfamiliar territory when large numbers of less sophisticated market participants are considered such as where small businesses and residences participate in demand response management programs or contribute power to the grid for distributed energy sources . Other types of potentially relevant risks are new including such novel risks as the risk that when large numbers of small participants elect to respond to a demand response management signal their geographic distribution creates stability problems on the grid. In order for efficient markets that combine both demand response and distributed energy generation to be possible and to be attractive to prospective market participants the overall risk profiles of participants and of the derivative energy securities traded on such markets must be visible and must maintain the confidence of these participants. Furthermore development of real time energy markets requires that uncertainty and variability of loads and sources on the network be quantitatively and qualitatively transparent and manageable through tradable financial and physical trading rights. As markets continue to develop into more effective tools to integrate increasingly large numbers of participants two types of risk must be simultaneously managed in market based smart grid solutions financial risk and system operations risk. This is a distinct challenge compared to the purely financial risks that are commonly measured and allocated in financial derivatives.

In addition to the practical challenges associated with integration of large quantities of renewable energy resources and distributed energy resources generation and storage the energy markets must have tools to effectively price the effect of infrastructure reliability on the network due to the physical limitations of the network to deliver electricity to end users. This requires that reliability ratings for actual physical infrastructure assets can also be described qualitatively and quantitatively for inclusion in real time markets and futures markets for energy derivatives. The scoring of infrastructure reliability is an important part of quantifying system operations risk inherent in the system that must be accounted for in financial models if risk is to be allocated in an appropriate and socially optimal manner.

In addition to challenges in management of the grid the existing energy market structure results in inefficient pricing and taxation of market externalities. The inability to effectively attribute system losses e.g. transmission losses to network market participants stems from the current inability to facilitate nodal allocation of energy on continuous flow energy networks that is allocation of real costs and externalities associated with energy transformations on a node by node basis for instance by assigning a carbon cost to electricity losses on a high voltage transmission line and then allocating that cost to each user of electricity which was transmitted along that transmission line . In a continuous flow energy networks with proper energy information overlay networks it is possible to effectively attribute the negative externalities of power generation transmission distribution and storage to end consumers with particularity such that the end to end environmental effects of energy usage can be quantified. Once quantified and attributed to end consumers more effective means of pricing pollution and other negative externalities can be explored by government beyond methods such as cap and trade that are currently being considered. With end to end accountability it is possible to tax pollution in the final goods and services produced directly which increases transparency and affects consumer behavior in order to help reach national or supra national environmental goals.

Another important aspect of managing energy markets is pricing of derivative energy securities. When considering instruments which consist of aggregated demand energy reduction or distributed energy generation obligations there are two important financial aspects to consider the appropriate price for the instrument and the actual price to be paid to the various entities who voluntarily have committed to carry out certain demand reduction or distributed generation actions on demand in return for financial compensation. The derivative energy securities are similar in nature to commodities futures in which a price is paid on an open market for the right to buy or sell a certain commodity at a certain price at or by some definite time in the future. The price for the instrument is distinct from but dependent on the price of the underlying commodity and a purchaser of such a commodities future instrument who plans on actually taking or making delivery of the commodity has to consider both the price to be paid for the instrument and the ultimate price of the commodity as compared to the market price at the time of the settling of the contract to determine whether or not to proceed with a purchase or sale of such a futures contract or financial instrument . But in commodities futures the actual delivery of commodities on settlement of a contract is not facilitated or managed by the market or exchange that handled transactions involving the futures contract what is traded on such exchanges are contractual obligations only. Parties to final contracts for delivery and receipt of contracts have resort to legal mechanisms in the case of failures of counterparties to fulfill their obligations without the involvement of the exchange that made the market in the futures contracts. In situations where exchanges may actually involve themselves in the delivery of the underlying physical assets being traded and may take on a certain measure of risk with regard to such deliveries the pricing of futures contracts becomes more complicated as there may be at least three parties bearing some measure of risk associated with each contract a buyer a seller and an exchange.

As the electric grid system continues to integrate increasing numbers of diverse market participants the markets which determine the relationship between parties interacting on the network will continue to become ever more important. In fact future reliability is likely to be provided through market operations and not the decisions or actions of central planners. The development of complex energy markets capable of effectively managing operation of the grid within the physical operational and policy constraints required will require the development and implementation of new trading tools to interact with the markets.

At the core of these new markets will be the trading platforms that provide new ways to integrate engineering and business decisions to manage the physical and financial risks that in the case of the electric grid are coupled due to the unique constraints of the network. In order to manage the diverse energy resources spiking demand and continuously increasing uncertainty and variability all market participants require new tools to interact with developing markets that enable them to effectively manage physical and financial risk.

Current methods for managing the utilization of network assets including for example transmission and distribution network lines are suboptimal. This is due to lack of visibility to most players regarding line losses which are often as much as 8 10 of electricity generated and system requirements such as ancillary services both of which remain unattributed to end users. For example voltage support required for a large factory is not attributed to the factory in any meaningful way leading to a free rider problem. Although Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition or SCADA systems often provide extremely low latency data feeds to utility network operations centers or NOCs these systems are often not configured in a manner that enables wide area network optimization and utilization to occur. The use of transmission and distribution assets across many service areas by many different physical and energy asset holders is critical to providing more transparent and efficient markets that are capable of meeting the energy challenges faced by the United States and many other nations.

Challenges with the pricing and trading of transmission rights in many cases are linked to the fact that electrons flow over all parallel paths inversely proportional to the impedance of the path and do not follow any specified contractual path as assumed in physical transmission rights . Loop flow becomes a problem when bilateral transactions between market participants extend to cause flow problems in third party systems i.e. other parts of the network . More generically this problem is a direct result of the inability to directly control the flows between any two points on the network within the grid network without influencing line flows elsewhere on the system. In short simplified shortest distance contract paths across the electric grid network are neither technically nor economically efficient. It is this highly interconnected nature of the electric grid system that requires new approaches for managing dispatch network utilization and network optimization.

It is common in the art to base the entire operation of the grid on the concept of control areas that are premised on the concept that loads and resources will maintain an instantaneous balance across the network. This assumption of uniform power quality and instantaneous balancing of energy assets on the network is not necessarily useful. Control Area concepts are not required for efficient and reliable provision of services and management of the electric grid. In fact the assumption that all users require the same power quality and consistency of access is in some cases detrimental to parts of society who may be unable to pay for such services or end up paying for such services without understanding the true sources of the associated costs. It is also common in the art to utilize Area Control Error ACE as the metric with which to manage control areas. This is generally specified by a standards or regulatory agency that tells system operators to keep their ACE within tight limits in two key ways first that the control area balance on an instantaneous power basis is kept in balance with the rest of the interconnection at least once every ten minutes and second that the control area s energy imbalance remain within a specified limit generally 0.2 0.4 of peak demand every ten minutes. The control area concept and many of the centralized dispatch and scheduling mechanisms utilized today introduce large inefficiencies into the system and provide problems for the provision of effective low cost energy services due to scheduling and dispatch limitations associated with fixed scheduling mechanisms. New systems and methods that are able to provide effective tools for customers to purchase electricity according to their needs and desires as services down the wire are possible if correctly implemented.

Another challenge of energy is that the end consumer requires energy to run their home or business. Rarely do they have an understanding of the complexities of how energy pricing works. Instead they focus on how to generate revenue or control the costs of their own business or residence. End users are primarily interested in the end state and benefit that energy enables. For instance end users value the delivery of comfort convenience mobility security among other tangible economic benefits. The state of the art of energy management lacks a translation mechanism of turning the complexities of energy into tangible physical experiences As an example the value of comfort can be delivered by adjusting the control system of a central heating system boiler space heater sunlight etc. Users lack an ability to optimize their total comfort based on economic variables.

It is an object of the present invention to utilize a system and method for enabling nodal allocation of electricity and the effective utilization and optimization of transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid system such that intelligent adjustments may be made to connected devices and systems to optimize perceived comfort levels.

Accordingly the inventor has conceived and reduced to practice in a preferred embodiment of the invention a system and method for enabling nodal allocation of electricity and the effective utilization and optimization of transmission and distribution infrastructure of the electric grid system using information obtained or exposed via the invention to optimize comfort levels in an iNode or eNode network.

The inventors provide in a preferred embodiment of the invention a system for managing continuous flow energy distribution networks that is particularly adapted for managing electric power demand and distributed generation capacity among a large number of consumers such as residential small and large commercial institutional that is hospitals schools and the like and industrial users. The system relies on an overlay packet data network comprised of energy information nodes or iNodes which overcomes the previously discussed limitations by overlaying a rich set of informational attributes on continuous energy flows such that consumers can use these information attributes and dimensions to make informed energy choices. A key advantage of the invention is that while a single physical network carries power from all sources the available energy at any given node is priced and allocated separately as a finite resource based on data attributes of the system. These prices when combined with user needs can create lowest cost deliver of energy services and energy benefits.

Furthermore the new system enables consumer preferences to be implemented through selection of energy sources by explicitly named sources or brands or by any of a large number of information attributes or dimensions. The system of the invention enables new consumer behaviors such as paying more for certain energy source types or even avoiding purchase embargoing of certain energy types or suppliers for example some consumers may choose to undertake the difficult path to becoming a no coal electrical household or business by refusing to take any coal based electricity no matter the cost or even the lack of availability of alternatives for some periods . In addition information attributes create a large opportunity for commercial branding advertising search and market making in addition to passing on regulatory compliance information to consumers.

For the purposes of describing the invention two related terms are used herein. An eNode is a physical node in a continuous flow energy distribution system at which energy is stored or transformed in the sense that generation and consumption of electricity are both energy transformations since energy is never created nor destroyed . Examples of eNodes include switches and breakers generators motors electric appliances home power distribution panels meters central heating systems lighting controls and so forth. The continuous flow electrical distribution network can be thought of as a network of pipes or channels connecting a large number of eNodes electricity flows through these channels mostly these are wires of course and is transformed stored controlled and measured at various eNodes. While the examples described herein will be electrical network examples the same descriptions could be made by reference to other continuous flow energy distribution networks or the continuous flow portions of mixed energy distribution networks without any loss of generality the invention should be understood to have as its scope any continuous flow energy distribution systems and the focus on electricity should be understood as being exemplary and not limiting.

A key element of the invention is the use of an overlay packet data network comprised of iNodes and coupled to the continuous flow energy distribution network of eNodes that was just described. In general iNodes are associated with or coextensive with corresponding eNodes and have interfaces capable of bidirectional data exchange with other iNodes. For example where a metering device is placed in a physical network this is an example of an eNode an iNode would be a data device adapted to receive readings from the metering device and to pass those readings on via a packet data network to other iNodes. Conceptually the entire physical continuous flow energy distribution network may be overlaid by a packet based data network of iNodes that communicate sensor readings perform calculations related to the energy flows in the energy network send control signals to actuating elements in the physical network such as a signal to open a breaker or to start a generator and communicate information pertaining to the energy network to interested users both human and automated .

Although modularity of iNodes it is not necessary according to the invention most iNodes described herein are highly modular in nature so they can be easily connected peer to peer and in trees or hierarchies and inserted into networks at different levels. Modular design has as advantages the facilitation of scalability flexibility security robustness standardization and suitability for progressive deployment.

The use of a network of iNodes makes it possible to collect detailed data about usage patterns from large numbers of energy users including how these usage patterns vary during various time periods including peak demand periods and periods when sources of renewable energy such as wind or solar are unavailable or are available in abundance. Additionally detailed data on how each user reacts either automatically or otherwise to management signals sent during peak demand or other periods is collected. For example some users may significantly reduce demand when requested and may do so promptly. Other users conversely may not react at all or may react sporadically. The same variations in response may occur among operators of distributed generation or storage facilities. There are many reasons why reactions will vary and even why reactions may significantly deviate from demand reductions that were explicitly volunteered by a user. For example when a peak period arrives a user who volunteered to participate in demand reduction might be on vacation or out of their home for any reason and so many of the loads that would be targeted may already be secured turned off . Similarly some user owned distributed generation facilities may be able to react to management signals by changing the generation profile while others for instance solar systems may not be able to change in response to demand management signals because they are dependent on the sun or another uncontrolled factor . Collecting data about the variability and uncertainty of these various human machine systems that participate in the market enables more effective management of the overall system by providing more market intelligence to ensure better decision making by all members of the complex electrical system.

According to an embodiment of the invention this usage data is analyzed to create response profiles for each affected user. A response profile reflects an amount of load likely to be actually reduced or generated by a user when requested. The profile may be quite complex reflecting the varying predicted behaviors for a user on different days at different times during different seasons and so forth. Response profiles can also be generated according to the invention on classes of users large or small who behave in similar ways it is not necessary for each user to have an individual response profile. Furthermore response profiles can be quite dynamic for example a response profile may express a conditional behavior such as if there has been usage of at least X kwh in the two hours prior to the period of interest then the user is likely at home and the expected response is Y otherwise the expected response is Z . In the example given Z would likely but not necessarily be less than Y and would reflect the fact that both fewer loads are likely to be active because the user is away as inferred by lack of use in the earlier period and that no user reaction to any demand reduction request is possible because the user is likely not at home. In other embodiments of the invention users may have home automation systems implemented and could receive notification via email SMS text message or other means while away from home and thus be enabled to take actions to reduce load when needed this capability would be reflected in the response profile for such users or classes of users.

In an embodiment of the invention consumers and small businesses participate voluntarily in supply generation and storage or demand consumption management programs by establishing preferences. Preferences can take many forms. In some cases users may state that certain loads are off limits or critical and can never be turned off remotely for any load conditions. Other loads may be given one or more attributes that can used to determine if the load is available in any given situation for remote deactivation. Attributes could include time of day length of time since the load was turned on length of time since the load was last remotely deactivated level of criticality of the demand reduction effort price to be paid for shedding the load don t take this load offline remotely unless I will be paid 1 for the sacrifice or even the communication required to confirm for example this load can only be turned off if a message is sent to its automatic controller and the automatic controller states that it is safe to turn off the device . Another user might express the preference that stored solar energy will be placed on the grid when the price is at a certain level or when the level of criticality of the peak is sufficiently great. It will be appreciated that any number of consumer or small business preferences are possible for controlling when and whether one or more loads are made available for remote deactivation. Moreover the same considerations that apply for deactivation can also be applied for activation in the case where generating capacity or storage capacity is available. Consumers and small businesses may have in aggregate substantial amounts of power in storage or ready to be generated on demand if the management system was in place to request it and to manage it. Again each user s supply side resources generation and storage capacity can be made available according to preferences established by a user. Each response profile also reflects the geographic location of the user or class of users to whom it pertains. This information is important for determining which utility and which particular grid locations such as substations tie lines or regions will be affected by the activation of the response profile and to what extent.

In an embodiment of the invention a number of response profiles are combined to create a response package. Because statistical behavior of users whose profiles are combined in the response package is known and because a large number of profiles are normally combined into a package it is possible according to the invention to estimate with good accuracy how much load reduction or generation each response package represents. For example a response package made up of the collected response profiles of 10 000 consumers might be expected to yield 1.5 MWh megawatt hours of load reduction during a particular 15 minute peak load period. Each time this response package is invoked that is each time a signal is sent to all the users represented by the response package the actual demand change effected is measured and used to refine the statistical model for each response profile and for the response package as a whole. In this way according to the invention the system for energy management continually adjusts to maintain highly accurate models of supply and demand changes in response to invocations of response packages reductions through load shedding or additions through generation of power or release of power from storage . As with response profiles each response package has a geographic element. For instance it may represent elements loads and generation storage elements spread across a particular utility s area of responsibility or it may represent elements in a particular urban region.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention response packages are made available for purchase by third parties. Purchasers could be utilities who desire to directly manage demand or they could be aggregators who resell demand management to utilities at peak period. According to the invention a given response package can be sold for any time period at any time in the future or indeed for the current time period . Thus a response package for reducing load in San Francisco by 10 MWh for the 15 minute interval starting at noon on Friday Mar. 31 2010 could be sold at any time before 12 15 on that day. Because the package is sold according to a preferred embodiment of the invention on an open market it is likely that the price would vary over time based on market participants estimates of the likely demand for power at the critical time for this package that is at 12 00 on March 31 . In principle the package can be sold more than once according to the invention although in the end only one owner is able to actually elect to invoke the demand response action represented by the package. It should be noted that actual exercise of the demand response action represented by any given response package is necessary according to the invention if load conditions are markedly different from what the final purchaser expected that entity may elect not to incur additional costs described below by actually exercising the demand response action.

According to an embodiment of the invention consumers make their preferences concerning their willingness to participate in on demand energy management actions that is load reductions or provision of power from generators or storage systems known in advance. Since consumers are unlikely to be willing to enter into long term forward contracts for electric power actions that they may find quite unpalatable when a critical day arrives for instance if the weather is much warmer than expected consumers may balk at letting their air conditioners be turned off it is possible according to the invention for consumers to override their preferences at any time. Indeed this is one of the reasons that relying on consumers for demand response is so problematic and why utilities seek to have remote control whenever possible although this is rarely possible and is even illegal in some jurisdictions because of regulatory requirements . In order to provide a level of control that consumers will want or require and to provide a reasonable energy management capability to utilities the combination of a number of consumers again these can also be businesses response profiles into response packages of sufficient size that they will be large enough to be useful and will have predictable statistical behavior is carried out. According to a preferred embodiment when a utility or other entity actually invokes a response package for instance by actually requesting the demand to be reduced by 10 MWh during the critical period all of the end users that make up the response package are sent signals directing them to take the appropriate actions which they previously volunteered to take. While some will fail or refuse to do so this has generally already been taken into account by building the response profiles and the response package to reflect the statistical patterns that this particular package of users has shown in the past so according to the invention the actual demand response seen should closely approximate that specified as the rating of the response package in the example above the rating would be 10 MWh of demand reduction in the target time period .

Actual responses that occur when a response package is invoked are measured according to an embodiment of the invention. This measurement is used to refine statistical models used for response profiles as described above. Also according to an embodiment of the invention an invoking entity an entity which invoked a supply or demand response action associated with the response package may optionally only be charged according to a supply or demand response that actually took place. For instance while 10 MWh was forecasted and requested if only 9.5 MWh was actually achieved the price paid by an invoking entity would be reduced. Any reduction could be linear so that in the example given the entity s actual price is reduced by 5 or it could be set by any formula agreed in advance by the parties in the marketplace for instance the price difference could be set at 5 reduction for any shortfall from 0 to 5 10 for any shortfall above 5 but less than or equal to 10 and so forth . It should be appreciated that any price adjustment schema can be used according to the invention and that similar adjustments or no adjustment could be made if the response action exceeded what was requested typically one would expect that any overage would not be charged to an invoking entity but this is not required according to the invention .

According to preferred embodiments iNodes comprise at least a processor such as a standard microprocessor or a customized processor both very common in the art and a network interface which is connected to data network . Processor is adapted either to receive input readings from current sensor or electrical switch or both or to send output signals to electrical switch or to do both. In addition in other embodiments iNodes can comprise voltage sensors temperature sensors voltage regulators to receive output from processor or any other sensing or actuating devices known in the art. iNodes are defined by the interoperation of one or more electrical sensors or actuators with a processor that can communicate with other processors by passing data through network interface across data network to another network interface associated with the other processor . Various embodiments showing different arrangements of iNodes to accomplish different purposes will be illustrated and described with reference to in all of them and all other embodiments of the invention it should be understood that any arbitrary sensor or actuator elements can be used in any given iNode but all iNodes have at least a processor a network interface and at least one means of sensing or controlling eNodes electrical devices .

Data communications between iNodes in any given embodiment can be accomplished using any data communications protocol known in the art or indeed any novel proprietary protocol the invention does not rely on nor require any particular data communications protocol. Common protocols that may be implemented in network interfaces include transmission control protocol TCP universal datagram protocol UDP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP Java remote procedure calls RPC simple object access protocol SOAP and the like.

Gateway iNode in an embodiment of the invention comprises a processor and a local network interface as well as a network interface for coupling to external data network . In configuration where local iNodes connect directly to external data network gateway iNode may only have one network interface . Gateway iNodes at a minimum have an operating system operating on and a storage medium not shown coupled to processor in all figures showing processors in iNodes it is intended to be understood that some form of local storage and an operating system are understood to be included in the processor element these are not shown to avoid undue complexity but are considered to be inherent to the functioning of any processor.

In various embodiments of the invention software executes on processor to carry out the key logical functions of gateway iNode as part of an overlay packet data network overlaid across some set of elements and in the embodiment illustrated in of the electricity distribution network of electricity grid and its connected elements that is an electricity distribution network as referred to herein refers to networks comprising one or more of the elements of coupled by one or more electricity grids or . For example in some embodiments software receives via local network interface updates from local load iNodes and source iNodes concerning their state example of such updates include current voltage frequency true and reactive power readings as well as settings of control elements such as switches. Updates may be sent from local iNodes on a regular basis for example every 15 seconds or when a value changes by some specified minimum amount for example when changed by more than 10 from average of last five readings or when polled by software . Software in some embodiments sends control signals to control elements associated with local iNodes. For example in response to a signal received from data network software could automatically shed some or most electrical loads under its control that is controlled by actuators or control elements in turn controlled by one of its child load iNodes by sending signals to the appropriate load iNodes instructing them to interrupt current to one or more of their controlled loads. Similarly software could in response to a signal from data network or at a scheduled time determined from a schedule stored in its associated data storage send a signal to source iNode instructing it to start or to stop generating electricity or to change the amount being produced. In these embodiments gateway iNode becomes a key element of a system that enables dispatched electricity supply or demand management as it is adapted to be connected via data network to one or more dispatchers to process received signals in order to determine precisely what is to be done locally and to carry out the requested actions by sending control signals to one or more child iNodes associated with it generally in the same household or tenant it is also adapted for being a data collection element of a larger system by managing the collection of operating data from all of its child iNodes processing that data as by aggregating it and passing the data upstream via data network to other system elements that may for example aggregate data from a large number of gateways .

In another embodiment of the invention and referring to an energy management network for a home or small business similar to that of is illustrated with the addition of smart meter . Generally all users of electricity who draw at least some of their power from electric grid are provided by the utility with a meter for measuring the amount of energy used at a particular location. In the past and still today in a large proportion of locations meters are read by human meter readers on a monthly or semi monthly basis. This presents obvious cost implications for utilities which must pay those readers and has led to many innovative approaches including having consumers read their own meters with periodic unannounced audits by an external utility pair meter reader . Recently a wave of introductions of automated meter reading AMR systems has been seen. These have quickly been succeeded by a more useful innovation the smart meter and its accompanying advanced metering infrastructure AMI . While one of the goals of utilities in automating meter reading has been to reduce and eventually eliminate the need for human meter readers another potentially much more lucrative motivation has been the possibility of obtaining meter readings on a frequent basis instead of only once per month. If meters are read for example every fifteen minutes then utilities are able to measure how much energy is used by each ratepayer consumer whether commercial residential institutional or industrial during peak usage periods. This is an essential precondition to the very desirable from the utilities point of view shift to variable pricing schemes. In a variable pricing scheme the price of a unit of electricity typically measured in kilowatt hours or kwh is varied based on demand. During peak periods the cost of generating electricity is commonly much higher as expensive and often independently operated by for profit IPPs peaking power plants must be utilized for a portion of the overall load by contrast during low demand period most power is generated by very low cost sources such as large coal plants and hydroelectric plants. Smart meters make all this possible partly by being connected to the operations centers of utilities by a data network associated with the grid shown together as grid and data network . In most cases smart meters are designed to enable integration of home automation systems via local network . For example small businesses or homes with wireless automation systems for managing lighting HVAC heating ventilation and air conditioning systems and the like are able to integrate these systems with smart meters. Often this is done to enable consumers to participate in optional or even mandatory demand response programs in which utilities are allowed to turn off automatically certain loads to reduce demand during peak periods typically providing a discount to consumers willing to enter into such arrangements as an inducement to do so .

In an embodiment of the invention smart meter is integrated with a home energy management network according to the invention through smart meter iNode . Smart meter iNodes act in effect as a gateway to the smart meter and to the utility beyond. As such it will typically have an internal architecture similar to that of gateway iNode although this is not necessary as in some cases smart meter can be integrated directly with local network as when a ZIGBEE compliant smart meter is used with a ZIGBEE home energy management network. In some embodiments smart meter iNode acts as a load iNode passing meter readings to gateway iNode . Gateway iNode is able with the benefit of meter level usage data which provides data about total usage in the home or business to calculate in software operating on processor the amount of load that is not monitored or controlled by load iNodes by subtracting from the total the total load that is monitored by load iNodes . Analogously if source iNode is measuring a non zero amount of generated power the total unmonitored load can be calculated by subtracting from the smart meter reading the total of load iNode readings and adding in all source iNode readings. This capability is useful because it allows unmonitored loads to be accounted for and in some cases users could be prompted to secure stop unmonitored loads in a demand reduction scenario in effect adding a manual load reduction capability that can be mediated by gateway iNode . There are any number of uses to which a system comprising an integrated smart meter gateway iNode and a variety of load and source iNodes and can be put according to various embodiments of the invention. For example if a utility sends a demand response signal directing the user corresponding to smart meter to reduce a certain amount of load immediately this reduction can be managed by gateway iNode . Gateway iNode could carry out the requested demand reduction in a variety of ways. It could direct one or more load iNodes to interrupt their power that is to turn off their loads to provide some of the required reduction. It could direct source iNode to actuate its control of electrical source in order to start the generator or to increase the amount of electricity it generates. It could even coordinate over data network with other gateway iNodes to request that they shed some of the load cooperatively of course issues of verifiability will arise in such a scenario and particularly of verifiability of non duplication the same load reduction should not be counted twice .

According to an embodiment of the invention and illustrated in iNodes are connected directly to external data network rather than being connected through gateway iNode . Accordingly gateway iNode is only required in this embodiment to have one network gateway although obviously a gateway iNode with two network interfaces could be used with one of the interfaces merely remaining idle . Also although not shown separately in another embodiment a mixed approach is taken some iNodes connect to the external network via a gateway iNode with two network interfaces while others connect directly to external data network as shown in . While load iNodes smart meter iNode and source iNodes could be hard wired to connect only to gateway iNode over external data network in some embodiments local iNodes would connect to a service provider over external data network and identify themselves for instance by each iNodes providing a unique serial number to service provider when first connecting. The system disclosed in like all embodiments of the invention described herein is not limited to use in a particular type of venue such as homes or small businesses the use of homes and small businesses is exemplary and not limiting. For example load iNodes could be a large number of dispersed electrical loads possibly under the economic control of a large number of entities. For instance laptop charging stations in public places could be deployed by the owners or operators of the various public places and made accessible to third party users such as travelers or coffee shop visitors via service provider . In some embodiments patrons wishing to recharge laptops would connect via data network to service provider and make a small payment or a donation to a charity and service provider would then send a signal to enable a corresponding electrical device i.e. outlet allowing the patron to recharge. In another embodiment such patrons could identify themselves and their utility provider and account number and any electricity usage in for example electrical load would be measured by iNode and passed to service provider who could then pass the data on to an appropriate utility provider for billing possibly collecting a percentage fee which may then possibly be shared with the owner or manager of the location at which the charging patron is located . This example should make clear that there are many economic scenarios enabled envisioned and encompassed by the invention and it is reiterated that these examples should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention illustrated in a hierarchical arrangement of iNodes is illustrated. A plurality of premise iNodes is connected to one or more local iNodes via data network . Optionally a plurality of local iNodes is connected to one or more regional iNodes via data network . Many permutations and combinations are possible. Premise iNodes commonly in embodiments of the invention have child iNodes corresponding to particular electrical loads sources and so forth. As an example premise iNode may be a gateway iNode of a home energy management network of a type such as those illustrated in . It could be a gateway iNode for a tenant in a commercial office building. It could be a gateway iNode for a single building in a college campus or a high school. It could be an isolated source iNode for a diesel generator normally used as an emergency power supply for a large retail establishment but configured to start on demand under control of a local utility during extreme demand periods. Similarly local iNodes could be of many types and could have many purposes without departing from the scope of the invention. For example a local iNode could be a neighborhood cooperative energy management system s central node receiving inputs from a utility regional iNode in this example concerning desired demand levels and from a plurality of home gateway iNodes . The neighborhood energy management system could coordinate among the participating neighborhood residents premise iNodes to for example coordinate the starting of heat pumps and air conditioning compressors during periods of high heat load which are usually also periods of high electricity demand in order to ensure that no two compressors or heat pumps start within a specified time of each other heat pumps compressors and the like have high starting currents and when many attempt to turn on nearly simultaneously large load spikes can be experienced that can destabilize grid operations . Neighborhood management systems could also coordinate to ensure that the overall energy usage of a particular neighborhood does not exceed some specified limit coordination is carried out by sending signals to premise iNodes and in effect operating the premise iNodes and the local iNode as a distributed software system for optimizing energy usage profiles of the neighborhood as a whole . In another embodiment one or more of premise iNodes is a distributed storage system operated as a common asset of a local iNode and its child iNodes for instance a neighborhood may invest in distributed battery storage systems and possibly also in several generating devices and these may be operated under control of local iNode to manage overall load as viewed by regional iNode . Additionally in such an arrangement when prices are high due to high demand local iNode could direct generators and storage systems to deliver power to the members of the local community to avoid their having to pay the higher prices storage could be topped off later when prices drop back to their normal lower levels. This type of power management would actually be a boon to utilities as well as to their customers as it is often quite expensive for them to deliver power during peak periods and many of the ratepayers remain on fixed regulated tariffs that are much lower than peak prices. In some embodiments data networks and are identical often the Internet serves both functions but other single networks could also do so . It should be appreciated from these examples that the overlay packet data network approach of the present invention allows a wide range of deployment architectures of which the examples given are a subset. For instance there could be many layers of hierarchy and a given premise iNode could be logically connected to and communicate with and possibly even be controlled by more than one local iNode and a local iNode could be connected to communicate with and possibly even be controlled by more than one regional iNode . Or in another embodiment several distinct layers beyond the three layers shown in are possible. And in yet other embodiments a given iNode may participate as a local iNode with respect to certain applications or subnets as a premise iNode in other applications or subnets that is a given iNode could function at different hierarchical levels for different purposes. Moreover in highly interconnected scenarios it may be more useful to think of iNodes as being arranged in a web. And since iNodes are generally associated with corresponding eNodes or physical elements of the underlying continuous flow energy distribution network on top of which the overlay packet data network is overlaid the architecture of large scale distribution of iNodes according to some embodiments of the present invention will often come to resemble the hub and spoke with hierarchical subnets arrangement of typical large scale electrical distribution systems.

A configuration database stores information pertaining to the configuration of the components of a digital exchange as well as information pertaining to users who have registered with the digital exchange . When new users connect with a digital exchange via communications interface from a user interface via a remote iNode or they are guided through a registration process. Details of this process will vary in accordance with the invention but will typically include at least the collection of identifying information concerning the user and information to enable the communications interface to connect to a remote iNode associated with the user as appropriate. According to an embodiment of the invention when a user provides information enabling a communications interface to find and connect to an associated remote iNode the communications interface queries the remote iNode to obtain a list of devices or energy resources monitored and addressable by remote iNode. For instance a home iNode may return a list of several loads and one or more generators or storage devices. Optionally a user may view the list of associated devices or energy resources and provide detailed information about one or more of the devices or energy resources. For example a user might start with a list of monitored outlets and appliances that was obtained by communications interface from home iNode and manually provide the information that outlet 7 has a Dell Inspiron computer connected to it outlet 8 has a 17 inch monitor connected to it appliance 1 is a Kenmore washer of a specific model and so forth. The list of acquired devices or energy resources and all associated amplifying information concerning those devices or energy resources are stored in configuration database . According to an embodiment of the invention configuration database is also populated with a set of data about the standard energy usage profiles of known brands and models of electric devices. For example information may be stored in configuration database concerning the power consumption of various models of Kenmore washers and driers as well as additional detailed information such as the various duty cycles and their associated power consumption profiles the consumption of power by a washer for instance will vary dramatically at different stages of its various duty cycles . Information concerning precautions to be observed when considering deactivating particular devices is also optionally stored in configuration database for instance it may be unsafe for a washer to turn it off during a spin cycle whereas it might be perfectly safe to turn it off during a fill cycle.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention user preferences are stored in configuration database . While interacting with digital exchange users are given options to express preferences for how their energy resources may or may not be used by a digital exchange to build response profiles and response packages or to execute energy management actions that involve the user s energy resources. As discussed above preferences can be quite wide ranging according to the invention and may include mandatory preferences preferences that a digital exchange is not allowed to violate such as never turn off my television on outlet 14 or optional preferences with conditions for example if the price is more than X degrees and my hot water temperature is at least Y and it is between 8 00 am and 4 00 pm local time you can turn off my hot water heater for as long as needed or until the temperature drops to Z degrees or highly permissive preferences you can do whatever you want to this load whenever you want .

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention events are stored in event database . According to the invention a very wide range of events may be stored in event database . For example each packet of data concerning the state of a device or energy resource can be considered an event and stored in event database . To illustrate consider a washing machine that is monitored and controlled by a home iNode in the home of a user of a digital exchange . When the washing machine turns on an event is generated to record that the device activated at a specific time. If the home iNode is configured to pass frequent power readings for the device then a series of events of the form device N was consuming X kilowatts at time T is passed by home iNode via communications interface and stored in event database . Similarly if a response package is activated and event is generated if a particular response action is requested an event is generated and if the requested action is taken another event is generated all of these exemplary events are stored in event database . It is desirable according to the invention to capture events at as granular a level as is possible for any given configuration for example as in the case of home iNode described above it may only be possible to have information at the level of detail of a home whereas in the case of another home iNode discussed above device level granularity is possible . According to the invention configuration changes may also constitute events and be stored in event database enabling an audit trail to be maintained that is configuration database stores the current configuration but event database will have a complete record of changes to configuration database . Extraneous events which are events not directly recorded by remote iNodes or other sources within the digital exchange infrastructure may be entered manually or automatically into the event database . For instance if a third party provides weather forecast information or actual weather information for example it is snowing in Wichita at time 1 00 pm this information can be stored in event database . This is useful according to the invention because it may be possible to correlate changes in aggregate load across many connected users connected to the communications interface with weather phenomena in a very detailed way.

It should be appreciated that exemplary forms of event or other data that may be recorded or collected for storage may vary and may comprise any potentially available data that may be useful in utilization optimizations. For example to focus on comfort driven optimization that is to optimize utilization for user comfort rather than for example optimizing with the ultimate intention of lowering costs or increasing efficiency a variety of time based data weather information energy generation data sensor data values or metadata pertaining to such information or optimization in general may be collected or utilized according to the embodiment. In this manner a variety of optimization operations may become possible according to the nature and quantity of data being recorded and the recorded data may be varied in the pursuit of a particular optimization or according to a particular arrangement. It should therefore be appreciated that a wide variety of data effectively any data available within or provided by an iNode or eNode system may be utilized according to the embodiment and any limitations or constraints described herein are merely mentioned as exemplary details according to specific arrangements embodiments or use case scenarios.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention transaction database stores information pertaining to partial pending completed and closed transactions. According to the invention partial transactions may include transactions to which only one party is committed at a given point in time for instance an offer to sell the right to invoke a particular response package at a particular time in the future or a request to obtain a specified level of demand reduction at a specified time in the future when neither the offer nor the request has been taken up by a second party. Pending transactions according to the invention include situations where two parties are committed to a transaction but the underlying energy actions have not yet been consummated for instance if a utility has purchased the rights to invoke a response package at a specified time but either that time has not yet arrived or if it has arrived the utility has chosen to not execute the response package yet. Completed transactions are transactions for which the underlying energy resource actions have been taken. Closed transactions are transactions for which all settlement actions such as verifying actual energy response actions taken by user allocating funds among various users who participated and satisfying all financial aspects of the transaction for all parties involved have been completed.

It should be appreciated by those practiced in the art that the various databases described herein are for illustrative purposes only. The functions of all of them can be included in a single database system or the functions could be distributed over a larger number of database systems than outlined herein without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention. For example a configuration database could contain only configuration information pertaining to physical things such as locations of remote iNodes and consumer preference information could be stored in a separate preferences database without departing from the scope of the invention. What is relevant to the invention is the set of information stored and the uses to which it is put rather than precisely how it is stored the field of database management is very advanced and those having practice in that art will appreciate that there are many considerations having nothing to do with the instant invention that may dictate one or another particular architectural approach to database storage.

According to an embodiment of the invention statistics server calculates a plurality of statistics based on data take from or derived from one or more of a configuration database a transaction database and an event database . Statistics can be calculated on request from clients of the statistics server such as a rules engine or remote iNodes provided via communications interface . Statistics can also be calculated according to a prearranged schedule which may be stored in a configuration database alternatively statistics may be calculated periodically by statistics server and pushed to clients or applications which may then choose to use the passed statistics or not. According to an embodiment of the invention statistics server is used to characterize an expected response profile of a plurality of end users of a digital exchange which response profile may be for a particular period of time or for any period of time optionally time specific and time independent response profiles for a plurality of end users may both be calculated. According to another embodiment of the invention statistics server is used to characterize expected response from a response package built up from a plurality of end user response profiles which expected response may be for a particular period of time or for any period of time optionally time specific and time independent response forecasts for a plurality of response packages may both be calculated. Statistics can be stored in a separate database such as an event database or they may be delivered in real time to a requesting client or application such as a rules engine .

According to various embodiments of the invention statistics server calculates statistics based on a wide variety of available input data. For example statistics server can calculate the expected load reduction to be delivered by a single end user or a collection of end users on receipt of a request for a reduction in load. This may be calculated based on any available data from event database transaction database configuration database or any other data source accessible to statistics server for instance weather data passed directly in to statistics server from a third party via communications interface . Data elements which may be used to calculate response profiles may include but are not limited to past history of responses to similar response requests at the same or different times and on the same or different days. Response profiles can be calculated based on a type of load to be reduced for example if a user has volunteered to make several resistive loads such as water heaters and resistive space heaters available for reduction on demand expected response may be calculated by estimating the probability that said loads are actually active at the time of a request based on previous history of the activation times for said loads. Alternatively said resistive loads might always be on yet an end user might occasionally override response actions locally and statistics server may estimate likely load reduction by estimating the probability that an end user will override a demand reduction signal based on previous override history. In both of these examples and indeed in any statistical calculation made by statistics server previous history data can be for the user concerning whom a statistics is being calculated or it can optionally be historical data from a plurality of users who are judged by statistics server to have similar characteristics. This allows for instance a new user to be incorporated readily into the system and methods of the invention by allowing historical data for already active users with similar characteristics to be used to estimate the expected behaviors of said new user. In an embodiment of the invention demand management may be achieved by altering duty cycles of appropriate loads rather than merely turning them off for example setpoints of an advanced thermostat could be adjusted by one or more degrees in order to reduce the aggregate HVAC load controlled by the thermostat or a hot water heater could be allowed to stay offline until water temperature drops to some predefined temperature at which point the heater would turn on. In these cases the preferences are stored in a configuration database and statistics server calculates expected response by for example deriving a response function expressed as a function of time where time can be defined in various ways such as the time since the last duty cycle started the time since a critical parameter was last reached or the time from the response request s transmission to the device this list is not exhaustive and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention which characterizes the typical response for the device. Then a calculation of the likely response can be made using this function and included in a response profile. Note also that whenever information about a device type such as a particular type or model of washer dryer thermostat or any other device is contained in a configuration database information from either the manufacturer of a device or an aggregated history from many such devices used by various participants in digital exchange can be used in lieu of actual usage information from any particular user if desired. In this way response profiles can be built up with high accuracy for even very new users or for users who do not have equipment that enables current or power measurements per device as upon listing various devices a response profile can be built using typical response profiles for each device the user lists .

In another embodiment of the invention expected response profiles can be based at least in part on information that is either real time in nature or nearly so. For example when information about current status of equipment on or off and potentially at which point in a duty cycle can be gathered it can be used to modify a response profile by taking into account the fact that loads which are already off cannot be turned off to save power. Similarly scheduled loads when known to statistics server by being stored in configuration database can be leveraged by taking into account the fact that a given load is scheduled to turn on in a period of interest and overriding the schedule to keep it off thus achieving a predictable load reduction for the period of interest.

In another embodiment of the invention users can be assigned an energy risk rating analogous to a credit rating. Statistics server calculates energy risk ratings by taking into account past user history particularly concerning the degree to which a user honors his commitments. For example if a user volunteers by establishing preferences that are stored in configuration database to allow 3 kilowatts of load to be controlled by digital exchange during periods of demand response or by volunteering to provide generated power of 3 kilowatts from a home wind turbine and then fails to actually deliver according to what was volunteered either because devices were off and therefore not available for load shedding or wind was not available or any other reason then statistics server decrements the energy risk rating for said user. As with credit scores time can be a key parameter in adjusting energy risk ratings after a series of failed commitments it takes some time before the energy risk rating will rise back up following a change to actually honoring commitments.

It should be appreciated that the examples of statistical data generation provided heretofore are exemplary in nature and do not limit the scope of the invention. Essentially any statistics that can be calculated based on data available about users their loads and available energy resources their behaviors for instance one might be able to infer that a user is at home based on dynamic behavior of power usage and use this to predict how responses might differ from those of a user away from home in fact preferences can be stated according to away or at home profiles which can be inferred or directly declared as is done with home security systems when a user clicks Away to tell the system he is leaving the house the consistency of their responses their demographics and so forth.

According to a preferred embodiment of the invention rules engine or an equivalent software module capable equivalent in the sense that it meets the functional description provided herein which is often done using a standards based rules engine but need not be so limited receives events or notifications from one or more of the other components of the invention and executes any rules linked to said events or notifications. Events could be received from a third party via communications interface as when a user elects to invoke a response package that he has purchased through digital exchange or from statistics server as when a statistic exceeds some configured threshold or from one of the databases as when a data element is added or changed . Events can also occur and fire rules based on calendars for instance a daily event might fire which causes a new set of response packages for times during the day that is one week or one month in the future to be created and stored in configuration database and made available for purchase on digital exchange via communications interface . When an event is received an event handler in rules engine evaluates whether any rules are configured to be fired when an event of the type received occurs. If so rules are executed in an order stipulated as is commonly done with rules engines. Rules can generally invoke other rules so an event s firing may cause a cascade of rules to fire or execute rule invocation and execution continues until no further rules are remaining to be fired. Rules are stored alternatively either in the rules engine itself or in configuration database . In an embodiment of the invention rules are established for the management of response packages so that when a user changes or adds configuration data relating to loads or energy resources that can be controlled by digital exchange a rule is fired which causes the user s response profile to be recalculated and the revised response profile to be stored in configuration database . Typically whenever a response profile is added or changed a rule will fire which either recalculates the expected statistical behavior of any response packages of which the changed user s response profile is an element or determines if the newly added or changed response profile should be added to an existing or a new response package. Inclusion of a response profile in a response package may be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the geographic location of the facility home or small business associated with the new user for instance if all users within a given substation s service area are to be included in a single response package the demographics of the user for instance if a response package comprised of affluent greens is maintained and a new user matching that profile is added or the type of generation equipment available at the new user s facility for instance if all wind power generators are bundled into a plurality of wind based response packages . In this latter case in an embodiment of the invention the wind profiles of the geographic locations of various users who together comprise a response package can be combined by statistics server into a composite wind generation response package profile that can then be used to announce to prospective buyers the availability of specified amounts of wind power at specified times. In some cases there may be an insufficient number of response profiles in a given region or of a given type to make a reasonably sized and reasonably well behaved which typically is a consequence of having a statistically significant mix of response profiles in a single response package response package in these cases when a new user or set of resources associated with an existing user is added that is in the same region or has the same type a rule is triggered which checks to see if there are now enough users or enough load or generating capacity to create a new response package. If the answer is yes then a new response package is created and a request is sent to statistics server to calculate the expected responses of the new response package. When the results are returned from the statistics server they are stored in configuration database and any rules for making the response package available via communications interface are invoked. In this fashion and through the use of scheduled events as discussed above an inventory of available response packages is made available to potential buyers on digital exchange .

Another example of rules which are triggered by events according to the invention is when a demand for service is placed at the digital exchange . In an embodiment of the invention when a consumer s preference stored in configuration database states that a given load should only be operated when power of a certain type is available for instance don t run my dishwasher except using wind power and the consumer desires to operate the given load then a request is placed to the digital exchange for a package of wind power of sufficient quantity to provide for the given load. The placement of such a request constitutes an event which is stored at event database and passed to rules engine to determine if any rules are fired by the event. In this case a rule would be fired which determines if there is any wind power available in sufficient quantity to provide for the given load. If not a message is sent via communication interface to the appropriate remote iNode to so inform the user. If there is a single source of wind suitable for the given load then the capacity of a response package associated with the source is decremented for the relevant time interval it could be the current time interval or a future time interval for example when the given load is to be operated according to a schedule at a future time by an amount equal to the expected demand from the given load. If there is more than one suitable source available for the given load then the rule that was invoked will either resolve the situation itself if it is so designed or it will invoke a further rule to select from among a plurality of sources the one that is most appropriate. Selection of sources can be made according to any criteria including but not limited to price proximity to the requesting user energy risk rating of the various response packages or a fairness routine that spreads equally priced demand among a plurality of sources of supply.

It should be appreciated that the examples of rules provided in the above are exemplary only and should not be taken to limit the scope of the invention. Rules engine is the module that responds to events and that in effect creates an efficient market for energy based on aggregated response packages which are in turn based on the detailed statistical behaviors of a plurality of individual users loads and energy resources.

According to another embodiment of the invention a home or small business comprises a plurality of electric loads that are connected to and draw electric power from an electric grid via a connecting smart meter that is adapted to meter electricity usage within home . At least some of loads are further adapted to communicate with a smart meter . Electric loads can be any kind of electric load capable of being operated in a home or small business such as major appliances washers driers and the like electronics computers stereos televisions game systems and the like lighting or even simply electric plugs which can have any actual load plugged into it or no load at all .

In an embodiment of the invention a home or small business communicates with a digital exchange via the Internet or a similar data network. According to the embodiment data is pushed from a smart meter to a digital exchange in order to provide information concerning condition of loads . For example smart meter at a specified time interval may report to digital exchange that load is running and using 1.5 amps of current or 180 watts of power and that load is off and that load is running in power conservation mode for example if load is a computer and is adapted to provide its energy management mode to a smart meter . In other embodiments smart meter may pass periodic updates to digital exchange and supplement the regular updates with event based updates for example when a load turns on . In yet other embodiments digital exchange pulls data from smart meter either on a periodic basis or on an as needed basis. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill in the art that many combinations of push and pull periodic and event driven update strategies may be used by one or more gateways or by a single gateway at different times or indeed even by a single gateway at one time with different techniques being used for different loads. Users in a home or small business can communicate with the digital exchange as described above using a PC a telephone such as a mobile phone a dedicated home area network keypad or directly on smart meter which can alternatively be equipped with a screen such as an LED screen or a touchpad and optionally with buttons sliders and the like for establishing preferences that are then transmitted to the digital exchange . It will be appreciated that the description above of the communications associated with a home or small business comprising both loads and generators is equally applicable to homes or small businesses in which a smart meter is used in place of a gateway with a smart meter performing similar functions to a gateway in addition to its normal role of metering power usage.

In some cases homes may only pass aggregate electricity consumption data to a digital exchange from a smart meter either via the Internet or a special purpose data communications network adapted for communications between smart meters and utility based data systems. In these cases even though there is no visibility at the digital exchange level to the individual loads and generators in homes it is still possible according to the invention for a digital exchange to receive usage data from smart meter and to send requests for action for instance via a text message to a mobile phone or even a phone call to a regular phone located at the home or small business asking the consumer to shed unnecessary loads due to high electricity demand or to attempt to place any generating units online in response to a need at the electricity grid . Since any changes in load measured by smart meter at home or small business would be sensed by digital exchange shortly after the request went out the response profile of such smart meter only users can be included in response packages according to the invention. Even further it is possible to include entirely unmonitored loads and generators again taken to include storage systems capable of injecting power onto the grid unmonitored as used here means that the usage of loads and generators is not monitored in real time or near real time by digital exchange . The use of unmonitored loads and generators can still be beneficial according to the invention. For example in an embodiment of the invention some users register unmonitored loads and generators with the digital exchange using one of the user interface methods discussed earlier for example via a website associated with digital exchange . Optionally the registering user can also provide certified records of past operation of the unmonitored loads or generators which can be used according to the invention as input to be used in building a response profile for the unmonitored loads or generators . These unmonitored response profiles can be included in larger response packages with or without discounting of the capacity of the unmonitored loads or generators to account for the fact that these devices are unmonitored. Then when a response package including such unmonitored loads or generators is activated an activation message is sent to users of unmonitored loads and generators advising them of the required action to take. Messages are sent via any communications medium including but not limited to phone calls text messages emails or alerts on a website that may be monitored manually or automatically by users of unmonitored loads and generators . Accounting for whether such users actually take the requested actions is done in two ways. First the statistical profile of the response profile for such energy resources will include the expected behavior for example the action will be taken 55 of the times it is requested this is used by digital exchange to build a response package that behaves as expected. Second audits may be contractually required and conducted in which actual usage of unmonitored loads and generators is checked periodically for example monthly by a third party or with sufficient safeguards against fraud as are needed to satisfy business needs of a digital exchange . These needs will vary depending on the context. For example some users of unmonitored loads and generators will want to voluntarily participate and expect no remuneration for their participation in these cases it is not important to have a level of confidence sufficient for the disbursement of funds but only a level of understanding of expected behaviors to enable a refinement of the statistical model of the response profile. In other cases users of unmonitored loads and generators will expect to be paid for their participation and therefore will likely agree to contractual terms including right of audit for example of tamper proof device usage logs.

In another embodiment of the invention one or more of loads are monitored by clip on current measuring devices which are clipped around a load bearing able in order to sense the current flowing through the cable. In an embodiment the clip on current sensor is adapted to monitor one or more phases of the main current flowing into a home or a small business essentially acting via its wireless connection to a gateway as a clip on smart meter.

It will be seen from the various embodiments illustrated in that essentially any arrangement of communications will suffice as long as it allows users of energy resources to establish their preferences and operators of digital exchange to build statistical models of expected responses to requests to take action and operators of digital exchange to send notification of requested actions to users of energy resources according to their preferences.

It should be further appreciated that in the various arrangements illustrated in various control systems or interfaces may be utilized for manual automated or semi automated adjustment or interaction according to the embodiment such as to automatically perform adjustments to connected systems or devices. In this manner data recorded and processed according to the invention may be utilized to drive adjustments to devices or systems on the fly in a real time or scheduled manner in reaction to the recorded data or analysis or processing of the data. Such adjustments may generally be made with a concern for the comfort of users such as inhabitants of a home or workers in an office. For example based on recorded data optimizations may be performed by adjusting heating or cooling settings such as changing temperature set points or operating ranges adjusting lighting controls such as brightness or hue or adjusting air quality such as by controlling the amount of ventilation or filtration being utilized. In this manner adjustments may be made to optimize not only for traditional factors such as cost savings or energy efficiency but particularly with regard to perceived comfort levels for example as may be desirable in residential settings.

In a preferred embodiment and referring to a fractional smart metering system is disclosed. According to the embodiment a plurality of electrical loads and electrical sources associated with one or more consumers of energy are monitored by associated load iNodes and source iNodes as described above in reference to . Each load iNode is adapted at least to record the energy usage in its associated electrical load and each source iNode is adapted at least to measure the energy generated by its associated electrical source . Load iNodes and source iNodes are connected via data network and master iNode . Data network is in some embodiments a home area network or a local area network in a small business but in other embodiments data network is the Internet. Master iNode receives from a plurality of load iNodes and source iNodes usage statistics concerning the consumption or generation of energy by the associated electrical loads and electrical sources . As before while in this example loads and sources are electrical in nature it should be understood that they could also pertain to other types of energy such as natural gas and the fractional smart metering system could be used to measure other forms of energy and to manage energy distribution networks other than electrical grids. Master iNode is adapted to receive usage statistics at predetermined time intervals such as on a quarter hourly basis although master iNode in some embodiments is adapted to pull usage statistics on demand rather than to receive them periodically. Master iNode passes these aggregated usage statistics which may optionally also include generation statistics via grid interface to statistics server which is typically located in a utility operations center but need not be. Statistics server is connected via grid data network to grid interface grid interface is in some embodiments a stand alone server computer in other embodiments grid interface is a web page located on a host web server in yet other embodiments grid interface is a stand alone software application either distributed on disc to consumers or downloaded by consumers and adapted to allow a master iNode or plurality of load and source iNodes to connect via network to itself in order to collect usage statistics which it then sends on via grid data network to operation center . Grid data network is in some embodiments the Internet while another embodiments it is a dedicated data network operated by utility. In some embodiments load iNodes and source iNodes connect via data network directly to grid interface and no master iNode is present. In other embodiments consumers participating in a smart grid fractional smart metering system such as that disclosed herein will have a variety of arrangements some of them using a master iNode and plurality of child iNodes such as load iNode and source iNode while others will have only source iNodes and load iNodes and yet others will have hybrid architectures in which Master iNode is present and aggregates statistics from a plurality of child iNodes but there is a further plurality of iNodes that connect directly to grid interface .

It will be appreciated that according to the invention statistical information concerning energy usage and generation can be accumulated at statistics server without the use of smart meters. It will further be appreciated that an element of risk is introduced on behalf of the utility under this arrangement since the utility does not directly own or control the iNodes that are the source of the aggregated statistics. This is quite different from the situation common in the art today in which smart meters owned by the utility collect all usage statistics. In order to mitigate the risk utilities may collect aggregate statistics for periods corresponding to the time period for which routine meter readings are available. This data is generally already collected by utilities as it is the basis for their billing of ratepayers for actual energy usage on a monthly or bimonthly basis usually . Usage data from traditional meter reading is obtained by statistics server from operations database which in many embodiments is a relational database containing financial and operational data pertaining to a utility although other database formats and architectures may be used. The aggregate statistics obtained from iNodes via grid interface can then be compared to the usage data obtained operational database again this is the usage data collected from routine meter readings . Clearly the total from the iNodes should be less than or equal to the total amount obtained from the meter which by definition is the total of all energy used by the particular ratepayer for the particular period measured using the meter and furthermore the ratio of the total measured by iNodes divided by the total measured by a meter gives a good estimate of the proportion of the total energy load of the given premises that is monitored by iNodes. In one embodiment this ratio is assumed to be more or less constant although it can be recalibrated each time a meter reading is taken and the total usage of energy for any given time interval can be taken to be the total measured by iNodes divided by this ratio. Thus in this embodiment a utility is able to offer demand based pricing to consumers without the necessity of installing smart meters. In effect the aggregate of the iNodes for a particular ratepayer act as a fractional smart meter providing interval based measurement and two way communications between utility and ratepayer in real time for a fraction of the loads and sources present at ratepayer s premises. In some cases regulators or consumers may be unwilling to allow prices to be set based on a sampling approach such as that just outlined. In these cases a fractional smart metering approach may still be used according to the invention in which the loads measured by iNodes and in the generation of energy if measured are priced according to a demand based pricing scheme as if a smart meter were physically present measuring their energy usage on a small time interval basis while the balance of energy usage as determined by subtracting the total iNode measured energy usage from the meter measured usage is priced as usual using a fixed price tariff.

In fractional smart metering systems according to the invention it is important to be able to guard against fraud. One possible source of fraud would be to disconnect iNodes from data network during periods of peak demand and therefore the price and enter reconnect the iNodes during other periods. This would allow a fraudulent consumer to pay a lower than average price for iNode measured energy during periods of low usage and low price while still paying the averaged fixed price tariff rates for all energy used during peak periods. To avoid this in some embodiments a heartbeat mechanism such as are well known in the art may be used to detect the disconnection of any iNodes. This does not protect however against fraud such as by disconnecting electrical loads from load iNodes in order that the electrical loads can be operated without being detected by load iNodes . A more robust solution is to tightly integrate loads and load iNodes or sources and source iNodes such as by encouraging the adoption of energy efficient appliances with integrated network ready iNodes. Since many of the largest electrical loads used by consumers are appliances with integrated electronic controls such as heating ventilation and air conditioning systems refrigerators stoves and ranges dishwashers water heaters hot times and the like and since there is already precedent for the promotion of energy efficient appliances by utilities and regulators it is envisioned that iNode equipped appliances will allow fractional smart metering according to the invention to be practical.

In an embodiment of the invention once fractional smart metering is in place based on received aggregate data from a plurality of source and load iNodes for a plurality of consumers of energy statistics server computes usage values for time increments and passes them to pricing system in order to enable pricing system to compute demand based prices for each consumer. Pricing systems that are adapted to compute demand based pricing are well known in the art what is new is providing fractional smart meter based usage data in one of at least two forms according to the invention. One form is simply the total of energy usage net of generation by all monitored energy resources associated with a given consumer monitored in the sense that an associated iNode is present and feeds data as described above to statistics server . According to this embodiment when a monthly or bimonthly meter reading is obtained and passed to pricing system the sum of all interval readings from iNodes which were already priced based on demand is subtracted from the total and the remaining balance is billed at the normal fixed tariff rate for the applicable consumer. In a second form the ratio method described above is used to compute the total usage for each time increment based on fractional smart meter based measurements that is by dividing the total energy usage net of generation measured by iNodes by the fraction computed previously for the applicable consumer of total energy load that is monitored and to price the entire usage using demand based pricing. If this embodiment is used then when regular meter readings are obtained the total energy usage measured by the meter can be compared to the total computed by summing each time increment s value that was obtained by the second form and comparing the two values. If there is a significant variance for example a variance that exceeds a configurable maximum tolerance between the computed and measured total usage then the ratio method s results would be suspect. The variance could have been caused by normal fluctuations in energy usage among monitored and non monitored loads the two types of loads may not behave identically over time so that the ratio of monitored load to total load would in fact fluctuate or by fraud. In one embodiment when this situation is reached the first form is then preferentially selected by pricing system in other embodiments utilities or regulators may decide that where error is known the total usage for each time increment is adjusted to the lower of a pro rated amount based on total usage according to the real meter and the computed amount in other words resolve errors in favor of the consumer although many other approaches are possible according to the invention. For example in another embodiment statistics server computes an average percentage of total load consumed during each time increment for a sample of smart meter equipped consumers similarly situated to the consumer of interest and applies this percentage to the actual total usage of the consumer of interest to compute a value for each time interval.

It should be evident that the monitoring of a substantial portion of loads of a large set of consumers using iNodes and without the necessity of deploying smart meters makes possible a wide variety of demand management and demand based pricing schemes that are mutually beneficial to utilities and their consumers. Achieving this without the need for massive deployments of smart meters that do little for consumers is highly desirable.

In another preferred embodiment of the invention and referring to participants in energy markets are assigned reliability ratings that are used to build aggregation models that exhibit predictable performance characteristics desirable to exchange operators and market participants. Reliability ratings can be considered roughly analogous to credit ratings in that they measure a probability that a participant in an economic exchange will perform as promised. In fact the use of reliability ratings provides a valuable means for separating system limitations that may affect the actual response to an invocation of a given response package at a certain time from human behaviors that may also affect the actual response. Such separation of human factors from system factors taken broadly to include details of system behavior within consumers span of control as well as the system controlled by grid operators is very useful because people similarly situated or grouped based on common demographics and economic variables may be profitably studied without regard to their particular electrical infrastructure and similarly similarly designed electrical subsystems will likely behave in predictable ways without regard to the personalities of their human possessors . In a first step detailed performance data concerning exchange participants energy usage and market participation is collected. This data is collected as described above in reference to in event database and transaction database . Performance data may be supplemented with detailed configuration data from configuration database the configuration data pertaining particularly to identity capacity type and configuration of energy resources controlled by each participant. Data may be collected for the entirety of a participants active participation in an exchange but in many cases it may be preferable to collect data pertaining to specific time periods. Some of these approaches to time binning of performance data are described in more detail below. In step a reliability rating is computed for each participant and optionally for groups of participants. These reliability ratings are then used in step to select aggregation targets for a new tranche or for many new tranches for example by selecting all retail consumers that have reliability ratings above some minimum threshold. A tranche is a response package as defined above or a group of response packages or parts thereof of even an assemblage of particular response profiles that are made available on a digital exchange for purchase and eventual optional activation at a specific time or during a specific time period. For instance one tranche might be listed on an exchange as a collection of AAA rated demand response packages in a particular utility operating area that is available for purchase and that can be activated as desired between a specific start and stop time on a specific date. In step an overall expected performance profile is calculated for each tranche created in step by statistically combining using statistics server and as described with reference to above the expected response of the response profile associated with each participant included in the tranche in step . In addition a collective reliability rating for the tranche as a whole can be calculated. This is done in an embodiment by calculating a weighted average in which the reliability rating of each participant in the tranche is weighted by the expected total load available to be generated or reduced by that participant during the time period in which the tranche is eligible to be activated recall that this may only be a portion of the total load available for control at the participant s site since certain loads may routinely not be available during the relevant time period . Thus the reliability ratings of participants whose loads make up a larger than average fraction of the overall tranche s available load will be weighted more heavily in computing the tranche s reliability rating than that of a participant that makes only a nominal contribution to the overall available load of the tranche. In step tranches thus created and rated are listed for purchase on a digital exchange . If a tranche is actually purchased and then activated in the time period in which it is allowed to be activated again as described above in reference to then in step the actual performance of the tranche is measured. This is an important step because the very nature of the tranches which are in effect derivative energy securities with two important risk dimensions means that their behavior will be determined by a very complex mix of variables and will likely always be comprehensible only in statistical terms. In step actual response performance of tranches is compared to the expected performance and a determination is made for each tranche whether the variation between expected and actual performance exceeds allowable limits. Allowable limits are typically internally set and used by the relevant digital exchange although in some embodiments the price of tranches may be adjusted if the variance is too large in typical embodiments allowable limits are stored in configuration database . In some embodiments adjustments are only made in step when variances are outside of allowable limits although within the scope of the invention adjustments could be made after each tranche is activated keeping in mind that not all tranches are actually activated tranches are in many respects like options and it is not always desirable to exercise an owned option . In some cases tranches assembled according to steps and are made available separately for a large number of time periods for example a tranche could be assembled that is appropriate for any weekday noon hour during summer months in a given region and thus listed for each such time period in these cases adjustments can be made at the tranche level. More commonly however tranches exist only for one or a small number of time periods and in any case it is desirable for digital exchange to be able to identify sources of variation and to control and price them accordingly so it will more commonly be the case that adjustments will be made to individual response profiles already described above and to individual reliability ratings. Any adjustments are propagated to all affected response profiles and response packages and used in future tranches. Finally in optional step periodic review of reliability ratings is conducted. For example in some embodiments a monthly review of actual performance of the response profiles associated with each user will be reviewed and reliability ratings recalculated in order to account for changes in underlying behaviors. In some cases changes will occur as participants become more proficient in their roles as distributed energy generators of demand response providers in other cases usage patterns will vary with seasons and with changes in underlying business or residential activity patterns of the participants.

It will be appreciated that many variations are possible in how the process outlined in are carried out. Many of the more important exemplary variations will now be described without limiting the scope of the invention. In some embodiments of the invention each participant in a digital exchange will be given a single reliability rating that reflects their aggregate behavior in terms of how reliably they satisfy requests for energy generation or demand reduction in response to activation of tranches . This would be appropriate for some participants whose behavior is very consistent or for situations where a relatively simple model is desirable. But in other embodiments it will be preferable to compute a plurality of reliability ratings for some participants. For example some residential energy consumers may be quite reliable that is may quite reliably fulfill their obligations to generate energy or reduce energy demand when requested during noon periods during the week when children are at school and energy usage is both stable and flexible. On the other hand the same consumers may be quite unpredictable on weekends when teenage children are at home. Using one reliability rating for such a participant will lead to large variances and will tend to reduce the value of tranches both to its host exchange and to its purchaser and even to its participants who only generate income as members of a tranche when they take requested actions . Similar problems may occur with businesses with highly variable patterns in energy usage and in the consistency of energy usage. Accordingly in some embodiments of the invention reliability ratings are calculated for some portion of participants for independent time periods for example particular days of the week particular hours of the day or particular months of the year. In most embodiments for any given time period for which a tranche is to be assembled there will be one reliability rating for each eligible participant.

In another embodiment of the invention reliability ratings are calculated for classes of participants in addition to or instead of calculating reliability ratings for particular individual participants. In some cases this is done because tranches are assembled from response profiles pertaining to neighborhoods or other collective participant groups. On other embodiments reliability ratings are calculated for particular demographic segments in order that relatively new participants that have not built up a sufficient track record to have an individual reliability rating may be assigned a reliability rating associated with a demographic segment of which the new member is a group thus providing at least a reasonable approximation of the likely risk level the new participant will introduce into a tranche . In some cases where a new participant is a member of several groups for which reliability ratings have been calculated an average of the reliability ratings of the groups is used as a proxy for the uncalculated individual reliability rating. It should be understood that methods of combination other than simple averaging could also be used for example by weighting certain reliability ratings more highly than others because of their better probative value. An example of this would be the assignment of a greater weight to a reliability rating associated with the geographic location of a new participant rather than the age of the new participant. In other embodiments reliability ratings for very small participants are not used because of the degree of statistical uncertainty that could be introduced instead a relatively large number of similarly situated participants for instance homeowners within a given income range and within a certain county can be treated as an aggregate and a reliability rating for the entire group can be calculated in step . In some embodiments separate reliability ratings are calculated for demand response and for distributed energy generation based on the likelihood which is subject to verification by analysis of actual results in steps through that the behaviors associated with turning off presumably desirable electrical loads which has a social or convenience cost will differ significantly from the behaviors associated with operating exiting electrical generation devices where it is likely that a more straightforward cost based approach will be used . When separate distributed generation and demand reduction reliability ratings are used for a participant the appropriate reliability rating is used for determining the contribution within a tranche of load iNodes use demand response reliability rating and source iNodes use distributed generation reliability rating . In general any arbitrary mixture of granularities of reliability ratings is possible according to the invention as long as at least one reliability rating can be applied for each participant in a tranche keeping in mind that default ratings can be used in order to generate an overall reliability rating for the tranche itself.

In an embodiment of the invention tranches are built top down by first deciding on a desired risk and overall tranche response profile for a new tranche and then selecting participant response packages or response profiles to populate the tranche calculating the aggregate reliability rating and response profile iteratively and adding or removing participants until the desired overall profiles are achieved. This may be a preferable approach for exchanges desiring to have a balanced portfolio of derivative energy securities available for trading on the exchange with liquidity in all risk ranges that is with an adequate supply of low cost high risk tranches as well as higher cost lower risk tranches . To illustrate the top down approach assume a very reliable 10 megawatt demand response tranche is desired for a particular time period further characterized in that all loads to be reduced must be in the operating area of a particular large utility an exchange might desire such a tranche during expected high demand time periods because it expects a ready market for the tranches from the relevant utility or from traders who deal with it. The exchange having thus defined the size time risk profile will then assemble a candidate tranche from available participants those that satisfy any other constraints as in this example the geographic constraint . It should be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that there a number of ways to iteratively build a tranche with the desired characteristics. In one exemplary embodiment all of the eligible response packages that is those satisfying membership constraints such as demographic or geographic limitations that have approximately the desired risk profile for instance those that have an relevant reliability rating that is within a small range around the desired tranche reliability rating are added to the tranche and a calculations of the overall tranche size will it deliver 10 megawatts after computing expected responses and its response and risk profiles are conducted. The results are compared to the desired results and actions are taken depending on the outcome of the comparison. For example if the tranche does not yet encompass 10 megawatts of expected response it will be necessary to add more participants which can be done either by expanding the allowable range around the target risk profile and re performing the initial steps or by selectively adding small numbers of new participants with each new small group having approximately the desired risk mix for instance adding a participant who is more risky along with one who is less risky than the target profile . In another top down approach a set of tranches with the desired mix of risk profiles is stipulated and various combinations of the available response profiles are attempted in an effort to optimize the overall mix by satisfying the largest number of tranche requirements possible. This is a well known type of computational optimization problem of fairly high dimensionality for which several approaches that deliver approximate results in reasonable computational time are known. Among these are constraint based optimization simulated annealing genetic algorithms and neural network approaches. It should be appreciated by one having ordinary skill in the art that the task of finding a near optimal allocation of response profiles among the desired tranches to minimize the overall tranche variance that is the total amount by which all the tranches collectively fail to meet their target response and risk profiles is one that while challenging is a familiar one for which several well understood approaches exist. Any of these may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.

In some embodiments a bottom up approach to building tranches with desired risk profiles based on reliability ratings is used. An example where this approach may be preferred is when a high degree of specificity is desired in terms of geographical or market segmentation of participants. For instance it may be desirable to build a set of small business tranches for each of several towns possibly for political reasons or perhaps to support distinct marketing campaigns in each town. Another example where a bottom up approach might be desired is when it important to build tranches that are specific to very narrow grid constraints such as a plurality of tranches for which all participants are served by a single power plant or transmission line when limited importing of power from outside that district is important for economic or grid stability reasons. Yet another possible reason is when it is desired to build tranches with desirable attributes such as tranches composed solely of wind produced power or other desirable environmentally oriented tranches. Similarly it may be desirable to build tranches with particular carbon budgets in mind. In all of these cases it is more important to build tranches with participants or similar loads generation storage assets within a disparate group of participants of a particular type. In a fairly straightforward embodiment of the invention using the bottom up approach all eligible participants are first determined and the total expected response for any given time period is determined based on the response profiles of each participants . For example it may be determined that all of the available wind generators for a particular period will likely generate 37.5 megawatts of electrical power during the period. Next a decision is made about how to divide up the available contributions in the example under discussion one approach would be to establish three 10 megawatt tranches and one of 7.5 megawatts. Finally the available participants are sorted in order of reliability rating and then assigned to the four targeted tranches by dividing up the sorted list into the appropriately sized chunks. By definition this approach would give four tranches with different over reliability ratings an alternative approach would be to assign the participants in order to get four roughly equally rated tranches. This is an example of a business decision that an exchange operator or aggregator would make. To get four roughly risk equivalent tranches there are again several well known approaches such as a round robin assignment from the sorted by reliability ranking list or simply randomly assigning each participant to one of the four tranches and then making one for one trades to balance them in terms of load and rating. Again it should be clear to one having practice in the art that there are a large number of ways to divide up the available participants into tranches with desirable risk profiles and size breakdowns without departing from the scope of the invention the examples given are exemplary in nature only.

In an embodiment of the invention when an activated tranche falls outside of a desired variance band the performance of each of the participants in the tranche is automatically examined to make this concrete examined here means mathematically examined by statistics server upon its notification of the firing of a rule by rules engine which in turn evaluated the rule after receiving notification of an event indicating completion of a tranche activation the event possessing data elements that indicated an out of variance deviation from desired performance for the tranche . The examination determines for each participant whether that participant was one of the contributors to the problem by varying excessively from its target performance level . Note that there may be many excessively out of variance participants with some being too high and some being too low. Note also that in some cases digital exchange itself exerts a fair amount of control over the performance of a tranche by activating energy resources until the desired result is achieved and then stopping so any evaluation of the performance of particular participants is made against the actual performance requested by digital exchange during the activation not the nominal performance level established in the original tranche assignments. Finally note that for a variety of reasons digital exchange may choose not to adjust reliability ratings immediately in the face of excessive variances for some or all of the participants e.g. when a given exogenous factor like an extreme heat wave substantially changed these are business decisions that according to the embodiment are reflected in the rules loaded into configuration database . According to the embodiment when immediate adjustment of reliability ratings is desired these changes are generally immediately calculated by statistics server and the new values are loaded into configuration database . The new values are used the next time tranches are being built with the particular participants whose reliability ratings were adjusted. In another embodiment of the invention the calculation and update to reliability ratings may be delayed until it is convenient for the system operator to update such values and the make the associated changes in additional derivatives. In some embodiments an alternative approach is taken in which all currently open tranches that is tranches which are listed on the exchange but not yet activated regardless of whether they have been sold or not in which any of the participants with adjusted reliability ratings are participating. In these cases one or more participants assigned to each affected tranche have undergone a change in its reliability rating. According to the embodiment for each such tranche statistics server recalculates the expected response profile and reliability rating of the tranche using the newly changed reliability ratings of the updated participants and then evaluates the result to see if the changes in overall expected tranche performance are significant. If they are then the digital exchange has the choice of either notifying any buyers of said tranches of the possibility of change in performance adjusting pricing or changing the participant mix if there are unassigned participants available for the affected tranches time slots in order to restore the tranches statistical profiles.

In step historical reliability or performance data for infrastructure elements is collected from iNodes or external data systems . Using one or more of the approaches described above pertaining to the various ways of computing participant reliability ratings in step a reliability rating is computed for each infrastructure element to be evaluated. Again analogously to the steps of in step reliability ratings for infrastructure elements are used to select elements for inclusion in one or more new tranches for creation of new derivative energy securities. In step the overall expected performance profile and reliability rating of new tranches is computed and new tranches are made available for purchase on digital exchange in step . Steps through are exactly equivalent to the analogous steps in but applied to infrastructure elements rather than participants.

It should be noted that in addition to time based derivatives spatial derivatives that is the rate of change of a variable with respect to position on the earth are used by statistics server in some embodiments when computing infrastructure reliability ratings. Spatial derivatives may be useful in determining an underlying grid problem for instance where the rate of failure of transformer increases as the distance to some point in space that is on the map space can be considered two dimensional for purposes of the invention possibly because of an underlying problem such as excessive tree movement due to high winds or even the presence of a disruptive actor.

In step historical environmental impact data for participants and infrastructure elements is collected from iNodes or external data systems . Environmental data can be extracted from iNodes using nodal allocation techniques described previously. For example if it is known that 25 of the energy flowing into load iNodes associated with master iNode is derived from solar power and the balance from a local coal based power plant then statistics server can compute the environmental impact of energy usage at iNodes corresponding to master iNode . Similarly if it is known from external data sources that a particular participant has purchased certain renewable energy credits then the environmental benefit of those credits can be attributed by statistics server to that particular participant. Using one or more of the approaches described above pertaining to the various ways of computing participant reliability ratings in step an environmental rating is computed for each participant or infrastructure element to be evaluated. Again analogously to the steps of in step environmental ratings for participants or infrastructure elements are used to select elements for inclusion in one or more new tranches for creation of new derivative energy securities. In step the overall expected performance profile and reliability rating of new tranches is computed and new tranches are made available for purchase on digital exchange in step . Steps through are exactly equivalent to the analogous steps in but applied to environmental ratings rather than reliability ratings.

It should be noted that in some embodiments of the invention some combination of the methods illustrated in is used. For instance it will not always be desirable to form tranches solely on the basis of environmental ratings without consideration of risks such as the risk of failure to perform or the risk of infrastructure failures or congestion. Thus in many embodiments one or more of participant reliability ratings environmental ratings and infrastructure reliability ratings will be combined into one or more composite ratings and used to assemble tranches and to make them available for sale. Furthermore the methods illustrated are exemplary only in some cases participant reliability ratings environmental ratings and infrastructure reliability ratings will be used for purposes other than the assembling of tranches for sale on digital exchange .

For example in some embodiments of the invention reliability and other ratings computed for users participants classes of users or participants or particular infrastructure elements or buildings are made available over data network to affected or interested parties in a variety of settings that are well established in the art as user interface media. For example in one embodiment an energy consumer s reliability rating is provided as an input or as a downloadable widget or applet for inclusion on the participant s personal web page or the participant s home page on a social network such as Facebook or LinkedIn . Users may choose to publish their environmental ratings to show they are very green or as an example to their friends and social network connections. Or they may elect to have the information provided in a private location in order to allow them to actively monitor either their participation in energy markets or their environmental footprint or more specialized variants such as their personal carbon footprint . Indeed such information could be augmented with information gathered from exogenous sources in order to allow a participant to measure and perhaps actively manage their impact on the environment or their profits from participation . In some embodiments carbon footprint data pertaining to participants is gathered via external data sources with their permission from retailers for example by feeding data derived from the mashing up of point of sale purchase data for a given consumer and carbon footprint data of the specific products purchased in order to provide an estimate of the carbon footprint of the participant . In fact statistics server in some embodiments computes an estimated total carbon footprint or total footprint in terms of any externalities including other pollutants renewability labor exploitation etc. of a participant or a class of participants particularly where a class of participants is organized for the purpose of collectively improving their performance as for example a green neighborhood or a renewables society for display to the participant or class of participants via one or more user interface methods known in the art including but not limited to social networks mobile phone applications or web pages. Such computations can be performed by statistics server by collecting as much data as possible about the environmental impact of said participants from external data sources and from various iNodes and and then estimating the total fraction of energy usage measured by the iNodes for example by gathering total usage from operations database when utilities participate and the total fraction of retail purchases measured by the available retail environmental impact data from external data sources and then extrapolating to estimate each participants or class of participants total environmental impact. Such estimates could be adjusted by multiplying by a number greater than one to account for the unmeasured contributions such as energy usage at work on the road and so forth although in some embodiments of the invention participants who use electric vehicles or mass transit would be able to include transport data in the more accurate as measured part of their environmental footprints . It will be appreciated that there are many ways of computing estimated environmental impacts or impacts from other externalities once extensive electrical energy usage data is available to seed the computation even in the absence of external data proportional measured rates of environmental impact on a per power output basis could be compared to overall averages from the economy as a whole to estimate how much more or less than average a given participant uses or contributes in the case of negative externalities such as carbon . Thus according to the invention reasonably indicative measures of an individual s or a household s or a group s impact on the environment can be made using only data from iNodes.

Steps are strongly analogous to the corresponding steps in except they apply to inclusion or exclusion of particular users from user classes rather than reliability ratings.

In another embodiment of the invention user classes are created based on energy usage and environmental footprints of users and this information is made available to government agencies for use in creating differential taxation systems to encourage environmentally responsible behaviors. For example in some neighborhoods tax credits could be provided to ratepayers also citizens taxpayers and users who achieve certain environmental footprint reduction targets and optionally tax penalties could be applied to those who exceeded some minimal environmental footprint standard.

While the use of reliability ratings as just described provides a useful means for defining a plurality of energy derivative securities with varying price and risk points it does not address the allocation of risk among the various parties. For example when a tranche is created which provides for the generation on demand of 5 megawatts of wind generated power with a very high reliability rating it remains unclear what happens if the activation request is satisfied only to a level of 4 megawatts. The buyer and activator of such a security expected to received 5 megawatts presumably generated by a large number of independent power producers for instance by home solar panels and generation from small wind turbines and may now have to buy the extra megawatt at a higher than bargained for price or he may simply have a shortage of one megawatt he may choose to curtail some of his own electrical loads as a result . Clearly a very real cost is associated with the failure of the security when activated to deliver the expected energy response.

There are several ways according to the invention that this risk be allocated among an exchange a buyer of a complex energy security and the various participants whose agreement to shed load or generate electricity on demand are packaged into the security by the exchange. In some embodiments of the invention the buyer of a security absorbs the added costs of the failure on the part of the exchange or its participants to deliver the promised additional load and clearly in these embodiments it is the buyer who assumes the risk of such non performance. In such cases typically the buyer will demand a lower price for such securities relative to others in which he does not assume such risks. In other embodiments an exchange assumes the risk of non performance for instance by promising to deliver following the previous example 5 megawatts at an agreed price no matter what if the security is activated. In these embodiments if the 5 megawatts of supply is not achieved by activating designated response packages that were used to build the derivative energy security the exchange activates additional response packages until the required supply level is achieved or alternatively the exchange buys power on the open market presumably at higher prices since dispatching of distributed energy generation by buyers of energy securities will typically be done during periods of high energy demand and therefore high prices . In some embodiments an exchange mitigates its own risk by passing on at least some of the costs of assuming the risk of delivery of the underlying energy resources associated with derivative energy securities to exchange participants who failed to meet their obligations to generate power or reduce it in the case of demand response activations . For example the price paid to participants for their actual energy generation or curtailment in response to activations is in some embodiments determined at least in part by the reliability rating the particular participant has established. Participants who consistently honor their obligations and thus have higher reliability ratings will received higher prices for their energy actions taken in response to activations of exchange traded securities while those who consistently failed to honor their obligations would have low reliability ratings and would therefore receive significantly lower prices. In other embodiments some participants who desire higher prices and who are confident of their ability to deliver select a different pricing arrangement in which they receive much higher prices each time they generate or curtail usage of power in response to activation of a response package of which they are part. In return for the higher prices these participants agree ahead of time that when they fail to take a requested action which they should according to their established preferences have taken then their accounts will be decremented by the same high price or the same price with an agreed upon discount rate. That is they have to pay when they fail to meet their obligations. In most embodiments the payments by a particular participant to the exchange for failing to execute promised energy actions will be capped at the level of payments the participant has received for a specified time period. That is in most embodiments consumers who elect to actively participate in demand response or distributed energy generation programs using a digital exchange will never have to pay the exchange anything but their earnings can be reduced to zero if they fail to meet their obligations as often as they succeed. However this is not a limitation of the invention in some cases participants may be business entities attempting to arbitrage the exchange s market and these participants may be willing and be allowed to be exposed to potential losses from their participation. For example a sub exchange might emerge in which a commercial entity arranges on its own behalf to have a large number of energy users participate in demand reduction and distributed energy generation programs through the sub exchange which itself acts as a participant on a main exchange . Such a sub exchange participant would assume the risks of non performance while choosing to maximize the price received for actions taken in the hope that like a main exchange they would be able to minimize or eliminate the risk of losses by actively managing their own participant base using their own methods and data or the main exchanges methods and available data for aggregation of users into tranches.

In another embodiment of the invention a curve step or piecewise linear is provided in each financial instrument that describes an incremental price for each megawatt of load shed or generated or discharged depending on the purpose of the security within a given time window for the response profile. Each curve has an associated probabilistic model which can vary along the curve e.g. a historical Probability Density Function PDF showing the probability of being able to activate x number of megawatts of specific capacity . The PDF could have megawatt intervals matching each incremental megawatt bin on the price curve. This method provides an additional method of managing risk on the exchange. The market maker the exchange is able to protect itself from exposure associated with single point pricing models where it assumes responsibility for the performance of a security but still enjoy the ability to have trading volume associated with the individual security the megawatt bins on the pricing curve provide ample opportunity for market participants to hedge risk and to identify arbitrage opportunities. With varying incremental pricing for each megawatt bin along the curve and the associated risk for each component of the tranche associated with such a curve multiple owners could in fact each purchase portions of the same tranche from the exchange according to the invention. This allows for and encourages a high degree of market fungibility because it enables small amounts of capacity kW MW etc. . . . and small amounts of energy in other securities kW h MW h etc. . . . to be traded and sold in part. It also enables a variety of smaller users to be matched via the exchange with large providers of energy resources on the electric grid.

In some embodiments of the invention exchanges primary or subsidiary voluntarily maintain reserves by keeping a supply of response packages unbundled that is not allocated to any tradable security on the exchange in order to be able to augment any response packages that threaten to miss their committed activation results. Maintenance of reserves obviously reduces the revenue potential for the exchange which usually only generates income when securities are traded and when the underlying response packages of securities are activated ideally this reduction is more than offset by the increase in revenues resulting from the higher prices chargeable by the exchange when it agrees to assume the risk of non performance.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention and referring to a digital exchange very much like the one illustrated in and described above with reference to that figure is shown. The embodiment further comprises pricing server which is coupled via network to statistics server and rules engine . Pricing server is adapted to retrieve data from various data sources within digital exchange including but not limited to configuration data from configuration database transaction data from transaction database and event data from event database . Pricing server may also optionally be adapted to interact via communications interface with one or more trader iNodes home iNodes local iNodes or regional iNodes . As before the allocation of functions between rules engine statistics server pricing server and the various databases which are typically capable of performing computation using stored procedures or other methods known in the art is exemplary in nature and highlights certain functional relationships within the invention. It is possible within the scope of the invention to combine the roles of one or more of these functions or parts thereof without necessarily departing from the scope of the invention. For example the functions of pricing server could be combined with those of statistics server without loss of scope or functionality. Such an arrangement might be commonplace in some embodiments as statistics server and pricing server perform related functions. Similarly in some cases it may be desirable to distribute the functions of pricing server across several identically or similarly configured machines in order to achieve scale and robustness i.e. fault tolerance of the overall invention again without departing from the scope of the invention. What will be appreciated by one having ordinary skill of the art however as he reads through the following descriptions of exemplary functions of pricing server is that the high dimensionality and complex nature of the computations envisioned by the inventors are only executable in any practical sense on specific machines that have been designed or configured to optimally meet the computational demands of pricing server . An exemplary pricing server configuration comprises a general purpose computer with multiple CPU cores a very fast front side bus for rapid memory access such as 1 GHz bus clock speed and several gigabytes of random access memory RAM . In some embodiments shared memory architectures are used allowing each of the processors to access a shared memory containing common data elements. Pricing server may be programmed using multiple threaded programming techniques known in the art or using programming tools and file system architectures optimized for massively parallel computing. For example in some embodiments pricing server will be implemented on a HADOOP computer cluster that acts as a single large scale virtual computer and will be programmed using the well known MapReduce parallelization technique in order to allow for very large scale via the use of potentially hundreds or thousands of processors. In other embodiments parallelized database systems such as GREENPLUM are used to achieve the necessary scalability. It should be appreciated that there are several implementation approaches available that are well known in the art that will enable the scale needed to allow pricing server to rapidly perform complex computations such as the exemplary embodiments described herein as part of a large scale energy derivatives market or digital exchange it is not imagined that it would be possible to carry out the functions of pricing server in one s head or via a series of consultations of human beings working together. The same comments just made concerning architecture scaling and combinatory possibilities among functional elements of the invention apply equally to all of the software elements that comprise digital exchange .

In an embodiment of the invention pricing server provides real time price quotes to traders associated with trader iNodes on request for a plurality of derivative energy securities available to be purchased from digital exchange . Note that once a security has been purchased from digital exchange it may be resold by the buyer to any other eligible participants in digital exchange at market prices which are not set by pricing server . Pricing server may however provide the starting price for newly listed or at least heretofore unpurchased securities since digital exchange is often the first seller as at least some securities traded on it represent aggregated response packages assembled by digital exchange as described herein. Starting prices for each security are computed by pricing server based on parameters passed to it by rules engine which normally sends a notification and request for pricing to pricing server when a new security is created. In typical embodiments of the invention parameters passed to pricing server for initial pricing of securities comprise at least a time period start time and duration in the future when the security is eligible to be activated an aggregate reliability rating of the tranche comprising the security the size of the security amount of energy involved and a product identifier.

In another embodiment of the invention pricing server receives requests from home iNodes local iNodes or regional iNodes for pricing information and computes or looks up certain prices may be set to static values by digital exchange current prices for immediate energy resource actions which may be taken by automated agents operating with home iNode or by actual consumers who are interactively connected to one or more of the respective iNodes. According to this embodiment digital exchange may elect to provide real time pricing to potential spot participants who may elect to discharge from generation or storage assets electricity or to reduce demand in excess of or contravention to their normal preferences because of a strong market need that is reflected in high prices quoted by digital exchange . According to the invention market participants may also elect to absorb energy based on such pricing signals when it is favorable to increase consumption or store energy. For example during a wind ramping event it is beneficial for wind providers and network operators to increase consumption and storage to absorb excess energy that would otherwise destabilize the network. Such a mechanism allows digital exchange to seek additional capacity on the fly in response to market demand or to serious events on the grid. For example if a grid outage occurs in a region digital exchange may elect to quote a high price for immediate demand reductions from any participating iNodes in the affected region. In a related embodiment digital exchange proactively sends notifications of price changes to regional iNodes local iNodes home iNodes or even trader iNodes in order to stimulate market based actions among the various participants associated with the respective iNodes. The ability to provide dynamic price signals to participants of all sizes as required or via push reporting and to selectively do so based on any of a number of discriminators such as location or region of target iNodes type of consumer associated with target iNodes probability that devices at target iNodes will be available to meet the need this can be determined dynamically based on historical performance data as discussed above and any other relevant attributes of iNodes or their associated market participants.

According to the invention there are several different types of securitized products that may be assembled by and traded on digital exchange . Several possible products will be described here as examples of securities although it is emphasized that the following product descriptions collectively comprise an exemplary list and not a complete list of product types that may be offered according to the invention. A very simple type of product is a real time energy allocation contract. An exchange may opt to retain capacity in reserve not only for risk mitigation as mentioned above but also to provide a volume of distributed energy or aggregated demand reduction that may be purchased and immediately activated this embodiment operates very much like a spot market for a commodity . In addition some participants in control of one or more energy resources may choose to participate only in real time transactions in essence using their energy assets e.g. storage capability distributed generation capability or demand reduction capability as a means to execute arbitrage strategies. In some embodiments digital exchange allows such participants to set their own minimum prices for distributed generation or demand reduction while in others such participants are limited to either participating or not and the exchange sets the real time price using pricing server . This latter approach is preferable in some embodiments as pricing server attempts to set a price that will maximize overall value to digital exchange or the electric grid as a system. If digital exchange offers one or more securities that require it to internally manage risk and a price is set too low encouraging use of real time response packages there is a risk to the exchange that any reserve it requires for covering its own risk positions contracts to deliver or curtail power in which the exchange bears the risk of failure as described above and thus be forced in the event that the participants bundled in a security fail to meet their obligations to buy energy assets on the open market at unfavorable prices. In most cases it is likely that the exchange will use external risk management for traded securities by leveraging the flexibility of the PDF curves previously described which enable incremental pricing along the curve for each response profile within each bin of energy sized as determined by the exchange e.g. MW kW etc. . . . . In such a scenario the pricing for such securities will as the market becomes more liquid with size and sophistication of participants be entirely external. Although the exchange via either or both of statistics server and pricing server can provide extensive market intelligence information to participants that can help quantify the value of such securities it is not necessary according to the invention for digital exchange to actively price anything to be traded on the system.

Real time energy allocation products provide an excellent example for illustrating a variety of means pricing server uses according to the invention to deliver adaptive prices in very complex energy markets. In an embodiment of the invention digital exchange charges premium process for most energy securities by assuming all risk of non performance and guaranteeing buyers of energy securities a minimum or fixed availability of energy generation or demand reduction resources at the specified time. To offset the potential risk digital exchange also maintains a reserve of response packages to compensate for shortcomings from the resource packages included in its various marketed securities. Additionally in order to provide a hedge against those resources remaining idle due to full performance by participants included in activated energy securities digital exchange maintains an active spot market offering real time energy allocation units that are activated as soon as purchased or in some cases within some very short time period thereafter . The best mechanism for digital exchange to optimally balance demand for real time allocations against the exchange s need for risk mitigation and thereby to deliver profits is pricing. Specifically digital exchange is in a position from which it can dictate several key price variables in what is a very complex system in order to drive the system s equilibrium away from unprofitable to profitable operating regimes. Digital exchange can set prices dynamically for real time allocation contracts and provided it has arranged contractually for the privilege by varying the payoff to participants in energy resource actions such as distributed energy generation and demand reduction. Additionally digital exchange can set the starting price at which securities are offered when they are created although this price mechanism is weaker but probably most common because it is carried out significantly before the time period where real time decisions are being made and because while digital exchange can ask for a certain price for a given security it may be forced to adjust that price if no buyers are available who are willing to pay that price.

In order to determine optimal pricing strategies in this example and indeed in many other exemplary embodiments pricing server in an embodiment uses discreet event simulations in which likely outcomes over a large number of simulation experiments performed iteratively over a wide range of parameter combinations are calculated. After a large number of simulations parameter combinations are reviewed and a suitable parameter combination that delivers stability of the network high profitability and stable results is selected automatically. Stability of results refers to the variance of key output variables revenues profits idle capacity levels etc. for a given parameter combination in some cases a few simulation tests with a given parameter combination will show very good profitability but other tests with the same parameters will show very poor results. In such situations the variance of key output variables is high and the parameter combination can be considered relatively unstable. Stability of the network refers to a range of values describing a regime in which the solution meets the physical operational and policy constraints under which the grid operates. Acceptance criteria such as maximum variance or more preferably a combination of profitability and stability for instance maximizing profitability subject to a maximum allowable variance are provided to pricing server by rules engine or are obtained by pricing server directly from configuration database note that different products or security types may have different acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria can be expressed for each individual security or for classes of securities including geographic or market distributions size of security in terms of monetary value or amount of energy affected or any other attribute by which securities can be grouped. When performing simulation testing pricing server uses calculated performance and risk profiles for the security being studied and historical data regarding likely demand in the time period to be simulated to determine the statistical behavior of the various elements to be simulated use of historical data or statistical profiles in simulation model building is well known in the art . In other embodiments pricing server uses a combination of simulation and direct calculation to determine optimal prices when sufficiently complete closed form mathematical functions are available to describe key system elements. For example if it is determined from analysis of historical data that a simple price elasticity curve describes the relationship between price of real time allocations and demand then this function which may be a simple linear relationship or a polynomial approximation or a spline or a combination of several distinct functions which between them covers the whole range of possible values of the independent variable may be used to compute needed quantities or may be used as an input to a simulation model . In another embodiment of the invention pricing server uses constraint based optimization techniques known in the art to compute an optimal range of prices for various products. It will be understood by those having ordinary skill the art that there are many mathematical approaches to finding an optimal operating regime in a highly dimensional parameter space other candidate techniques include genetic algorithms neural networks Tabu search simulated annealing and the like. In another embodiment of the invention the pricing server may not actively set a price but may simply calculate optimal prices based on any one or combination of the factors described and then make the calculated prices available to market participants to enable them to better participate.

In another embodiment of the invention futures contracts or futures are offered to buyers participating in digital exchange in which buyers purchase contracts granting them the obligation to activate a tranche that is a plurality of response packages each themselves consisting of a plurality of response profiles of distributed energy generation demand reduction or both at some fixed time or time period in the future on a particular delivery date or final settlement date . Similarly in another embodiment of the invention options contracts or a options are offered to buyers participating in digital exchange in which buyers purchase contracts granting them the right but not the obligation to activate a tranche that is a plurality of response packages each themselves consisting of a plurality of response profiles of distributed energy generation demand reduction or both at some fixed time or time period in the future on a particular delivery date or final settlement date In either case futures or options for instance a product of this type might grant the buyer the right or obligation to activate a dispatchable 10 megawatt tranche of distributed energy generation resources any time between noon and one o clock in the afternoon on a particular day in the future. Futures are priced by digital exchange initially when they are placed on the market as discussed above as it is digital exchange that carries out any activation requests made by holders of such securities in a sense in some cases digital exchange is the holder of the underlying commodity energy because it has the ability to send activation requests to a large number of potentially small owners of energy resources who in turn are paid by digital exchange is they fulfill requested actions said payment being at a price determined by digital exchange and potentially including adjustments based on the owners respective reliability ratings . According to the invention after energy resources are activated payment from transactions on digital exchange may occur immediately or at a later date depending on the business decisions made by digital exchange to clear transactions and the nature of the contracts with market participants. Once a first buyer has purchased such a security it may in some embodiments be listed on the exchange again by the holder of the security and sold to any willing buyer at any price the buyer and new holder is willing to pay. It is expected that digital exchange will calculate using pricing server its initial offer price based on historical behavior of similar securities which will typically vary in price as the maturity eligible activation date approaches.

Initial prices of futures or options may be based on internal risk external risk or mixed models. Internal risk models refer to situations described above in which digital exchange assumes the risk of non performance while external risk models refer to situations also described above in which holders of futures or options assume the risks of non performance. Generally prices of external risk adjusted futures will be lower than those of internal risk adjusted futures as the lower price reflects the lower value of a security which imposes a higher burden of risk on its holder. A mixed model is one where an intermediate path is taken and both parties assume some part of the risk of failure to perform. There are a number of possible ways in which this can be accomplished. For example and in one embodiment of the invention digital exchange offers futures and options contract for energy generation of a specified amount in which the quantity is specified to be a target amount plus or minus a tolerance range of a certain percentage any amount within this tolerance range can be delivered on activation by digital exchange with no price adjustment. But if digital exchange fails to deliver at least the required minimum target quantity less tolerance range it will be obligated to pay a penalty or compensatory payment to the activating holder of the relevant security to compensate the holder for its additional costs resulting from receiving an inadequate amount of energy. On the other hand if too much is delivered that is more than the target amount plus the tolerance range digital exchange may again suffer a penalty in most cases this will be because the activating holder of the relevant security will not be required to pay for any energy generated above the contractual maximum level leaving payment for this excess to the digital exchange . This embodiment provides one example of a mixed risk model it should be understood that it is merely exemplary and that there are many other possible variations within the scope of the invention.

In another embodiment of the invention additional securities are made available by digital exchange to account for risk such that digital exchange is not responsible for underwriting the risk of non delivery or over delivery of energy resources. According to the invention delivery can refer to discharge or absorption of energy resources from the electrical grid. An additional security called an energy default swap or EDS may be offered on digital exchange to enable market participants to obtain protection for their obligations in energy markets due to their holdings of securities traded on digital exchange . In one example a protection buyer and a protection seller enter into a standardized contact relating to the financial obligations of the protection buyer with reference to a third party known as a reference entity . For example a bilateral contract could be used where the protection buyer pays a periodic fee to the protection seller in return for a contingent payment by the seller upon a delivery event where the protection buyer s failure to deliver or over delivery of some part of the energy resources specified in any number of energy related securities may require payment as indicated in the relevant contract. The energy default swaps are used to enable further speculation or hedging of risks that underling energy securities are not settled as expected. EDS swaps offer protection if securities are cleared as expected in return for regular insurance like premiums. In another embodiment of this invention an index of energy default swaps is listed by digital exchange . Such an energy default swap index or EDS Index is a series of energy default swaps based on a portfolio of bonds that consist of energy supply or consumption contracts with specified payment structures and delivery events. A decline in an EDS Index signifies investor sentiment that obligations of contract will not be met. Likewise an increase in an EDS Index signifies investor sentiment looking for energy securities to perform better than expected. An EDS Index will have a number of series representing different realization times of securities and different tranches per series using a weighting mechanism determined by statistics server based on actual volume of available securities to be indexed. An EDS Index enables the market to continuously update the value of underlying energy contracts even as sentiment towards tranche performance continues to change. This is significant because an EDS index gives digital exchange the capability to if it so chooses leave reliability ratings and expected performance profiles for response profiles and tranches fixed once initially created and listed on digital exchange while still enabling the market to hedge risk as reliability ratings or other ratings of underlying assets change prior to maturity or execution. According to the invention a number of different indices such as EDS Indices can be created to enable hedging of risk and speculation on other underlying assets traded on digital exchange .

In another embodiment of the invention variance swaps may be listed and sold via digital exchange . Variance swaps are a derivative contract that allows counterparties to trade the future realized volatility of an underlying asset against its current implied volatility via digital exchange . This allows investors to speculate on or hedge risks associated with the magnitude of volatility in supply demand frequency or other key metrics. Variable swap contracts are generally between two parties with one party paying a fixed amount agreed upon at inception of a deal although according to the invention a group of smaller parties might be matched with a larger counterparty. The other party or group of aligned parties pays an amount based upon the realized variance of price changes of underlying products which is one of the indices made possible by digital exchange statistics server and pricing server . Net payoff to counterparties is a difference between variance of price changes of underlying products and a related index and is settled in cash at expiration of each contract.

In another embodiment of the invention total return swaps or total rate of return swaps for all or part of particular energy securities held or for a portfolio of securities are traded between two or more parties via digital exchange . For example a party might sell the total return any future gains or losses on a reference asset a given held security or basket of securities in exchange for a fixed or floating cash flow that is independent of fluctuations in the value of the reference asset with respect to time. This provides an additional type of protection for market participants such that protection against the loss of value irrespective of cause is also available above and beyond protections available against delivery events via the energy default swap.

In another embodiment of the invention an exchange traded fund or ETF is created by statistics server from pools of assets e.g. capacity demand bonds etc. . . . on digital exchange . Exchange traded funds enable fund managers to create investment vehicles that trade at approximately the same price as the net value of a collection of assets over the course of a trading day.

In another embodiment of this invention conversion between either or both of energy types and their associated externalities can be exchanged in an efficient manner via digital exchange . Though a liquid market place provided by digital exchange it is possible for counterparties to exchange energy attributes or externalities e.g. NO SO Carbon emissions etc. . . . in order to create more efficient markets to and improve ability of energy producers and consumers to participate fully in market based solutions and to deal with environmental challenges. According to the invention this may be done either where externalities remain coupled to the energy itself or where they are decoupled and traded in their own right. However this model encourages market integration which can ultimately be used to re couple energy and its associated externalities such that pollution and other externalities can be more appropriately priced

In another embodiment of the invention an insurance like security product is marketed by digital exchange . In order to aid large energy users or utilities to manage risk of their operations digital exchange commits to maintain a specified level of dispatchable distributed energy generation or demand reduction in reserve for possible activation at an agreed price by holders of such securities. Such insurance securities are priced by digital exchange when placed on the exchange for initial purchase. Initial pricing of insurance securities will depend on several factors and will typically be computed by pricing server as described above using simulation or other approaches. Factors that may in some embodiments influence initial pricing of insurance securities include the length of time during which the reserve will maintained the amount of advance notice required to be given by a holder of an insurance security of intended activation of some or all of the reserve the underlying response packages that are used as the reserve and their potential value in other roles as response packages used for reserves will not be available for other potentially profitable uses and the presence or absence of forecasted major energy shortage or surplus events. To the extent that digital exchange is able to leverage its knowledge of large scale market and grid dynamics to accurately forecast energy demand at least as it affects holders of such securities it is possible for pricing server to calculate initial prices that should deliver profits to digital exchange. Once a first buyer has purchased such a security it may in some embodiments be listed on the exchange again by the holder of the security and sold to any willing buyer at any price the buyer and new holder is willing to pay.

In the event of activation by a holder of an insurance security the holder is required to pay the agreed price for energy delivered or demand response results delivered as a result of such activation. In some embodiments of the invention energy prices to be charged in event of activation are fixed at the time of sale of the insurance security being an essential attribute of the security. In other embodiments insurance securities are structured so that digital exchange maintains a reserve and guarantees adequate capacity and so that prices of actual distributed energy generation or demand reduction delivered to a holder of such a security are set by the market usually within limits generally a maximum is set but a minimum could also be established . Such an approach might desirable for holders of insurance securities who are willing to undertake a certain amount of price risk as long as they can be certain of having the power they need or of being able to shed the power they need to in the case of demand reduction insurance securities when they need it the price risk is offset by the generally lower initial sales price of such insurance securities initial selling prices would tend to be lower because digital exchange would be able to generate higher revenue upon activation because activation will typically only occur when there is risk of supply for the holder which typically would also be a time of high market prices for the underlying energy assets . As in the case of initial selling price of insurance securities pricing server will in some embodiments be used to compute the fixed price or the limits for securities that will use market based prices for actual energy asset usage and this price or these limits will become part of the insurance security as marketed.

In some embodiments of the invention insurance securities similar to those just described will be packaged with a slightly different guarantee . In these embodiments rather than guarantee that a fixed amount of capacity will be reserved for each specific insurance security contract sold insurance securities are written to guarantee delivery at the prices specified without specifically committing to maintain a specific level of reserves. According to these embodiments statistics server computes for each time period typically for each hour but other time periods may be used a minimum reserve level to be maintained separately for distributed energy generation insurance contracts and demand response insurance contracts by digital exchange in order to ensure that adequate reserves will be available for any likely combination of activations. Statistics server uses historical data concerning overall market demand for energy and historical patterns of insurance contract activations as well as the reliability ratings and expected responses of the participants whose energy assets are in the reserve capacity typically using iterative simulation experiments to determine an optimal reserve level for each type of energy asset. Clearly digital exchange assumes a higher level of risk by using a single reserve of capacity to serve against a potentially large number of insurance securities rather than using a dedicated reserve for each insurance security individually but this risk is assumed in order that higher overall profits may be obtained as a far lower percentage of the potentially profit generating assets available to digital exchange will be tied up in insurance contracts. Statistics server will typically in its simulation runs target the highest overall profit level or degree of electric grid system stability by computing system benefits as well as expected profits from selling insurance contracts and from activations of insurance reserves as these activations are profitable too the profitability problem of large reserves is rather that in the absence of activations a large amount of capacity is on the bench not generating revenues for digital exchange .

In another embodiment of the invention insurance like securities to protect market participants from actual physical reliability of assets are listed and sold on digital exchange . The reliability profile and historical data for a given infrastructure asset primarily albeit not exclusively targeted at transmission and distribution to include routine maintenance that may involve shutting down a given asset as well potentially cataclysmic events that can cause interruptions of service or operation is calculated by statistics server and made available to participants. This information can be used by market participants to hedge against the risk that given energy securities purchased on digital exchange might lose value due to the isolation of such an asset from all or part of a distribution network. For example if a large manufacturer purchases a futures contract for a large amount of electricity to be provided over the next year from a given supplier there may be a strong desire to hedge against the risk that the given supplier becomes isolated from the grid due to a transmission line failure that results in a default on the initial contract potentially exposing the manufacturer to additional risk from future and unknown market conditions. These insurance like securities could be swaps where protection is arranged between two or more counterparties with or without an additional reference party and with or without the involvement of digital exchange beyond listing and clearing of standardized contracts listed on digital exchange . It will be appreciated that a number of other contractual arrangements could be standardized and utilized by digital exchange to match counterparties or groups of counterparties such that all market participants can more effectively hedge risk and operate more effectively.

In another embodiment of the invention ancillary services securities are packaged and sold by digital exchange . Today utilities and grid operators use traditional generation assets largely combined cycle gas turbine plants and diesel standby generators to provide ancillary services for the electric grid. Ancillary services refers to any number of services to manage power quality according to operational physical and policy constraints of the electric grid system including but not limited to transmission level frequency response transmission level regulating and standing reserve transmission level reactive power distribution level security of supply contributions distribution level quality of supply services and distribution level voltage and power flow management services. According to the invention demand side management or distributed energy resources storage or generation can be packaged into securities to provide ancillary services by statistics server such that they can be listed on digital exchange . Again the use of response profiles and statistical models for risk can be provided to market participants such that risk can be effectively managed and allocated. The management of delivery uncertainty and the impacts of physical network constraints on the delivery of services can also be incorporated into the model. Prior to listing or upon listing pricing could be initially set and possibly subsequently adjusted by pricing server . The use of available curtailable or interruptible loads along with or independent of distributed energy resources to provide ancillary services via an exchange is significant for a number of reasons. Through creation of a security to provide said services for a given time period start time and duration it is possible for users providing services by curtailing or interrupting loads or by discharging energy into the grid system from a multitude of potential devices to be fairly compensated for their participation in the market by providing a crucial service. This fair compensation is derived from the ability of the market to discern fair value by providing transparent opportunities for comparison to other options for meeting ancillary services requirements imposed by operational policy or physical network constraints. Moreover via digital exchange market participants can effectively compare the impact and cost of ancillary services provision at various levels of the grid as a network i.e. provision by commercial scale entities at the transmission level or via demand side management and distributed generation at the distribution level . Differences in levels of service provision can have secondary and tertiary impacts on power quality within components of the service areas.

In another embodiment of the invention transmission rights securities both physical transmission rights PTRs and financial transmission rights FTRs with equivalent effect can be listed individually or packaged together as desired by a market participant and made available on digital exchange as either a primary or secondary market. A market participant or issuing authority in a primary marker lists transmission rights based on standard attributes required for trading on digital exchange . Current transmission rights trading methods have almost no transparency on top of insufficient volume and a lack of firmness. As PTRs facilitate inter zonal trades and price hedges they promote market liquidity by enabling market participants to enter new markets. FTRs can be described as an equivalent product to forward PTRs. FTRs are necessary in markets coupled exclusively implicitly in order to incorporate forward energy contracts and financial OTC especially cross border or interconnection trading and solutions for transmission risk hedging. Increases in fungibility enable network participants to mitigate exposure to increasingly constrained physical network requirements that result in substantial tiered pricing increases. These transmission assets can be categorized into multiple products i.e. base peak off peak etc. . . . . With sufficient market liquidity and via digital exchange market parties can also use financial Contracts for Differences CfDs . For example one party might wish to buy a certain amount of energy in a Zone A and sell it in a Zone B whereas another party might intend to set up the exact opposite trade. In this scenario the settlement of CfDs is purely financial and the holders pay the difference between pricing zones. CfDs would allow rapid intra day position movements and ensure coherence with futures markets for arbitrage opportunities such that a continuous trading approach is likely.

In another embodiment of the invention congestion and loss management securities are packaged and sold by digital exchange . Although secondary markets for transmission rights can have significant impact on congestion the combination of securities available to market participants via digital exchange enables participants to better understand how multiple approaches may have synergistic effects and how a wide area view of the network may yield greater efficiencies due to larger diversity of physical infrastructure assets load requirements and available generation and storage options. Utilities and grid operators today struggle with the limitations of the existing grid and expectations are that this problem will only get worse as renewable energy sources are brought online since these sources such as wind and solar are both highly variable and uncertain and are often located in regions where the grid is not ill equipped to handle the increased demand having been designed for an electricity industry built around large centralized generation facilities and large population centers with relatively consistent and predictable loads . To mitigate congestion and loss problems digital exchange packages and sells congestion and loss management securities that commit to automatically take actions of a specified magnitude whenever load factors on a specified plurality of grid elements such as tie lines exceed a specified level. For example if load on a specified tie line exceeds 75 of rated capacity digital exchange would be obligated to automatically take action to reduce demand on the tie line by a fixed amount such as 5 megawatts or 50 MW for a transmission bus or interchange etc. . Such congestion and loss securities are priced by digital exchange when placed on the exchange for initial purchase. Initial pricing of congestion and loss securities will depend on several factors and will typically be computed by pricing server as described above using simulation or other approaches. Factors that may in some embodiments influence initial pricing of congestion and loss securities include the length of time for which the commitment to act exists the underlying response packages that are likely to be used in congestion or loss management events and whether digital exchange or a third party will hold any such response packages in reserve against congestion or loss management events and their potential value in other roles as response packages used for reserves will not be available for other potentially profitable uses and the presence or absence of forecasted major energy shortage or surplus events that may lead to congestion of relevant grid elements or large losses at key grid constraints. To the extent that digital exchange is able to leverage its knowledge of large scale market and grid dynamics to accurately forecast energy demand at least as it affects holders of such securities it is possible for pricing server to calculate initial prices that should deliver profits to digital exchange and optimal system benefits to grid and market participants. Once a first buyer has purchased such a security it may in some embodiments be listed on the exchange again by the holder of the security and sold to any willing buyer at any price the buyer and new holder is willing to pay. Such a security may also be relisted in part on the digital exchange .

In another embodiment of the invention securities are packaged based on particular business needs e.g. balancing load within a given service area preferences e.g. use of demand resources distributed generation etc. and asset characteristics or combinations thereof specified by a user and made available on digital exchange . The user can specify primary secondary and tertiary criteria for structuring a response profile. In some cases one or more particular types of security e.g. loads sources transmission rights distribution rights etc. . . . can be packaged by statistics server into a composite security. For example a user could have a need to provide voltage support or other ancillary services within a region where statistics server computes a combination of available demand resources and distributed generation sources that are available to meet the business need specified by the user. This composite group of assets is then packaged into a response profile which is subsequently tranched into tradable bins of varying assets based on the parameters set by the user within limits of rules set by digital exchange . According to the invention this self service method of creating structured energy related derivatives based on user preferences and needs can be used to create any number of complex energy securities to meet compelling business needs to manage diverse energy resources and both physical and financial risks associated therein. There are according to the invention a large number of ways to develop various securities based on relative weightings of quantitative assessments of underlying energy assets. For example a user could choose to have a complex security where aggregation is primarily based on users of particular reliability ratings is structured based upon a time based derivative of such reliability ratings and is further structured based on upon a specific geographic target region or no region at all. This is another means of managing risk associated with digital exchange and market participants.

In another embodiment of the invention either or both a user and digital exchange can specify preferences for packaging of composite energy securities combining transmission related rights with energy sources and sinks loads on a network into single securities or into composite baskets of securities. For example packaging of transmission rights across either or both transmission and distribution level assets along with a particular energy source on a network may be carried out in order to enable node to node contracts to be entered into by market participants. By packaging a combination of energy assets required to provide energy services across a network digital exchange can enable true nodal allocation of resources by combining energy assets from diverse market participants to rapidly create composite products. In another embodiment of the invention additional line losses due to a marginal increase in transmission as a result of additional demand could be attributed to each additional user such that there was no negative effect on pre existing arrangements with previously related parties on a network. This would in effect require a purchaser of end to end energy products to purchase sufficient energy such that line losses across transmission and distribution network paths used were offset. As line losses on a physically constrained network can be easily modeled it is possible to attribute marginal increases in losses to particular purchasers responsible for increasing capacity utilization of affected lines.

In another embodiment of the invention and as an example of assembly of energy securities to satisfy diverse business needs market participants create affinity portfolios of energy securities. Examples of affinities could include hydro generation wind generation any green source low carbon sources below a specified cap solar or stored solar energy etc. . . . . It will be appreciated according to the invention that many such affinities can exist and that risk can be hedged as described. For example a large consumer products company may elect to spend considerable funds to create a green brand in part by committing publicly to obtain 100 of its energy from green sources which of course could be defined in many ways as for instance that an energy source is green if it is either renewable or a very low carbon generator . Such a company may desire to purchase considerable futures contracts for various energy sources that meet its definition of green in order to assure a ready supply of green energy. Furthermore in order to hedge against the risk that it may be unable to obtain needed green energy such a company may choose to engage in a diversified approach involving a variety of securities to minimize its exposure for example by using swaps to hedge financial risks and demand response options to cause others to shed loads and thus to both free up more green supply and to mitigate the environmental impact of any non green power used by offsetting it with an equivalent reduction of non green power used elsewhere on the grid since the costs of re branding would be grossly excessive.

In another embodiment of the invention a user could request a custom blend of assets in a structured security to be listed on digital exchange where the asset blend is determined by a consultation or survey of the user which is used by statistics server to create tranches which are subsequently priced by pricing server listed and sold. According to the invention the asset blend could be determined for the user by statistics server using either or both any unallocated energy assets available to digital exchange and energy assets contained in other securities which can be purchased in their entirety or in part to create a desired security meeting the needs or preferences of the user. The unique capability of digital exchange to facilitate continuous assignment or reassignment of energy assets to allocate them such that they provide the highest value to an electrical grid network as determined by the market is a unique function that enhances market integration liquidity and efficiency.

According to an embodiment of the invention and referring to in addition to iNodes being coupled with electrical loads and electrical sources iNodes are also coupled to transmission equipment and distribution equipment and are adapted to collect data from both transmission equipment and distribution equipment arranged throughout electric grid . Transmission equipment generally are high voltage systems or extra high voltage EHV systems which are generally greater than 345 000 volts in the context of power transmission engineering intended to transport or transmit electricity for long distances with low losses. Distribution equipment generally comprises medium and low voltage systems used to distribute electricity from transmission systems to end users. Transmission iNodes collect information regarding state of transmission lines or equipment as energy is transmitted along paths from sources to loads or sinks . Similarly distribution iNodes collect information regarding state of distribution lines or equipment as energy is distributed from transmission systems to loads or sinks . Variables such as voltage current frequency wire resistance phase time location coordinates power flow limits temperature line sag AC or DC or others including but not limited to external variables measurable at physical locations associated with transmission systems or distribution systems such as wind speeds temperature precipitation and the like can be collected by transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes . These iNodes may use Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA or any number of other protocols and methods to relay sensor information from a network element to a server system via overlay packet data network . For example a distribution substation is a distribution system with an associated distribution iNode and a high voltage DC to AC converter is a transmission system with an associated transmission iNode . Both transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes may have hierarchies of subordinate iNodes in a similar fashion to the home iNode networks described with reference to and elsewhere. Common examples of network elements likely to possess an associated transmission iNode include feeders busses transformers wires and instruments associated with transmission of electricity to end users. Each section of a transmission or distribution grid will typically affect one or more measured attributes or variables that can be measured and communicated to a server system by transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes . For instance a high voltage wire between two substations will have a loss related to electric current passing along it and iNodes associated with each of the substations will be able to communicate information about losses or factors which can be related to or indicative of losses to a server system adapted to compute and account for losses. Examples of such server systems include digital exchange and also simulation and modeling server described below with reference to . Thus each device such as a substation feeder or a voltage convertor has a specific value assigned to it depending on how it affects properties of electricity being transmitted or distributed through by or under control of the device.

According to another embodiment of the invention transmission iNodes or distribution iNodes or both are used for active management of power quality attributes associated with or controlled by transmission systems or distribution systems . One example of this use of iNodes is the communication of detailed information e.g. voltage frequency temperature or current relating to line characteristics from iNodes via data network to modeling and simulation server or digital exchange to enable effective modeling of transmission dynamics allocation of losses or costs associated with network usage including pricing of transmission costs or of unbundling of ancillary services due to imbalances on a network associated with facilitating a given transaction across the network to market participants or any combination thereof. This information can according to the invention be transmitted from transmission iNodes or distribution iNodes or both using packet data network to a server system connected to packet data network via communications interface . Once information from iNodes pertaining to either a transmission or a distribution network or both sometimes in terms of an effective end to end path from an energy source to an energy sink on a network as in a fully nodal allocation system that allocates all costs benefits and externalities on a node by node basis throughout a network or a region of a network it is possible for digital exchange to compute the performance of network assets on either a considered exemplary path or similar alternate paths or all possible paths or some portion thereof using simulation and modeling server which may itself consider real data from an iNode network simulated data or both. When combined with data from other iNodes on packet data network for example those associated with end users generators or storage operators digital exchange enables market participants or systems under their control or dispatching authorities to dispatch energy generation and storage resources such as pumped hydro storage flywheel storage wind generators and the like or demand side resources or both in any combination by discharging consuming or storing energy to or from the grid helping electrical systems meet operational policy or physical constraints or some combination thereof. For example ancillary services which are generally defined as functions performed by generation transmission system control and distribution systems to support generating capacity energy supply power delivery and reliable operations have large system inefficiencies and costs that are not attributed to end users in the current system. Generally six primary ancillary service types are identified although it is possible to describe additional subtypes within each reactive power and voltage control loss compensation scheduling and dispatch load following system protection and energy imbalance. Some ancillary services are premised on control area concepts that attempt to maintain instantaneous balance on transmission and distribution networks within specific spatial constraints. According to the invention attributes related to provision of ancillary services can be measured or controlled by transmission systems and distribution systems coupled to transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes . Additional attributes related to ancillary services may also be obtained from additional iNodes such as source iNode and sink iNode . For example a transmission operator is typically required by regulators to keep a certain amount of electricity in reserve known as operating reserves to match generation to load in response to unexpected generation or transmission outages or shortages. Operating reserves are generally broken down into reliability reserves which include spinning reserves that must be fully available within ten minutes as well as supplemental operating reserves that can be called upon to start providing electricity in ten minutes but must be fully available within 30 minutes. Operating reserves are generally about 3 of peak demand in the supplemental and reliability categories. Load following reserves are similar to operating reserves in that they attempt to match demand increases associated with fluctuations in demand throughout the day. Load following is generally broken into two components known as ramping and fluctuations which account for load changes above base load for a system. According to the invention the utilization of packet data network to communicate sensor information pertaining to power quality attributes on transmission or distribution networks from transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes enables digital exchange to make energy assets and securities available for purchase that are capable of meeting a network s needs from a diverse set of energy resources and market participants. Moreover reliability ratings risk indices environmental impact ratings efficiency ratings and effects on a network calculated at least in part by simulation and modeling server or statistics server or both enables high frequency or low latency trading to occur such that many more assets are available to meet network needs in real time or near real time in order that a network can not only facilitate bulk dispatch but also frequency support voltage support and the like via exchange operations. Furthermore in some embodiments simulation and modeling server uses data obtained from iNodes via packet data network to attribute various costs monetary or externalities of providing ancillary services of all types to particular consumers. In some embodiments of the invention cost information upon being calculated by statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both is stored in transaction database in real time near real time or periodically.

According to another embodiment of the invention transmission iNode and distribution iNode provide information via data network to a server system such as server system of digital exchange where simulation and modeling server or statistics server calculate and allocate transmission line losses and other attributes typically by breaking them into discrete units that is fixed increments of line losses or other attributes such as fixed quantities of carbon emitted by sources responsible for a specific unit of transmitted electrical power that can be assigned attributed to charges against or allocated to particular physical network elements. In today s art load transfer is typically allocated evenly across all users without regard of their location on a grid or detailed characterization of their usage or other factors that affect system losses and efficiencies. According to the invention a source iNode records attributes related to generation of electricity injected from a source onto an electric grid system . Attributes recorded by source iNode may be related to a quantity for example capacity or energy of electricity to externalities associated with the generation of said electricity or to other characteristics such as power quality or even information related to the organization generating the electricity itself or indeed any combination of these or similar attributes . Similarly sink iNode or smart meter records a quantity of energy consumed and potentially also records other related attributes such as power quality at time of consumption depending on the sophistication of sensing equipment available. Sink iNode or smart meter data may vary substantially due to the wide range of hardware solutions provided by utilities to measure consumption but generally utilities and others at least measure a total energy in units such as kilowatt hours passing through a measured point prior to consumption. It is more beneficial if sink information is detailed in terms of device level granularity versus site wide consumption granularity in terms of number of variables voltage current frequency phase temperature and the like and in terms of granularity in time for instance by measuring variables on a minute by minute basis versus hourly or monthly readings . When sink and source data is combined with data from transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes on a server system it is possible for digital exchange or an equivalent server system to calculate and report losses associated with individual energy transfers from source to sink across a grid network. For example digital exchange upon receipt of sink source transmission and distribution data as applicable via communications interface and possibly after storing the data in event database on a real time near real time or periodic basis simulation and modeling server or statistics server utilize information from event database and possibly exogenous data sources to determine total losses costs ancillary services required transmission fees due to physical network asset owners taxes or fees due to government or regulators or externalities associated with one or more end to end energy pathways. The nature of electricity is such that power generated at one or more sources will take all possible paths generally all parallel paths inversely proportional to the impedance of the paths themselves just as water flowing from a source to a sink does not follow a single path this is an inherent quality of electrical and water networks or grids . However according to the invention where a substantial portion of paths are instrumented in the sense of having a plurality of transmission iNodes and distribution iNodes capable of measuring power electricity flow along a path statistical server and simulation and modeling server alone or in conjunction with each other creates a virtual flow model in which all flows from sources and to sinks are attributed in various portions to specific possible paths such that for each physical transmission eNode or distribution eNode all electricity is accounted for. Virtual models are created according to the invention by using various mathematical approaches to quantitatively model the network. Often a model for pricing dispatch and the like will be based at least in part around Optimal Power Flow modeling OPF using any number of mathematical methods known in the art such as the lambda iteration method also known as the equal incremental cost criterion gradient method Newton s method linear programming method interior point method or others. For example in an embodiment of the invention distinct regions of a grid are treated separately with interconnections to other grid regions being treated as sources or sinks respectively based on whether net flow of power is into source or out of sink the region being analyzed which represent boundary conditions for a simulated or modeled portion of a network in a manner analogous to the control area concept. Then a graph based mathematical representation of the region being studied is created in which each eNode within the region where an intersection occurs between a plurality of transmission lines or distribution lines is treated as a node of the regional graph and the paths to other nodes are treated as graph edges . Then working from either sinks or sources and stepwise back to the opposite that is sources or sinks one of several iterative modeling approaches that is well established in the art of network analysis is used to allocate all flows through each node respectively to a plurality of source sink pairs in order to create a plurality of virtual paths that can be attributed to each source sink pair. For each such virtual source sink path which has a throughput in terms of either capacity or energy or both a proper allocation of transmission losses and externalities can then be made based on the particular characteristics of each transmission system element and each distribution system element . This is one method according to the invention for carrying out nodal allocation on a continuous flow energy network other methods are possible using other network modeling approaches known in the art without departing from the scope of the invention. A key aspect of the present invention is the provision of means for a collecting sufficient substantial fraction of energy usage data and energy injection data to allow simulation and modeling server possibly in conjunction with simulation server to create a realistic virtual flow model of each addressed region of a grid. In some embodiments of the invention not all regions of a grid system are modeled for instance regions where insufficient data is collected by iNodes might not be modeled . In these embodiments as described above junctions between modeled and unmodeled regions are treated effectively as sinks or sources for purposes of analyzing modeled regions. A particular junction node may in some instances switch over time from sink to source based on changes over time of net inflows or outflows for modeled regions. Hence the timeliness of data collected and the time granularity of the data is important in determining the extent to which digital exchange is able to nodally allocate losses and externalities to particular sinks. Information concerning energy flows in virtual paths over time is stored in event database or transaction database or another data storage system associated with or coupled to digital exchange on a real time near real time or periodic basis. As mentioned before the precise distribution of data among various databases is not a limiting factor in the scope of the invention but rather is an implementation decision that has little relevance to the particular aspects of the invention described herein. It will be readily recognized by one having ordinary skill the art of database design that there may be any number of architectures and data distribution schemes that may be adopted according to various embodiments of the invention without limiting the scope of the invention as claimed. According to the invention energy storage nodes can be treated as a sink or a source depending on the nature of the energy transformation occurring at a given instant.

According to the invention and referring to iNodes along possible transmission paths from a source to a particular sink are aggregated with other similarly situated iNodes by digital exchange or an equivalent server system possessing information on grid topology in order to create a virtual pathway that connects a sink and source across electric grid network . Each virtual energy pathway associated with a corresponding group of iNodes represents a physical route and is linked to a combination of either or both other transmission iNodes or distribution iNodes e.g. on wires substations feeders or transformers . They are referred to as virtual paths because in fact while there is a physical meaning to a virtual path it is not physically correct to assert that a specific number of electrons flowed from any one point on a grid to any other point following any particular graph. There will be a plurality of virtual energy pathways that connect any given source sink pair on an electric grid network and since there are many possible source sink pairs there will be a very large total number of virtual energy pathways. Each energy pathway will have different attributes associated with it. It is thus possible for a customer end user generator balancing authority or other player interested in attributes of an energy pathway or the corresponding group of iNodes to take action based on these associated attributes. An exemplary response may be for a balancing authority to raise a transmission price or for collective action of many market participants to do so due to congestion on a certain path or for an end user to demand least cost for transmission or distribution of electricity or both. By specifying end to end energy pathways it is possible for a network to be managed in a plurality of ways that increase market transparency fungibility of energy and externalities and can increase efficiency. The use of virtual energy pathways linking sinks and sources is referred to as nodal allocation or nodal management . For example a developer may wish to transport energy from a currently un developed or partially developed wind resource to a major metropolitan area 300 miles west of the energy resource. If the developer is unable to find adequate capacity on existing transmission lines in the region because they are grossly underinvested instead of postponing the project until additional transmission lines are developed the developer moves electricity generated at the wind resource over a combination of transmission and distribution lines to reach a storage facility near the metropolitan area that enables the developer to sell the energy produced. This may involve a plurality of utilities that own distribution or transmission assets or both between the wind resource and the storage facility but via digital exchange and the associated control modeling pricing event transaction and communications features of the invention the developer and the utilities are able to solve the problem in a way that enhances profitability and resilience of the system. Network flow paths or power quality is impacted directly by commands from digital exchange or from any similar server system to influence grid operations via communications interface based at least in part upon output from simulation and modeling server or statistics server which can be utilized to communicate with variable transformers for instance to control tap ratio or phase shift angle switched shunt control other flexible alternating current transmission system FACTS devices or their direct current equivalents or additional network control equipment via SCADA or similar systems.

According to a related embodiment of the invention a server system such as the server system comprising digital exchange is used to determine optimal transmission paths based on any number of parameters specified by a market participant to provide end to end transport for energy assets from source to sink across electrical grid network . These parameters may be stored on the server system of digital exchange or on a client system used to interact with digital exchange via Internet or a similar data network. The server system is able to provide attribute optimized virtual transmission paths because losses can be effectively allocated to network users and losses costs and externalities can be controlled or reduced during an optimization process by simulation and modeling server or statistics server to improve overall system efficiency when possible by determining optimal flow paths and inducing particular flow patterns to serve loads as required. According to the invention the term allocated herein means associated with charged to or linked to a given user . This represents an improvement over the present art because currently system operators transmission companies and other utilities often arbitrarily allocate losses to users without any rigorous analysis such as that provided by statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both. For instance if a customer wishes to buy from a local plant but the most direct transmission route becomes congested due to high demand and prices rise dramatically a new transmission pathway may be more cost effective if congestion costs are higher than extra transmission loss costs associated with the alternative pathway. Another potential situation is when a given customer wishes to purchase the cheapest possible electricity or electricity with the least total overall impact on the environment including environmental effects of energy delivery pathways used . In this case transmission line costs represent a significant portion of a given power purchase that must be optimized to obtain least cost electricity meeting a consumer s capacity and quality requirements. In a related embodiment of the invention pricing server is used to calculate transmission fees payable to transmission and distribution network asset operators. Often assets have carefully constructed capital recovery rates constructed by or in partnership with government agencies. Pricing server provides relevant pricing information to statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both to enable them to complete calculation of an optimized energy pathway based on applicable preferences. It will be appreciated that according to the invention any organization or market participant in an energy grid may request attribute optimized energy transport from digital exchange or based on analysis done by a participant or a third party computer system. For example it is not necessary for an end consumer to directly receive the benefits of nodal allocation and attribute optimized energy transport capabilities of the invention. It is possible for a load serving entity to use attribute optimized energy transport methods discussed herein to achieve cost savings that may or may not be provided to end consumers of the energy. In fact entire companies or organizations could be constructed that either identify or act upon or both arbitrage opportunities in electric grid networks to provide attribute optimized delivery of energy assets from any number of sources and sinks on the network.

In another embodiment of the invention pricing server computes fees associated with use of transmission and distribution assets and makes such information available to client systems interacting with digital exchange . If requested by a user through a mapped client system pricing server supports transmission cost estimation or analysis including but not limited to optimization via statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both to enable a client system to view some or all of the energy and externality assets derivatives and securities listed on digital exchange with a cost of transport included. Supporting all inclusive or end to end pricing is an important feature of digital exchange that can significantly improve users ability to interact with modern energy markets as they move towards fully liberalized and transparent structures that leverage the nodal allocation concepts covered herein.

According to the invention utilization of iNodes and data network linked to digital exchange can be used to provide additional means of managing market participants interactions with electric grid network . The frequent monitoring and modeling of networks made possible by digital exchange via data network with iNodes and simulation and modeling server enables market participants to buy or sell electricity of varying power quality as well as capacity and total energy from the grid. Due to the ability to allocate losses ancillary services costs externalities and other previously unallocated system components to network users it is possible to provide opportunities for users to elect to sell or buy energy with varying quality depending on their needs the system s ability to accommodate such needs and the value of such energy. For example a residential user who cannot afford electricity under a particular pricing scheme for example a time of use scheme may elect to purchase energy on the margin i.e. only when available during peak hours or to accept a lower quality of power frequency fluctuations voltage fluctuations etc. . . . or to be treated as an interruptible load for example subject to automatic unloading without notice during times of system stress in order to purchase power at a lower rate. Conversely a data center providing website hosting services may wish to purchase power with an extraordinarily high power quality to minimize their systems overall lifetime costs which may be adversely impacted by voltage or frequency fluctuations . It is possible via market activities on digital exchange to accommodate both scenarios by utilizing iNodes connected to digital exchange . This enables user specific or even device specific quality of service delivery which is achieved not only through varied reliability of power for example where a consumer with more elastic demand elects to participate in demand response more frequently but also through power quality fluctuations for example frequency or voltage variance such that overall welfare of consumers especially those possessing more elastic demand curves is improved. INodes are linked to physical infrastructure assets some of which can be controlled via signals sent over data network . One such example is the use of an in line transformer that is controlled via a matched iNode at a sink for example a residential user s meter or a connection from a grid to a data center that can be used to enable participants to receive energy from transmission or distribution lines or both within power quality attribute ranges allocated to that nodal user via the marketplace on digital exchange . In a related embodiment of the invention iNodes and data network provide a stable means of enabling transmission and distribution lines and assets to experience substantial changes in electricity flow or power quality without negatively affecting the provision of services.

In another embodiment of the invention data gathered from transmission iNodes distribution iNodes and exogenous sources including but not limited to utilities databases AMI AMR network provider databases and the like are evaluated by a statistics server or a simulation and modeling server such as statistics server and simulation and modeling server on digital exchange in order to provide benchmarking data for a variety of market participants. Statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both generate a number of important metrics and ratings such as efficiency ratings peak utilization average utilization variance of utilization power quality characteristics and variance of those characteristics as related to time or other characteristics or exogenous variables. It will be appreciated that any number of relationships may be explored by simulation and modeling server or statistics server or both for a variety of purposes. For example a common carrier s operation and maintenance of an asset may be compared with other similar assets or organizations to provide market data and infrastructure data for market transparency to refine simulation and modeling tools or to improve operations or to schedule maintenance .

In another embodiment of the invention and referring to simulation and modeling server acting as a component of digital exchange as shown or as a standalone server platform communicating with components of digital exchange via communications interface performs a grid simulation to make possible performing what if analyses to determine where the most cost effective location is for new transmission lines. For instance if there is frequent congestion along a particular route the price of electricity for users who at least in part receive their electricity along that route may be very high. One method of lowering the cost of electricity may be to make capital investments in infrastructure in order to relieve the congestion. Simulation and modeling server is used to calculate a likely return on investment ROI of the new infrastructure by comparing a cost of building the new infrastructure against expected savings in electricity costs over a specified time period. As a further example distribution level ancillary services for example from distributed energy resources or demand assets are a difficult problem to solve today due to challenges in controlling and monitoring the last mile of a system referring to the last mile of distribution needed to get power to an end consumer . A distribution iNode is simulated for a large battery storage system on a distribution line which could improve system reliability or enhance power quality or both. The ROI of a battery storage system is calculated from the cost of a battery and the decreased operating expenses of maintaining voltage along that specific distribution line . This information is utilized by digital exchange or a utility to justify rate recovery to avoid capital expenditure fees or commissions or to secure financing for a project.

According to the invention many means of pricing transmission and ancillary services can be supported by digital exchange through the use of simulation and modeling server and pricing server . For example pricing server can compute a transmission charge directly related to the impact of each transaction on the system as calculated by simulation and modeling server while the ancillary services charges can be similarly computed by pricing server based on actual costs incurred on the system in order to accommodate a given transaction as calculated by simulation and modeling server . Simulation and modeling server may use optimal power flow algorithms constrained economic dispatch algorithms or any number of algorithmic approaches to determine optimal paths for a given attribute as specified by the user regulator or a third party although many other models for calculating optimal paths and the costs or prices associated can be similarly determined by digital exchange .

According to another embodiment of the invention and referring to a server system such as the system comprising digital exchange is utilized to provide a robust market for transmission rights trading that provides superlative opportunities to manage risk and reliability for market participants regulators and system operators. The ability to rapidly and accurately model and assign losses using simulation and modeling server including incremental losses due to increased utilization means that a hierarchy of transmission rights can be developed and allocated to market participants by a regulator an independent system operator a regional transmission organization or via a market or auction . These rights may or may not have a hierarchy upon their issuance but a secondary market can not only be utilized to provide a liquid marketplace capable of increasing market participant flexibility and reducing congestion but can also be used to create a hierarchy of transmission rights that utilizes tiers or classes within each type of right e.g. Physical Financial or Contracts for Differences . Each tier of rights is based upon incremental instantaneous losses associated with an increase in capacity of a given asset being utilized. For example four regular classes of rights and one specialized right might be created as follows for a transmission line that has a normal operating capacity limit of 200 megawatts. In this instance rights will be classified as A E where A is the highest class or tier . Class A rights are created for a first 50 megawatts of capacity on a line meaning that only losses that occur in the line if 50 megawatts of energy were passing through the line would be applied to users holding Class A rights . Similarly Class B rights holders might bear all of the marginal increase in losses associated with incremental capacity increase associated with increasing line utilization from 50 megawatts to 100 megawatts. This process continues for regular class C with losses due to incremental capacity used 2431 and regular class D. A special class could be a specialized right for example an emergency right which may or may not have limits on when or how it could be authorized for use. Specialized rights may be given only to specific user classes or such rights may be freely available for any market participant to purchase. In this example case a Class E special right provides a means of enabling line utilization to exceed its normal 200 megawatt operating capacity in order to operate at 250 megawatts for a given period. The Class E rights holder would again have to provide all of the energy required to offset higher line losses occurring due to increasing line utilization. Any number of schemes for assigning physical or financial responsibility for either losses or externalities or both can be developed using simulation and modeling server but this information is only of true value when linked to a market such as digital exchange that provides opportunities for managing such relationships in context with energy assets to be associated with such rights. Transmission related securities may be traded in very small incremental units such that overall opportunities for risk hedging and arbitrage are increased. Smaller units also facilitate small entities participating in markets by enhancing fungibility and thereby reducing risk associated with purchasing and holding many types of transmission related rights. Large blocks of rights issued to market participants can be broken up and allocated to many separate parties in a secondary market. In a related embodiment of the invention various classes of transmission rights have additional attributes such as a 20 year term for Class A rights which helps guarantee a revenue stream for a developer of such assets. Similarly classes may be based on contractual agreements generated by digital exchange or interested parties or both.

In another embodiment of the invention and referring to a server system comprised of one or more of statistics server and simulation and modeling server automatically computes a total amount of generation assets required for purchase based on total requirements of an end user. For example an end user wishing to deliver a specific capacity of energy at sink requests energy from digital exchange and is linked with source by digital exchange . The exchange system as previously described determines an optimal energy pathway based on user preferences across electric grid to provide an end to end solution for a market participant. Digital exchange calculates losses that the market participant will be required to absorb comprising generation conversion losses transmission losses and losses due to ancillary services such as main flow support or auxiliary flow support and ensures that the participant purchases adequate energy capacity to cover all losses allocated to the particular energy transport transaction. Users may or may not be made aware that such losses were included in purchases of energy assets from one or more energy sources on electric grid network .

In another embodiment of the invention an amount of excess energy required to maintain grid stability for example operating reserves or load following reserves is reduced. According to the invention statistics server or simulation and modeling server or both is used to forecast energy demand on a network. Forecasts may include any number of metrics already calculated by digital exchange to determine risk reliability efficiency or other metrics related to electric grid management and resilience. Forecasts are used by statistics server to calculate resilience of an electrical grid network according to metrics specified by digital exchange third parties such as regulators government agencies consumer groups or industry groups or any combination of these. After calculating grid resilience for regions of a grid in terms of space or time or both a server system of the invention dynamically determines an amount of excess energy otherwise known as reserves that is required to ensure effective provision of services and stable operation of a grid based upon specified standards. Such standards may be stored by digital exchange in rules engine event database configuration database or any combination thereof. This dynamic system and method for managing excess energy required by a network significantly reduces overall system inefficiencies caused by inadequate tools to dynamically assess and manage risk and allocates costs associated with such risks to network participants in a transparent way.

In another embodiment of the invention it is possible to provide market based mechanisms to enable self regulation of frequency and voltage in an entirely decentralized manner with sufficient market participation by all connected sinks and sources on a network. The ability to allocate and price losses and marginal impacts on an interconnected grid network pertaining to each individual market transaction via digital exchange enables a homeostatic grid control mechanism to operate whereby a diverse group of market participants individual interests provide sufficient grid stability and efficiency to no longer require active management even though they may continue to require regulatory oversight and monitoring. Network connected iNodes are capable of sensing power quality characteristics frequency voltage phase and so forth as well as a wide variety of pricing signals either directly linked to an electric grid network for example location based marginal prices or linked to other markets for related commodities for example natural gas diesel coal carbon emissions and so forth such that iNode controlled devices can automatically respond to optimize objectives at the asset level while communicating such responses to the network level to enable effective and stable system wide management of energy resources.

Many well known market mechanisms exist for managing commodity and online retail market that may be used by digital exchange according to the invention and without departing from the scope of the invention. For example while auction type bidding for particular classes of capacity are possible both with and without explicit inclusion of transmission related costs associated with path dependent losses and externalities along computed virtual transmission paths it is equally possible according to the invention for digital exchange to carry out routine matching type trading operations to connect sources and sinks while allocating transmission related losses and externalities. When a sufficiently large number of market participants exists to ensure adequate liquidity various bid and offer systems are envisioned in which digital exchange matches bids and offers to complete trades possibly including market level optimization of externalities or market based stability constraints. That is while carrying out routine trading operations in a manner analogous to those performed on established commodities exchanges digital exchange of the invention may also preferentially match acceptable bids and offers such that based on computations by simulation and modeling server and possibly also or alternatively statistics server overall system stability is improved. For instance when several acceptable bids are available to match to a given offer digital exchange may select that bid to match which taken in context of all other nearly simultaneous bids and offers being matched will lead to the lowest overall transmission losses or the highest overall power quality or the best overall satisfaction of regulatory constraints or a minimum overall environmental impact or any combination of these and other similar factors.

According to another preferred embodiment of the invention and referring to an order to buy or sell a product listed on digital exchange is initiated by a client system or iNode e.g. a Trader iNode or a Home iNode and received by a server system on digital exchange via a communications interface . Frequent listing information from digital exchange is sent to client system or iNode via push or pull reporting via communications interface . In response to selection of an order execution action e.g. a physical or virtual button that is clicked or depressed or an automated signal received via an application programming interface or other system level interface client system or iNode sends a request to server system to purchase or sell a given product. The order or request to buy or sell etc. is executed by server system based on client information stored on or accessible to server system including identification of a particular client system or iNode and energy resources or financial instruments directly referenced in a specific transaction or comprising a specific security or financial product. Client system receives and stores a client identifier as well as an event identifier associated with a given energy related purchase or sale. Server system receives requests and combines client and event information associated with relevant client identifiers and energy resource identifiers into or with a given future or real time energy security in accordance with stored billing payment account or legal contract information whereby a client affects underlying energy or financial assets directly purchased or contained in a purchased security or basket of securities by initiation of an execution order from iNode or client system via an execution button user motion or signal. According to the invention iNode or client system can also be a server for a subsidiary network itself. Communication between the various components referred to can as is common in client server environments occur through the Internet a dedicated private network or any other similar communications network. Communication to facilitate interaction in a client server system according to the invention can be accomplished through a variety of protocols such as HyperText Transfer Protocol HTTP although more secure means may be utilized. Similarly information presentation can utilize common web based tools such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL web browsers e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer and HyperText Markup Language HTML . It is also possible according to the invention for interactions to utilize a proprietary communications protocol methods for authentication and authorization and non repudiation using server system or client system or both or within a subsidiary network of a client system Other examples of communications protocols between client systems and server systems that might be used to facilitate interactions include well known web services such as HTTP POST methods using Remote Procedure Calling e.g. XML RPC and protobuffers or widely used financial protocols used in algorithmic trading such as the Financial Information Exchange FIX protocol. Furthermore server system can be one of any of the various server components operating standalone or as a component of a larger server physical configuration described above as server components of digital exchange as further described in various exemplary embodiments below.

In another embodiment of the invention an immersive method and system for presentation and management of energy related information and securities comprising a client system or iNode for example trader Node home iNode or a commercial iNode adapted to communicate with digital exchange via a communications interface a visual display comprised of a plurality of two dimensional displays three dimensional displays and multi user collaborative interfaces and an iNode or client system control interface capable of navigating iNode or client system displays and initiating execution orders is disclosed. Typically control interface will consist of an alphanumeric input device which can be coupled with client system although a plurality of other control devices can be utilized e.g. multi touch surface computing interface where display and control interfaces are coupled or visual sensing equipment that uses processors on client or server systems or both to recognize motions or auditory signals and thereby to control a client system . According to an embodiment of the invention an iNode upon input from a client or a locally connected client system graphically presents energy related security information to user via the iNode or client system display . INode or client system control interface is then used to control presentation of trading and electrical grid information based at least in part on a price of the presented energy securities. Optionally iNode or client system display may present or require location or risk information or both associated with the presented energy related securities or underlying energy related assets. In many cases a derivative or rate of change associated with various attributes of energy or associated externalities or their underlying assets may be desirable to present to users of client system

In another embodiment of the invention client system is comprised of a Personal Computer or PC and a plurality of two dimensional displays three dimensional displays and multi user collaborative interfaces can be connected to digital exchange via the Internet or similar communications network such that client system can be utilized to facilitate effective trading and management of electrical grid management and energy assets. Client system may optionally be connected to a control system e.g. a building control system acting as an iNode or may be connected only to digital exchange .

According to embodiments of the invention it is usually desirable to provide real time or near real time data and to support information transparency if operators and other market participants are to interact most effectively or optimally through markets. Multi dimensional representation for example spatial and temporal representation of a large amount of energy data network data financial data externality data user preference data reliability ratings or contract defaults provides market participants with an immensely improved experience that increases efficiency of human machine interactions and provides more effective tools for automated decision making decision support systems or automated attention that can be facilitated by digital exchange or iNode or client system .

The use of multi user or collaborative operating environments or both for management of energy resources electrical networks or their related markets is particularly important to future management of electrical grids. According to the invention iNode or client system can display large energy related risk related user profile including but not limited to behavior type of participant historical performance and financial data sets using a special operating environment via two dimensional display three dimensional display or multi user collaborative interfaces and which can optionally incorporate multiple iNodes or client devices e.g. traditional computers surface computers mobile applications to form room scale building scale or organizational working environments. Moreover iNodes or client devices can be connected in parallel peer to peer or serial networks or both to form enterprise scale trading and operations systems that can incorporate users from multiple geographic locations business units and even separate organizations or groups of organizations e.g. associations of cooperative utilities who centralize trading and reliability management using markets to minimize costs and required expertise if desired. This means that according to the invention large scale applications that run interactively across one or more enterprise networks can be created using iNodes or client systems to interact with digital exchange either directly or via proxy or both. These applications can then provide operators the ability to measure monitor assess and predict performance of the system and of other market participants performance. According to the invention such combinations of tools for human human interaction and machine human interaction can best enable rapid incorporation of the latest sensing data communication visualization computing and interaction techniques to improve trading risk management energy asset management and electric grid network management. Collaboration management and information management can optionally be accomplished via a variety of tools which authenticate user roles data access data ownership and permissions to control common actions such as create read update and delete CRUD 

According to another embodiment of the invention a participant graphically selects energy contracts or derivatives which can include related externalities or not based upon the components of the grid which said energy resources affect via an iNode or client system which subsequently communicates a basket of such energy assets or rights to server system for further review analysis purchase sale or holding as allowed by server system . Additional contracts traded may also be reliant on energy or externality related pricing such as Energy Efficiency Asset backed securities which depend on a value of energy savings as established from retail or wholesale pricing at least in part to provide cash flows to security holders. According to the invention this graphical selection of listed assets is made possible by metadata stored on server system and associated with given assets and products traded on digital exchange . This information is then provided to iNode or client system based on preferences input by a user of iNode or client system which preferences can be stored on server system of digital exchange or iNode or client system or both. For example preferences relating to geographic areas of interest may be stored on iNode or client system or client server and may be used to enable automated participation in or decision support for a given portion of market by an individual user or group of users. Storing and execution of preferences for a basket of traded goods combined with exact information about the nature of the traded goods on a physical network and the optional ability to control eNodes via an iNode packet overlay network will allow individuals to selectively participate in markets and to realize their preferences more exactly. Similarly trading or products related to actual goods traded on a physical network can be used to manage risk using similar concepts. For example default swaps on demand response securities or on energy efficiency securities can be used by market participants. Users could choose to only trade in a specific item or class of items whether classified according to physical or financial attributes if they so desire and thus elect to only visualize products and information related to such items or classes. For example green energy related products could be the only class of items of interest and a user could restrict iNode or client system via preferences stored on iNode or client system to only present such information and metadata.

According to another embodiment of the invention statistics server can be used to determine a particularly useful combination of assets or securities possessing particularly useful underlying assets that meet a given network participant s e.g. an energy distribution company compelling business need e.g. voltage or frequency support . Although a physical outcome for commodities or externalities is often desirable these assets can be commodities derivatives or any type of energy or externality related asset which may affect the network participant. By automatically grouping many energy assets into securities or aggregated assets and presenting those to a user via a visual display based on the most relevant combination of assets according to user specified preferences in server system trading systems according to the invention are capable of continuously improving relevance of complex securities and aggregated energy resources presented to market participants. According to the invention this combination of energy assets may utilize forecasted network performance data e.g. demand supply frequency losses voltage etc. or real data from a variety of exogenous sources to include third parties or synchrophasors or both. According to another embodiment of the invention it is possible for iNode or client system to determine a particularly useful combination of assets from one or more digital exchanges that may include digital exchange . User participation in a market using statistics server to select or analyze potential securities or financial products of interest might be presented to a user for final confirmation or selection but both the client or server system might be used to automatically select and purchase securities for a user of an iNode or client system . Selection of securities might be computed based on a number of attributes for example minimizing cost or risk but might also be based on additional factors for example user comfort in a facility Actions taken on behalf of a user may include purchases from a market on digital exchange as well as authorization of listing or sales of assets or products into a market. As an alternative to direct action based on single or multiple user objectives alone or decision support requiring user confirmation actions may be taken by iNode or client system or server system in digital exchange based on an inferred user decision intended to facilitate participation in the market as if the user selected the action directly

According to another embodiment of the invention it is possible for iNode or client system or a subsidiary network connected through an iNode or client system or an additional external network to provide similar calculations such that an optimal basket of energy or externality rights assets or products can be constructed to meet a relevant business need. According to a related embodiment of the invention pricing server can calculate an approximate or exact value of a set of energy assets packaged by digital exchange or pricing server such that a final purchaser can be charged some portion of the value of the transaction for the service provided in aggregating assets and rights by statistics server or by a third party. This means that pricing server can optionally be used at least in part to determine or compare a commission or fee levied on a given transaction or to perform push reporting or automated intelligence to an end user based on data available from either exogenous sources e.g. the Internet or digital exchange or both.

In another embodiment of the invention pricing server of digital exchange obtains information from either event database or transaction database or both at least in part to calculate a commission or transaction fee due to digital exchange . Fees calculated by pricing server can include a variety of attributes based on any of preferences or rules set by digital exchange iNode or client system or an external party for example the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission or government agencies . Fees calculated by pricing server can then be recorded either instantaneously or in periodic intervals or both in transaction database . Additionally fees calculated by pricing server can be compared to historical averages predicted fees revenue projections and a plurality of other data sets by statistics server which results may be held only for digital exchange or may be released by digital exchange to other individuals. It is also possible according to the invention for statistics server to calculate cost savings or other similar benefits for a market participant to change their account type i.e. the legal nature of their relationship with digital exchange as expressed via a combination of trading and data volumes allowances fees and related requirements for margins risk exposure or other common requirements imposed by exchanges on members or traders on such platforms such that a user can make better informed decisions about optimal means of structuring their relationship with digital exchange or other market participants. Pricing server of digital exchange may optionally be used to obtain fee information for client transactions which may be assigned to a different named user or legal entity that that which completed a transaction. For example a client trading iNode e.g. an electric vehicle may connect to digital exchange and provision energy required for charging but the fees for the transaction may be ascribed by pricing server to an electric vehicle subscription service provider or similar power marketer e.g. a transportation marketer or rental car company which uses digital exchange to serve its customers but manages charges for energy or transaction fees or both due on the exchange on the clients behalf

According to another embodiment of the invention various metadata attributes including but not limited to risk reliability energy capacity resilience or capital cost pertaining to physical network assets or energy assets as well as metadata related to derivatives of energy and financial products and assets can be displayed to users with any of graphical auditory or sensory symbols and information. This information can be prioritized by server system on digital exchange a third party system connected to iNode or client system via the Internet or a similar communications network or by iNode or client system itself. Prioritization of available energy financial risk and other data can be based on participant specific information stored on server system at digital exchange or a third party location or iNode or client system . This hierarchy of data presentation can be determined based on participant specific preferences or user specific preferences where user refers for example to a particular individual on a participant client system or client network system . Moreover it is possible according to the invention for this hierarchy of information to be determined based on user surveys initiated by either iNode or client system or server system again located either at digital exchange or at a third party location or both.

According to another embodiment of the invention a trading iNode has the ability to automatically execute trades using algorithmic trading strategies based on user information stored on exchange server system and on data feeds either pre processed or unprocessed from synchrophasor measurements other modern sensing technologies network information or pricing information which are obtained either directly by trading iNode e.g. via local sensors or third party services or via digital exchange . The ability to leverage such data feeds often obtained through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA or similar systems but which could also potentially be obtained from any third party is key to providing low latency or high frequency trading such that digital exchange is capable of utilizing many disparate energy assets to provide additional ancillary services e.g. voltage support frequency support etc. from assets which remain unallocated or activated during an energy event where absorption or discharge of energy from or into an electrical grid is beneficial or necessary. According to the invention it is also possible for iNode or client system to utilize many disparate energy assets to provide direct aggregation of energy assets and only purchase unpackaged energy assets or some combination of packaged and unpackaged assets from digital exchange or third parties. This means that iNode or client system could be used to choose to purchase and optionally aggregate assets from any of digital exchange and any combination of asset holders e.g. direct clients third parties etc. to develop structured or unstructured financial products from said assets and to relist them or sell them to counterparties on digital exchange in other markets or in bilateral agreements

According to another embodiment of the invention it is possible for a trading interface such as described above to also interact directly with exchanges of related commodities and derivatives exchanges or regulated markets or OTC market makers unrelated to digital exchange . In this way it is possible for users of the invention to simultaneously interact with wholesale energy retail energy other commodities financial and energy or externality related derivatives markets simultaneously or nearly so and to have combinations of products from one or more markets presented to them. For example insurance products coverage products or derivatives capable of hedging risk exposure to fluctuations in energy costs or demand response failures might be presented to a user. This placement may be done by digital exchange or by a third party using data provided at least in part by digital exchange . Recommendations may optionally be derived from past use of digital exchange or from an estimated profile of a user which can be constructed by statistics server and relies on participation data from similar users. Alternatively recommendations may optionally be derived based on risk exposure actual or forecast network conditions and actual or forecast data pertaining to products being viewed purchased or already purchased by user via an iNode or client system . According to another embodiment of the invention digital exchange or third parties may optionally present or provide additional information or products to users of client system . This placement or provision or both of additional information such as advertising or additional products might be offered to users to improve user experience reduce their risk reduce transaction costs on the exchange or any other business enhancing procedure or may solely be to generate additional revenues. For example a third party may be willing to pay for a coverage contract protecting an end consumer s option to purchase energy to recharge their vehicle at some point in space time as a result of the consumer holding the third party s brand of credit card or as a means of targeting potential clients as part of a marketing campaign.

According to another embodiment of the invention any server system connected to an iNode or client system via the Internet or similar communications network can be utilized for presentation of multi dimensional e.g. spatial temporal etc. . . . data related to a continuous flow electrical grid network. According to a related embodiment of the invention any client system acting as a server for a subsidiary network can be utilized to interact with digital exchange .

According to another embodiment of the invention energy market information e.g. transmission and distribution losses energy generation type can be integrated with other metrics related to environmental impact to provide a representation of externalities associated with a market participant s actions. This integrated information would improve decision making and global efficiency of energy provision by allowing this information to be communicated on digital exchange . Improved representation and accounting of losses and environmental impacts will increase transparency and improve pricing of goods on digital exchange especially if externalities become taxed or otherwise acquire value. Market participation could be modified to reduce net energy impacts between and during energy transformation events. For example an iNode or client system might initiate trades that use information other than or in addition to cost such as environmental externalities. For example statistics server can be used to compute externalities associated with a point to point energy transaction across a network that might be used by a user to procure power from digital exchange .

According to another embodiment of the invention iNode or client system can display information pertaining to other market participants or products on digital exchange or both from either information stored on iNode or client system or on server system or on both. This information can be used by a user of an iNode or client system to enable a market participant to better understand additional information for example related to risk or reliability associated with a given party asset derivative or other product on digital exchange . According to the invention these additional attributes or metadata related to a particular participant or listed product can consist of various shapes or symbols that can be defined at least in part by a legend made available to a participant via iNode or client system . According to a related embodiment of the invention these symbols colors or other visual cues can also refer to energy assets or products that remain unallocated are unprotected by additional measures to hedge against risk e.g. an energy default swap or have some other attribute that is of interest to a user of iNode or client system . It is also possible for such symbols colors and visual cues to be used in conjunction with auditory signals to alert users about a change in attributes such as risk or in likelihoods of certain events occurring for example the probability of congestion occurring in a given region to which a participant has exposure or has indicated interest reaching a specific threshold or about execution of a specific market transaction.

According to another embodiment of the invention it is useful in operation of digital exchange and for market participants interacting with digital exchange to maintain a participant profile generated by statistics server . This participant profile can be made available or not to market participants in general or only to market participants acting as counterparties with the party to whom a specific profile pertains. Participant profiles can optionally be made available in their entirety or in part either before during or after a transaction via digital exchange takes place. Moreover it is possible for release of profile information to take place based on rules specified by digital exchange on preferences of the participant on preferences of a counterparty or even on some combination thereof. Similarly participant profile information can optionally be made available to users through third parties.

According to another embodiment of the invention iNode or client system or a client subsidiary network can be used at least in part to upload information pertaining to energy related or externality related assets indices derivatives or other securities that may be traded in other markets that are connected to the Internet or a plurality of similar communications networks. It is possible according to the invention for these additional products or assets to be incorporated into iNode or client system or server system related to digital exchange or both. Once incorporated into a portfolio associated with a given user iNode or client system or digital exchange can calculate listed products related to the new portfolio of assets associated with a participant or only products related to a newly added externally traded product or asset. It is also possible according to the invention that a participant may use external markets to balance physical or financial risks associated with holdings on digital exchange . For example digital exchange can require users of a given class of assets to restrict their financial exposure to a given amount given some combination of factors calculated by statistics server as specified by digital exchange or by some third party including but not necessarily a regulator . If a participant wishes to purchase more assets than would otherwise be allowed by digital exchange due to such restrictions on participant exposure it is possible for the participant to reduce his exposure by obtaining protection from other markets or external parties in bilateral agreements. This is especially true if such products for risk management are not available on digital exchange directly. Information provided by iNode or client system can be sent to server system via communications interface and then validated by a participant profile server which communicates with digital exchange or a party that has provided external risk balancing for a participant via communications interface . After the participant s external protection has been validated statistics server recalculates the exposure available to the participant such that participant is once again able to continue trading without a violation of regulations or contracts relating the participant to digital exchange .

According to the invention although digital exchange may optionally rely on a system of bilateral risk management tools such as those defined in the 1990s it is desirable that more holistic methods be used to balance risk in the overall systemThis can help ameliorate challenges and shortcomings of such systems which contributed to the Enron debacle and collapse. According to an embodiment of the invention digital exchange may elect to use either multilateral netting or clearing or both. Netting can be defined as the offsetting of positive credit exposure on one set of transactions with negative credit exposure on another set of transactions. Digital exchange may optionally establish a master netting agreement that can reduce potential discrepancies in legal attributes between market participants. Clearing requires that a bilateral transaction is broken up into two separate transactions and a central institution is substituted as counterparty to each original leg. For example a system of multilateral netting and clearing can be used to offset and reduce overall risk in the system. This can help reduce overall credit risk defined as the potential loss resulting from the failure of a counterparty to perform under a contract in the market. Client systems may optionally be required to report current credit risks or margins that may be used by digital exchange to a risk management server in order to properly manage client system access or provide information to appropriate authorities as required by law. Risk management server in various embodiments of the invention receives risk related data from clients or from statistics server and computes aggregate risk profiles for given participants or securities and optionally applies risk management business rules to determine what actions are required based on a given risk exposure. Risk management server may optionally be an additional set of business rules within rules engine or a set of additional statistical computation implemented in statistics server without departing from the scope of the invention. Similarly risk management server will in some embodiments be architected as a set of distributed server applications without departing from the scope of the invention. It will be appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art that there are many functionally equivalent ways of architecting or arranging the functions described herein pertaining to risk management server and the arrangement shown in is for illustrative purposes only.

According to another embodiment of the invention it is possible for a participant to specify a range of preferences that are communicated to server system and stored either on participant profile server of digital exchange or on a third party server system or both. These user preferences can indicate a great deal of information that can be utilized by server system to represent a participant s interest or a group of participants interests in accordance with preferences specified such that their interactions with a market can be simplified greatly. While this is expected to most commonly apply to market participants who are not likely to be frequent traders and active speculators with their energy and externality assets e.g. small businesses and homeowners it is possible that more sophisticated organizations may elect to use similar services. These preferences for interaction with a market must be characterized in such a manner that machine interactions become clear to users and are easily understandable for planning purposes e.g. in a home or business . According to the invention energy assets including but not limited to loads generation storage or transmission rights held by a user are presented either spatially or temporally or both. Thus a user is able to manage preferences in a thoughtful and simple way that is somewhat analogous to frames of film that can be advanced or retracted to see changing values and system parameters. Furthermore within each spatial or temporal frame a user can specify bins which each possess preferences relating to either control or trading of energy assets or both. For example a residential user can have six frames with which to organize loads in their home early morning late morning lunch afternoon dinner and evening. Within each frame a residential user might have four bins with which to specify preferences for control or trading of their energy assets during that frame never control control whenever control for short periods and control only if not present . Thus a user can arrange her home appliances into bins as desired within each temporal frame. More sophisticated users may wish to utilize spatial representations especially if they have energy assets in a variety of geographic locations. For example a participant with a properly mapped iNode or client system may wish to control assets at multiple buildings e.g. a commercial property manager or cooperative . Additional preference setting features can include additional attributes or affinities related to control of energy consumption generation storage or transmission. For example it is possible that a user can create bins relating to particular energy types they wish to utilize to operate given devices and specify that such devices only run on such energy types e.g. produced locally or solar only . According to the invention it is also possible for a user to communicate information enabling iNode or client system or server system to automate trading or control based on an opportunity cost expressed by a user. Users may be able to specify business processes comfort metrics or individual appliances or tasks importance based on frames for available incentives. For example a user may specify their willingness to change the temperature in their home or business in exchange for ten dollars per hour twenty dollars per hour or one hundred dollars per hour This enables the client system a third party server system or digital exchange to take automated action on their behalf or provide decision support. This can enable a users to interact with the system based on their unique Quality of Service requirements to better attempt to achieve an optimum individual solution. Other users may set preferences that only enable digital exchange or iNode or client system to utilize their energy assets at higher values due to a higher actual or perceived cost associated with altering their behavior e.g. an office building may only be willing to enable its HVAC equipment to stay off for 30 minutes or less in order to keep workers cool on a summer day unless there is a major pricing event such that the value of behavioral change may be extraordinarily high . In some cases participants may indicate a preference based on attributes other than monetary compensation as primary or subsidiary tools for trading. For example a user may generally wish to be paid a great deal for conservation during dinnertime but if server system indicates that conservation will have a low monetary value but a strong effect on carbon emissions or some other externality a user may nevertheless elect to participate. It is possible according to the invention for server system to have determined such externalities from simulation and modeling of an electric grid system on simulation server which may according to the invention be directly coupled to or connected via an external communications network to server system such that such externalities or reduction thereof can be attributed to the specific participant. According to the invention methods for setting preferences can also include bins or frames for scheduling and planning for energy or externality events. For example users can assign various assets to bins or frames indicating amounts of time a user wishes to have in order to decide whether or not to participate in a given event. One such example would be a where a large manufacturer of aluminum is willing to shut down its operations entirely or in part depending on the value of the electricity they would otherwise be utilizing if they are given adequate time to plan. Such a user can specify that two weeks notice is required for a 50 megawatt reduction where the entire plant would be shut down but that only 5 hours notice is required for a 5 megawatt reduction. Again these different notification and confirmation requirement preferences can also include additional attributes like price windows externalities to be saved which may or may not be attributed to the user and other metrics of interest as specified by a participant using iNode or client system . According to the invention this system can be utilized such that users can elect to automate their participation with market structures entirely or they may choose to automate participation for events within a specific range of specified parameters only and manually control their system for others or they may request only to receive decision support which enables them to be informed by the system but to manually execute controls to execute any resulting decisions. According to a related embodiment of the invention a user s range of acceptable operational parameters for a network connected device or system which is capable of interacting with markets might have a user specified range of acceptable operating values for varying levels of compensation. This operational window can then be used by iNode or client system to control and dispatch loads within said operational window such that iNode or client system optimizes its local system based at least in part on forecast or actual prices for energy or externality related products on digital exchange .

In another embodiment of the invention a user requests that digital exchange provides iNode or client system with pricing associated with energy transport across an electric grid. Pricing server can then communicate this information to iNode or client system such that pricing of energy assets as viewed on iNode or client system can be viewed as all inclusive prices. This means that a user would be able to view energy assets priced based not only on the asset itself but also including all delivery costs across one or more network to a location specified by the user. It is also possible for a user to specify a number of favorites such that common delivery locations can be stored on either iNode or client system or server system such as participant profile server or both. In this example iNode or client system can be used to procure energy in a node to node or point to point transaction across an electric power system such that a user of iNode or client system may interact with only relevant data. In this case iNode or client system receives inclusive pricing information from digital exchange more specifically pricing server which is then used by iNode or client system to select optimal products or groups of products to meet a specific need required by iNode or client system or its user. According to the invention it is also possible that iNode or client system may optionally compute some or all inclusive pricing of energy transactions across digital exchange . In a related embodiment of the invention pricing server or iNode or client system may provide inclusive pricing of multiple assets to end users for other purposes. For example an end user participating in a market may wish to purchase energy efficiency asset backed securities with a limited range of exposure to energy prices effect on performance of the target security. Digital exchange may be provided with information pertaining to overall investment risks and criteria desired by an end user via a network connected iNode or client system communicating across a network such as the internet . Digital exchange or a third party based at least in part on data from digital exchange may then recommend a combination of financial products which effectively limit risk in the desired area in this case risk that energy savings will be adversely affected by energy prices and that a value of an asset backed security financing energy efficiency projects which depend on the value of such savings will thus deteriorate. In this case energy efficiency default swaps an insurance policy a coverage contract or a number of other products may be recommended to reduce risk exposure or complexity to an end userThis type of service may be especially valuable as end users become increasingly active in markets at the retail level over time.

According to another embodiment of the invention similar systems and methods discussed for applications related to continuous flow electrical grid networks could be applied in similar fashion to other continuous flow energy networks such as natural gas.

In another preferred embodiment of the invention a Multidimensional Energy Decision System MEDS is provided which is a form of a linked building optimization and demand response platform that overcomes one or more of the previously discussed limitations through use of a series of decision processes capable of pushing intelligence to the edge of a grid to better enable decentralized management via participation in local and global energy externality and capital markets. A key innovation is that users are connected to a series of technologies which are capable of providing reactive and proactive control responses allowing such technologies to infer desired user decisions based on an effective linking of decisions i.e. user actions or choices to tangible outcomes e.g. comfort business processes etc. .

This concept is based on a synergistic pairing of information extraction from building automation control and monitoring systems with directly created content from users of said system. Observed information that may be extracted may include but is not limited to one or more device run times and efficiencies as well as internal or external temperature and humidity data and other building specific or system specific information whereas user generated content will include information relating preferences for comfort business processes or other tangible attributes with a relative importance that can be defined on an objective scale of any type e.g. value in dollars importance on a scale from one to ten or any other objectively measurable or computable scale considered relevant by users .

physical connections to energy transfer locations where energy can enter exit be stored transformed switched re directed or measured and 

a means of providing for interaction with humans or machines which are operating at least in part at the location 

a connection to an energy distribution system to include via the internet such as the electric distribution system.

The system is characterized by the fact that a combination of machine learning or any other artificial intelligence method may be applied to observed data in conjunction with user supplied information such that consumers energy choices can be refined automated or both in whole or in part based on local i.e. site or building level needs as well as global needs i.e. of an electric grid or segment thereof or of a large corporation s overall energy management systems .

System according to the invention are strongly differentiated from existing solutions that focus on traditional technical metrics such as kilowatt hours kW h by its capability to relate energy consumption or cost savings or both to business processes user comfort or other metrics thus enabling users to make effective decisions.

In one embodiment of the invention users are able to interact with an event based system that simplifies complex temporal decisions such that users can interact with decision variables i.e. choices in discrete groupings or time periods hereinafter referred to as events. According to the invention these events may be presented to a user in a variety of ways for example in a calendar or on a timeline and through a large number of different electronic media such as web based applications or pages thermostats mobile applications trading interfaces or even print media.

According to the invention an event can be defined as a behavior based activity that spans a time period that is either discrete or can be discretized by a server system such that a user can interact with it in a discrete form. Events may be defined based on common scheduling attributes such as hour day week or by any combination of metadata from local systems for example building monitoring or control systems or from exogenous information for example information pertaining to a heat wave which may define a unique occurrence. Each discrete event can be depicted graphically to a user such that it is possible to comprehend temporal range of the particular event and such that any data pertaining to a decision faced by a user can be visualized. For example a user may view a calendar that provides an event based mechanism for viewing thermal comfort standards for example Fanger Predicted Mean Vote human thermal comfort index as defined by ASHRAE based on expected likely known or forecasted costs associated with maintaining that particular decision variable in an indicated range of values or at a specific value. According to the invention selected decision variables may be determined by user preferences stored on a server system or may be determined automatically by a server system. Other examples of decision variables may be dollar value saved kilowatts of capacity reduced kilowatt hours of energy reduced or delayed or a quantity of an externality such as carbon that results from a user s actions during a discrete period. Other metrics may be more user specific for example hamburgers per kilogram of carbon emissions for a fast food restaurant or may relate to specific business processes of one or more end users at a given site or across a portfolio of sites. Additional comfort metrics may include indoor temperature and humidity readings. A simple example of this is shown in .

For example in an embodiment drilling through discrete event data may be accomplished through a variety of user interactions conducted via various user interfaces known in the art including for example web based and mobile applications. User interface actions involving a discrete event may involve drilling down into event components forecasted via simulation or extrapolation of historical data or both which can enable users to exert more direct control over specific actions and their associated economic or comfort metrics. Associated economic and comfort metrics presented to a user may include a cost to maintain thermal comfort levels at a given level or within a given range for a specific decision period for example a user may be willing to spend up to 25 to maintain a 72 degree Fahrenheit indoor temperature instead of letting a building cool to 71 degrees Fahrenheit on a cold morning By using an event based methodology for assessing decision variables and outcomes associated with energy transformation events it is possible to better enable users to relate to energy markets which are coupled to their local systems or microgrids. It is through marginal decision making and user feedback that users can train machine systems to take actions on their behalf that enable them to better participate in highly dynamic and volatile markets. According to the invention it is possible for automated decision making data presentation and intelligence or decision support to involve numerous different forward or past time periods as part of a decision for any given event. For example it is possible that an MEDS system of the invention may present a user with decisions related to suggested temperatures for an upcoming business day based on a yearly budget which may include past information pertaining to expenses in the given fiscal year as well as forecasts of energy consumption and cost.

Due to extreme volatility of prices in wholesale markets and in view of likely continued deregulation of electricity markets which will further expose consumers to that volatility marginal decision making is an important evolutionary step towards a more responsive electrical distribution system however current systems remain inadequate for future needs. Simply put the latency and uncertainty associated with human interactions with systems will typically be detrimental to larger systems and end users can be better served by automated processes which manage their relationships with external markets at least in part on their behalf.

According to another embodiment of the invention an MEDS system may also utilize intelligent methods of machine communication to obtain additional information from building occupants or microgrid users whether machine or human . The use of an expert machine system to communicate with end users can provide additional information aiding MEDS systems in marginal decision making. Communication methods may include a combination of text based numeric or voice based interaction frameworks. For example the use of a server based or client based expert system or some combination of each using text based chats can be used to communicate with users to ask whether or not they are actually too warm or if in fact they may desire their HVAC system to reduce indoor temperature at a marginal time. This can allow MEDS system according to the invention to further improve operational schedules based on confirmed constraints relating to business processes or comfort throughout a discrete time period. In this example an office manager might respond via a chat window on a client system e.g. a computer or mobile device that a current temperature is sufficient and requires no change. An MEDS system through an expert communication system may optionally elect to provide additional metadata to users in messages sent to users in order to aid users to better make decision on the margin. For example an expert communication system may ask a user whether she would like to reduce an indoor temperature by 2 degrees Fahrenheit or if she would prefer to save fifty dollars in an upcoming marginal decision period. In another embodiment of the invention users are able to submit notifications to an MEDS system according to the invention to initiate expert system response For example a user may submit a message via a text based interface from a client system as previously described stating that they are vacating a specific premises or noting that comfort is unsatisfactory. In these examples an expert system can deduce actions to take in order to remedy a situation noted by a user if it is so configured. In this example an MEDS system may in response to user notifications change current occupation settings for a selected area to unoccupied or reduce building temperature in the zone from where a complaint originated respectively.

According to another embodiment of the invention an MEDS system can connect to a background application which can be running on client systems that draw electric power at least in part from an MEDS connected system. An MEDS server located either onsite or at a remote data center can connect to client devices directly or through any number of intermediate connections with other devices e.g. through peer to peer networking or both. Client systems for example office workstations desktops laptops mobile devices servers and the like running such a background application can be controlled individually or in aggregate groups of various sizes or both such that energy consumption can be altered. According to the invention a number of techniques for limiting or controlling energy consumption may be initiated by an MEDS connected application communicating with a client system. These may include varying processor speed reducing telecommunications bandwidth dimming monitors changing performance of storage e.g. hard drives or solid state memory hibernating or shutting off machines or any combination of these and other energy affecting actions that can be taken in regard to client or server systems many of which are well known in the art. Again through the optional use of an expert system an MEDS system according to the invention may communicate directly with human or machine users to determine whether energy saving measures are too extreme or alternatively could be made more aggressive at marginal times. For example a chat window may be opened by a foreground or background application running on a network connected client system that queries a user to ask if current machine performance was adequate or was negatively impacting the user s performance. This concept similar to the marginal temperature considerations described above can be used to better adjust forecasts for future energy events as well as to take action during a marginal event being considered by an MEDS system at the time of an information request. Furthermore according to the invention a background application may optionally track performance utilization of central processing units CPUs and other onboard equipment of client systems. This information may be relayed to a local MEDS server which can in turn send this information individually or in aggregate to a cloud based MEDS system where additional expert systems and analysis techniques can be used to process data. This can enable a local or distributed MEDS system to present client systems owners with information related to actual utilization of their client systems along with estimates of potential savings that could be achieved through hardware or software updates or both. For example a series of high powered desktops might be replaced by a series of laptops. According to the invention use of such data to direct advertisements to users directly through an MEDS system through third party applications and websites or to sell data enabling others to target end users for software hardware or other products related to this process is an important optional component of MEDS systems according to the invention. In another embodiment of the invention an MEDS system uses an expert system to monitor and optimize temperature controlling devices in a physical space in order to further optimize performance of computational resources. Due to effects of ambient temperature on efficiency of CPUs this can be an important additional mechanism for optimization of facilities with significant computational resources whether in a traditional data center or an office environment.

In another embodiment of the invention a combination of observed and user supplied feedback enables previously unattainable levels of accuracy of and improvements to correlations of consumers to markets as well as optimizing energy consumption and generation that is any energy transformations onsite or across a portfolio of sites which sites may choose to interact with electric distribution systems individually or in aggregate. shows a high level schematic of this process applied to an exemplary case of building performance optimization and management.

The process of pairing information about users observed by a system for example local thermostat settings overrides or changes by users who are uncomfortable at an observed temperature for example from a building automation system can then be used to link processes in interlocking feedback cycles to accelerate intelligent learning by control systems. Feedback from users may occur through a large number of mechanisms ranging from direct changes to local controls feedback provided through web interfaces feedback provided via mobile applications or through third party applications such as TWITTER .

By utilizing a combination of machine learning approaches to information extraction and user content monitoring it is possible to generate more robust relation specific data which can help train algorithms to better respond to exogenous events and information or local phenomena occurring on a site or in a building.

The ability to construct probabilistic models of energy transformation and efficiency opportunities is a differentiating element in MEDS systems. According to the invention this information can be utilized in a wide variety of ways to further enhance relationships between and among end users and service providers and can enable more economically optimal outcomes. Additional uses of automated lead generation include but are not limited to use of MEDS to connect users across one or more facilities to their energy transformation events and associated externalities create groups defined by one of more shared attributes which may choose to act as an economic unit when interacting with other parties ranging from electric grid systems to capital markets validate and monitor long term risks associated with securitized financial products or performance based contracts or agreements that require validation and verification provide automation to end users microgrids and any grouping them allowing them to participate in energy externality and capital markets continuously optimize energy performance of buildings or microgrids through any combination of user generated machine and human content analytical optimization methods for example mixed integer programming machine learning or other similar forms of artificial intelligence or optimization via simulation such as integrated thermal and load modeling tools .

In another embodiment of the invention an MEDS system utilizes a series of processes to obtain needed information for optimization of user decisions related to operational processes such as energy procurement and dispatch of energy transformation events. Decision processes involved in scheduling dispatch of controllable energy assets generation storage or consumption require consideration of multiple objectives that may establish competing requirements for an end user. Due to the multidimensional nature of decisions related to energy consumption a process for determining a utility of various outcomes for an end user is required.

According to the invention prior to optimizing a building in a continuous semi automated or automated process it is necessary to obtain information about user needs and preferences to properly adjust one or more objective functions based on explicitly stated or implied needs of end users in a particular facility. Determination of values which define a given user s Pareto frontier or surface are important to effectiveness of MEDS systems according to the invention.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a network connected server system obtains information pertaining to various outcomes for example pertaining to business processes or user comfort from a client system via a web based interface. Information is transmitted from a client system across a network such as the Internet and received by the server system where credentials identifying the user can be validated against a database containing account information which may be operated separately or as part of the server system. In an exemplary embodiment after a user finishes completing a digitally recorded survey where survey is defined as any series of questions actions or requests for other methods of providing feedback to a client system which can be digitally represented and transmitted to the server system for interpretation the server system utilizes a statistics server to calculate a Pareto surface for competing objectives of a multidimensional optimization problem related to the survey. For example a survey may seek user feedback on the relative importance of cost savings versus comfort ranging from nominal values to extreme values. When data from a wide range of questions is aggregated this information can be used to construct an n dimensional space which represents a range of valid solutions for a corresponding multiobjective optimization problem as defined by the users feedback pertaining to n variables of interest. This n dimensional solution space can then be reduced to a Pareto frontier or Pareto set. A Pareto frontier describes a set of choices that are efficient potential solutions and techniques for determining Pareto frontiers from a finite set of alternatives are well established in the art of computer science. The invention s novel use of a client server system for conducting surveys gaining information for use in constructing a Pareto set which can be explored by a network connected statistics server is a significantly new addition to the concept of building optimization. Through the system s construction of acceptable ranges for priorities based on their relationships to other competing objectives it is possible to effectively model a reasonable range of potential objective function values for use in optimization. When this capability is combined with data feeds for example weather data or energy commodity data from exogenous sources and any data which may exist in an associated MEDS server system the MEDS system can act as an effective proxy for human or machine decision makers or provide decision support.

An exemplary description of a process by which user actions can be inferred utilizing information obtained via a direct survey or via an expert analysis which is made available to an MEDS server system may be as follows determine a user s preferences for saving earning money by changing system behavior describe a Pareto frontier for a user using a statistics server utilize the Pareto frontier to define key values in objective functions utilize the resulting objective functions for initial solution selection that is narrow the solution space determine solutions via either analytic or simulation based methods or both confirm selected simulations via controls routine or simulation model to validate that solutions obtained fall within an acceptable solution space finalize scheduling options based on simulated solutions and seek decision from a MEDS server system and either present decision options to a user or infer a user s decision based on the Pareto frontier or relative weighting of the multi objective optimization variables or both.

When a client server system and method for determining a Pareto set or other mathematical descriptions of one or more valid ranges of solutions is coupled with synergistic methods for information extraction an MEDS system according to the invention becomes a strongly differentiated platform enabling intelligent and decentralized management of buildings campuses and microgrids which can accurately participate in complex markets and machine to machine transaction systems on behalf of users in a non disruptive and optimal fashion.

Among other benefits of MEDS end users employing systems according to the invention benefit from nearly continuous recommissioning of a building s HVAC schedule based on optimized overall dispatch schedules for a site. This can according to the invention lead to generation of additional value beyond cost savings consumption reductions or externality reductions including in an exemplary embodiment procurement of additional Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED points as defined by the U.S. Green Building Council which can enhance monetary value of a building and its desirability to end users. According to the invention automated dispatch and control of network connected devices capable of energy transformation is extendable to many other devices beyond HVAC systems such as data centers lighting systems computer loads outdoor parking lights plug loads or any system that is controlled by centralized or decentralized computer systems. It is also possible according to the invention that any type of energy related process which can be controlled by an MEDS system and is not location dependent may be transferred between multiple geographic locations by an MEDS system to one or more connected buildings campuses or microgrids which may be owned by one or more businesses or individuals using MEDS services. For example computerized tasks such as data processing or website requests may be routed to a data center with a minimal cost of electricity based either on local or global conditions or both and on values at either or both locations.

According to the invention an MEDS system can also be connected to other forms of media for a variety of purposes related to public relations marketing sales or awareness. Detailed information captured by MEDS systems can be leveraged by corporations organizations or individuals seeking to highlight responsible actions or improvements in sustainability. Because of quantitative modeling tools provided by MEDS systems according to the invention and described above this information can be presented with a great degree of confidence and in many cases may be presented with actual descriptions of uncertainty which can be calculated by a network connected statistics server. Integrated simulation and modeling capabilities which enable MEDS systems to augment reality with additional information based on mathematical models can enable MEDS connected users to better leverage investments in MEDS and actions related to energy and environmental issues in print and social media that is TWITTER FACEBOOK and the many similar services known in the art in various combinations such that they can better realize full value of capital and behavioral adjustments related to these issues.

According to the invention a MEDS system for benchmarking can also enable comparisons between MEDS connected organizations and individuals. This information can be used in a variety of ways and may be presented only to account holders or made public via a MEDS user s website or via a third party platform or both A MEDS system according to the invention may be used to provide industry standard benchmarking for clients who currently lack adequate access to information. For example a group of large real estate clients might agree to let a MEDS system expose their anonymized data to one another in order to better benchmark their own building portfolios energy consumption against other companies that they compete against. A MEDS system can optionally expose limited groups of users data to one another in either an anonymous fashion or with explicit reference to users or both. This information can be valuable to organizations seeking to stay competitive and all organizations may benefit from increased transparency in addition to the obvious benefit for clients and grids from increased competition for energy efficiency. Another example may involve sharing of energy consumption information within a familial unit where anonymity may not be a concern. Similarly various social groups may wish to share energy efficiency or consumption information via Facebook or other social networking solutions where attribution is desired.

According to the invention periodic stress testing of buildings or microgrids may be used by a MEDS system to reduce risk relating to forecasting future events. As the value of energy on the electric power system is closely linked to its uncertainty and variability any ability to accurately forecast future load and generation profiles of systems connected to an interconnected power system is critical. While MEDS systems according to the invention typically include a capability to generate forward models from simulated models of buildings or microgrids there is substantial value in leveraging empirical data to improve the value of a given system. According to the invention individual device commands commands to groups of devices or sample schedules may be initiated by a MEDS system to gather empirical data which in turn can be used to ensure that end users and occupants are able to achieve maximum value for their interactions with an electric grid system. This information for induced events can be used to profile technologies in a building. For example individual devices can be turned on and off such that a single kilowatt reader or metering device can be used to record a total energy consumption of each given device in a building in various configurations. A more specific example may include monitoring of a kilowatt meter while manipulating a variable speed of a fan such as a fan of a Variable Air Volume box in an HVAC system. This information can then be used by a MEDS system to improve its optimization and forecasting techniques. This can be especially important for optimal participation in demand response events.

According to another embodiment of the invention periodic stress testing can also be used to determine performance degradation of equipment during its lifetime. For example chillers in commercial buildings may have been replaced and linked to a performance contract that guarantees a specified amount of savings over an expected lifetime of the contract. Periodic stress testing can validate that actual performance of machines is within the specified range. This especially if combined with MEDS scheduling logs enables MEDS to properly ascribe responsibility to users or service providers in the event of performance contract failures.

According to another embodiment of the invention periodic performance or stress tests can be used to help generate reliability ratings for a specific customer. As reliability ratings for a customer may include both behavioral and physical aspects an ability to collect empirical data from consumers connected to a MEDS system from time to time is important. By varying conditions in a stress event for instance time of day size of event length of event amount of advance warning and the like it is possible to better isolate a relative importance and characteristics of physical and behavioral attributes. This allows a service provider delivering MEDS based services for example to enable people or organizations to maintain reliability ratings even when they change facilities. While active testing strategies may be crucial for assessing risk and generating performance profiles MEDS systems according to the invention are also capable of using passive testing strategies to obtain valuable profiling information. MEDS systems need not necessarily issue direct commands or command sequences in order to derive test performance. Due to frequent albeit optional optimization of device scheduling and commands measured results of executing a wide variety of schedules provides MEDS systems with substantial amounts of data that may be used to provide an effect equivalent to that achieved using active methods. MEDS systems may optionally enhance this passive ability further by varying characteristics associated with performance of building components related to energy structure or any other energy or externality related variable. For example insulation values R values device efficiencies energy usage or similar variables may be varied to improve upon mathematical representations of building or microgrid systems used in optimization. Over time exploration of a solution space for these parameters can be used to improve end users understanding of their physical assets and a MEDS system s ability to optimize said system as a result.

According to another embodiment of the invention a MEDS system can be used to provide control of microgrids and buildings based on actions take by or on behalf of a digital exchange .

According to yet another embodiment of the invention a MEDS system can be used to provide dynamic shaping and storage services for network connected energy transformation assets such as wind farms and solar power arrays that are both variable and uncertain power supplies. It is possible to connect forward forecasts related to transformation events affecting a power grid that can be balanced using a MEDS platform. For example a MEDS system can be paired with one or more wind farms and can dynamically optimize operating schedules or dispatch schedules of energy related events at a portfolio of facilities such that an output of a coupled system is less variable or more certain. The ability to provide shaping and storage services leveraging existing infrastructure is a significant advancement over techniques in the art which rely on Demand Response for stress reduction or ancillary services. Due to a MEDS system s ability to control load in a decentralized but precise manner systems according to the invention are able to provide such services with quantifiable levels of risk. According to the invention this enables a MEDS system to offer such services directly into power markets or to provide services directly to entities controlling or possessing energy transformation assets which are in need of shaping and storage.

In another embodiment of the invention synergistic information extraction for optimization of maintenance and services can be coupled with previously described systems for observation and control of buildings campuses and microgrids in order to provide a variety of services that can better manage the total cost of ownership related to operation of facilities. Processes analogous to those illustrated in and can be used to provide energy efficiency experts service providers and contracts with automated tools for lead generation and quantitative assessments of business value by leveraging a combination of extracted and user supplied content. Again the feedback loop thus established can be used to enhance learning of an intelligent server based system capable of providing recommended actions and decision support for business development related to energy efficiency demand response maintenance and commodity consulting for clients critical resources.

A wide variety of machine learning techniques may be employed in concert with a network connected controls network that is capable of monitoring and controlling facilities through a variety of industrial automation systems and controls technologies that are well established in the art. Advantages of the instant invention pertain among other things to the ability of systems according to the invention to use expert user content in conjunction with observed information and analysis to provide forward looking business intelligence or decision support. The ability to perform probabilistic assessments of value of future contracts which the invention defines as either a combination of fixed efficiencies such as from capital upgrades and variable efficiencies such as from demand response participation or both is a markedly different approach from current business intelligence practices which rely almost entirely on historical data. Furthermore the ability to automatically generate opportunities and leads from these energy transformation opportunities which can be linked to local phenomena or forecasted or actual global phenomena or any combination of these represents a significant departure from business practices or technological capabilities in the art. This process can be applied to customers within a portfolio of a given service provider connected to an MEDS system through its own user interface or via a third party application accessing data obtained at least in part from an MEDS system.

According to the invention a MEDS system is also capable of providing for direct advertisement placement through either its own user interface or third party websites or both. The system is also capable of providing data enabling third parties to engage in ad placement utilizing at least in part data collected from either a MEDS system or a following process or both. As the cost of capital and total cost of ownership dictate a majority of outcomes related to capital investments in energy consuming equipment in business and homes calculation and verification of savings over the life of a considered investment period are paramount. Thus an MEDS system that includes an ability to use integrated thermal and load forecasting tools related to building systems can be of immense value when determining products and services that can provide compelling value propositions to end users. A MEDS system s connections to building systems or microgrid connected systems can be used to determine which advertisements are most relevant for particular end users. Using information related to observed forecasted values for buildings these opportunities can be used to place advertisements to end users themselves or to assist in ad placements targeting service providers and retailers offering the goods themselves. Thus a MEDS system and data can be used to advertise potential service providers or retailers to clients or vice versa. For example a MEDS connected building may have a design thermal insulation value of R 17 for its attic or crawlspace. Actual observations of the building via a MEDS system may indicate that an actual thermal value for the roof is closer to R 11 based on comparisons of simulated values and observed values over time. A MEDS system may then present a user with a recommendation to upgrade the insulation in question to R 19 or greater to save a specified amount of money over a forecasted period. Service companies or retailers wishing to install or sell insulation to end users may pay for opportunities to have their information displayed generally on a MEDS user interface on a savings alert recommendation itself or to users through third party websites and other media. Similarly a MEDS system could be used to advertise or sell pre qualified leads and opportunities to service providers and retailers on a subscription pay per click or any number of other arrangements.

According to another embodiment of the invention a MEDS system may use data obtained through its network connected buildings and microgrids to provide additional mechanisms for manufacturers retailers installers insurers and others to better understand performance of physical devices. For example a MEDS system may be used to measure calculate and optionally report or certify performance of physical devices across a wide variety of facilities. One such example would be the certification of performance of an air conditioning device that may substantially underperform on a portfolio of buildings as compared to its manufacturer s specifications. By obtaining data and using a network connected statistics server to process gathered information a MEDS system may be used to generate performance reports linked to specific devices by attributes such as device type device make and device model These identifying attributes may then be used to provide information about said device to third parties or to expert systems for example an equipment replacement recommendation engine operating as part of the MEDS system.

The ability to finance projects enabling end user participation in active energy markets and systems is one of the critical roadblocks to modernization of energy infrastructure in the United States. Most existing demand response participants are totally unaware of the value of their participation in wholesale markets via existing aggregators and many more remain unable to participate. Equally troubling are the challenges with obtaining adequate financing to enable end users to achieve potential savings at local or system levels from fixed efficiencies such as capital equipment upgrades.

The U.S. government and many other organizations have cited challenges with securing capital as one of the key impediments to achieving superior power systems reliability and cost savings. Current practices consistently involve the use of commercial loans backed with real estate assets often on the facility selected to undergo an upgrade to finance capital improvements geared at future savings. Performance based contracting from Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning contractors to end users dominate the industry today and each project involves human intensive audits and contract negotiations and often involves further effort by a performance based contractor to secure insurance against any resulting contracts in the event that cash flows from an end users savings prove to be insufficient.

According to the invention it is possible to reduce complexity and streamline a financing process for energy efficiency opportunities through direct securitization of energy efficiency projects. By combining probabilistic methods assessing a value of fixed and variable efficiencies of a project over time cash flows from savings can be effectively allocated discounted and hedged such that risk can be adequately distributed among investors and capital markets can more effectively participate in modernization of end users capabilities to optimize their interactions with electrical distribution systems.

According to the invention one of the key challenges to spurring additional investment in energy efficiency and other innovative forms of financing for capital improvements is uncertainty and risk associated with long term benefits for such securities. Furthermore a common practice of renegotiating many of the terms comprising mainly bilateral and trilateral agreements between each counterparty results in large amounts of unnecessary costs due to associated legal fees time delays and projects which are never carried through to completion.

According to an embodiment of the invention a securitized energy efficiency services agreement can be constructed and securitized while using a MEDS system for monitoring and verification of related assets over time. The construction of energy efficiency securities enables investors to directly cover capital expenditures associated with forecasted fixed and variable efficiencies associated with a project or both . Payments from end user based on observed performance measured by a MEDS system are then distributed to participants in a securitized structure in accordance with or other similar manner.

This illustrative and innovative structure builds upon practices in energy efficiency and power purchase agreements to provide a truly innovative system capable of enabling forecasting risk assessment aggregation securitization monitoring and verification of energy efficiency projects to enable their widespread implementation by leveraging direct access to capital markets. It will be appreciated that a number of similar business arrangements can be created to better suit the needs of participants in a securitized efficiency product.

Upon aggregation securities may or may not be priced by a network connected pricing server as part of a digital exchange and listed for purchase. According to the invention direct sale to investors listing on an exchange or any number of potential sales arrangements can satisfy conditions of the process detailed in . Furthermore according to the invention energy efficiency securities may be backed by capital equipment installed as part of a project or may be unsecured by physical assets.

The ability of a MEDS system according to the invention to facilitate securitization of fixed and variable efficiencies or both will allow vested parties for instance regulators utilities end users and investors to construct effective incentive and rebate programs to further encourage end users of electricity to upgrade and install such dynamically optimized systems as part of a larger process of grid and market modernization.

In one embodiment of the invention payments from participating facilities campuses and microgrids which may be securitized on an individual or aggregate basis are distributed through an electronic platform although it will be appreciated that traditional payments such as posted checks and invoicing may also be used.

It will be appreciated that many other variations of this process can be constructed based on needs of participants in a particular securitization event and on existing and future regulatory environments in which securities will be traded.

According to the invention credit risk and other risks to counterparties in the securities must have mechanisms to ensure adequate protection from risk such that business transactions and relationships are feasible and easily replicable. For securitized contractual obligations managing credit risk is one of the core challenges which is currently impinging upon the development of energy efficiency and transformation improvement projects in the United States. According to the invention credit risk is defined as any potential loss resulting from failure of one or more parties to honor their financial obligations. The critical aspect of credit risk is its relationship to market risk risk that a portfolio will decrease due to a change in the market risk factors and that it has asymmetric behavior. Credit risk is the complement of mark to market MTM gain or loss of a counterparty to perform under a contract. In the energy and efficiency space non performance can come in many varieties ranging from contract frustration renegotiation and mutual concessions to regulatory intervention. A unique ability of MEDS systems according to the invention is to connect with a variety of digital exchange technologies in order to provide unique mechanisms for managing such risks as actual performance expected performance and changes in risk profiles for given contracts and assets over time.

According to the invention it is possible for securitized assets described herein to be managed such that a vibrant market can be maintained in a manner allowing a full range of vested parties to participate. This is extraordinarily challenging due to the vast arrays of different businesses e.g. hedge funds regulated utilities producers of energy commodities merchant energy producers industrial consumers financial institutions standalone merchant energy companies and standalone physical assets municipalities in addition to private consumers and small businesses that might choose to participate in such markets. The transparent management of risk associated with such processes will involve provision of a number of key pieces of information that will reduce advantages enjoyed by expert investors over individuals and less sophisticated participants. MEDS is designed to be coupled to a series of additional tools such as power systems modeling applications which can enhance its own forecasting and simulation capabilities by providing accurate information which can improve its ability to provide consumers and businesses of all types with information required to make educated decisions related to externality and credit risks and transactions in addition to energy transactions that can be initiated and managed by the system itself.

According to the invention illustrates an exemplary process in which credit risk can be represented and managed for securitized contracts participating in markets. In step a coverage contract is requested for a specified period and with a specified amount for an explicitly defined event by a user via a client system. In step a server system receives the request and optionally confirms receipt to the client system. In step the server system assigns the request to a statistics server which determines whether or not coverage should be offered and the price at which to offer it. In step the server system confirms an ability to offer the contract based on the system s risk management system which may involve external checks to an underwriter via a network. In step the server system communicates an offer to at least one client system which offer can then be reviewed and optionally purchased. Finally in step the server system validates payment and issues binding contracts. MEDS may be able to take actions based on inferred user decisions via direct user control or any combination thereof to manage risk exposure and contractual obligations of users in a market environment.

According to the invention MEDS systems according to the invention are also capable of providing independent protection to utilities and investors related to growth in electricity demand failures of energy efficiency projects to deliver on purported energy savings whether financially or in terms of energy metrics and against the impact of other exogenous factors that influence transformation and consumption of energy at campuses facilities and microgrids. Although MEDS systems can be used to provide real time monitoring and verification for connected systems to insurers or performance contractors it can also be used to provide a unique kind of business protection commonly referred to as coverage. According to the invention coverage contracts may be constructed by any end user performance contractor or other party that may have some type of financial regulatory or other interest in a connected building. However it will be appreciated that non connected parties could also be potential participants in a speculative manner depending on regulatory considerations. Coverage contracts constructed between two or more counterparties would involve a simple contract initiation process such as that which is depicted in . In this process a server system and client system construct a contract for a specified period using factors related to a coverage being requested. For example a coverage contract for building load exceeding 75 kilowatts of peak demand during the month of July could be constructed using elements such as the building s location the dates in this case July of a given year the specific conditions in this case exceeding 75 kW of peak demand the maximum level of coverage for the facility and the number of events to be covered. Similarly other consumption related externality related or cost related coverage contracts can be constructed for single buildings campuses and microgrids or across portfolios of such assets. For example a municipal utility serving electric customers in California may wish to hedge against large demand spikes that leave them with huge financial exposure to secure power during peak consumption in warm California summers. Peak consumption in a large portfolio of buildings could be protected against to reduce overall risk to a utility during its most precarious time of year. According to the invention it is desirable but not required for buildings to be connected to a MEDS platform to participate in such contracts. It is likely that increased discount factors for investors in such contracts and higher prices to coverage seekers would occur for systems not connected to a MEDS platform which would provide more accurate historical information and potentially active control mechanisms. That being said the invention includes use of load or thermal simulation tools which may be used to model demand in addition to use of integrated weather models and other exogenous data feeds which can still provide sufficient levels of accuracy in assessing risk to offer contracts to involved parties.

Coverage contracts described in this invention can utilize MEDS smart meter systems or other forms of monitoring and verification to assess whether or not an event meeting agreed upon payment terms in the coverage contract occurred. If so contract participants can be notified and automated actions taken to distribute funds via either electronic or physical means or both. Coverage contracts can enable payment based solely on occurrence of an event or based on some combination of other factors more traditionally associated with insurance contracts such as proof of loss payment withholding or claims processes. It is expected that a preponderance of such contracts would be settled solely on observed actions such as meter readings for the peak demand or consumption example measured by approved sensors for example weather sensors load monitors device control systems and the like .

In an embodiment of the invention logical abstraction of devices or eNodes within a network connected server system or at an iNode or client system level can enable more effective management of complexity inside the server system or digital exchange . This is as a result of the ability to deal with complexity towards the edges of a distributed system as opposed to centralizing complexity using rules engines as is commonly done. According to the invention this can provide significant improvements to scalability and resilience in a system by reducing complexity in central components on which many other parts of the system may be dependent. Similarly this logical abstraction enables a client system iNode or server system to create via a manual or automated process logical device improvements based on observed data for example an improved estimate of real time energy consumption requirements for a non metered device or to create custom controls logic which might be used to interface with particularly complex or unique end use devices or eNodes without any effect on the larger system.

According to another embodiment of the invention buildings campuses and microgrids connected to a MEDS server system via a network such as the Internet may be optimized using any number of analytical and simulation based techniques. This may involve use of stochastic optimization tools or mixed integer linear programming or other metaheuristics which are capable of solving various components of or all of a global optimization problem related to efficient operations of an end user system.

According to another embodiment of the invention throughout operation of an end user system connected to a MEDS system a variety of data fusion techniques can be utilized by the server system to leverage observed data collected from building automation and industrial controls systems that are connected to a MEDS system via a network.

In some embodiments of the invention aggregation of end users occurs through service providers rather than directly within a MEDS system. For example a server system is used by a wide variety of participants directly and thereby is enabled to aggregate additional users under one account associated with the server system and may optionally allocate commissions from earnings savings to said providers.

It should be understood that embodiments described herein are exemplary in nature and any number of alternative architectural approaches well known in the art of computer science for instance to improve scalability security or robustness may be used without departing from the scope of the invention. For example an intermediate computer can be used between a client system and a MEDS server to ensure a secure connection to MEDS as an option and to enhance system reliability resilience without departing from the scope of the invention. Such an approach could include use of an intermediate network connected computer system as a proxy server between a MEDS system and a DDC control system within a building campus or microgrid.

According to the invention the iNode and eNode components can be combined at any scale across the energy infrastructure. In one embodiment represented in the iNode component of pricing server can be used to create optimal schedules for equipment operations within a building. These schedules would deliver energy services such as thermal comfort lighting mobility etc. at a cost optimized control sequence. The control sequence is passed into the control system which executes the optimized schedule. An example of a control system is the building control system . This results in the delivery of energy services that energy users value and require. A common end user value is comfort. Comfort can be provided in many cost optimized manners that the iNode eNode construct can meet. For instance an end user can provide thermal heat by turning on the boiler buying a space heater letting sunlight into the building increase the number of workers and computers that generate ambient heat etc. Each one of these external variables can be entered into the statistical server . The cost optimal manner to reach thermal comfort can be determined executed and delivered to the end user with minimal input and effort.
