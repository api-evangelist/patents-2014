Itch or pruritus is an unpleasant sensation that causes the desire to scratch. Itch sensation includes both sensory and affective components and can be induced by chemical mechanical and psychological factors. While acute pruritus may serve as a protective mechanism chronic pruritus represents a significant clinical problem resulting from renal insufficiency cholestasis Hodgkin s lymphoma polycythemia vera solid tumors HIV as well as several serious skin diseases Twycross et al. 2003 Ikoma et al. 2006 . Chronic itching disrupts normal sleep pattern and daily activity. In the US pruritus occurs in approximately 20 of adults in 25 of patients with jaundice and in 50 of patients receiving renal dialysis. Atopic dermatitis which accompanies severe itch is the most common childhood skin disorder affecting 15 20 of children in developed countries and 10 of children worldwide Flohr et al. 2004 . It has been estimated that children with atopic dermatitis lose an average of 1.9 hours of sleep per night and their parents lose an average of 2.1 hours per night Buys 2007 . Unfortunately chronic pruritus is often resistant to treatment e.g. anti histamine and thus represents one of the major problems to society Carroll et al. 2005 . The direct cost of atopic dermatitis in the United States alone has been estimated to be 1 billion dollars per year Carroll et al. 2005 . In contrast to numerous studies on chronic pain the research on chronic pruritus remains a relatively neglected area Ikoma et al. 2006 Paus et al. 2006 .

While significant progress concerning the cellular mechanisms of itch sensation has been made over the past several years the molecular basis underlying itch sensation in the central nervous system was heretofore unknown. The lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms has hindered the development of effective mechanism based anti pruritic drugs. There is a need in the art therefore for a treatment of pruritus.

Itch sensation can be induced by chemical mechanical and psychological factors. An opioid or opiate is a general term for natural or synthetic substances that bind to specific receptors opioid receptors in the central nervous system producing an agonist action. Opioid analgesics are extremely useful in managing severe acute pain postoperative pain and chronic pain including cancer pain. Opioids however are known to induce pruritus. Consequently there is a need in the art for combinations comprising opioids that alleviate pain but that do not induce pruritus.

One aspect of the present invention encompasses a method for treating pruritus in a subject. The method comprises substantially inhibiting the activation of a first pruritus specific neuron receptor in a pruritus specific neuron of the subject.

Another aspect of the invention encompasses a method for treating pruritus in a subject. The method comprises substantially impeding the function of a pruritus specific neuron of the subject such that the pruritus specific neuron does not relay the itch sensation.

Yet another aspect encompasses a method for identifying a compound that decreases the incidence of pruritus in a subject. The method comprises contacting a pruritus specific neuron receptor in a cell of the subject with both a test compound and a pruritus specific ligand and comparing the activation of the cell to the activation of a cell contacted with only a pruritus specific ligand. If the activation of the pruritus specific neuron receptor is decreased in the cell contacted with the test ligand compared to the cell contacted with pruritus specific ligand alone then the test compound decreases the incidence of pruritus.

Still another aspect encompasses a combination comprising an agent that substantially inhibits the activation of a first pruritus specific neuron receptor in a pruritus specific neuron of a subject and or an agent that substantially inhibits the release and or production of a pruritus specific ligand and at least one analgesic agent.

A further aspect encompasses a combination comprising an agent that substantially impedes the function of a pruritus specific neuron of the subject such that the pruritus specific neuron does not relay the itch sensation and at least one analgesic agent.

The present invention provides methods and combinations for treating pruritus. Generally speaking the invention provides methods for treating pruritus by providing methods of substantially inhibiting the activation of a pruritus specific receptor on a pruritus specific neuron. In this context pruritus specific neurons refers to neurons that express a pruritus specific receptor are located in the central nervous system and are responsible for transmitting the itch sensation as opposed to pain perception. For instance GRPR is a pruritus specific receptor and neurons expressing GRPR in the dorsal horn are pruritus specific neurons. Similarly NMBR is a pruritus specific receptor and neurons expressing NMBR in the dorsal horn are pruritus specific neurons.

Advantageously substantially inhibiting the activation of a pruritus specific receptor on a pruritus specific neuron provides a direct means of treating pruritus by specifically targeting the neurons responsible for the itch sensation as opposed to other sensations. Similarly substantially inhibiting the activation of a pruritus specific receptor on a pruritus specific neuron provides a central means of treating pruritus by specifically targeting the neurons of the central nervous system responsible for the itch sensation as opposed to only inhibiting peripheral mediators such as histamine.

Usually an agent that alleviates pruritus may substantially inhibit the activation of a pruritus specific receptor on a pruritus specific neuron may substantially inhibit the production and or release of a pruritus specific ligand may substantially impede the function of a pruritus specific neuron or any combination thereof. In some embodiments a combination of the invention may comprise more than one agent that alleviates pruritus. For instance a combination may comprise an agent that substantially inhibits the activation of a pruritus specific receptor on a pruritus specific neuron and an agent that may substantially inhibit the production and or release of a pruritus specific ligand.

Pruritus may be histamine dependent or histamine independent. In one embodiment the methods of the invention may be used to treat histamine dependent pruritus. In another embodiment the methods of the invention may be used to treat histamine independent pruritus.

Methods of the invention may be used to treat pruritus arising from a variety of causes such as xerosis skin conditions such as psoriasis eczema sunburn athlete s foot insect bites poisonous plants such as poison ivy poison oak poison sumac Hodgkin s disease jaundice polycythemia scabies lice worms thyroid illness diabetes mellitus dandruff iron deficiency anemia parasitic infections medications cholestasis pruritus related to pregnancy HIV infection or other causes of itching or pruritus.

The present invention also provides a combination comprising an agent to alleviate pruritus and at least one analgesic agent. In particular the invention provides methods of alleviating pruritus induced by an analgesic agent.

One aspect of the invention encompasses treating pruritus by substantially inhibiting the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor. In one embodiment the activation is substantially inhibited by an antagonist to a pruritus neuron specific receptor. Non limiting examples of pruritus neuron specific receptors include gastrin releasing peptide receptor GRPR and NMB receptor NMBR . In one embodiment the pruritus specific neuron is contacted by a GRPR antagonist. In another embodiment the pruritus specific neuron is contacted by a NMBR antagonist. In yet another embodiment the pruritus specific neuron is contacted by both a GRPR antagonist and a NMBR antagonist.

In certain embodiments the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor is substantially inhibited by contacting the receptor with a GRPR antagonist. GRPR antagonists are known in the art and may be peptide or peptide derivative antagonists small molecular weight antagonists antibody antagonists or the like. In certain embodiments the GRPR receptor antagonist may be selected from the group of antagonists including Leu CHNH Leu Bn D Phe Bn 6 13 NH D Phe Bn 6 13 ethylamide D Phe Bn 6 13 propylamide D Phe Bn 6 13 heptylamide D Phe Bn 6 13 phenethylamide D Phe Bn 6 13 4 methylphenethylamide D Tyr Bn 6 13 propylamide D Phe Val CHNH Gly Bn 6 13 PA D Phe Bn 6 13 hydrazide D Phe Bn 6 13 methyl ester D Phe Bn 6 13 ethyl ester and N Ac GRP 20 26 ethyl ester. In other embodiments the GRPR receptor antagonists may include nonapeptide compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 244 883 nonapeptide compounds disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 369 094 analogues of substance P Coy et al. J. Biol. Chem. 263 5056 1988 and analogues of GRP 20 27 Heimbrook et al. J. Biol. Chem. 264 11258 1989 . In yet other embodiments the GRPR antagonist may be selected from the group of antagonists comprising RC 3095 RC3940 II BW2258U89 BW1023U90 PD176252 JMV594 and JMV641.

In some embodiments the pruritus specific neurons are substantially inhibited by contacting the neuron with a NMBR antagonist. NMBR antagonists are known in the art and may be peptide or peptide derivative antagonists small molecular weight antagonists antibody antagonists or the like. In certain embodiments the NMBR antagonist may be selected from the group of antagonists including BIM 23127 D Nal Cys Tyr D Trp Lys Val Cys Nal NH and PD 168368 Ryan et al. 1999 .

The antagonist generally will cross the blood brain barrier BBB of the subject to contact the pruritus specific neuron in the central nervous system. The antagonist may inherently be able to cross the BBB . For example compounds with a molecular weight below 500 daltons. Alternatively the antagonist may be delivered across the BBB . Methods of delivering antagonists across the BBB are known in the art. For instance antagonists may be delivered via injection into the intrathecal space. Additionally modalities for drug delivery across the BBB may entail its disruption by osmotic means biochemically by the use of vasoactive substances such as bradykinin or even by localized exposure to high intensity focused ultrasound HIFU . Other strategies to cross the BBB may entail the use of endogenous transport systems including carrier mediated transporters receptor mediated transcytosis and blocking of active efflux transporters.

The antagonists of the present invention may be in the form of free bases or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts commonly used to form alkali metal salts and to form addition salts of free acids or free bases. The nature of the salt may vary provided that it is pharmaceutically acceptable. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds for use in the present methods may be prepared from an inorganic acid or from an organic acid. Examples of such inorganic acids are hydrochloric hydrobromic hydroiodic nitric carbonic sulfuric and phosphoric acid. Appropriate organic acids may be selected from aliphatic cycloaliphatic aromatic araliphatic heterocyclic carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids examples of which are formic acetic propionic succinic glycolic gluconic lactic malic tartaric citric ascorbic glucuronic maleic fumaric pyruvic aspartic glutamic benzoic anthranilic mesylic 4 hydroxybenzoic phenylacetic mandelic embonic pamoic methanesulfonic ethanesulfonic benzenesulfonic pantothenic 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic toluenesulfonic sulfanilic cyclohexylaminosulfonic stearic algenic hydroxybutyric salicylic galactaric and galacturonic acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts of compounds of use in the present methods include metallic salts made from aluminum calcium lithium magnesium potassium sodium and zinc or organic salts made from N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine meglumine N methylglucamine and procaine. All of these salts may be prepared by conventional means from the corresponding compound by reacting for example the appropriate acid or base with any of the compounds of the invention.

Injectable preparations of the antagonists for example sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally or intrathecally acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water Ringer s solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition fatty acids such as oleic acid are useful in the preparation of injectables. Dimethyl acetamide surfactants including ionic and non ionic detergents and polyethylene glycols can be used. Mixtures of solvents and wetting agents such as those discussed above are also useful.

For therapeutic purposes formulations for administration of the antagonist may be in the form of aqueous or non aqueous isotonic sterile injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules having one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for use in the formulations for oral administration. The compounds may be dissolved in water polyethylene glycol propylene glycol ethanol corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil benzyl alcohol sodium chloride and or various buffers. Other adjuvants and modes of administration are well and widely known in the pharmaceutical art.

The amount of the antagonist that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage of the composition will vary depending upon the subject and the particular mode of administration. In some embodiments the amount of the antagonist may be between about 1 g to about 100 g. In other embodiments the amount of the antagonist may be at least about 1 g at least about 10 g at least about 20 g at least about 30 g at least about 40 g at least about 50 g at least about 60 g at least about 70 g at least about 80 g at least about 90 g or at least about 100 g. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages may also be determined with guidance from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ninth Edition 1996 Appendix II pp. 1707 1711 and from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Tenth Edition 2001 Appendix II pp. 475 493.

In another embodiment an agent that alleviates pruritus may substantially inhibit the release and or production of a pruritus specific ligand. An agent used to substantially inhibit the release and or production of the pruritus specific ligand does not necessarily need to cross the BBB as it may act on the afferent nerve fibers. In one embodiment an agent may substantially inhibit the release and or production of GRP. In another embodiment an agent may substantially inhibit the release and or production of NMB.

Agents that substantially inhibit the release and or production of a pruritus specific ligand are known in the art. For instance N type calcium channel blockers are known to inhibit the release of neuropeptides from primary afferent fibers. In one embodiment therefore an agent that alleviates pruritus may be an N type calcium channel blocker. Non limiting examples include Ziconotide and Conotoxin GVIA. Ziconotide is an FDA approved intrathecally administered peptide that blocks the N type calcium channel.

As described in section a i above agents used to substantially inhibit the release and or production of the pruritus specific ligand may be in the form of free bases or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.

The amount of an agent that substantially inhibits the release and or production of a pruritus specific ligand that may be combined with carrier materials to produce a single dosage of the combination will vary depending upon the subject and the particular mode of administration. For instance in some embodiments dosages of Ziconotide may range from about 0.01 mcg hour to about 0.8 mcg hr. In other embodiments dosages may range from about 0.01 mcg hour to about 0.1 mcg hour. For instance the dosage may be about 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 or 0.1 mcg hour. Alternatively the dosage may range from about 0.1 mcg hour to about 0.8 mcg hour. For instance the dosage may be about 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 or 0.8 mcg hour. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages may also be determined with guidance from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ninth Edition 1996 Appendix II pp. 1707 1711 and from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Tenth Edition 2001 Appendix II pp. 475 493.

In some embodiments a combination of the invention may comprise an agent from section I a i and an agent from section I a ii .

Pruritus may also be treated by substantially inhibiting the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor by blocking a pruritus specific ligand from interacting with a pruritus neuron specific receptor. As used herein pruritus specific ligand refers to a ligand for a pruritus specific neuron receptor. For example GRP and NMB are non limiting examples of pruritus specific ligands. In one embodiment the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor may be substantially inhibited by blocking the interaction of GRP with a pruritus neuron specific receptor. In another example the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor may be substantially inhibited by blocking the interaction of NMB with a pruritus neuron specific receptor. In yet another example the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor may be substantially inhibited by blocking the interaction of both GRP and NMB with one or more pruritus neuron specific receptors.

Methods of blocking the interaction of a pruritus specific ligand from interacting with the pruritus neuron specific receptor are known in the art. Antibodies peptides peptide derivatives or small molecules may be used to block the interaction between the pruritus specific ligand and the pruritus neuron specific receptor. For instance an antibody that recognizes the pruritus specific ligand and intereferes with the ligand binding to the pruritus neuron specific receptor may be used. For example the GRP blocking antibody 2A11 may be used to block the interaction of GRP with a pruritus neuron specific receptor.

Alternatively the release and or production of the pruritus specific ligand may be substantially inhibited. Agents used to substantially inhibit the release and or production of the pruritus specific ligand do not need to cross the BBB to substantially inhibit the pruritus specific neurons in the central nervous system. As described above agents used to substantially inhibit the release and or production of the pruritus specific ligand may be in the form of free bases or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof.

Additionally the agents may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions and administered by a number of different means that will deliver a therapeutically effective dose. Such compositions may be administered orally parenterally by inhalation spray rectally intradermally transdermally or topically in dosage unit formulations containing conventional nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers adjuvants and vehicles as desired. Topical administration may also involve the use of transdermal administration such as transdermal patches or iontophoresis devices. The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous intravenous intramuscular or intrasternal injection or infusion techniques. Formulation of drugs is discussed in for example Hoover John E. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1975 and Liberman H. A. and Lachman L. Eds. Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms Marcel Decker New York N.Y. 1980 .

Injectable preparations and formulations for parenteral administration may be prepared as described above. Solid dosage forms for oral administration may include capsules tablets pills powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms the compound is ordinarily combined with one or more adjuvants appropriate to the indicated route of administration. If administered per os the compound can be admixed with lactose sucrose starch powder cellulose esters of alkanoic acids cellulose alkyl esters talc stearic acid magnesium stearate magnesium oxide sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids gelatin acacia gum sodium alginate polyvinylpyrrolidone and or polyvinyl alcohol and then tableted or encapsulated for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets can contain a controlled release formulation as can be provided in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. In the case of capsules tablets and pills the dosage forms can also comprise buffering agents such as sodium citrate or magnesium or calcium carbonate or bicarbonate. Tablets and pills can additionally be prepared with enteric coatings.

Liquid dosage forms for oral administration may include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions solutions suspensions syrups and elixirs containing inert diluents commonly used in the art such as water. Such compositions may also comprise adjuvants such as wetting agents emulsifying and suspending agents and sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents.

The amount of the compound of the invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage of the composition will vary depending upon the subject and the particular mode of administration. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that dosages may also be determined with guidance from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Ninth Edition 1996 Appendix II pp. 1707 1711 and from Goodman Goldman s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics Tenth Edition 2001 Appendix II pp. 475 493.

In some embodiments the antagonist may be coupled to a neurotoxin that is incapable of independently entering the neuron. In these embodiments the antagonist binds to the receptor on the pruritus neuron cell membrane and delivers the neurotoxin to the neuron thereby selectively impeding the function of the pruritus specific neuron and hence substantially inhibiting the pruritus specific neuron. Non limiting examples of suitable neurotoxins may include saporin modified botulinum toxin the enzymatic chain of ricin the ribosome inactivating protein gelonin the enzymatic chain of exotoxin and the enzymatic chain of diphtheria toxin. Methods of coupling an antagonist to a neurotoxin are well known. For instance see Nichols et al. Science 1999 286 1558 1561 and published US Patent Applications 2007 0110769 2007 0048335 and 20040253248. In one embodiment the antagonist is coupled to saporin. Methods of coupling an antagonist to saporin are known in the art and may be found for example in published US Patent Application 20040253248.

Generally speaking the amount of antagonist coupled to a neurotoxin may be between about 200 ng to about 2 g. In certain embodiments the amount may be less than about 200 ng at least about 200 ng at least about 500 ng at least about 1 g at least about 1.5 g or at least about 2 g. The antagonist coupled to a neurotoxin may typically be administered as detailed in section I above.

Another aspect of the invention provides screening methods for identifying compounds that decrease the incidence of pruritus. Typically the method comprises comparing the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor in a cell contacted with both a test compound and a pruritus specific ligand to the activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor in a cell contacted with only a pruritus specific ligand wherein if the activation of the pruritus specific neuron receptor is decreased in the cell contacted with the test compound compared to the cell contacted with pruritus specific ligand alone then the test compound decreases the incidence of pruritus.

In some embodiments the pruritus specific neuron receptor that is activated is GRPR. In other embodiments the pruritus specific neuron receptor that is activated is NMBR.

The activation of a pruritus specific neuron receptor may be measured by means known in the art. For instance a biochemical modification of the receptor itself or a downstream signaling molecule may be quantified. A non limiting example of a biochemical modification is phosphorylation. Alternatively neuron activation may be observed as an indicator of pruritus specific neuron receptor activation. Methods of observing neuron activation are known in the art.

One aspect of the present invention provides a combination comprising an agent to alleviate pruritus and at least one analgesic agent. Suitable analgesic agents are described below.

A combination of the invention also comprises at least one analgesic agent. For instance a combination of the invention may comprise at least one at least two at least three at least four at least five at least six or more than six analgesic agents. In some embodiments at least one analgesic agent may be an opioid. As used herein an opioid is a substance that binds to an opioid receptor and possesses biological activity. A non limiting example of an opioid is an opiate. In other embodiments at least one analgesic agent may be a non opioid analgesic. In certain embodiments the combination may comprise at least one opioid analgesic and at least one non opioid analgesic.

To identify novel genes that are expressed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord differential dorsal ventral screening was performed Li et al. 2006 . The expression of the GRPR gene was found to be restricted to lamina I of the spinal cord . GRPR expression is located in the most superficial layer of the dorsal horn . No GRPR cells are found in the deep dorsal horn and ventral horn of the spinal cord. Such highly specific expression of a gene in lamina I but not in other regions of the dorsal horn is unprecedented. Because lamina I neurons have been implicated in pain and itch sensation we postulated that GRPR neurons may be important for mediating the itch sensation.

GRP is expressed in a subset of small and medium sized DRG neurons and is colocalized with peripherin a marker for unmyelinated fibers . GRP is also colocalized with CGRP or substance P but is neither costained with isolectin B4 IB4 a nonpeptidergic marker nor with myelinated marker NF200 D E data not shown . Furthermore about 80 GRP neurons express TRPV1 in the DRGs data not shown . GRP fibers project to the superficial layer laminae I and II outer layers of the dorsal spinal cord to which SP fibers and CGRP fibers project . GRP mRNA is not found in the superficial layer of the spinal cord.

To examine whether GRPR is required for locomotor activity GRPR mutant and wild type littermate mice were examined in an open field test. There was no significant difference in locomotor activity between the two genotypes . To assess whether GRPR may contribute to pain sensation the thermal mechanical and inflammatory formalin pain responses of GRPR mutant mice were examined. We found the GRPR mutant mice and wild type mice did not differ in any of the pain behaviors examined suggesting that GRPR is not required for transmission of noxious information.

To further examine pain behaviors of GRPR mutant mice in persistent pain models the mechanical hypersensitivity produced by hindpaw injection of complete Freund s adjuvant CFA was examined and no significant difference was found between GRPR mutant and wild type littermates . To examine if GRPR is required for neuropathic pain the mechanical thresholds of GRPR mutant and wild type mice were tested in the partial sciatic nerve injury model Malmberg and Basbaum 1998 . Comparable mechanical hyperalgesia was found in ipslateral and contralateral sides of the injury between GRPR mutant and wild type mice data not shown .

To ascertain whether there is an alteration in the expression of pain related genes in the dorsal horn a number of pain related genes were examined by immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization studies and no obvious difference in their expression was detected in the dorsal horn between GRPR mutant and wild type littermate mice data not shown . Taken together the behavioral and molecular analysis suggest that GRPR is not required for pain sensation.

To ascertain whether GRPR is required for itch sensation we studied the effects of several pruritogenic agents in GRPR mutant mice and wild type mice. These pruritogens include compound 48 80 which degranulates mast cells and releases histamine Kuraishi et al. 1995 a protease activated receptor 2 PAR2 agonist SLIGRL NH2 which is a histamine independent itch mediator Steinhoff et al. 2003 Shimada et al. 2006 and chloroquine pan and Cowan 2004 Green et al. 2006 . In all tests the scratching behavior induced by i.d. injection of these agents was significantly reduced in GRPR mutant mice compared to wild type mice .

To determine whether an activation of GRPR in the spinal cord may facilitate the transmission of itch signals which would subsequently result in increased scratching behavior the GRPR agonist GRP18 27 was intrathecally administered Ladenheim et al. 1996 . Indeed increased scratching behavior was found in a dose dependent manner data not shown . However in GRPR mutant mice injected with this agonist intrathecally the number of scratching behaviors were significantly lower . I.t. injection of the GRPR antagonist D Phe 6 Bn 6 13 OMe Wang et al. 1990 significantly inhibited GRP18 27 induced scratching behavior . I.t. injection of the GRPR antagonist 10 min before i.d. injection of each of the pruritogenic agents resulted in a significant reduction of the scratching behavior compared with saline control D E. These results suggest that GRP acts through spinal GRPR to mediate the transmission of information that drives scratching behavior in response to pruritogenic stimuli.

The second mammalian bombesin like peptide NMB and its receptor NMBR appear to show similar expression pattern with that of GRP and GRPR. In DRG cells NMB is expressed in a subset of neurons which also express CGRP indicating that NMB is expressed in a subset of peptidergic C fibers FIG. A B data not shown . In contrast NMBR is expressed in the most superficial layer of the dorsal spinal cord . These expression patterns are consistent with previous literature Namba et al. 1985 Wada et al. 1990 .

NMBR is a mammalian homologue of bombesin like peptide receptors and may have a role in mediating itching sensation in the spinal cord. To determine whether neuromedin B NMB an NMBR agonist may mediate some scratching behaviors we injected NMB into mice intrathecally. Similar to GRP i.t. injection of NMB 1 nmol 5 l induced robust scratching behaviors in wild type mice . Because the scratching behaviors are not completely abolished in GRPR mutant mice this raises the question of whether other bombesin like peptide receptors such as NMBR may compensate for the loss of GRPR in the spinal cord. Indeed our preliminary studies suggest such a possibility. GRPR and NMBR may have redundant functions for several reasons 1. NMBR and GRPR share significant homology 2. NMB is expressed in a subset of small DRG neurons and NMBR is expressed in the superficial layer of the spinal cord data not shown Namba et al. 1985 Wada et al. 1990 3. Intrathecal NMB induces scratching behavior 4. In several species examined GRPR and NMBR are all coupled to downstream intracellular signaling components including phospholipase C and are capable of stimulating tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins such as p125FAK Ryan et al. 1998 .

Identification of GRPR and GRP as the itch genes paves the way for the molecular characterization of itch related genes in the nervous system. Recently National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes NINDS The Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas GENSAT BAC transgenic project at Rockefeller University has generated GRP EGFP GRP enhanced green fluorescent protein transgenic mice successfully Gong et al. 2003 . In GRP EGFP mice endogenous GRP coding sequence has been replaced by the sequence encoding EGFP protein and EGFP can be used as a molecular tag to label GRP cells. Images from GENSAT database showed that that GRP EGFP fibers are present in the superficial layer of the dorsal horn. Although GRP EGFP staining in DRG cells is not available from GENSAT the fact that GRP EGFP fiber staining in the superficial dorsal horn provides convincing evidence that GRP EGFP expression mimics endogenous GRP expression. Moreover GENSAT database also shows that GRP EGFP staining in other brain regions of GRP EGFP mice recapitulates the endogenous expression of GRP in the brain data not shown further validating the GRP EGFP transgenic lines. The availability of GRP EGFP mice makes it possible for the first time to sort GRP cells from other types of DRG cells. In contrast to GRP expression in peptidergic cells in the DRGs c Ret a transmembrane signaling component of the receptor for glial cell derived growth factor GDNF is only expressed in non peptidergic IB4 GRP cells Molliver et al. 1997 Snider and McMahon 1998 . Dr. Jeff Milbrandt at Washington University has generated c Ret EGFP knock in mice and expression of c Ret EGFP mimics that of endogenous c Ret Jain et al. 2006 . Examination of EGFP in DRG cells of c Ret EGFP mice indicates that EGFP recapitulates endogenous c Ret expression. It was also confirmed that GRP and IB4 are not coexpressed in DRG cells.

The scratching behaviors of GRPR mutant mice are not completely abolished in some itch models . For example in the compound 48 80 model despite a significant reduction in scratching behaviors of GRPR mutant mice compared with wild type controls the mutant mice still scratched in response to itching stimuli . Moreover i.t. injection of the GRPR agonist GRP18 27 induced dose dependent scratching behaviors but GRP induced scratching behaviors are not completely lost in GRPR mutant mice . These observations suggest that GRPR is not the only itch mediator in the spinal cord and raise the possibility that GRP may cross talk with other GRPR like receptors in the spinal cord. A likely candidate is NMBR because it is the closest homologue of GRPR. Anatomically NMB is expressed in a subset of small DRG cells and NMB fibers project to lamina I and II of the dorsal horn Namba et al. 1985 Wada et al. 1990 whereas its receptor NMBR is expressed in the dorsal spinal cord Wada et al. 1990 . Indeed preliminary studies indicated that i.t. injection of NMB is capable if inducing robust scratching behaviors . These studies raise the possibility that NMBR may have compensated for the loss of GRPR in GRPR mutant mice in response to compound 48 80 and GRP may cross talk with NMBR to mediate itch transmission.

To confirm the efficacy of the NMBR antagonist BIM 23127 Tocris we will test whether BIM 23127 can inhibit the scratching behavior induced by i.t. injection of NMB and determine the minimal dose needed to black this effect. Different doses of BIM 23127 0.1 0.3 1.0 nmol 5 l diluted in saline or saline only 5 l will be injected 10 min before i.t. injection of NMB 1.0 nmol 5 l and the number of scratching responses will be counted for 30 min at 5 min intervals after injection. Another group of mice will receive the injection of BIM 23127 1.0 nmol 5 l only to determine whether BIM 23127 itself can cause scratching behavior. All measurement will be performed by a person who is blinded to the experiment condition.

To examine the effect of the NMBR antagonist on the scratching behavior of mice three animal models for itch will be used. a compound 48 80 100 g Sigma Aldrich b chloroquine 200 g Sigma Aldrich c and the PAR2 agonist SLIGRL NH2 100 g Bachem . Each pruritogenic reagent is dissolved in saline in a volume of 50 l. Saline is injected into different group of mice as the control. Two days before experiments a 1.5 cm diameter circular area is shaved at the back of the neck where i.d. injections are given. Then the mouse is placed in a small plastic chamber 9 9 13 cm for 60 min for acclimation prior to experiments. Either NMBR antagonist or saline will be injected intrathecally 10 min before i.d. injection. Immediately after i.d. injection of the pruritogenic agent into the rostral part of the back mice will be placed back into the same cage for the observation of scratching of the injection site by a hind paw Maekawa et al. 2000 . The mice will be videotaped beginning 15 min prior to i.d. injection for later counting of hind paw scratching behavior directed towards the shaved area at the back of the neck.

All the behavioral experiments will be performed by a person who is blinded to the experimental condition. Statistical analyses will be performed using the repetitive ANOVA to compare the effect of NMB or NMBR antagonist with saline group. These comparisons will be made by the use of Prism Software GraphPad San Diego Calif. and STATISTICA 7 StatSoft Tulsa Okla. . Data will be expressed as the mean s.e.m and p

NMBR heterozygous mice have recently been obtained from Dr. Hiroko OHKI Hamazaki in Japan and are being bred to generate NMBR mutant mice in our facility. These mice exhibited normal locomotor activity and were fertile Ohki Hamazaki et al. 1997 and thus should be valuable for assessing the requirement of NMBR in itch sensation. Mice will be genotyped by PCR as described Ohki Hamazaki et al. 1997 . For each pruritogenic agent ten NMBR mutant male mice and 10 wild type littermate control mice will be used. Three sets of experiments will be performed using three different pruritogenic agents compound 48 80 PAR2 agonist and chloroquine as described above. Injection of these pruritogenic agents and the examination of the scratching behaviors of these mice will be performed according the procedure described in Experiment 8. Statistical analyses will be performed using the repetitive ANOVA as described in Experiment 8. All of the experiments will be performed by a person who is blind to the genotype and treatment.

In mammals often a member of a gene family may substitute for the loss of the function of one of their own members. The mechanism of functional redundancy may provide a safeguard against inadvertent loss of one of their own and ensure the survival of the animals. GRPR and NMBR are members of mammalian bombesin like receptor family and share 56 homology of amino acid sequence. Moreover the compounds that bind to NMBR also bind to GRPR with a lower affinity Ryan et al. 1999 . In GRPR mutant mice some scratching behaviors remain in response to pruritogenic stimuli suggesting that NMBR may compensate for the loss of GRPR in the spinal cord. This possibility can be critically tested by examining the scratching behaviors of GRPR NMBR double knockout mice and comparing them with GRPR or NMBR single knockout mice as well as wild type littermate controls. Regardless of whether NMBR mutant mice show abnormal scratching behaviors in experiment 9 this genetic experiment will help understand the relationship between GRPR and NMBR in the spinal circuitry.

NMBR GRPR double heterozygous mice will be generated by mating NMBR mutant mice with GRPR mutant mice. NMBR GRPR double heterozygous mice then will be mated with each other to generate NMBR GRPR double mutant mice. Because of a low percentage of double mutant mice in one litter several litters within two weeks of period will be pooled for the experiment. To ensure that the results are comparable in similar genetic background in addition to GRPR NMBR double mutants GRPR and NMBR single mutant mice will also be used for behavioral comparison. Mice with other combination of genotyping such as double heterozygous mice will be tested in pilot experiment to confirm they exhibit normal scratching behaviors like their wild type littermates do. In all experiments only male mice will be used and age of the mice will be similar.

The scratching behavior of GRPR NMBR double mutant mice will be examined using compound 48 80 PAR2 agonist SLIGRL NH2 and chloroquine. The scratching behaviors will be induced by i.d. injection of pruritogenic agents and the number of scratches will be recorded counted and compared between GRPR single mutant mice NMBR single GRPR NMBR double mutant and wild type mice. Experimental protocols will be as the same as those described in Experiment 8. Data analysis will also be the same as described in Experiment 8.

Rapid progress has been made in identifying the receptors such as the transient receptor potential TRP channels involved in pain and temperature sensation during the past several years Tominaga and Caterina 2004 Wang and Woolf 2005 . In contrast few itch genes have been found. Several reasons may have hindered the progress in studies of molecular machinery that controls itch sensation First our lack of understanding of itch specific neuronal pathways is an obstacle for molecular study of the itch genes. In fact the difficulty of identifying itch specific neurons has made the molecular cloning of itch specific genes using the differential screening strategy a common technique for cloning tissue specific genes almost impossible. Second the genes that have been implicated in itch sensation are often implicated in pain making it difficult to dissociate the itch genes from the pain genes. Third the lack of adequate animal models and a great variability in animal behavioral tests also represent a problem Green et al. 2006 . Finally while knockout mice lacking genes expressed in the nociceptive pathway have been routinely examined for potential defects in pain behaviors it has not been so for itch related behaviors. Identification of GRP and GRPR as itch genes should provide an opportunity for molecular cloning of itch related genes in GRP or GRPR cells.

In this experiment the genes that are expressed in GRP cells in DRGs will be identified. There are several compelling reasons for us to use GRP DRG neurons as a starting point for molecular cloning of itch related genes 1 . Our studies suggest that GRP sensory neurons mediate the transmission of itch signals from the skin to the spinal cord. In line with this GRP is expressed in a rare subset of small diameter unmyelinated C fibers which project to lamina I and IIo outer layer of the dorsal horn. This expression pattern is in accordance with what we know about the itch neuronal pathway Schmelz 2001 Davidson et al. 2007 . The finding that only approximately 8 of total DRG cells express GRP makes these cells a unique population for identifying their underlying molecular signature. 2 . The genetic tools for isolating GRP cells are now available thereby making tissue specific molecular cloning feasible. EGFP as an intracellular reporter is a very useful tool for flow cytometric separation of different populations of cells and therefore can be exploited to sort EGFP cells from EGFP cells Bhattacherjee et al. 2004 . 3 Rapid improved gene chip technology now only requires a minimal amount of cRNA and thus very small number of cells for hybridization. In addition GRP EGFP mice are available in MMRRC at University of California Davis a NIH sponsored service. We are currently in the process of importing GRP EGFP mice from MMRRC to our facility at Washington University.

Because of the difficulties of dissociating adult DRG neurons due to abundance of fibers in DRGs P0 DRGs will be used for dissecting DRG out from mice. In addition no co expression of GRP and IB4 is found at this stage. Because of a low percentage of GRP cells approximately 8 GRP EGFP mice will be used for sampling. In contrast c Ret expression is much more abundant than GRP in DRG cells about 60 70 of total DRG cells and thus one c Ret EGFP mouse will be used for sampling. The DRGs will be dissected out and kept in 1 Fetal Calf Serum FCS for nutrition at 4 C. To generate goodyields for cell sorting the DRGs will be dissociated in 0.1 trypsin and resuspended into single cell suspension in Hank s Balanced Salt Solution HBSS with no calcium or magnesium and no phenyl red. The suspension will be filtered through a 40 50 micron cell strainer B D Falcon 352340 . Except for the digestion step the sample will be kept cold at all times to minimize RNA degradation and cell death. Washington University provides an excellent facility for cell sorting and it is expected that GRP and c Ret cells will be isolated. Total RNAs are prepared from sorted from GRP EGFP cells and c Ret EGFP cells respectively by using RNA Bee reagent Tel Test Friendswood Tex. . Total RNAs are further obtained using the RNeasy mini kit Valencia Calif. and the quality of RNAs is assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA will be made from GRP EGFP cells and c Ret EGFP cells respectively followed by RT to make cRNA for subtractive screening.

GRP and c Ret cDNAs for subtractive hybridization are prepared using smart PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit Clontech . GRP and c Ret cDNA subtractions will be performed using Clontech PCR Select cDNA subtraction Kit Clontech . In forward subtraction GRP cDNA tester will be suppressed by excess c Ret driver to enrich GRP high cDNA. In reverse subtraction GRP cDNA tester is suppressed by excess c Ret cDNA driver to enrich c Ret cDNA. The subtracted forward products which enrich GRP cDNA will be subcloned into PCRII vector using TA Cloning Kit Invitrogen Life technologies and transformed into TOP10F competent to construct subtracted GRP cDNA library as described Li et al. 2006 .

Picked clones will be randomly selected from the subtracted GRP cDNA library. Differential screening will be performed according to the manual in the PCR Select Differential Screening Kit Clontech as we have previously described Li et al. 2006 . In brief the insert of each clone will be amplified and quantified. About 20 30 ng PCR product will be dissolved in denaturation solution at a 1 1 ratio and dotted on a nylon membrane Hybond XL Amersham . Hybridizations will be performed with both subtracted and unsubtracted GRP and c Ret probes which are labeled with P dUTP by using Prime a Gene Labeling system Promega . Candidate clones showing GRP hybridization signals will be selected and sequenced by the WUSTL Sequencing Core facility St. louis Mo. . Sequences will be identified in GenBank.

Tissue collection and the isolation of GRP and c Ret cells will be the same as described above. Total RNA will be isolated from the spinal cords using Trizol RNA extraction protocol available from Invitrogen . The quality of total RNA is critical for the success of microarray experiment. To ensure the high quality of total RNA a small amount of total RNA will be subjected to spectrophotometric and electrophoretic analysis. Only total RNA with high quality will be used for further experiments. cRNA targets for microarray analysis will be generated according to the Affymetrix Genechip Expression Analysis Manual Affymetrix Santa Clara Calif. . Briefly double stranded cDNA will be synthesized from 5.0 g of total RNA directly using Gibco BRL s SuperScript choice system. cDNA will be purified using phenol chloroform extraction with Phase Lock Gel Eppendorf and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. In vitro transcription will be performed to produce biotin labeled cRNA using a BioArray High Yield RNA Transcription Labeling Kit Enzo Diagnostics . Affymetrix murine expression MOE430 sets which contain approximately 45 000 probe sets will be hybridized with labeled GRP and c Ret cRNA targets. Hybridization washing and scanning of Genechips will be carried out on an Affymetrics Fluidics Station following the standard procedures at the WUSTL Genechip Facility St. Louis Mo. . The arrays will be washed and stained using a fluidics system with streptavidin phycoerythin Molecular Probes amplified with biotinylated anti streptavidin antibody Vector laboratories and then scanned with a GeneArray Scanner Affymetrix . A total of three independent GRP and c Ret hybridizations will be carried out to reduce the experimental variations. These are standard techniques that we have previously used Li et al. 2006 .

The CEL files will be obtained with Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. DNA Chip Analyzer dChip version 1.3. Harvard Li and Wong 2001 will be used to normalize all CEL files to the baseline arrays compute the model based expression PM only model and import the normalized values into Microsoft Excel where probe sets absent from all chips will be removed. The fold change FC in GRP expression for each probe set will be calculated using Excel. Significance analysis of microarrays SAM Tusher et al. 2001 will be applied to analyzing the expression difference between GRP and c Ret probe sets. Candidate genes will be filtered out by the use of two criteria FCs 1.5 and SAM with false discovery rate FDR 

The genes which show fold change above the cut off line between GRP cells and c Ret cells will be subcloned by PCR. To amplify the gene of interest the primers flanking about 1 kb cDNA sequence will be designed based on the sequence information in GeneBank. Amplified PCR fragments will be subcloned into pREM T vector Promega and sequenced for confirmation. Once it is confirmed the subcloned plasmids will be used as templates for synthesizing anti sense RNA probes by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. Sense probes will be synthesized as a control for non specific signals. Digoxigenin labled RNA probes will be made and hybridized as described Birren et al. 1993 . In our hands approximately 30 40 candidate genes can be screened simultaneously within one week Li et al. 2006 . The expression of these genes in the DRG cells will be examined by the use of in situ hybridization.

Once the gene is confirmed to be expressed in a subset of DRG cells we will determine whether the candidate gene is colocalized with GRP by in situ hybridization followed by immunostaining using anti GRP antibody. This technique has been routinely used in our lab to verify the gene expression Li et al. 2006 . Using this approach we should be able to validate whether the candidate genes are indeed expressed in GRP cells.

Three groups of mice were given bombesin saporin Advanced Targeting Systems CA at the dose of 1 microgram 100 ng 10 ng intrathecally at the volume of 5 l. Two weeks after the bombesin saporin treatment the mice were tested for GRP18 27 induced scratching behavior. The scratching behavior was obviously reduced dose dependently. See The depletion of GRPR positive neurons are confirmed by in situ hybridization. See Other markers of the superficial dorsal horn are normal.

Bombesin originally isolated from frog skin is an exogenous agonist of high affinity for GRPR and bombesin saporin bombesin sap a toxin coupled to bombesin can bind and kill GRPR neurons upon its internalization after intrathecal injection into the spinal cord. In example 8 GRPR neurons in the spinal cord were selectively ablated and itch and pain behaviors of these mice was assessed.

To employ the bombesin sap ablation approach in mice the dose of bombesin sap and time points that were appropriate for intrathecal injection were first assessed using blank sap in which saporin is conjugated to a peptide of random sequence as the controls. Mice treated with a single injection of bombesin sap using three different doses 200 ng 300 ng and 400 ng showed reduced scratching behaviors in response to intradermal i.d. injection of chloroquine a histamine independent pruritogenic agent as well as a dose dependent decrease of GRPR neurons as detected by in situ hybridization in the spinal cord compared with blank sap . At 400 ng after two weeks of injection more than 80 of the GRPR neurons were ablated to C and this number of GRPRneurons remained relatively same after 4 weeks of treatment . The number of GRPR neurons was similar between the control groups treated with blank sap or saline . Moreover no severe behavioral abnormalities were noted in bombesin sap treated mice. Therefore bombesin sap at 400 ng with two weeks of treatment was chosen in all the experiments.

To determine whether bombesin sap might ablate other subsets of cells in the dorsal horn different populations of the superficial dorsal horn neurons were analyzed using lamina specific markers. Expression of neuromedin U receptor 2 NMUR2 a marker for a subset of lamina I neurons in the spinal cord was not affected in mice treated with bombesin sap . Expression of dynorphin another lamina I specific marker was also unchanged data not shown . Neurokinin 1 receptor NK1 is primarily expressed in lamina I and ablation of NK1 neurons in the spinal cord by substance P sap reduced the persistent but not acute pain responses in rats. NK1 signals in lamina I did not change as assessed by density of the fluorescience signal after immunocytochemistry . Expression of lamina II markers such as neurotensin and PKC did not reveal significant change in their expression in the bombesin sap group . A comparison of the same panel of molecular markers in the spinal cords between the blank sap and saline groups showed no significant changes in subpopulations of laminae I II either in their numbers or their expression patterns . In addition the subsets of primary fibers examined by a variety of markers including GRP CGRP Substance P SP and IB4 remained unaffected by the bombesin sap treatment . Together these data demonstrate that only GRPR cells were ablated whereas neither other subpopulations of lamina I neurons and lamina II nor the primary afferents were affected. Moreover the normal expression pattern of NK1 in mice treated with bombesin sap indicates that GRPR neurons and NK1 neurons whose neuroanatomic electrophysiological and functional features have been most intensively studied are two distinct subpopulations in lamina I of the spinal cord.

To assess the role of GRPR neurons in itch sensation mice treated with bombesin sap and blank sap were subjected to i.d. injection of a panel of pruritogenic agents followed by counting scratching behaviors. Unlike the control mice which exhibited vigorous scratching mice treated with bombesin sap rarely showed scratching behaviors in response to injection of histamine a potent pruritogen . Consistently scratching behavior evoked by compound 48 80 a mast cell degranulator was also largely lost . These results are in a striking contrast with that of GRPR mutant mice whose scratching behavior evoked by histamine or compound 48 80 was either not significantly affected or modestly reduced . Thus GRPR neurons are a subpopulation of lamina I cells pivotal for mediating histamine or histamine dependent itch sensation.

We next determined scratching behaviors elicited by an agonist for PAR2 a receptor which mediates histamine independent itch via protease mucunain and chloroqune an antimalarial drug which also causes pruritus in Africans. Similarly mice treated with bombesin sap rarely scratched in these tests whereas the control mice responded vigorously D . Our data thus identify GRPR neurons as a subpopulation of lamina I cells pivotal for mediating both histamine dependent and histamine independent itch sensation. Finally we asked whether GRPR neurons may mediate the sensation of itching whose histamine dependence is yet to be determined. Examination of scratching behaviors elicited by endothelin 1 which exerts its pruritic effect through ETreceptors and serotonin or 5 HT also found that a nearly lack of responses to these stimuli in mice treated with bombesin sap F . In contrast GRPR mutant mice exhibited normal scratching behaviors in response to endothelin 1 and 5 HT C . In all pruritic agents tested the scratching behaviors of the blank sap group and the saline group were similar demonstrating that blank sap had no neurotoxicity on the dorsal horn neurons . Taken together these results suggest that GRPR neurons are required for itch sensations mediated by varying mechanisms.

Although molecular analysis has suggested that subpopulations of GRPR independent neurons in the dorsal spinal cord were normal after intrathecal bombesin sap treatment we did not know whether some subsets of GRPR independent neurons not identified by available lamina I markers might have been killed by bombesin saporin thereby contributing to the phenotype. This issue is important because we cannot exclude the possibility that bombesin may also bind to some receptors that may be expressed in non GRPR neurons. Because the GRPR mutation should protect GRPR neurons from being ablated by bombesin sap we reasoned that if GRPR cells were only population being killed in the dorsal spinal cord and responsible for the phenotype GRPR mutant mice treated with bomesin sap and with blank sap respectively should exhibit comparable scratching responses. Indeed we found that scratching behaviors of GRPR mutant mice were similar between the bombesin sap and blank sap groups in all itch models tested demonstrating that a lack of neurotoxicity effect of bombesin sap in the spinal cord of GRPR mutant mice. Therefore we conclude that GRPR neurons are the only population of cells responsible for the loss of scratching behaviors in wild type mice treated with bombesin sap.

To exclude the possibility that a loss of scratching behaviors of mice treated with bombesin sap may be attributed by the impaired motor function the motor activity of treated mice was assessed by the rotarod test. No significant difference in time mice spent on the accelerating rotating rod was found between the bombesin sap and the control groups indicating that the ablation of GRPR neurons did not influence the motor function . Thus these mice should provide a unique venue to address whether itch and pain signals are relayed by the same neural pathway. Next we tested mice treated with bombesin sap using a variety of acute and persistent pain behavioral paradigms. Mechanical withdrawal threshold was examined by von Frey filaments and no significant difference between two groups was found indicating that GRPR neurons are dispensable for mechanical pain . The acute thermal pain was assessed by the paw withdrawal Hargreaves and tail flick tests and in both paradigms the latency of the responses to thermal stimuli in the bombesin sap group was also similar to the control mice D . Mustard oil which elicits a sensation of burning pain via TRPA1 was used for testing acute inflammatory pain. However the licking and flinching behaviors evoked by the injection of mustard oil 0.75 into the plantar surface of one hindpaw were reduced significantly in mice treated with bombesin saporin suggesting that GRPR neurons are involved in mustard oil evoked pain. We also tested acute and persistent inflammatory pain responses using the formalin which elicited a biphasic response lasting about 10 min the first phase and from 10 min to one hr the second phase respectively. We found that licking and flinching behaviors elicited by intraplantar injection of 5 formalin in both phases were indistinguishable between the treated group and the control group . To evaluate whether GRPR neurons are required in persistent inflammatory pain we used Complete Freund s adjuvant CFA model. CFA was injected into the plantar of the right hindpaw of mice followed by measuring their mechanical sensitivity using a set of calibrated von Frey filaments. Mechanical hypersensitivity in mice treated with bombesin sap was comparable to that in the control group . These data suggest that GRPR neurons are not important for the development of persistent inflammatory pain. Finally we asked whether there was an alteration of neuropathic pain in treated mice using partial sciatic nerve injury PNI model. The mechanical hyperalgesia increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli after bombesin sap treatment remained comparable to that in the control group . With the exception of mustard oil test mice lacking GRPR neurons in the spinal cord showed normal pain behaviors which are reminiscent of that of GRPR mutant mice. To determine whether bombesin sap might have killed some of GRPR independent neurons which may not be important for itch but have accounted for the compromised pain behaviors elicited by mustard oil we compared pain responses of GRPR mutant mice treated with bombesin sap and blank sap. Similar to other pain tests we did not find any difference between the groups with respect to their responses to mustard oil . These results again reinforce the notion that the impaired mustard oil elicited pain can be ascribed to the loss of GRPR neurons only. Together except for mustard oil our data suggest that GRPR neurons are not important for acute pain persistent inflammatory and neuropathic pain.

Both male GRPR mutant mice and C57BL 6J mice The Jackson Laboratory of age between 8 and 12 weeks age were acclimatized to the experimental room and used for experiments. All behavioral tests were done by observers blinded to the treatment or genotype of the animals. All the experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the International Association for the Study of Pain and were approved by the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University School of Medicine.

Mice were intrathecally injected with blank sap 400 ng 5 l Advanced Targeting Systems CA bombesin sap 400 ng 5 l Advanced Targeting Systems CA saline 5 l and the intrathecal injection was performed as described previously.

The itch behavioral tests were performed as previously described. Briefly prior to experiments mice were given 30 min to acclimate to a small plastic chamber 15 26 12 cm . Mice were briefly removed from the chamber and intradermally injected with drugs at a volume of 50 l. Hindlimb scratching behavior directed towards the injection site at the back of the neck was observed for 30 min at 5 min intervals. One scratch is defined as a lifting of the hind limb towards the injection site and then a replacing of the limb back to the floor regardless of how many scratching strokes take place between those two movements. For intradermal injection the following drugs was dissolved in sterile saline and administered at a volume of 50 l endothelin 1 25 ng 50 l 5 HT 10 g 50 l Sigma compound 48 80 100 g 50 l Sigma SLIGRL NH2 100 g 50 l Bachem chloroquine 200 g 50 l Sigma histamine 500 g 50 l Sigma .

A rotarod system of accelerating treadmills Ugo Basile Italy was used to assess coordinate motor activity and general motor disability as described. The mice were tested for 3 trials with 15 min intervals and the latencies of animals to fall were averaged.

Pain behaviors were assessed as described previously. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using a set of calibrated von Frey filaments Touch Test kit Stoelting . Each filament was applied 5 consecutive times and the smallest filament that evoked reflexive flinches of the paw on 3 of the 5 trials was taken as paw withdrawal threshold. Thermal sensitivity was determined by Hargreave s test and water immersion tail flick methods. For the water immersion tail flick test tails were dipped beneath the water in a temperature controlled water bath IITC Inc. . The latency to withdrawal was measured.

Mustard oil 0.75 Sigma St. Louis Mo. in 20 l vehicle mineral oil was injected into the plantar surface of one hindpaw and the duration of licking and flinching of the injected paw was recorded for the first 5 min.

Inflammatory pain was determined using a formalin test by intraplantar injection of formalin Sigma 10 l of 5 formalin in saline into the plantar surface of the right hindpaw. The total time spent in licking and flinching of the injected paw was monitored for 60 min.

In CFA induced inflammatory pain the mice received an injection of CFA 20 l Sigma into the plantar of the right hindpaw. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using a set of calibrated von Frey filaments Touch Test kit Stoelting .

Surgery was performed as described before. In deeply anaesthetized mice sodium pentobarbital 50 mg kg incision was made in the left hindlimb at mid thigh level. A partial nerve injury was produced by tying a tight ligature with 9 0 silk suture around approximately to the diameter of the sciatic nerve. And the incision was closed with surgical micro clips. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed before and after surgery.

Immunocytochemical staining and in situ hybridization were performed as previously described. The following primary antibodies were used rabbit anti GRP Immunostar rabbit anti CGRP Peninsula rabbit anti SP Immunostar rabbit anti PKC Santa Cruz rabbit anti NK1 chemicon . The nonpeptidergic primary afferents were identified with the IB4 FITC Sigma . Donkey anti rabbit IgG coupled to Cy3 Jackson Immuno Research West Grove Pa. was used as the secondary antibody.

Four sections in the cervical region were counted or measured for the signal density and averaged for each mouse. Density of NK1 positive signal in the superficial spinal cord was measured by NIH ImageJ software.

Statistical comparisons were performed with two way analysis of variance ANOVA or Student s t test. All data were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean s.e.m. and error bars represent s.e.m. In all cases P

Itch pruritus is one of the major side effects of opioid management. To examine whether morphine induced pruritus is dependent on the GRPR mediated signaling pathway morphine induced scratching behaviors were compared between GRPR mutant and wild type littermate mice. In wild type mice intrathecal injection of morphine induced robust scratching behaviors while a saline vehicle injection did not . In contrast morphine induced scratching behavior was significantly reduced in GRPR mutant mice . These results suggest that morphine induced pruritus is dependent on the GRPR signaling pathway and GRPR is an important mediator for morphine induced scratching behaviors in the spinal cord. Importantly the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal morphine tested by the tail flick assay is comparable between wild type and GRPR mutant mice .

Previous studies have shown that morphine induced scratching behavior is mainly mediated by the mu opioid receptor MOR . DAMGO a MOR specific agonist also induced scratching behavior after intrathecal injection and this effect is almost abolished in GRPR mutant mice . In addition the antinociceptive effect of DAMGO is comparable between wild type and GRPR mutant mice . The expression of MOR is not affected by mutation of GRPR gene indicating that the defect morphine induced scratching behavior is not caused by the change of MOR expression in GRPR mutant mice.

To test whether a GRPR antagonist can block morphine induced scratching behavior a GRPR antagonist 0.1 1 nmol was injected together with morphine. The GRPR antagonist can significantly block morphine induced scratching behavior . The antinociceptive effect of morphine is not affected by co injection of GRPR antagonist . So blocking of GRPR would specifically inhibit the itch induced by morphine without compromising morphine s antinociceptive effect. Moreover acute thermal pain and mechanical pain are not affected by intrathecal injection of GRPR antagonist compared to a control group .

Presynaptic calcium channels have been implicated in the release of neuropeptides from primary afferent fibers. To further test the hypothesis that morphine induce pruritus is mediated by the release of GRP from primary fibers the effect of a calcium channel blocker on morphine induce pruritus was examined. The N type calcium channel blocker Conotoxin GVIA when coinjected with morphine significantly inhibited the scratching behavior induced by morphine . Conotoxin GVIA has been reported to have an antinociceptive effect and it has been reported to potentiate the antinociceptive effect of morphine.

An approximate 80 of GRP neurons express TRPV1 a vanilloid receptor important for detecting thermal and chemical stimuli in the DRGs . To further confirm that morphine induced scratching behavior is mediated by GRP GRPR signaling pathway we depleted GRP fibers by intrathecal injection of resiniferatoxin RTX which is a potent VR1 vanilloid receptor agonist. Three days after the injection of resiniferatoxin we found that the peptidergic fiber labeled by CGRP are largely diminished H TRPV1 signal is almost lost L . The GRP fibers are also almost depleted by the RTX treatment J . Non peptidergic primary fibers labeled by IB4 FITC are normal D . PKC which labels the LIIi layer of the spinal cord remains normal B . Morphine induced scratching behavior is significantly reduced after depletion of GRP fibers compared with the control group . Motor function is not affected by the depletion of TRPV1 primary fibers . The defect of morphine induced scratching behavior is not because of loss of GRPR since GRPR remains normal after treatment of RTX F .

5 HT fibers have been implicated in numerous animal behaviors and psychiatric disorders. Previously generated Lmx1b LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 conditional knock out mice CKO Lmx1b in which Lmx1b was only deleted in Pet1 pheochromocytoma 12 ETS factor 1 expressing 5 HT neurons were used to study the role of 5 HT fibers in itch behavior.

To determine the role of 5 HT fibers in morphine induced scratching behavior Lmx1bCKO mice and wild type mice were administered morphine. The scratching behavior was reduced in Lmx1bmice but not eliminated. . Similarly administration of 5 7 DHT reduces but does not eliminate scratching behavior compared to the administration of saline vehicle. . These results are inconclusive regarding the role of 5 HT fibers in morphine induced itch behavior.

Naloxone is a mu opioid receptor antagonist. When naloxone is administered with morphine it reduces the morphine induced scratching behavior. However naloxone does not reduce the scratching behavior induced by the administration of GRP. 

Intrathecal injections into the lumbar region of unanesthetized mice were performed as described previously. Morphine 0.1 0.3 1.0 3.0 nmol or vehicle was injected at a volume of 5 l and the number of scratching responses was counted for 20 30 min at 5 min intervals. For the GRPR antagonist 1.0 nmol or Conotoxin GVIA 10 pmol experiment GRPR antagonist or Conotoxin GVIA was injected together with morphine.

A hot water bath is heated to a constant temperature of 52 C. Mice are held loosely in a towel and the lower half of each mouse s tail is dipped into the bath. A timer is stopped immediately when the mouse flicked its tail. To avoid the possibility of tissue damage a cutoff time of 10 sec is used if no response occurs by this time a value of 10 sec is assigned to the experimental subject.

The animals are placed in a Plexiglas enclosure which rests on an elevated wire mesh grid. This allows the experimenter to probe the hind paws with the series of von Frey filaments Touch Test kit Stoelting Chicago Ill. . Each filament was applied 5 consecutive times and the smallest filament that evoked reflexive withdrawal of the paw on at least 3 of the 5 trials was taken as the paw withdrawal threshold.

The accelerating rotarod test is utilized to assess overall balance and motor coordination. The test is performed on an accelerating rotarod apparatus Ugo Basile with a 3 cm diameter rod starting with an initial rotation of 4 rpm and accelerating to 40 rpm over 5 min. Mice are tested 3 times with 15 min intervals.

Mice were given resiniferatoxin Sigma 25 ng 5 ul or vehicle intrathecally under isoflurane induced anesthesia. The behavior was tested 3 5 days later.

For morphine analgesia studies the tail flick assay was performed using the 52 C. water tail immersion approach. The baseline was measured before injection and then the latency was measured every 15 min for 2 hrs after injection. All tail flick results were expressed as a percentage of maximum possible effect MPE post drug latency pre drug latency 100 cutoff time pre drug latency .

Statistical comparisons were performed with two way analysis of variance ANOVA and Student s t test. All data were expressed as the mean standard error of the mean s.e.m. and error bars represent s.e.m. P

Expression of NMBR and GRPR mRNA in wild type mouse spinal cord was assessed using in situ hybridization. As shown in NMBR and GRPR mRNA expression was overlapping. NMBR and GRPR antibody staining and confocal immunofluorescence images in P4 mouse spinal cord also confirm overlapping expression of these receptors .

Goat polyclonal NMBR Antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. NMBR S 15 sc 34377 diluted at 1 20. Rabbit polyclonal GRPR Antibody was from NIH diluted as 1 400. For double staining the NMBR antibody was used at a dilution of 1 20 and visualized using a Cy3 conjugated tyramide signal amplification TSA kit. This was followed by staining with the GRPR antibody at a dilution of 1 300 and visualized using a FITC conjugated secondary antibody.

The effect of the NMBR antagonist PD168268 against several itch inducers was assessed. As shown in PD168268 inhibited NMB induced scratching behaviors. PD168268 also inhibited GRP induced scratching behaviors and chloroquine induced scratching behaviors .

The NMBR antagonist PD168268 Tocris Bioscience Cat 2603 was dissolved in DMSO and further diluted by saline prior to i.t. injection at 1 or 2 nM mouse 10 minutes before injecting 2 nM mouse of NMB. PD168268 was injected 10 minutes before intradermal i.d. injection of 200 g mouse of Chloroquine in 50 L Sigma .

Two siRNAs from Dharmacon were used siGENOME NMBR siRNA 1 was cat D 047820 01 and NMBR siRNA 3 cat D 047820 03 . The control mismatch siRNA was siGENOME Non Targeting siRNA 2 cat D 001210 02 05 . All siRNAs were dissolved in RNAse free water at the concentration of 1 g l stock solution. siRNA was mixed with polyethyleneimine 10 PEI Fermentas 10 min before injection to increase cell membrane penetration and reduce degradation. PEI was dissolved in 5 glucose and 1 g of siRNA was mixed with 0.18 l of PEI. The siRNA was used at 1 ug ul in 5 ul per mouse intrathecal injection. Reduce levels of spinal NMBR mRNA after siRNA injection was confirmed by Q RT PCR.

Intrathecal injection of NMBR siRNA 1 reduced the NMB induced and chloroquine induced scratching in WT mice . The reduction in NMB induced scratching was most significant at 4 and 7 hours after injection and absent 24 hours after injection. The reduction in chloroquine induced scratching was most significant at 3 hours after injection less apparent at 6 hours after injection and absent 24 hours after injection.

Intrathecal injection of NMBR siRNA 3 reduced the NMB induced scratching in WT mice . The reduction in NMB induced scratching was most significant at 24 after injection with the reduction persisting 48 and 72 hours after injection.

NMBR GRPR double knockout mice exhibit deficits in response to 3 different bombesin like peptides GRP 1 nM Bombesin 0.05 nM and NMB 2 nM all given by intrathecal administration . In addition NMBR GRPR double knockout mice exhibit deficits in response to histamine A and B or the histamine inducing compound 48 80 C and D ET 1 E and F chloroquine G and H and serotonin 5 HT I and J . Histamine was injected i.d. in 50 l at 20 g mouse. Compound 48 80 was injected i.d. in 50 l at 20 g mouse. ET 1 was injected i.d. in 50 l at 1 ng mouse. Chloroquine was injected i.d. in 50 l at 4 g mouse. Serotonin 5 HT was injected i.d. in 50 l at 1 1 nmol l.
