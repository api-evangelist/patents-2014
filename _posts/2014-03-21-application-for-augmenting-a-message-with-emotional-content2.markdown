title: Application for augmenting a message with emotional content
abstract: Implementations of this disclosure may assist users to communicate more effectively in online communications over a network such as emails, instant messaging, text messages, and social networking messages. In some implementations, systems and methods of this disclosure enable a message composer to augment a first message with one or more predefined or custom second messages where the second message is intended to convey an unspoken meaning about the first message. In some implementations, systems and methods of this disclosure enable a recipient of the augmented first message to rate the first message on its genuineness and to provide a predefined or custom explanation of the recipient's rating. In some implementations, systems and methods of this disclosure can change an online users' online picture (e.g., profile picture, avatar, etc.) based on ratings of the user's messages by recipients.

This disclosure relates to implementations of an application for augmenting a message with emotional content.

Society relies more and more on written communication via such communications means as emails instant messaging text messages and social networking messages than on other traditional forms of oral communications using landline and wireless phones. However these written communications means can be detrimental to communicating genuinely. For example through such social network measurements as number of friends and number of likes of a comment social media tends to encourage and reward the quantity of communication and not the quality of communication. As another example site guidelines and like dislike voting among other things can influence a person to communicate in a way that garners the most support or positive feedback from the individual s social network. As yet another example feedback using these written communication means can often be vague with one word responses or a simple like dislike indicator. Finally although emoticons have been used to attempt to express emotion in writings emoticons lack range and can be used to perpetuate communication that is not genuine.

Implementations of this disclosure may assist users to communicate more effectively in online communications over a network such as emails instant messaging text messages and social networking messages. In some implementations systems and methods of this disclosure enable a message composer to augment a first message with one or more predefined or custom second messages where the second message is intended to convey an unspoken meaning about the first message. In some implementations systems and methods of this disclosure enable a message composer to augment a first message by highlighting one or more words in the first message and assign one or more predefined or custom words conveying feeling or intent or other clarifying words to the highlighted words. In some implementations systems and methods of this disclosure enable a recipient of the augmented first message to rate the first message on its genuineness and to provide a predefined or custom explanation of the recipient s rating. In some implementations systems and methods of this disclosure can change an online users online picture e.g. profile picture avatar etc. based on ratings of the user s messages by recipients. In some implementations distortion of the user s picture is proportional to the genuineness rating of the user s messages. For example the more genuine the user s messages are rated the less distorted is the user s picture the less genuine the user s messages are rated the more distorted is the user s picture. In this way the genuineness rating of a user can be determined based on viewing the user s picture.

As shown in the messaging environment can include client devices and collectively client device a wireless cellular network network a website an instant message IM service a social media site and other services providers . Client devices and are depicted as a mobile phone and desktop computer respectively but client devices may comprise any type of computing device including mobile phone laptop netbook tablet cable box television wearable computing e.g. Google Glass etc.

The client device connects to network through a wireless cellular network such as GPRS based and CDMA based wireless networks as well as 802.16 WiMax and long range wireless data networks. The client devices and have memories e.g. offline storage capable of storing text and other messaging data.

Client devices and interact with external websites e.g. website and other service providers and via an application such as a web browser or a native application residing on the client devices and to post and send messages. For example client devices and may interact with an instant messaging service e.g. IM service such as Google Chat by visiting and logging into their Gmail account via a web browser or by installing and running a dedicated Google Talk application. Similarly client devices and may interact with a social media site such as Twitter via a browser or through a dedicated Twitter application. Other service providers may include but is not limited to e mail servers other social networking websites shopping sites review sites and any third party website on which a user maintains an account to interact with content or other users. This disclosure contemplates any type of service provider connected to network .

Client device connected through wireless network may also interact with other client devices through the circuit switched or non data portion of wireless network . For example a user at client device may transmit and receive a non VoIP call to a cellular phone or landline transmit and receive a text or multi media message through the SMS or MMS channels or receive push notifications through the SMS control channel.

In implementations of the present disclosure applications e.g. server and or client applications used to post and send messages to external websites e.g. website other service providers and and other client devices e.g. are configured such that a message composer can augment a main first message with one or more predefined or custom second messages where the second message is intended to convey an unspoken meaning about the first message.

In some implementations the main first message can include text video or an image or combination of the foregoing. In some implementations the predefined second messages may be intended to answer one or more of the following questions Is this your meaning what you say saying what you really want to without any fake action how you truly feel and being completely true and real with yourself and others In some implementations the predefined second messages intended to answer the posed question generally may be a statement confirming that the main message is genuine a statement that the message composer is having a hard time saying what the composer would like to say a statement regarding an underlying emotion of the composer or some other statement that provide additional meaning about the main message.

For example predefined second messages confirming that the main message is genuine may include I truly mean it you can take it word for word. But ask me to make sure the meaning you got is the meaning I intend This is the real me being completely true with you and myself These are my truly real feelings some of this may unintentionally hurt at first but I will not waste moments of your life and mine by being fake These are my real thoughts but I am unsure so don t expect me to feel this way forever. I must take into account what I may not know and This is my truly real current opinion and it does not realflect the views of my family friends employer or those I am accountable for. 

Predefined second messages indicating that message composer is having a hard time saying what the composer would like to say include Kind of . . . sort of . . . ask me more . . . I want to say what I really think something more but your reaction . . . I want to tell you so much more than what you see . . . I just don t know how To not lead you on my final answer is no and I told you this lie and I kept it going . . . this is me owning up to it starting the process to right it with you and just trying to get free so I can improve. 

Other predefined second messages that provide additional meaning about the main message can include statements that get to the point e.g. Let s have a serious talk . . . it s important This is a definite YES Do not take any of this seriously I am only taking this position for argument s sake and Posted only to share what I found interesting funny informative sad shocking sickening heartwarming write own .

In some implementations of the present disclosure applications e.g. server and or client applications used to post and send messages to external websites e.g. website other service providers and and other client devices e.g. are configured such that a message composer can augment a main first message by highlighting one or more words in the main first message and assign one or more predefined or custom words conveying feeling or intent or other clarifying words to the highlighted words. For example the predefined words can include happy sarcasm worried annoyed joke important great emphases love between the lines humbly deep regret unsure opinion or compliment.

In some implementations of the present disclosure applications e.g. server and or client applications used to review rate and respond to messages from external websites e.g. website other service providers and and other client devices e.g. are configured such that a recipient of a message e.g. the first message the second message an augmented message or a combination of the foregoing may rate the message on its genuineness.
