title: Predicting well markers from artificial neural-network-predicted lithostratigraphic facies
abstract: This disclosure generally describes methods and systems, including computer-implemented methods, computer-program products, and computer systems, for predicting well markers. One computer-implemented method includes separating neural-network (NN)-predicted facies output associated with a plurality of wells into two sets, a first set of NN-predicted facies output of training wells and a second set of NN-predicted facies output of target wells, calculating, for each training well of the plurality of wells, a sameness score between zones of NN-predicted facies output and human-identified lithostratigraphic units (finer zones), calculating a mean sameness score for the finer zones for all training wells, identifying finer zones with a mean sameness score greater than a threshold value as dominant facies zones, and iterating over each target well to calculate a top and depth position of each dominant facies zone determined based upon the NN-predicted facies output of the target well.

Surfaces that shape and bound a model of a reservoir such as of petroleum are constructed from data points known as well markers which are determined through a process known as well picking. Well markers can be used to characterize the reservoir in the sub surface of the earth and to help geoscientists understand characteristics of the reservoir such as structure orientation plausible hydrocarbon entrapment scenarios volume depth location of the reservoir seal and or other characteristics. Well log data associated with drilled wells such as gamma ray neutron porosity and multiple resistivity logs is manually interpreted by geoscientists and zones lithostratigraphic units are discerned along a well s trajectory. By identifying these zones for each well the geologist places data points well markers marking the depth boundary of such zones. Identifying the zones in relation to an associated reservoir is based on a well to well correlation which requires thinking knowledge and experience a time consuming process.

The well marker data can also form input data for three dimensional 3D petro physical modeling application software used to create and bound surfaces of three dimensional 3D reservoir models associated with the drilled wells. The traditional manual process of determining well markers is time consuming costly and it is not the best time investment for an expert geologist in a staff constrained organization. Inaccurately marked wells and or incorrect assumptions made due to lack of data to interpret can result in less than accurate 3D lithofacies models of reservoir formations and can cause wasteful expenditures of time and business resources and result in lost business opportunities and or revenue.

The present disclosure describes methods and systems including computer implemented methods computer program products and computer systems for predicting well markers according to an implementation. One computer implemented method includes separating neural network NN predicted facies output associated with a plurality of wells into two sets a first set of NN predicted facies output of training wells and a second set of NN predicted facies output of target wells calculating for each training well of the plurality of wells a sameness score between zones of NN predicted facies output and human identified lithostratigraphic units finer zones calculating a mean sameness score for the finer zones for all training wells identifying finer zones with a mean sameness score greater than a threshold value as dominant facies zones and iterating over each target well to calculate a top and depth position of each dominant facies zone determined based upon the NN predicted facies output of the target well.

Other implementations of this aspect include corresponding computer systems apparatuses and computer programs recorded on one or more computer readable media storage devices each configured to perform the actions of the methods. A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software firmware hardware or a combination of software firmware or hardware installed on the system that in operation causes or causes the system to perform the actions. One or more computer programs can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of including instructions that when executed by data processing apparatus cause the apparatus to perform the actions.

The foregoing and other implementations can each optionally include one or more of the following features alone or in combination 

A first aspect combinable with the general implementation further comprising for the second set grouping and stacking scattered interbedded facies into finer zones for target wells and determining depth ratios of the finer zones following the grouping.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented in particular implementations so as to realize one or more of the following advantages. First through an automated process manual human participation is reduced and or eliminated in the well picking process typically saving time and money. A geologist s time and cost is better spent analyzing verifying predicted well markers and helping to improve the accuracy of the described automated process. With less manual steps performed by geologists reservoir characterization efforts become more efficient both time and cost wise. Second the automated process can emulate in a repeatable manner a human capability to tolerate noise inconsistencies of data and to recognize underlying patterns when detecting a zone of interest. Third apart from the oil and gas industry the described techniques also have application in hydrogeology and geothermal exploration. Fourth as a reservoir is further characterized and new wells are being drilled the process can be employed in a real time manner to determine the well markers of a well being drilled. Existing wells with logs adjacent the new well being drilled can be used as training wells. Other advantages will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.

The details of one or more implementations of the subject matter of this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features aspects and advantages of the subject matter will become apparent from the description the drawings and the claims.

This disclosure generally describes methods and systems including computer implemented methods computer program products and computer systems for predicting well markers. The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the disclosed subject matter and is provided in the context of one or more particular implementations. Various modifications to the disclosed implementations will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other implementations and applications without departing from scope of the disclosure. Thus the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the described and or illustrated implementations but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.

Traditionally well log data is collected for each well of a group of wells for example wells in a hydrocarbon bearing field and manually interpreted by geoscientists to determine well markers. The well marker data is then used in the construction of a three dimensional 3D model of a reservoir associated with the group of wells.

At a high level methods and systems are described for reducing and or eliminating manual human participation in the traditional manually performed well marking process through the use of predicted lithostratigraphic facies to improve the efficiency of and reduce the cost of well marking. Artificial Intelligence through fuzzy pattern matching statistics and principals of geology are encapsulated together into a systematic method. The methods and systems utilize an artificial neural network NN predictive method to predict facies from supplied well log data. The NN predictive method works by means of classification map e.g. a self organizing map . Mapping input of a training dataset e.g. exemplary well logs to a range of outcomes which represent a human decision when presented with the data presented by the training dataset. The NN predictive method is then deployed on a majority of target wells to produce a rock facies prediction an NN outcome . Usually the traditional process stops once the NN predictive method completes the rock facies prediction and the facies prediction is used to construct the 3D reservoir model.

The present disclosure describes leveraging the NN predictive method facies prediction further using the facies prediction to also predict well markers e.g. top and base of the reservoir or the unit well markers . As such a post NN prediction method is applied against the NN outcome in order to detect zones with predominant facies in all target wells and depth locations of the zones lithostratigraphic units of the target wells after the deployment of data cleansing outlier removal index building and mapping process using the NN predictive method. In some implementations the post NN predictive method uses three unique statistical scores e.g. a sameness score using an edit distance algorithm coverage score and or ratio of depth . Typically a sameness score is a score between 0 to 100 lowest to highest used to describe how similar two string patterns are a coverage score is a score between 0 to 100 used to measure the degree of an element distribution within a population and a depth ratio between segments of a path. For example From A to C one can stop at B. A ratio can be expressed by distance between A to B over the distance between A to C AND distance between B to C over the distance between A to C. An example could be coverage score of females in a country is a ratio of total number of females over the total number of population of the country. These three statistical scores are used to determine the best position of the predicted well markers for each dominant explained in more detail below facies zone.

At all well data is gathered e.g. by a geoscientist . In some implementations the well data is from well logs and includes gamma ray neutron porosity deep resistivity intermediate resistivity shallow resistivity porosity density logs and or other data. From method proceeds to .

At a group of wells is decided upon to be used for training data set. In some implementations selection of training wells may include between ten and thirty percent of the overall wells where the remaining wells can each be a target of prediction i.e. target wells . In some implementations an orthographic map view of the wells in the field can help in the selection of wells that are part of the training wells. From method proceeds to .

At a major interval of interest coarse zone equivalent to a formation such as geologic layers of limestone sandstone etc. is marked representing a member of a formation or reservoir for the application of NN predictive method. illustrates well log data for multiple training wells arranged side by side according to an implementation. Each training well is represented by well log data e.g. . . . . The coarse zone is marked indicated in some way. Within the coarse zone there will be further subdivisions into multiple finer zones of interest representing other types of lithostratigraphic units. Returning to from method proceeds to .

At finer lithostratigraphic units finer zones that are located within the identified coarse zone of are identified by a human. In some instances the finer zones can be characterized by the presence of a dominant lithology facies. The recognition of these finer zones requires analysis of a collection of well log data that is available along the trajectory of the training wells. illustrates an example of well log data curves for a single training well and an identified five finer zones that have been identified for the coarse zone of the training well according to an implementation. Returning to method proceeds to .

At the NN predictive method is furnished with well logs of the training wells and human determined lithostratigraphic units finer zones are integrated into the same set of well log data for the training wells. The NN predictive method is used to predict finer zone facies on target wells within the coarse zone . illustrates an example of the outcome of the NN predictive method on a target well according to an implementation. Note the presence of interbedded facies . . . . Lithostratigraphic unit zone boundaries i.e. well markers are not easily identifiable from this raw facies output without additional method and processing. For example is a very heavily interbedded depth range where a geologist has subdivided into 2 zones. Various rock type overlies each other and a boundary between the 2 zones is not clear. is dominantly one facies rock type. Other facies are found interbedded within the dominant facies. Returning to from method proceeds to .

At at a high level the NN predicted facies output NN outcome of is supplied to a post processing zone prediction algorithm to identify well markers for target wells remaining wells of above that have not been processed .

Turning to at the NN predicted facies are separated into two sets. The first set SET minor set is the output from the training wells and the second set SET major set is the output pertaining to target wells. From method proceeds to both of and . In some implementations at and or the separated NN predicted facies output data can be pre processed prior to extraction of various statistics for each lithostratigraphic unit finer zone within a course zone a member of a geologic formation . For example the NN predicted facies data can be converted into other formats normalized etc. From and method proceeds to and respectively.

Together with prior work of the geologist on SET various statistics are extracted for each lithostratigraphic unit finer zone within a course zone member of a geological formation . In some implementations statistics of interest are 1 . mean of the sameness score between the NN predicted facies output and the finer zone classified by the geologists 2 mean of the ratio of depth for finer zones that all together make up a coarse zone and mean of the coverage score for a facie within the depth range of a finer zone as determined by the geologist.

At a sameness score is calculated using a fuzzy comparator between zones of NN predictive facies output and human identified lithostratigraphic units. In some implementations the fuzzy comparator is an enhanced Levenstein distance edit distance algorithm. However there are other fuzzy logic comparators which could be deployed to produce the sameness score.

The sameness score for the finer zone lime color would be very low e.g. below 20 when it is compared laterally within the same area of thickness of the raw NN predicted facies output . Whereas the sameness score for the red colored lithostratigraphic unit identified by the geoscientist when compared with the NN predicted facie of the same depth range would score highly in terms of sameness e.g. above 80 .

The process of computing the sameness score starts with an encoding step. The encoding is performed by conversion of the lateral slice of equal depth for the raw NN predicted facies output and also the geologist determined lithostratigraphic unit finer zone e.g. and . In some implementations at half a foot lengths the facie is represented by a character digit any character digit as long consistently used for the same representation. The entire lateral slice can therefore be encoded into consecutive string of characters. Each character represents a facie e.g. red facie is represented by character a yellow facie is represented by character etc. This allows two consecutive string of characters e.g. one from NN predicted facies and the other from either a geoscientist identified finer zone OR a grouped and stacked facies described below to be fed into the above described fuzzy comparator. The fuzzy comparator computes the sameness score by comparing the consecutive strings of characters. A 100 score means that two consecutive strings of characters are identical. Returning to from method proceeds to .

At the mean score of sameness for zones for all training wells is calculated. In other words having calculated the sameness score take the statistical mean for all the wells that are part of the training wells. From method proceeds to .

At the mean of coverage score per zone for all training wells is calculated. The coverage score is computed by taking the ratio of identical facie count in NN predicted facie output over either the same lateral thickness of the finer zone after grouping and stacking the NN predicted facies output OR the geologist identified finer zone. The mean coverage score is a metric to obtain the feel of the degree of similarity between two sets of values being compared. For example if a NN predicted red facies has a coverage score that is above mean it provides an indication to the process that the movement of a window of observation see must stop. is a graph illustrating how a coverage score is computed according to an implementation. Each cell is half a foot deep in the left track NN predicted facie output over the same depth range as per lithostratigraphic unit finer zone identified by the geologist appearing on the right track. In the example of for the lithostratigraphic unit finer zone in red the zone on the right will represent 100 coverage while the NN predicted facie output over the same depth range thickness the red facie will have a coverage score of 72.72 . Having calculated the coverage score for each well take the statistical mean for all the wells that are part of the training wells. From method proceeds to .

At the mean of proportion ratio for zones of all training wells is calculated after all like with like colored coded facies are grouped and stacked. In other words having calculated the proportion of ratio of zones for each well take the statistical mean for all the wells that are part of the training wells. Turning to is a graph illustrating the calculation of a depth ratio of a finer zone according to an implementation. Each depth ratio is calculated by taking the mentioned depth over the depth of all finer zones i.e. pink blue green lime green and red respectively . For example the pink colored finer zone has a zone depth of 4 therefore the depth ratio of the pink facies zone is 0.13. Returning to from method proceeds to .

At zones with mean sameness score greater than seventy percent 70 are identified by iterating through all finer zones and identifying zones with a mean sameness score greater than 70 . The statistical mean of the sameness scores for finer zones existing in the training well will allow an automatic detection of lithostratigraphic unit finer zone containing dominant facie in the target wells. An implementation of the present invention suggests that the lithostratigraphic unit mean sameness score not lower than 70 is effective in automatically detecting if an observed zone in a target well has dominant facies within the observed zone this emulates a human s capability to glance and determine a predominant color . The identified finer zones with a mean sameness score greater than 70 are therefore considered to be those containing dominant facies. In other implementations the mean sameness score to be considered a dominant facies zone can be either higher than lower than and or equal to seventy percent. In some implementations this threshold can be implemented as a configurable parameter. From method proceeds to .

At a determination of whether dominant facies zones exist is made. If it is determined that dominant facies zones are considered to exist method proceeds to . If however dominant facies zones are determined not to exist method proceeds to of method illustrated in .

At feed dominant facies detection statistics aspects for target well zones and or well markers prediction into a memory. Statistics and results learned from training wells are stored in memory stored variables as the training wells are analyzed or learned. These variables are accessible in the embodiment program when performing the iteration at box for the target wells. These memory stored variables can be for example which are the finer zones containing dominant facies as learned from the training wells what is the mean coverage score sameness score for each zone that contains the dominant facies as has been determined by box to etc. In other words by characterizing the NN predicted facies output of the training wells through extraction of statistical information and correlating them with human injected knowledge on the zones e.g. described above the method arms itself with sufficient information which is used as a guide to explore the target wells and to predict the depth location of finer zones thus well markers. In some implementations this information can be stored in particular storage locations normalized converted etc. for future use. From method proceeds to .

At dominant facies identified from training wells and or statistical characteristics of all finer zones e.g. mean sameness score coverage score and or depth ratio of zones are received e.g. accessed from memory in preparation of processing the target wells. For example after examining ten percent of the total population of wells it is determined that zones that are colored green and red contain dominant facies. For each color i.e. a finer zone store also in the memory accessible variables the mean sameness score coverage score depth ratio. The statistical mean is pulled out from the ten percent of the well population that represents training wells. Once in the memory the statistical information of the training wells can be accessed from other parts of the implementation. From method proceeds to .

At an iteration is performed for each well in the target well population to calculate a sameness score and coverage score for each dominant facies zone learned from a training well. For target wells NN finer zones prediction of each well would have completed grouping like with like and stacking obeying ordering of finer zones as learned from training wells. At each well in the target well population is iterated over not the training wells . The target wells would have completed steps described in . performs grouping and stacking of like with like facies. This grouping will represent the first position of the window of observation see for a facies when performing the method describe in . From method proceeds to of method illustrated in .

At the depth range of the finer zone that represents a window of observation is established by moving the window of observation. Turning now to illustrates a graph with an ungrouped unsorted NN predicted facie output of a set target wells and grouped sorted facies of the same color of target wells the NN was run against the target wells also so ungrouped unsorted NN facies output for target wells is available according to an implementation obeying the order of finer zones as learned from the training wells e.g. of . For example red blue green etc. facie are grouped together. Note that each XXXX indicates a particular different underground depth see also . To locate accurate well markers i.e. starting and ending depths of a dominant facie zone within the target wells given the raw NN predicted facie output a series of movements are made to one or more windows of observation WOO covering a certain depth range of the data. For each movement some metrics are calculated described further below in and . A WOO is employed on a finer zone that has been detected to contain dominant facie. For example if the system learns that there are two zones with dominant facies then two WOOs will be used to do the iteration of movement for each zone. A typical embodiment performs sequential iteration however in a parallel processing implementation multiple WOOs could be iterated simultaneously. Note that a window of observation is just a range to compare two tracks first being the unsorted and ungrouped NN facies output with the second which has been grouped and sorted as if observing a minute object under a microscope the view under the microscope can be thought of as a WOO. Panning the view to observe more of the minute object represents the iterative movement of the WOO.

In some implementations as a starting point of the iterative moves the method relies on a depth range of the zones a result of stacking and grouping of like with like facies as the initial window of observation an estimated starting location before iterative movement of the WOOs see the positions of in . As a result of facies sorting and grouping of the NN predicted facies output an estimated depth position of the two dominant zones can be determined. These positions serve as the starting location for the iterative move and measure. At the same depth positions bounded by the WOOs and the sameness score is calculated for the NN predicted facies output against its lateral counterpart appearing on the right hand side track . The unprocessed NN predicted facie output is being observed and compared to the grouped and stacked data within the same depth range of the observation window b. Note that the observation window depth range can initially be kept constant and be followed by a resize through enlargement and shrinkage by a delta depth parameter. The window of observation is moved up or down incrementally by this delta parameter in a series of iterative movements traversing the raw NN predicted facies output in order to determine an accurate location for one or more dominant facies zones by calculating the highest sameness coverage scores and or other scores. In some implementations the iteration can stop when the calculated metrics are no longer in agreement with the mean statistical properties of the zone being observed as learned from the training wells refer to below . While the WOO is being moved up or down sameness and coverage scores are computed. Returning to from method proceeds to .

At sameness scores between NN facies predicted output and the dominant facies zone of the grouped NN facies prediction are calculated. For the depth range covered by the WOO compute the sameness score e.g. using the Levenshtein Edit distance algorithm . is a graph illustrating iterative movements of a WOO according to an implementation. A sameness score is computed between the two tracks and as described above as per depth range identified by the WOO . Each successive graph illustrates an iteration. When sliding up or down each iteration will slide the WOO by a parameterized depth e.g. X feet . The same applies for shrinking or enlarging of the WOO . A number of iterations can be a system input parameter an example of which is to have the system input parameter control to stop iterative movement of the WOO upwards or downwards to the percentage depth of the stacked and grouped facie of the zone. Each iteration moves the WOO by a delta. Other conditions that will stop the iteration can be if the iteration has reached or exceeded the shallowest top and the deepest bottom of the coarse zone. The mean coverage score is a metric to obtain the feel of the degree of similarity between two sets of values being compared. For example if a NN predicted red facies has a coverage score that is above mean it provides an indication to the process that the movement of a window of observation see must stop. embodies the termination of iteration described above and when the coverage score of the iteration has exceeded the statistical mean of coverage score of the corresponding zone with dominant facie. The condition has the zone statistical characteristics exceeded ensures that iteration of movement would stop when the mean statistical metric has been exceeded. Returning to from method proceeds .

At similar to the calculation of the sameness score in a coverage score between the NN predicted facies output and the dominant facies zone of the grouped NN facies prediction is calculated. A depth range is as per WOO. For the depth range covered by the WOO compute the coverage score. Note that the coverage score computed for a WOO cannot exceed the statistical mean learned in of . The best coverage score is the one nearest the mean coverage score and will determine the iteration end of the movement of the WOO. From method proceeds to .

At a determination is made whether the zone statistical characteristics have been exceeded a condition . If it is determined that the zone statistical characteristics have been exceeded method proceeds to . If however it is determined that the zone statistical characteristics have not been exceeded method proceeds to .

In some implementations the determination is made among all sameness scores and coverage scores calculated for each iteration moving the WOO e.g. WOO . In some implementations the tested condition for each iteration can represented by the following pseudocode 

At a final top and depth position of a dominant zone is determined as positions having the highest sameness and coverage score from the various movements of the WOO which involve shifting enlarging or shrinking the window of observation. In some implementations the optimum position of the WOO is when the iteration score exceeds the facies mean score and is the highest score. In some implementations the optimum iteration is to enlarge the WOO by X feet e.g. half X feet at top end and half X feet at bottom end of WOO . As the initial depth position for the facies prior to iteration is known as is the best iteration points to decide to enlarge the WOO by X feet the start and end for a predicted facies can be calculated. From method proceeds to of method illustrated in .

At a zone with dominant facie depth is finalized with a known top and bottom depth based on a highest sameness and coverage score. Note that in some implementations are applied for all finer zones that have been identified to have dominant facies identified above in . Referring to illustrates a predicted depth position for grouped and stacked facies of the raw NN predicted facie output here illustrated as red and green that will produce the best iteration score according to an implementation. Bottom track illustrates the final estimated location of the dominant facies zones after incremental movements and resize. The sameness and coverage score is calculated for the new position as a result of each movement. Notice that gaps and blank areas exist on the bottom track in between and above the predicted locations for dominant facies zones note it is also possible to have gap below zone of dominant facies as well . From method proceeds to .

At the depth for remaining slots above in between or below dominant facies zones determined final location is determined. Note that at this stage the finer zone with dominant facies depth position has been predicted. Referring to illustrates gaps to be filled in above and in between finer zones position in relation to dominant facies according to an implementation. The length of the depth range for available slots is determined. From method proceeds to .

At zones in available slots above below and in between dominant facie zones are filled in proportional from the zone depth ratio as calculated at of method . In some implementations a simple strategy is adopted to fill in available slots. For example if the slot is only to fit in one finer zone then the entire slot can be populated with that finer zone. In finer zone can occupy the entire depth range between the green and red and respectively finer zones facies.

In the case where available slots need to fit more than one finer zone facies such as the slots collectively above the green finer facies the proportion of the depth range for the illustrated pink and blue finer facies in slot needs to be calculated to fit into the available slot . One possible implementation is to follow a ratio of depth of the zones after stacking and grouping of like with like facies. illustrates the use of a ratio of depth method to apportion a predicted stacked and grouped NN predicted facies output according to an implementation. As illustrated left track shows the original stacked and grouped NN predicted facies output for two zones prior to determination of accurate position of zones with dominant facie. The method calculates the ratio of pink zone and blue zone is 2 1. The right track shows vacant slot that remains above a dominant zone e.g. above of which has been predicted. The available gap e.g. is apportioned into the same 2 1 ratio to accommodate the pink zone and blue zone . From method stops.

At the scattered interbedded facies of NN predicted facies are grouped and stacked into zones for all target wells. Here a dominant facie cannot be found in the finer zones observed in training wells see . This means that the best prediction that the post processing method can do is to group and stack like with like together for all NN predicted facies in all target wells. In the situation that none of finer zones contain dominant facies the finer zones prediction that this method could predict will simply rely on grouping like with like facies together. From method proceeds to .

At the grouped and stacked like with like facie are considered to represent the prediction of a finer zone. The post processing method learns from the NN predicted facies. The objective is to find dominant facies contained within finer zones being learned see . However there is no guarantee that dominant facie exist in a finer zone. In the event that there is no dominant facie detected within any of the finer zones learned in training wells to predict the well markers in the target wells the best prediction of well markers will be based on the grouped and stacked of like with like facie and to find out the depth position of each finer zone. After method stops.

At the scattered interbedded facies of NN facies prediction are grouped and stacked into lithostratigraphic units zones for target wells. As illustrated in each finer zone is represented by a different color. Note that each finer zone can also but not necessarily contain multiple rock facies found interbedded within a dominant one. When the finer zone is identified by a geoscientist the identification process can deliberately overlook minor rock facies which may have been found interbedded together with a dominant rock facie within a finer zone. A geoscientist can do so because a human has the ability to generalize and can spatially correlate information of one well with some other wells within a field of study. They can decide if the minor facies inclusion is just an aberration of nature on a well being interpreted or in fact the minor facies persists laterally across the field which means that it merits to be considered as a distinct finer zone. In short a geoscientist has their own reason to believe why certain minor rock facies inclusion s should be considered as part of a finer zone the geoscientist has decided to delineate. Regardless of their reasoning the described method should be able to predict reasonably accurately top and bottom depth markers of finer zones. Having provided the NN with well logs and human interpretation knowledge of a sub set of wells e.g. training wells the NN can be applied to other wells that are not part of the training e.g. target wells . This means that wells being applied have not had finer zones interpreted by the geoscientist. Only well logs of target wells are available as input to the NN prediction.

For example illustrates the difference between a human prediction from well logs of training wells and NN predicted facies of a target well according to an implementation. Like with like facies are grouped together from the NN prediction. In some implementations the concept of grouping is simply to sort by color e.g. red color predicted by NN will be grouped together with all the other reds and will appear near the bottom of the track obeying the ordering of the finer zones as the geoscientist has determined. The same is performed with other colors e.g. greens will appear groups toward the middle etc. . Note each color represents a finer zone as geologist has determined on training wells. illustrates before and after grouping and stacking of like with like facies according to an implementation. From method proceeds to .

At a depth ratio of zones after grouping is determined. A depth ratio of each facies zone is obtained and noted for later use in the process. In some implementations each depth ratio is calculated by taking the mentioned depth over the depth of all finer zones e.g. illustrated pink blue green lime green and red . Referring back to illustrates an example of how a depth ratio of a finer zone is calculated according to an implementation. For example the pink colored finer zone has a zone depth of 4 therefore the depth ratio of the pink facies zone is 0.13 i.e. 4 30 . The depth ratio of zones is used to fill in zone without dominant facies. The depth ratio learned from each well in the target wells is stored in a computer memory. From method proceeds to .

From method proceeds to objective . At in some implementations the determined well markers positions that bind finer zones are used among other things consistent with this disclosure to model reservoir formations and lithofacies distribution according to an implementation.

The disclosure has to this point been described primarily with respect to using the facies prediction output of an NN model in which training of the predictive model is confined within a member of formation coarse zone . This zone is a lateral slice of the earth bounded by a top surface and a bottom surface which has been human predetermined. However the described method can also be applied on the NN predicted facies where the NN model is run unsupervised. In the case of unsupervised learning the NN model predicts all facies for the entire trajectory of the target wells from surface to bottom hole this means that the coarse zone locations of the target wells do not need to be determined by human. The unsupervised learning variation of the NN predictive model also trains from multiple logs of training wells and output as many facies types as the number of objective facies parameter specified for the model. After the learning process the unsupervised NN predictive model is then applied on target wells.

In the case of the alternative application an implementation of the present disclosure could be used to detect the location of dominant facies zone given a facies log along the well trajectory from surface to bottom of hole. To achieve this involves in some implementations running the NN predictive model twice. The first run is confined within a member of a formation e.g. a coarse zone . The method of the present disclosure is applied on the NN predicted facies output in order to detect the presence of dominant facies zones within the given member of formation e.g. coarse zone . The presence of dominant zones and the lithostratigraphic zone ordering within a member of formation then are used to detect the depth location of the equivalent dominant facies zones within the target wells. The NN facies output e.g. predicted using the unsupervised method on the target wells is used as the input for the dominant zone prediction steps.

The alternative method is by and large similar to the preferred embodiment described above. The present invention dominant facie zone detection mechanism is applied on the facie prediction output from the first run of the NN predictive models supervised . The second run of NN predictive model involves unsupervised learning which is configured to output as many class facies as the desired number of lithostratigraphic units finer zones . Note that the lithostratigraphic units have been previously mentioned as human determined on training wells for the first run of the NN predictive model.

One of the learning outcomes of the first run is the detection of lithostratigraphic units with dominant facies. An iterative search process along the target well trajectory is then performed on the target well. For a window of observation covering a depth range fuzzy logic employing calculation of sameness and coverage scores is applied between the dominant facies depth range of the first run and the lateral slice pertaining to the target wells. The calculation is performed iteratively along the target well trajectory at one or more WOO either having constant depth range or an incrementally enlarged depth range. As a WOO slides upwards towards the well surface point the total of sameness and coverage scores are computed and memorized for each movement upwards. The highest scores nearest to the mean scores will be the result of the prediction of the most likely depth position of this dominant facie zone within the target wells.
