In various embodiments the mobile application and or the advertising information handling system track information about calls which information may include any suitable about particular advertisements as discussed herein. For example without limitation the mobile application and or the advertising information handling system may be configured to track information relating to advertisements and calls to facilitate the gathering processing evaluating and presenting of information for an advertiser interface as discussed further below. In some embodiments certain features discussed with reference to mobile communication device could likewise apply to the advertiser communication device which could have installed thereon an application to facilitate the features.

Some embodiments provide the options of contacting an advertiser through the PSTN and or mobile network s or through the IP network s . In some embodiments the means of linking to the advertiser whether through the PSTN and or mobile network s or through the IP network s may be contingent upon the data connection available to the communication device .

According to one embodiment the method may begin as indicated by block . As indicated by block user input to initiate a call may be processed. For example the user may select a click to call option presented with an advertisement. In some embodiments the application may issue an interrupt to halt a process of the communication device to proceed with a call via a phone application of the communication device responsive to the user selection.

As indicated by block one or more characteristics of data connection availability may be determined. For example the application may determine whether the communication device is connected to a Wi Fi network a 3G network a 4G network and or the like. The application may transmit indications of a connection to the advertising information handling system .

As indicated by block in some embodiments the signal strength of the connection to such a network may be determined if any such connection exists. Any of such characteristics may be indicated to the backend system . As indicated by block it may be determined whether any such connection exists. If no connection exists the call may be made via the PSTN and or mobile network s . As indicated by block the application may prompt the initiation of the call with a phone application of the communication device . In some embodiments the application may allow a previously interrupted process of the communication device to proceed with a call via the phone application of the communication device .

However if it is determined that a data connection is available to the mobile communication device in some embodiments may be determined whether there is sufficient signal strength for the connection as indicated by block . In some embodiments a connection to such a network may be deemed as sufficient for considering the option of initiating a communication session with an advertiser via the data connection via through the IP network s as being available. In some embodiments the signal strength must satisfy a threshold in order for a communication session over the data network to be considered available. Any suitable threshold may be employed in various embodiments. With some embodiments the determination of whether the data connection has sufficient signal strength may be determined in the application some embodiments the determination may be made by the backend system based on information transmitted from the mobile communication device .

If it is determined that a data connection with sufficient signal strength is not available to the mobile communication device the call may be made via the PSTN and or mobile network s . However consequent to determining that a sufficient data connection is available to the mobile communication device some embodiments may present a user selectable option for the user to choose whether to use an IP connection or use the public switched telephony network as indicated by block . A user selectable option may also be presented via the application for the user to always use the IP connection when available. Thereafter the IP network may be automatically selected when available as the means to medication to advertisers without prompting the user for confirmation. However some embodiments may automatically choose that means for initiating a communication session over IP network s . In either case a call may be initiated over IP network s as indicated by block .

Though service service provider service provider categories and or the like are referenced herein as bases for features of embodiments herein it is to be understood that one or more other bases could be used in addition or in alternative. For example product property business corresponding providers corresponding categories and or the like could be a basis for features in addition or in alternative to service. Thus references herein to service service provider service provider categories and or the like are not to be construed as necessarily limiting embodiments to those aspects. Furthermore in certain embodiments any one or combination of advertiser service representative business publisher product provider property provider and or the like may be the same entity.

Captured data may be used to identify calls with quality leads. Lead data which may include one or more items of information variously referenced herein as call information may include any suitable information that may be captured to indicate infer and or determine which callers are likely to bring in business i.e. likely to conduct business enter into a transaction etc. . A call can be broken down and assessed based on any one or combination of various factors such as for example duration of the call distance of the caller from the business associated with the callee demographic information of the caller a call recording a transcription of the call a keyword analysis and or the like. Based on such indicia a lead can be identified qualified.

Certain embodiments may employ communication references that can be used as call tracking numbers as discussed herein. Based in part on the call tracking number received by the system monitoring of the call may be performed. However as discussed herein certain embodiments may obviate the need for call tracking numbers. Certain embodiments may use a client application installed on the mobile computing device to facilitate data capture. In some embodiments the client application may qualify captured data in part or in whole and or send captured data to the advertising information handling system for qualification. As discussed herein certain embodiments may route calls and or provide communication connections which may facilitate data capture. In various embodiments calls may be recorded monitored selectively partially sampled and or the like via the client application and or the information handling system on the backend.

The advertising information handling system which may be or include an advertising platform may be configured to qualify leads. In some embodiments the processes for qualifying leads may be performed in whole or in part by the advertising information handling system . Though certain aspects of lead qualification are depicted as being performed by the advertising information handling system the processes for qualifying leads may be performed in whole or in part by a client application installed on the end user communication device and or the advertiser communication device in some embodiments. In some embodiments a client application installed on the mobile communication device and or may facilitate a lead data capture process . The lead data capture process may include any one or combination of various embodiments as discussed herein that track information. The advertising information handling system may receive and process data regarding an end user in implementing the lead data capture process .

Having lead data the advertising information handling system may implement a lead qualification process . Some embodiments may qualify a lead according to a graduated lead scale. Any suitable lead scale may be used in various embodiments. In some embodiments a lead scale could entail a categorization scheme with categories such as good lead neutral and non lead or any suitable categories. In some embodiments a lead scale could entail a lead scoring system . The lead scoring system could be correlated to the category scheme in some embodiments such that certain scores correspond to certain categories. Some embodiments may score a lead with a numerical expression for example a lead score. For example in some embodiments a caller calling a representative of a service provider may be evaluated for lead potential. A lead score may be an assessment of a caller s potential to be a good lead. Accordingly a lead score may indicate which callers are more likely than others to bring in business thus providing a quantitative estimate of the probability that a given caller will provide business. By way of example without limitation a lead scale could include a range of lead scores from 0 to 100 or from 0 to 1 000 with the high end of the scale indicating greater probability. Some embodiments may use methods of statistical analysis to derive a lead score. Various embodiments may determine a lead score based on any one or more suitable quantifiers.

In some embodiments the advertising information handling system may implement a lead data logging process . Lead information about a caller may be retained as a lead profile. A lead profile may include indication of the corresponding caller as having a record qualified according to a lead scale. The lead qualification process could take into account previously logged lead data about a caller. Thus the advertising information handling system may implement a lead data search process . Accordingly certain embodiments may provide for reliable identity matching and lead qualifying in view of historical data about callers.

In some embodiments the advertising information handling system may implement business rules to take action based at least in part on the lead qualification. An advertiser could be charged based on the lead qualification in some embodiments. The account management billing module s could implement a code system by which an advertiser is charged based on the lead qualification. For example an advertiser could be charged only for good leads and or not charged for bad leads. The charging process could be a performance based system where charges are accrued on a per call basis.

In some embodiments the charges could be based on lead score. Charges could be proportional to lead score in some embodiments. Charges could be applied contingent on one or more thresholds. For example a minimum threshold could be employed where a lead score not meeting the minimum threshold could result in no charge. A lead score above the minimum threshold could result in a charge. The charge could be based on one or more score bands for example one or more score bands above the minimum threshold. By way of example a lead score above a 50 minimum threshold could be correlated to quartile bands. A discounted charge could be applied to a call will be a lead score correlated to a 50 75 band. A full charge could be applied to a call will be a lead score correlated to the 75 100 band. Some embodiments could implement a proportional charge such as a lead score correlated to 75 could result in a charge of 75 or some other proportion of the full charge.

In some embodiments the advertising information handling system may handle calls based on lead qualification . Lead qualification may allow the delivery a good leads to those advertisers willing to pay for them. Thus certain embodiments may route calls according to both lead qualification of the calls and correlation to advertisers able to provide service to callers.

Some embodiments may employ a decision tree checklist workflow and or the like to capture various aspects of lead data and assess those aspects to infer lead qualification. Such a decision tree checklist and or workflow may incorporate any one or combination of the depicted aspects and or similar aspects in any desired order according to various embodiments. Lead data can be consolidated and processed to yield a lead score . Any one or combination of types of lead data may be captured and qualified. By way of example if a caller from a radius of five miles of a plumber calls the plumber and talks to the plumber for 120 seconds and in those 120 seconds keywords weighted as strong indicia of a good lead for a plumber are detected multiple times the call may be scored with a high lead score that indicates that a high likelihood that it is good lead. And the plumber may be charged accordingly.

As indicated by block in some embodiments location information may be captured to provide an indication of the end user s location. As discussed herein various embodiments may employ any one or combination of methods of capturing location information including but not limited to gathering location information via any one or combination of the communication device such as the device GPS capabilities access points third parties determining the area code associated with the device differentiating between whether a caller uses a landline or wireless network receiving explicit location information with one or more search requests inferring location information from one or more search requests identifying a caller user profile that includes location information and is associated with an end user and or the like. Gathering of location information may be facilitated by the application of the end user device sending tracking information to the advertising information handling system . In some embodiments gathering of location information may be performed before an end user places a call for example via the mobile application. In addition or in the alternative gathering of location information may be performed concurrent with a call and or after a call. Various location quantifiers could be assigned to a user based on the service provider of interest. For example with some service providers proximate location of a callee is important say for a plumber for example. With other service providers proximate location of a callee may not be so important. As an example a number of points could be assigned to the caller based on an identification of the importance of proximity to the service provider category of interest and the location information gathered for the caller.

In some embodiments as indicated by block an end user s interaction on the mobile communication device may be captured as lead data of interest. For example as indicated by blocks and in some embodiments end user interaction with the mobile application and or website provided by the system may be captured. As indicated by block the user interaction may involve one or more searches. A user for example may spend significant time searching for a service provider prior to making a call. Say the user spends 10 minutes searching for a plumber in a certain geographic area say Glendale Calif. before making a call to a particular plumber.

As indicated by block the amount of time may be taken into account as an indicator of relatively greater interest. The time spent searching a particular category of service providers could be correlated to an increased indicator of interest in any suitable manner. Merely by way of example a number of points could be assigned to a user based on the time spent searching. Various interest quantifiers could be assigned to a user based on search time in a proportionate manner. For example a number of points could be assigned for every minute of search time. Various interest quantifiers could be assigned to a user based on the user meeting any one or combination of various thresholds of search time. As an example a number of points could be assigned after the user accrues 5 minutes of search time.

As indicated by block in some embodiments a search pattern may be taken into account as lead data of interest. The search focus or non focus may be considered. Certain embodiments could differentiate between searches to detect a pattern of searches corresponding to a given category of searches. For example a user might spend 5 minutes of searching viewing results linking to provider websites reading reviews etc. all related to a particular category of service providers say plumbers in a particular geographic area. Such search time could be distinguished from non focused searching such as searching related to various categories which might not be related. In such cases no additional points or lower number points may be assigned.

As indicated by block in some embodiments a depth of investigation may be taken into account as lead data of interest. Stated otherwise the depth of searching may be taken as an increased level of interest. For example a user that seems to scrutinize service provider reviews may be assigned a greater number of points than a user who does not. Scrutiny of reviews could be assessed by not only accessing review information but also time spent viewing review information and or the user selecting one or more options indicating that one or more service provider reviews were helpful where such user selectable options are available e.g. yes no options selected in answer to the presented question of Was this review helpful .

As indicated by block in some embodiments end user interaction with advertisements may be taken into account as lead data of interest. A user s interaction with one or more other advertisers could be captured as the mobile application may be configured to gather tracking information about a user s interaction with advertisements are presented to a user via the mobile application and or other applications of the mobile communication device as indicated by block . In some embodiments the mobile application receives pulls extracts and or listens to information from one or more other applications of the mobile communication device to gather tracking information. Advertisements may be presented via the one or more other applications and or calls are placed or at least initiated via the one or more other applications .

Some embodiments may capture previous indications of pertinent interests by callers which may be related to interacting with advertisements shopping and or browsing. For example certain purchases made by a caller with the mobile communication device may be relevant to certain service provider categories. As one possible example a user may purchase a new showerhead or lavatory online which purchases could be correlated to a service provider category of say plumbing home remodeling repair handymen and or the like. As another possible example a user could be browsing offerings of such products and such browsing could likewise be associated with an indication of interest. Any one or combination of the foregoing bases could be used to increase a lead score .

As indicated by block in some embodiments the user interaction may involve one or more calls. Any one or combination of the aspects of the call s could be bases on which to adjust a lead score . In some embodiments the client application may be configured to monitor calls placed with the mobile communication device and or other calls aspects associated with the mobile communication device and or . A user s interaction with other advertisers and or service providers may be captured to derive pertinent call data. In some embodiments tracking information may include call information gathered from a phone application of the mobile communication device . Tracking information may be gathered from an advertisement and or the phone number called to indicate subject matter and or service provider corresponding to the advertisement.

As indicated by block in some embodiments call duration may be taken into account as lead data of interest. The varying duration of calls could also be correlated to varying levels of interest with longer calls indicating greater interest. As indicated by block in some embodiments time information may be taken into account as lead data of interest. For example the time when one or more calls are made could be correlated to business hours prime time low demand time and or off hours of a given business and the lead score could be adjusted accordingly. One or more calls are made during the pertinent business hours prime time and or low demand time could result in a higher score . Conversely one or more calls are made during the pertinent off hours of a given business could result in a discounted increase in points no increase or a decrease in points.

As indicated by blocks and in some embodiments call repetition may be captured as lead data of interest that may be indicia of a lead. Certain numbers might be associated with people that use service providers with greater relative frequency. For example some people say those in the apartment business may call plumbers often. Calls repeated to from a particular service provider could be an indication of interest in the service provider and or a corresponding service provider category. For example if a single phone is calling the same plumber four times in a day that may correspond to a good lead. So the plumber may be charged for one or more of the calls.

Calls repeated to from multiple service providers could be an indication of interest particularly if the multiple service providers correspond to a common service provider category . If a caller called multiple plumbers that could be strong indicia of a good lead particularly if keywords matched between calls such as keywords indicating a service need broken pipe for example.

As indicated by block in some embodiments call intelligence data could include information captured about one or more aborted calls by the caller. Information about numbers of aborted calls could be considered indicative a less qualified lead. Accordingly a caller with a history of aborting calls as reflected by the caller s profile could be taken into account with a discounting of lead quantifier information for the caller. By way example a number of points could be deducted from the lead score.

As indicated by block some embodiments analyzing further may capture not only instances of aborted calls but also the numbers of rings till the caller aborts. Such information could be used to qualify aborted calls. A high number of rings could be associated with a non receptive callee or one that is slow to pick up. In such a case the aborted call may not count against the caller s lead score. Any threshold such as three rings for example could be used to differentiate the cases of a caller apt to abort and a callee difficult to reach with a number of rings meeting and or exceeding the threshold shifting the accountability from the caller to the callee.

In some cases a service provider may not pick up on a call from a caller that has been determined to be a well qualified lead. In such cases if a certain threshold of rings has been met say 8 rings the service provider could still be charged for call in some embodiments. The numbers of rings could also be used as data of interest for advertising metrics. Such data may also be tracked with respect to particular callees so that a service provider s record of answering calls is formed. Of interest to service providers may be the numbers of rings till the caller aborts and or till the call is answered.

As indicated by block in some embodiments if the call goes to voicemail that fact can be captured. In some embodiments voicemail may be recorded. The fact that a caller leaves a voicemail message rather than simply hanging up could be indicative of caller interest and could be correlated to the lead score with the addition of points the caller that leaves a voicemail message being considered as having greater potential to be a lead then a caller who does not leave a message. As indicated by block in some embodiments calls could be differentiated based on the content of calls as discussed herein.

As indicated by block in some embodiments a service category of interest may be inferred based on various data captured. In some embodiments the information handling system can look up the service provider associated with the phone number called. In some embodiments having identified the service provider the system may determine the corresponding search category. For example a user could make one or more calls to service providers corresponding to a particular category say plumbers in a particular area say Glendale Calif. The one or more calls could be taken into account as an indicator of relatively greater interest. Merely by way of example a number of points could be assigned to a user based on the one or more calls. In some embodiments interest quantifiers could be assigned to a user based on each call say a number of points per call. The number of points could be the same or different for each call. For example as the number of calls increases the number of points assigned could be increased. Thus the user s persistence could translate to a greater level of interest.

As indicated by block in some embodiments context of the caller may be inferred determined. Such context as information about the area of a caller demographic data about the area caller history for a particular area history for particular callers and or the like. The context information could be correlated to a service provider category to gauge relevance of the context information to the service provider category and to adjust the lead score accordingly. For example a combination of certain keywords identified in the content and demographics may be indicia of a lead. As another example certain area distinctions may be indicia of a good lead. For example a certain area of town could be known to generally have a lot of plumbing issues. Say a plumber receives a call from the area the knowledge of the area correlated to the service provider business could indicate that the call is likely to be a good lead. Information about various areas could be gathered by the advertising information handling system for example by analysis of call data crawling for information feedback from service providers from third party providers and or the like.

In some embodiments the communication device and or provides a conversation stream . The conversation stream could be provided to the system for further processing. Certain embodiments may use recordings of calls to determine if calls are leads or not. Calls can be recorded on the mobile communication device and or in some embodiments. In other embodiments calls can be recorded on the backend system particularly in embodiments where calls are proxied through the advertising information handling system .

Certain embodiments may provide for transcription of calls. Calls could be transcribed by the client application or by the backend system either of which may be configured to record calls. A transcription engine which could be included in the engine s could process recordings of calls. In some embodiments transcriptions could be based on recordings in other embodiments the conversation stream could be processed directly to generate transcriptions .

Certain embodiments may provide for keyword processing of calls. In some embodiments a call impression engine which could be included in the engine s could process transcriptions for keyword identification . However in some embodiments rather than transcribing calls verbatim a call impression engine could process keywords directly from a conversation stream or from a recording . The call impression engine could be configured to recognize communication content form that is evidence of lead potential. Certain keywords may be indicia of a lead. Lead scores of calls may be based at least in part on keywords used in the calls.

The impression engine may identify keywords as distinctive markings and could compile the keywords as a call impression for the purposes of characterizing the call from the perspective of lead potential. The call impression could be retained in any suitable form such as a file a list etc. The keywords could be correlated with keyword criteria to characterize the call from the perspective of lead potential and generate correlation results that can be taken into account with lead scoring . In some embodiments the correlation results can be taken into account in conjunction with other indicia which could correspond to any one or combination of the other indicia of lead potential discussed herein and or the like.

Certain embodiments may provide for a privacy overlay to maintain a barrier between captured content of calls and humans. Some embodiments could provide for privacy mechanisms such as for example machine review of calls only. Recordings of calls may not be returned to a human in some embodiments. In some embodiments recordings of calls may be processed such that the recordings are not human readable. For example in some embodiments recorded call content could be randomized such the recordings are not human readable.

Some embodiments could retain only select keywords . The retained keywords could correspond to distinctive indicia that provides evidence of lead potential. In some embodiments call analytics could be performed in real time such that recordings are not necessary and voice recognition would suffice to capture keywords. Thus the keywords could be retained as metrics for a call. In some embodiments the keywords could be selected such that the call could not be reconstructed based on the keywords . In some embodiments where keyword processing is based on transcription transcriptions could be scrubbed after keyword capture such that only the keywords are retained. In some embodiments the recordings may be archived for a predetermined period of time. Accordingly certain embodiments may obviate the need for any announcement that typically indicates that a call may be recorded for quality reasons or for training purposes or the like.

The keyword criteria could correspond to one or more keyword schemas that are correlated to various call scenarios. Thus in some embodiments keywords of a call impression could be matched with a keyword schema s . Various keyword schema s could be correlated to various call scenarios. For example some embodiments may provide for wrong number detection. The keywords wrong number may well indicate that a caller called the wrong number. Such evidence could be coupled with other indicia further corroborating the evidence that the call was made to the wrong number. A relatively short call duration for example could be such corroborating evidence and such a call may be considered to have a high likelihood of being a non lead.

Some keywords may mean a buying call in one context but not in another. Different keyword schemas could be tailored to different contexts. Accordingly certain embodiments may provide for contextual discrimination so that keywords are accurately correlated with a good lead in the proper context but are not correlated with a good lead in another context. Keywords could be categorized by service provider category into category specific keyword lexicons. Keywords could be gathered for any sort of profession and grouped into a specific keyword schema . For example if somebody is calling a restaurant and just talks for a few seconds considering the duration alone would not be an accurate indication of whether the call is a lead. However if the caller asks Are you open and the callee says Yes we re open such a call is a valid lead although it was such a short call because of the keyword indicia. Similarly keywords associated with asking for directions making a reservation etc. could be strong indicia of good leads for a restaurant business. Category specific tags or any other suitable means of linking could be used to associate category specific keyword schemas to specific categories. For example each business could be tagged and tied for example via code system to a business category specific schema . Business specific tags or any other suitable means of linking could be used to associate business specific keyword schemas to specific categories. For example each business could be tagged and linked for example via code system to a business specific schema .

In some embodiments a keyword schema could include word buckets sets of good words bad words and or neutral words that is keyword information indicative of a lead keywords indicative of a non lead and or keyword that are not useful as indicia. The word buckets could be tailored to each category and or business. In some embodiments each category may have three word sets associated therewith one for good words bad words and or neutral words. Other embodiments may simply have a good word set or a good word set and another word set.

Within each word bucket various words could be assigned various weights according to their significance. Such word buckets could be implemented in any suitable manner including word lists word tables matrices and or the like. And within a bucket keywords could be organized in a rank order and or any auditable hierarchical structure according to weight. Some embodiments may have keywords organized according to decision tree with contingencies so that only certain combinations of keywords may be considered. For example certain keywords could only have significance if used in conjunction with other keywords and or not in conjunction with others. Some contingencies could be implemented so that only a threshold cumulative weight and or keywords need be identified to score the call. For example the top five keywords having the greatest weight of all the keywords within a bucket may cumulatively meet or exceed a minimum threshold of cumulative weight so that further processing of keywords and or the call need not be performed if hits for the top five keywords are found for the call.

Some words however may be common to multiple service provider categories business e.g. common keywords that may indicate a caller ready to buy or ready to come into a business location wrong number detection etc. Some embodiments may enforce common keyword schema s to address such situations. Such words could likewise be assigned various weights according to their significance. The common keyword schema s could be used preliminarily or otherwise with respect to other keyword schema s such as more specific schema s .

Certain embodiments may adapt over time to modify inclusions in word buckets . Certain embodiments could apply a heuristic approach to adaptation. Adaptation could be based on which words are more frequently used words for buyers of a particular service. Similar calls could be analyzed together to find statistical characteristics of keywords used. The keywords could be ranked to assign greater weight to the more frequently used words. Such analyses could be performed on service provider basis a service category basis a location basis and or the like.

Certain embodiments may provide a service provider with feedback options regarding callers and lead potential. User selectable options via pop up the advertiser platform dashboard discussed herein and or the like could be provided to allow a service provider to rate a caller to indicate lead potential designate the call as a lead non lead wrong number etc. and or to otherwise provide feedback information about a call that the service provider received. Accordingly the system could confirm which calls actually lead to a sale are otherwise good leads are bad leads or non leads etc. The feedback could be used for training the system to heuristically adapt word sets. In view of the feedback regarding specific calls the call recordings transcriptions and or call impressions could be analyzed to identify keywords therein. For example if a call was identified as a good lead and the call contained a particular set of keywords and the service provider confirmed that call was a good lead then a subsequent having a similar set of keywords could be analogized to the earlier call to conclude that the subsequent call is likely a good lead. This could be particularly beneficial in businesses that are relatively unique or that have callers difficult to differentiate from a lead perspective.

In some embodiments a personalized profile of a service provider may be associated with one or more keyword schemas . The particular service provider could have an individually customized keyword schema . Customizations could involve screening out calls with keywords that are distinctive to a particular service provider. For example personal calls of the service provider say with the service provider s spouse could be excluded. Keywords indicative of personal calls say terms of endearment could be identified and the associated caller phone number could be retained on an exclusion list so that any calls from that particular number are automatically and preemptively screened out as non leads and not subject to lead processing.

The evidence of calls be of personal nature may include repetition of calls and or times of day that the calls are made. This could be considered as corroborating evidence as in some cases what might be considered a term of endearment in one context say Honey might be a common manner of speaking in another context such as where in some regions Honey and Hun are used by some individuals even when directed at strangers.

Over time both positive words and negative words could be accumulated identified and used to process calls more effectively. In addition there may be identified words that could simply be ignored as not being indicative of anything. Words of little or no significance to the lead qualification process could be screened out.

Certain embodiments may provide for accent recognition. Accent recognition may allow for more accurate lead qualification. Not only would the data capture be more accurate but also the recognition of a particular accent could be used in the qualification process to adjust the lead score. For example the recognition of a particular accent may allow for demographic characterization of a caller.

In some embodiments a client application installed on the mobile communication device of the service provider can be configured to manage multiple phone numbers. Some service providers may give out one phone to customers and one to personal contacts. There may be a virtual number and a regular phone number. Thus calls to multiple phone numbers could ring the communication device . The application could differentiate between calls coming in to each of multiple phone numbers to disregard personal calls but process business calls. In some embodiments where the backend system routes the call to the mobile communication device the system may notify the application on the mobile communication device that the call should be processed as a non personal call. The backend system could notify the application that a call is a personal call.

In certain aspects the advertiser interface for the advertising platform may include a dashboard . After an advertiser logs in different data points that can be of use for the advertiser may be presented to the advertiser. The dashboard may include any software process or module operable to present and receive information to from an advertiser allow an advertiser monitor advertising information select different types of advertising data identify desired metrics automatically generate dashboard views customize dashboard views and or the like.

As part of the advertisement performance metrics a call statistics feature may be configured to present access to details regarding any call in response to the advertiser s advertisements. Options for presenting access to details about call per particular advertisements calls per particular publishers calls per particular location calls using a particular number calls of interest which may be based on any suitable additional information such as intelligence a particular caller of interest a particular location of interest etc. successful calls that were successfully connected missed calls dropped calls calls receiving a busy tone call back statistics call lengths and or the like. For instance the call of interest feature could identify a number of calls from a particular call in a particular time period as an indication of interest. A caller who has made five calls to a particular advertiser or to advertisers in a particular service category in the last ten minutes may be taken as an indication of high interest. As another example the call back statistics features could indicate an advertiser s average time to call a consumer back. When a consumer clicks on an advertisement information may be known such that time may be tracked between the advertising information handling system sending an alert to the corresponding advertiser and the subsequent opening of the application on the advertiser s end. The advertisement performance metrics feature may be configured to present access to details regarding any advertisement viewings impressions advertisement clicks advertisement conversions advertisement locations advertisement product types voicemail left by callers and or the like.

A peer group feature may be configured to present access to details regarding peer group of advertisers.

For example the data could be specifically tie to particular advertisers of a sales force within a company. A peer group comparison feature may be configured to present access to details regarding comparisons of a particular advertiser s performance to performance of a peer group of advertisers. Any type of performance data may be compared. By way of example without limitation the peer group comparison feature may allow for advertisement rankings advertiser rankings and or publisher ranking with respect to the peer group. For instance average and top performers could be identified a top ten performer could be identified etc. A comparison to a peer group may indicate for example that plumbers on average are getting ten calls day and that a particular advertiser is only getting five calls per day. As another example a comparison to a peer group may indicate advertisement products and or packages that advertisers in the peer group have generally or specifically. For instance a comparison may reveal that most plumbers have a bronze package that generates an average of ten calls per week but those that have a silver package generate an average of 20 calls per week.

The rate my calls feature could be provided to allow a service provider to rate a caller to indicate one or more of lead potential designate the call as a lead non lead wrong number etc. and or to otherwise provide feedback information about a call that the service provider received. Accordingly the system could confirm which calls actually lead to a sale are otherwise good leads are bad leads or non leads etc. In some embodiments the rate my calls feature could be a pop up that is presented for certain calls. For example certain calls may be more questionable than others as to lead potential. The most questionable calls could be selected by the system for presentation to the service provider. In some embodiments the option to rate one or more calls could be listed as an action item s . In some embodiments the option to rate one or more calls could be identified alongside certain call listings presented upon selection of the my calls option .

In some embodiments the logging engines may include ANI logic to identify numbers of callers. In some embodiments the logging engines may be configured to track the length of calls. In some embodiments the logging engines may be configured to record calls.

Data of interest could include click data. For example data could be indicative of clicks to advertisements. For example data could be indicative of a number of clicks whether by logging the direct request of the clicks or a concomitant tracker that a particular advertisement received from end users via computing device in a certain time period.

Data of interest could include other types of data. For example data could include one or more of advertisement viewings impressions advertisement conversions third party data publisher data which publishers have presented which advertisements and associated details such as numbers of showing on publisher sites over a certain time period how many views per time period which could be on a per publisher site basis review data such as reviews associated with an advertisement ratings how many times a review is read feedback data that may indicate user preferences such as user preferences regarding certain advertisements more details around call click data caller name information from calling name delivery CNAM also known as caller identification or caller ID location information such as information about the area of a caller demographic data about the area history for a particular area history for particular callers and or the like.

In some embodiments the performance analytics module may be configured to present comparative data. For example current performance data may be compared to past performance data. A particular advertiser may compare that particular advertiser s performance to performance of a peer group of advertisers. A peer group of advertisers could be identified and or defined by advertising category and or geography. Any type of performance data may be compared. An advertiser may have user selectable options to select different types of statistics for comparison and order by different types of statistics.

Statistics could be based on time that is what has happened in the last hour day week etc. Statistics could be filtered based on distance. For example statistics could indicate that one or more calls and or click originated from a distance of X miles with respect to a reference point.
