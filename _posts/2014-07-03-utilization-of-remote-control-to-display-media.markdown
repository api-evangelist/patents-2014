It is appreciated that the attached dependent method claims adhere to the attached dependent system claims.

The present invention is at its core a system for distributing live TV content to end consumers. It is in some ways comparable to a traditional pay TV operation but it differs in some very significant ways. The defining characteristics of the service provided by the invention comprises that it presents content in a modern easy to access views such as on screen EPGs including rich metadata about the content provided and searches for content. Thus it is enabling to view live TV on a multitude of devices including smart phones pads computers through a web browser and TV sets. The interface to access content is very similar on all devices apparatuses.

The system and method of the present invention does not tie a subscription to a physical box such as a set top box as it distributes content over the Internet cloud admitting anyone with a subscription and a sufficient internet connection access to the service. It operates over 3G 4G networks as well as fixed internet connections of about 2 Mbit or higher. The content is delivered in a very high quality even on networks with low bandwidth the perceived quality will often be significantly better than for traditional TV distribution networks. Also the system records stores all channels making the content available for a period of time after it has been sent. Even though the focus of the present invention service is on distributing live TV content the service will also offer different types of on demand content.

A principle among others that runs all the way through the design of the consumer perspective of the present invention is the end user simplicity. In this sense it is constructed as simple as possible for an end user to consume live TV content helping the consumer finding content that is suitable for any particular moment.

There are two different methods of finding and viewing content through the system of the present invention either the consumer end user both searches and views the content on the same device or utilizes one device to search and browse for content and another device as the display for the actual content.

Now with reference to as an example of the former it is provided a backend system a consumer end user using a smart phone for instance an iPhone or android utilized to browse through an electronic program guide EPG through an application program App provided by the present invention. By simply clicking a channel symbol in the App the live content of that channel from a content provider will start playing on the device. By clicking an already aired program the recorded program will start playing. For a currently airing program it is also possible to pause and time shift back in time.

An example of the latter is a consumer utilizing an iPad to browse for content and when decided what to view an option to play the content in the living room or similar is selected enabling the living room TV set to start playing the content. To access these types of use cases the present invention includes functions for connecting multiple devices to an account and allowing these devices to talk to and control each other. This is closer described through the text referring to the attached .

An end user can communicate for instance by utilizing Akamai Technologies Inc. which is an Internet content delivery network Limelight Networks which provides simple dynamic user interfaces or Level 3 Communications which is a multinational telecommunications and Internet service provider company and other like communication providers .

In order to accomplish the latter the present invention backend system is firstly divided into two main parts the Business Administrative System BAS and the Media Handling System MHS . A third main part is the client application program App that provides consumers access to the present invention services.

As the name implies BAS handles the business and administrative side of the present invention operation comprising product and service offers to consumers consumer account information such as contact information current and past subscriptions payment methods and the like. Furthermore it provides a customer self service portal in a server integration with payment gateways customer issue tracking and usage analysis for business development. Hereby the BAS in one embodiment is built on top of Salesforce utilizing the core Salesforce features for instance customer relation management CRM and a 3rd party add on product O2BCore from ChikPea for product and subscription handling.

To build the BAS on top of Salesforce provides many benefits such as out of the box Salesforce already includes a number of useful features such as CRM being a cloud based Internet solution. Utilizing Salesforce permits to easily and quickly expand operations to new markets. Salesforce handles internationalization and localization of content which is also beneficial for quick expansion into new markets. As such Salesforce is a very open platform allowing to extend it if needed as well as to integrate it through open application programing interfaces APIs with e.g. the MHS. The O2BCore is a native Salesforce add on which means that it is fully built on top of Salesforce extending the Salesforce data model with objects and functions for product and subscription management.

The primary integration between BAS and MHS is through an Access Control Subsystem ACS which is part of MHS. The ACS contains information about subscribers and what content they are allowed to access information which originates in BAS. As soon as subscription information is updated in BAS it will also be sent to ACS. The main reason for having a copy of this information in MHS is performance as authorization checks are performed every time a consumer tries to access a content item including both metadata and actual media content.

Another point of integration provided is that the MHS feeds back usage statistics from an Audit Logging Subsystem ALS to BAS so that business development can analyze selected usage data.

The MHS handles the actual media content and metadata about the content. It also handles rating recommendations and interaction with social networks e.g. Facebook Twitter. In order to communicate with social networks an end user has in one embodiment access to Janrain Engage which is a turnkey solution that empowers users to register or sign in on your site with an account from one of 25 social networks and email providers including Facebook Google Twitter and Yahoo . Simplify registration eliminate the need for users to remember passwords and access rich profile data from a user s social network account with permission.

Moreover Janrain Engage also lets users share content or activities from your site to their social networks enabling word of mouth marketing and driving qualified referral traffic. The Janrain Engage is delivered through a set of customizable JavaScript widgets and robust APIs. And the solution supports cross channel user acquisition goals with SDKs for mobile sites and applications.

Thus in one embodiment of the present invention the MHS consists of the following subsystems injection transcoding digital rights managing DRM storage streaming EPG media metadata rating recommendation audit logging access control Social real Time monitoring.

The injection subsystem is responsible for getting content master signals into the present invention system . This Injection subsystem is largely agnostic to the contribution signal encoding format transport layer and physical delivery media. For example the encoding formats can be SDI MPEG 2 4 2 2 MPEG 2 4 2 0 MPEG 4 4 4 4 MPEG 4 4 2 2 MPEG 4 4 2 0 JPEG 2000 or SMPTE VC 1. As the transport layer can be SDI ASI IP DVB S2 PDH SDH or NGSDH DTM .

Physical media can be fiber coax TP cable xDSL radio link or DTH. It can also be hybrid solutions such as IP over PDH or Ethernet based FTTB. In one embodiment of the present invention the preferred contribution method is HD SDI encoded signals over IP on redundant fiber.

Moreover the transcoding subsystem is responsible for taking the incoming contribution signal and transcode it into formats suitable for delivery in the present invention services.

The DRM Subsystem is in one embodiment a Widevine DRM solution. The DRM Subsystem takes the transcoded signal divides it into small segments for instance around 2 seconds of content per segment and wraps the segments in a DRM protective cover. Also the DRM subsystem together with the ACS is responsible for authenticating and authorizing access when a consumer tries to view a particular content item. In one embodiment all transcoded and DRM protected media files are stored on Amazon S3 .

The streaming of content is performed using HTTP Live Streaming HLS and is thus essentially just serving files over HTTP. Thus in one embodiment the streaming subsystem essentially consists of a number of CDN Origin Servers and the actual CDNs. As for now the present invention utilizes the Amazon content delivery network CDN CloudFront but other CDNs will be added.

The EPG subsystem offers a REST API through which consumers can access EPG data using a present invention client application program App. Both consumers and applications will need to be authenticated and authorized. As such the EPG subsystem contains information about available channels the actual EPG data per channel and day and detailed information about programs. EPG sources are for instance provided by an external provider. For example EPG data is provided through EPG data in the XML format from one of the EPG source servers with the aid of an HTPP call.

Furthermore in accordance with the present invention the media metadata subsystem contains the same basic information as the EPG subsystem. In addition to this the media metadata subsystem will contain additional metadata about content from other sources. Utilized as a primary interface to the media metadata subsystem is for instance a REST API allowing general searches.

As mentioned in the latter the system of the present invention records and stores all EPG channels making the content available for a period of time after it has been sent. The period of time is determined by the provider of the present invention and may be set on the request of end users .

A rating subsystem of the present invention handles ratings of content items by consumers . The rating data may be used for recommendations as well as being displayed through the social subsystem which is a subject to consumer approval.

Moreover a recommendation subsystem produces recommendations on what content may be of interest to a particular consumer . Recommendations are based on data from several sources such as the audit logging subsystem the rating subsystem and the social subsystem.

Hereby the audit logging subsystem handles logging of any event in the MHS that may be of interest in an after the fact analysis. This includes both normal events such as a consumer starting to view a particular content item a new original content item is imported into the MHS and the like as well as extraordinary conditions such as errors of different kinds.

The present invention ALS exposes an asynchronous API that all MHS subsystems can use to post audit log events. The API is built around the concept of topics where each topic defines a certain class of events. Each topic also defines a set of parameters that must be included in an audit log event for that particular topic. The ALS API rests on top of the Amazon Simple Notification Service whereby the ALS is an SNS listener which sits on top of Amazon DynamoDB storing all the audit log events. This design permits to easily extend the types of events that can be handled by the ALS. It also admits to perform efficient post processing of the audit logs using Amazon Elastic MapReduce .

The access control subsystem is essentially a mapping from subscriber IDs to the content items they are allowed to access. The information in ACS is a copy of a subset of the subscriber information available in the BAS. ACS will be utilized to authorize access every time a consumer tries to access a content item.

In accordance with the present invention a social subsystem integrates the MHS with social networks such as Facebook Twitter and Google . This may include features such as publishing information about the content a consumer has viewed ratings and other information.

Furthermore a real time monitoring subsystem monitors and graphs important system parameters to give a quick view of the system state and health to the operations staff of the present invention.

The present invention system provides native Apps for iPhone iPad and a number of android devices both phones and pads but not restricted to those mentioned. A reason for native applications as opposed to purely web based applications is that they are providing a smoother end user experience and are able to securely apply the DRM protection.

A web client application program will be included in the present invention which for instance allows end users utilizing a computer to view content using a regular web browser together with a player plug in which supports the DRM system.

Moreover a smart phone pad such as an iPhone utilized as a TV remote control through an app stored in the phone . With aid of the App an end user chooses the media content to watch and for instance clicks on it to view it and the phones WI FI adapter interface connects to a WI FI access point AP through its WI FI adapter whereby the WI FI AP connects to the present invention backend system handling the mentioned means which operate the system . The backend processes demanded media content to view and re directs the media content to the WI FI AP by addressing the WI FI adapter and HDMI interface dongle TV embedded interface and streaming media content to the TV set. Communication signals in the system are wired through the connections wireless and or by cable by for instance utilizing the the Internet protocol IP which is schematically depicted in .

WI FI is the name of a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high speed Internet and network connections. The Wi Fi Alliance the organization that owns the Wi Fi term specifically defines Wi Fi as any wireless local area network WLAN products that are based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 802.11 standards. 

Alternatively in an embodiment of the present invention the remote control utilizes a cellular network by radio communication to access the backend system i.e. not a WI FI adapter to direct media content to an apparatus .

It is appreciated that an alternative to only communicate through WI FI would include that the apparatus is wire connected to the internet but that the remote control still accesses a WI FI access point to re direct media content to the apparatus . Thus the media content is transmitted from the Internet to the apparatus through wire cable.

In accordance with the present invention as mentioned a HDMI Dongle a small device with an HDMI interface and a WI FI interface adapter is provided. This can be connected to e.g. a TV set lacking smart TV set capabilities. Additionally the dongle can also be equipped with a universal serial bus USB interface for power which contains an application program which allows it to be controlled by other present invention applications such as the iPhone application program App. This permits end users to view content on any TV set with an HDMI interface using another device as a remote control.

New modern smart TV sets and like devices are already provided with an embedded WI FI adapter and not utilizing a dongle.

To summarize servers ones in connection providing media content through an electronic program guide accomplishing this the invention comprises a backend system and or comprising EPG and an apparatus with a screen having a high definition multimedia interface HDMI capability. Thus comprising an interface interfacing the apparatus screen high definition multimedia interface whereby the interface is equipped with a WI FI adapter.

Moreover the system provides a remote control equipped with a screen and at least one of a WI FI adapter a cellular network radio communication capability and a web browser the WI FI adapter is in connection with a WI FI access point . A software application program adapted to connect to the backend system through shows electronic program information EPG about media content on the remote control screen browsing said electronic program information and selecting a media content to be viewed by an end user of the remote control . In this sense the remote control could be in contact with any available WI FI access point i.e. not only an access point situated in the same room as the apparatus but also with access point at any place and country as the remote control not directly controls the apparatus but controls it from the backend system . Hence for instance any suitable TV set in the world could be initiated by e.g. a barcode function as is further elaborated below.

In order to clarify the present invention remote control it does not directly utilize the apparatus for remote control but the cloud backend system is remotely controlled to transmit media content menus to the apparatus .

Furthermore a backend system server software application re directs the selected streaming media content to the WI FI access point and addresses the apparatus which is in WI FI transmitting proximity to the apparatus and receives the streaming selected media content from the backend system and displays the media content on the apparatus screen through the apparatus WI FI adapter . The redirecting of the media content to the apparatus WI FI adapter is in one embodiment accomplished by utilizing the apparatus media access control address MAC address and it can also be added a unique code. This can either be accomplished through an account in the backend system held by an end user listing its devices in the account. Else as an alternative the remote control when an apparatus is utilized for the first time in accordance with the present invention a barcode is pushed to the TV set initiated by the remote control and shown on the apparatus screen. Thereafter the remote control inherent camera scanner is utilized to photograph scan the barcode from the screen whereby the barcode comprises all of the apparatus particulars needed to receive media content from the backend system of the present invention. A barcode to be utilized is a code able to contain enough of characters to hold the apparatus particulars such as a 2D or quick response code and the likes.

The MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC addresses are used for numerous network technologies and most IEEE 802 network technologies. One embodiment of the present invention comprises that the MAC address and its unique assigned code is utilized to pair the remote control with an apparatus .

In one embodiment the EPG menu or other menu presenting media content to can be pushed through the remote control to the apparatus . Thus the end user is able to choose media to watch from the apparatus screen and to select the media to watch by remote control . To push data means for instance to allow a device apparatus to be constantly awake to immediately download new content such as emails news feeds menus and the like data as soon as it is available.

The attached set of claims determines other possible embodiments of the present invention to a person skilled in the art of the present technical field.
