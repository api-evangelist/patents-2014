title: Prosthetic weight-lifting tool for amputees
abstract: A prosthetic instrument is provided for attaching to a forearm shaft of an upper limb amputee to enable receipt of a handle, such as a weight-lifting barbell. The instrument includes a rod having a proximal end for receiving the forearm shaft and a distal end; and a yoke having a pair of prongs that extend from a bridge that connects to the distal end, wherein said pair of prongs provide a gap into which to insert the handle. Each prong includes a through-hole along a common axis to accommodate a clamp pin to secure the handle.

Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 119 the benefit of priority from provisional application 61 764 663 with a filing date of Feb. 14 2013 is claimed for this non provisional application.

The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to prosthetics. In particular the invention relates to a weight lifting tool to aid an upper limb amputee i.e. a person who has lost an arm.

Military service personnel operating in combat zones and other persons involved in hazardous occupations risk being subject to tissue damage to extremities such as arms and legs to a degree as to require surgical amputation. The unfortunate experience can produce consequences of physical pain disfigurement and inconvenience regarding activities pursued prior to severe injury.

An example of such inconvenience involves weight lifting such as with a bench press. Human hands can provide subtle and effective grip of properly shaped tools such as rod handles. Arms and shoulders employ muscles and joints that enable exercise such as lifting balanced objects of appreciable mass. Such operations are severely compromised by loss of a hand and or an elbow reducing rotational flexibility as well as handling capacity.

Conventional prosthetics yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a prosthetic instrument for attaching to a forearm shaft of an upper limb amputee to enable receipt of a handle such as a weight lifting barbell. The instrument includes a rod having a proximal end for receiving the forearm shaft and a distal end and a yoke having a pair of prongs that extend from a bridge that connects to the distal end wherein said pair of prongs provide a gap into which to insert the handle. Each prong includes a through hole along a common axis to accommodate a clamp pin to secure the handle.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The inventor is a left above the elbow trans humeral amputee who was active in weightlifting prior to losing his left arm. After realizing a lack of any suitable prosthetics available to above the elbow amputees for weight lifting the inventor decided to fabricate his own. shows a multiple views of a prosthetic yoke adaptor . An elevation view of the yoke adaptor is shown at upper center. A plan view is shown at lower center. Fore and aft views are respectively shown to the left and right of the elevation view.

The yoke adaptor includes a fork and a central threaded rod . The U shaped fork includes a through hole having a centerline that extends across both prongs that extend from a bridge that connects to the rod at its distal end. The rod includes a center threaded countersunk hole at its proximal end. A circular outline illustrates a location between the prongs of the fork and the rod in which a weight lifting bar can be inserted for bench pressing or other exercises.

The views denote exemplary dimensions for the adaptor . The distance between facing surfaces of the fork is 1.50 inches to accommodate cylindrical device such as a barbell handle. The through hole has a diameter of 0.25 inch to accommodate a restraining pin.

After attaching the prosthetic an amputee operator can insert an exercise tool e.g. a barbell handle into the yoke . A clamp pin secures the handle to the yoke until removal of the lock release pin . shows a perspective view of an operator engaged in bench pressing weights using the adaptor . The operator wears the prosthetic assembly attached to the left humerus below the shoulder. The heim joint angles to position the forearm upright and enable the yoke on the adaptor to receive a barbell handle . Thus the operator can lift the barbell handle using both arms for purposes of weight training.

The heim joint is also known as a rod end bearing and can be used for precision articulation. The heim joint includes a casing a spherical swivel within the casing an opening for hardware attachment and a joint shaft extending from the casing. The joint shaft can be threaded or solid depending on application. The amputee s elbow includes the heim joint with its 20 extension shaft and the 13 clevis with a quick release pin that secures them together.

The 13 fully threaded rod acts as a wrist connected to the shaft that acts as a forearm. The custom machined fork or yoke end equipped with the quick release pin acts as the hand. The pin inserts into the through holes of the yoke . The threaded rod attaches to the base of the fork via female 13 threads. This method of attachment enables the length of the arm assembly to be quickly adjusted for length in the event of misalignment with barbells or exercise machines. This prosthetic is inexpensive and easy to produce but still enables amputees to weight lift again and enhance their physical fitness. In addition the prosthetic can be used by a below the elbow amputee as a forearm attachment for similar purposes.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
