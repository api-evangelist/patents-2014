Referring to a system for transmitting messages is illustrated according to various embodiments. A first device comprising an SCS and a second device comprising an SCS are illustrated according to various embodiments. In various embodiments SCS and SCS may be aftermarket software programs installed on first device and second device . However in various embodiments SCS and SCS may be embedded into a chip such as an 802.11 wireless chip in first device and or second device .

In various embodiments the SCS may implement a standardized communication protocol SCP on a device. SCP may attach an SCP header to a packet in order to identify a datagram as an SCP datagram. First device may communicate with second device via SCP. The SCS may recognize the SCP header and may follow the SCP. The SCP may define the ability for devices to discover one another to request the transfer of raw data to transmit confirmations on receipt of data and to perform any other steps involved with transmitting data.

In various embodiments the SCS may be implemented at the network layer in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI model or the Internet layer in the TCP IP model . Regardless of the protocol being used at the transport layer e.g. TCP UDP SCTP DCCP the SCP header may allow devices comprising an SCS to communicate via SCP.

In various embodiments at least one of first device and second device may comprise a smartphone. However in various embodiments first device and second device may comprise any type of device capable of transmitting and or receiving data.

Referring to a process for transmitting data between devices is illustrated according to various embodiments. In various embodiments a first user may wish to transmit data from first device to second device . The data may comprise any type of data such as a text message image video text document or any other type of file.

The broadcast message may be sent by a variety of hardware. For example the broadcast message may be transmitted via an 802.11 wireless chip Bluetooth chip or NFC.

In various embodiments first device and second device may not be within transmission range of each other. However an intermediary device such as a smartphone equipped with hotspot technology may be within transmission range of first device . First device may search for available devices by transmitting a message to intermediary device instructing intermediary device to look for available devices. Intermediary device may receive a broadcast message from second device and intermediary device may transmit the broadcast message to first device . Thus first device may discover second device without connecting to the internet or a cellular network even though first device may not be within transmission range of second device . In various embodiments any number of intermediary devices may be daisy chained such that first device may discover second device from miles apart by transmitting data via a series of intermediary devices.

First device may display a list of all discovered devices to the user. The user may select second device in order to transmit data to second device . The user may select a file or message to be transmitted to second device .

The SCS on first device may determine the transmission hardware to utilize for the transmission step . In various embodiments first device and second device may each have only one type of transmission hardware such as an 802.11 wireless chip and the SCS may thus select the 802.11 wireless chip to transmit the data. However in various embodiments multiple transmission paths may be available between first device and second device . For example first device and second device may each comprise an 802.11 wireless chip and a Bluetooth chip. In various embodiments the SCS may determine the fastest transmission path and may select the fastest transmission path to transmit the data. In various embodiments the transmission path may be selected by default settings. For example SCS may always select an 802.11 wireless path for transmission when available and if the 802.11 wireless path is not available SCS may select a Bluetooth path. However in various embodiments the SCS on first device may transmit a speed test message to second device via each available transmission path and the SCS may select the fastest transmission path based on the speed test results.

In various embodiments the SCS may instruct first device to send the data to second device via multiple transmission paths. A message may be divided into multiple packets. SCS may analyze the available transmissions paths and send the message over multiple transmission paths in order to expedite transmission of the entire message. For example SCS may determine that the fastest method of transmitting the message may be to transmit 90 of the packets via an 802.11 wireless path and 10 of the packets over a Bluetooth path. SCS may attach an SCP header to each packet being transmitted to second device whether via 802.11 wireless or Bluetooth . Thus SCS on second device may recognize the packets as being received by SCP and SCS may reassemble the packets in order to recreate the entire message. In various embodiments SCS may analyze all transmission paths available including but not limited to multiple 802.11 wireless chips Bluetooth chips NFC PDQ or any other transmission paths in order to select the fastest transmission method.
