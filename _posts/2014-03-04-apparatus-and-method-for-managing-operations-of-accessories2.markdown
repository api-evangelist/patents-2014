This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 499 670 filed Jul. 8 2009 by Aronzon et al. entitled Apparatus and Method for Managing Operations of Accessories. All sections of the aforementioned application are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates generally to accessory management applications and more specifically to an apparatus and method for managing operations of accessories.

It is common today for gamers to utilize more than one gaming accessory. This is especially true of gamers who play Massively Multiplayer On line MMO games in a team or individual configuration. Gamers can have at their disposal accessories such as a keyboard a general purpose gaming pad a mouse a gaming console controller a headset with a built in microphone to communicate with other players a joystick a computer display or other common gaming accessories.

A gamer can frequently use a combination of these accessories in one game e.g. headset a keyboard and mouse . Efficient management and utilization of these accessories can frequently impact a gamer s ability to compete.

Accessory management can have utility in other disciplines which may not relate to gaming applications. Efficient use of accessories in these other disciplines can be important to users.

One embodiment of the present disclosure entails a computer readable storage medium having computer instructions to present in a graphical user interface a plurality of associable actions and a plurality of accessories of distinct operational types associate one of the plurality of associable actions with an input function of a select one of the plurality of accessories record the association of the action and the input function detect a stimulation of the input function while monitoring the selected accessory in use retrieve the action associated with the input function and transmit the action to an operating system. The plurality of accessories can be for navigating in or controlling a software application operable in a computer system or a gaming console.

One embodiment of the present disclosure entails presenting in a graphical user interface a plurality of associable actions and a plurality of accessories of distinct operational types receiving a request to associate one of the plurality of associable actions with an input function of a select one of the plurality of accessories associating the action with the input function monitoring the selected accessory for a stimulation of the input function and transmitting the action to an operating system responsive to detecting the stimulation of the input function.

One embodiment of the present disclosure entails a computing device having a controller to present a plurality of associable actions and a plurality of accessories of distinct operational types associate an action with an input function of a select one of the plurality of accessories monitor the selected accessory for a stimulation of the input function and transmit the action to an operating system to launch a first software application or to convey to a second software application the action or an aspect of the action.

In the present context an accessory can represent any type of device which can be communicatively coupled to the computing device and which can control aspects of the OS and or a software application operating in the computing device. An accessory can represent for example a keyboard a gaming pad a mouse a gaming console controller a joystick a microphone or a headset with a microphone just to mention a few. The keyboard and gaming pad represent accessories of a similar category since their operational parameters are alike.

A mouse on the other hand represents an accessory having disparate operational parameters from the keyboard or gaming pad. For instance the operational parameters of a keyboard generally consist of alphanumeric keys control keys e.g. Shift Alt Ctrl and function keys while the operational parameters of a mouse consist of navigation data generated by a tracking device such as a laser sensor buttons to invoke GUI selections and settings thereof e.g. counts or dots per inch acceleration scroll speed jitter control line straightening control and so on . Such distinctions can be used to identify disparate categories of accessories. The joysticks game controllers or any other input devices represent additional categories of accessories supported by the AMS.

In step the AMS application presents a GUI such as depicted in with operationally distinct accessories such as the keyboard and mouse . The GUI presents the accessories in a scrollable section . One or more accessories can be selected by a user with a common mouse pointer. In this illustration the keyboard and mouse were selected with a mouse pointer for customization. Upon selecting the keyboard and mouse in section the AMS application presents the keyboard and mouse in split windows respectively to help the user during the customization process.

In step the AMS application can be programmed to detect a user selection of a particular software application such as a game. This step can be the result of the user entering in a Quick Search field the name of a gaming application e.g. World of Warcraft . Upon identifying a gaming application the AMS application can retrieve in step from a remote or local database gaming application actions which can be presented in a scrollable section of the GUI represented as Actions . The actions can be tactical actions communication actions menu actions and movement actions or any other types of actions which can be used to invoke and manage features of the gaming application.

The actions presented descriptively in section of the GUI can represent a sequence of accessory input functions which a user can stimulate by button depressions navigation or speech. For example depressing the left button on the mouse can represent the tactical action Reload while the simultaneous keyboard depressions Ctrl A can represent the tactical action Melee Attack . For ease of use the Actions section of the GUI is presented descriptively rather than by a description of the input function s of a particular accessory.

Any one of the Actions can be associated with one or more input functions of the accessories by way of a simple drag and drop action. For instance a user can select a Melee Attack by placing a mouse pointer over an iconic symbol associated with this action. Upon doing so the symbol can be highlighted to indicate to the user that the icon is selectable. At this point the user can select the icon by holding the left mouse button and drag the symbol to any of the input functions e.g. buttons of the keyboard or mouse to make an association with an input function of one of these accessories.

For example the user can drag the Melee Attack symbol to the right mouse button thereby causing an association between the selection of the right mouse button and the gaming action of a Melee Attack. When the right button of the mouse is selected during normal operation the AMS application can detect the selection as a trigger to generate the key sequence Ctrl A which is understood by the gaming application as request for a Melee Attack. The gaming application receives from the AMS application by way of an operating system the Ctrl A sequence as if it had been generated by a Qwerty keyboard.

With this in mind attention is directed to step where the AMS application can respond to a user selection of a profile. A profile can be a device profile or master profile invoked by selecting GUI button or each of which can identify the association of actions with input functions of one or more accessories. If a profile selection is detected in step the AMS application can retrieve macro s and or prior associations of actions with the accessories as defined by the profile. The actions and or macros defined in the profile can also be presented in step by the AMS application in the actions column of the GUI to modify or create new associations.

In step the AMS application can also respond to a user selection to create a macro. A macro in the present context can represent a subset of actions that can be presented in the Actions column . Any command which can be recorded by the AMS application can be used to define a macro. An command can represent a sequence of input functions of an accessory identification of a software application to be initiated by an operating system OS or any other recordable stimulus to initiate control or manipulate software applications. For instance a macro can represent a user entering the identity of a software application e.g. instant messaging tool to be initiated by an OS. A macro can also represent recordable speech delivered by a microphone singly or in combination with a headset for detection by another software application through speech recognition or for delivery of the recorded speech to other parties. In yet another embodiment a macro can represent recordable navigation of an accessory such as a mouse or joystick recordable selections of buttons on a keyboard a mouse or a mouse pad and so on. Macros can also be combinations of the above illustrations. Macros can be created from the GUI by selecting a Record Macro button . The macro can be given a name and category in user defined fields and .

Upon selecting the Record Macro button a macro can be generated by selection of input functions on an accessory e.g. Ctrl A speech etc. and or by manual entry in field e.g. typing the name and location of a software application to be initiated by an OS . Once the macro is created it can be tested by selecting button which can repeat the sequence specified in field . The clone button can be selected to replicate the macro sequence if desired. Fields can also present timing characteristics of the stimulation sequence in the macro with the ability to customize such timing. Once the macro has been fully defined selection of button records the macro in step . The recording step can be combined with a step for adding the macro to the associable items Actions column thereby providing the user the means to associate the macro with input functions of the accessories.

In step the AMS application can respond to drag and drop associations between actions and input functions of the keyboard and the mouse . If an association is detected the AMS application can proceed to step where it can determine if a profile has been identified in step to record the association s detected. If a profile has been identified the associations are recorded in said profile in step . If a profile was not been identified in step the AMS application can create a profile in step for recording the detected associations. In the same step the user can name the newly created profile as desired. The newly created profile can also be associated with one or more software applications in step for future reference.

The GUI presented by the AMS application can have other functions. For example the GUI can provide options for layout of the accessory selected button how the keyboard is illuminated when associations between input functions and actions are made button and configuration options for the accessory button . Configuration options can include operational settings of the mouse such as Dots Per Inch or Counts Per Inch and so on. The AMS application can adapt the GUI to present more than one functional perspective. For instance by selecting button the AMS application can adapt the GUI to present a means to create macros and associate actions to accessory input functions as depicted in . Selecting button can cause the AMS application to adapt the GUI to present statistics in relation to the usage of accessories as depicted in . Selecting button can cause the AMS application to adapt the GUI to present promotional offers and software updates.

It should be noted that the steps of method in whole or in part can be repeated until a desirable pattern of associations of actions to input functions of the selected accessories has been accomplished. It would be apparent to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that there can be numerous other approaches to accomplish similar results. These undisclosed approaches are contemplated by the present disclosure.

In step the AMS application can receive instructions describing all or a portion of the input functions of the unknown accessory. These instructions can come from a user who defines each input function individually or responds to inquiries provided by the AMS application. The AMS application can for example make an assumption as to the keyboard layout and highlight each key with a proposed function which the user can verify or modify. Once the AMS application has been provided instructions in step the AMS application can create an accessory identity in step which can be defined by the user. In steps and the AMS application can associate and record the accessory instructions with the identity for future recognition of the accessory. In step the AMS application can present a depiction of the new accessory with its identity along with the other selectable accessories in section .

Method can provide a means for universal detection and identification of any accessory which can be used to control or manage software applications operating in a computing device.

Once one or more stimulations have been detected in step the AMS application can proceed to step to determine if action s have been associated with the detected stimulation s . If for example the stimulations detected correspond to keyboard and mouse button depressions the AMS application can determine if actions have been associated and recorded for such stimulations. If these stimulations trigger one or more actions the AMS application can proceed to step where it retrieves the stimulation definition of these actions for each accessory reporting a stimulation. In step the AMS application can substitute the detected stimulations with the stimulations defined by the action.

To illustrate this substitution suppose for example that the detected stimulation was Ctrl A simultaneously depressed on a keyboard. Suppose further that an action associated with this stimulus consists of a macro that combines mouse clicks with a navigation of the mouse e.g. moving the mouse quickly in a forward motion for a given distance and a request to invoke an instant messaging IM session with a particular individual using Skype or some other common IM tool. In step the AMS application would substitute Ctrl A for stimulations consisting of the mouse clicks navigation and a request for an IM application. The substitute stimulations would then be reported in step to an operating system OS .

In step the OS can determine whether to pass the substitute stimulations to an active software application in operation e.g. a gaming application and or to invoke another software application. The active software application can be operating from the same computer system from which the OS and the AMS application operate or can be operating at a remote system such as an on line server or family of servers e.g. World of Warcraft awaiting stimulation data from the computer system. In this illustration the macro comprises both stimulation feedback for the active software application and a request to initiate an IM session. Accordingly the OS conveys in step the mouse stimulation signals to the active software application e.g. gaming application and in a near simultaneous fashion invokes the IM session in step with a specific individual or organization .

Referring back to step the illustrations above cover a scenario in which the AMS application has detected an association of actions to accessory stimuli. If however the AMS application does not detect such an association then the detected stimulus or stimuli supplied by one or more accessories is transmitted to the OS in step . For example it may be that a stimulation based on the depressions of Ctrl A has no particular association to an action. In this case the AMS application passes this stimulation to the OS with no substitutes. In step the OS can determine if this stimulation invokes a new software application in step or is conveyed to the previously initiated software application.

Contemporaneous to the embodiments described above the AMS application can also record in step statistics relating to the detected accessory stimulations. A portion of the AMS application can operate as a background process which performs statistical analysis on the stimulations detected. By selecting button in the AMS application can provide an updated GUI which illustrates the usage of input functions of one or more accessories for which stimulations were detected in step . For ease of illustration only a keyboard accessory is shown. In this illustration certain keys references on the keyboard are color coded to illustrate the frequency of usage of these keys.

A color scale defines the frequency of usage of the input functions of the keyboard. The first end of the scale navy blue represents a single detected depression while an opposite end of the scale bright red represents detected depressions. Based on this scale the AMS application maps by color in step stimulations of the keyboard. For example the key grouping depict a color coding with the highest detectable usage while the F key reference indicates the fewest depressions. Keys having zero depressions are not color coded to readily identify the color mapping of keys which were used at least once.

The AMS application provides additional functions in a playback panel of the GUI which can help a user understand how the color coded keys were used during an active software application such as a video game. In this section of the GUI the AMS application can present the user with a playback control function which the user can select to replay pause forward or rewind the usage of these keys. When usage playback is selected the user can for instance see the color coded keys highlighted in real time with a temporary white border to visualize how the keys were selected. A time clock provides the user the elapsed time of the playback sequence. Button allows the user to retrieve statistics from other sessions while button provides the user a means to save statistics from a given session.

The GUI of could have been shown as a split screen with all accessories which generated one or more detected stimulations e.g. keyboard mouse and microphone each providing statistical symbolic results as described above for the keyboard. Although not shown split screen embodiments are contemplated by the present disclosure for the GUI of .

In addition to a symbolic representation as shown in the AMS application can provide the user a means to visualize raw statistics in a table format such as shown in by selecting button . The table format shows raw data in section and possible suggestions in section for improving user performance which can be generated by the AMS application in step . Section can be presented in a table format with a column identifying the key being analyzed its usage and number of key presses. The user can ascertain from this table the most and least frequently used keys as well as other identifiable patterns.

The AMS application can utilize an understanding of the layout of the accessory in this case the keyboard to determine from the statistics ways that the user can improve response time or ergonomic use. For example the AMS application can determine from a layout analysis that the key combination can be reassigned to a macro based on the trigger which could provide the user a faster response time and free up the user s right hand for other tasks. The AMS application can also provide alternative suggestions. For example the AMS application can also suggest creating single button macros for each of the key combinations and which can be assigned to keys on the keyboard or left and right buttons of a mouse. The latter suggestion of assigning macros to the mouse can help the user free up his her left hand.

The AMS application can utilize present and next generation algorithms to determine how to improve response times and ergonomic usage of accessory devices. The AMS application can for example have at its disposal an understanding of the layout of each accessory the type of software being controlled by the accessory e.g. World of Warcraft type of operations commonly used to control the software e.g. known actions as shown in the actions column of an understanding of the associations made by other users e.g. gamers to improve their performance when controlling the software and so on. The AMS application can also be adapted to communicate with the active software application by way of an Application Programming Interface API to receive additional usage statistics from the software which it can in turn use to improve the user s performance. The AMS application can also utilize common statistical and behavior modeling techniques to predict the behavior of the user and responses from the software application to identify possible ways to improve the user s performance.

From these illustrations it would be apparent to an artisan of ordinary skill in the art that innumerable algorithms can be developed to analyze accessory usage and thereby suggest improvements. These undisclosed embodiments are contemplated by the present disclosure.

From the foregoing descriptions it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned embodiments can be modified reduced or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. For example method can be adapted to define more than one programmable layer for an accessory. Such a feature can extend the functionality of an accessory into multi layer paradigms of input functions. The GUI of can be adapted so that a user can specify more than one programmable layer for a specific accessory.

The user can also specify which layer to present in while associating actions. If for instance layer is shown the GUI of can present the actions associated in this layer by presenting descriptors superimposed on the input functions e.g. buttons or keys . When the user switches to layer e.g. by selecting from a drop down menu the layer of interest the accessory can be shown in the GUI with a different set of associated actions. The user can define a macro or identify a key sequence to switch between layers when the accessory is in use.

The trigger for switching between layers can be a toggle function e.g. selecting the tab key on a Qwerty keyboard to switch between layers in a round robin fashion layer layer layer to layer and so on . Alternatively the user can define a hold and release trigger to switch between layers. In this embodiment the user moves to another layer while pressing a button e.g. a Shift key and returns to the preceding layer upon its release. In yet another embodiment the trigger to switch layers can be defined differently per layer. The user can for example select the letter A in layer to proceed to layer and select the letter B in layer to return to layer or proceed to yet another layer . There can be numerous combinations of layers and triggers which can be defined to substantially expand the capability of single accessory. Additionally triggers can be of any kind tactile speech etc.

In another embodiment method can be adapted so that a user can define super macros and or super profiles. A super macro can represent nested macros combinations of macros . Method can be adapted so that the user can customize the timing for executing nested macros. Similarly a super profile can represent nested profiles combinations of profiles . A super profile can for example comprise sub profiles each sub profile defining associations of actions to input functions of a particular accessory.

In yet another embodiment method can be adapted to establish audio profiles for headset accessories. When a user select a headset accessory such as GUI can be adapted to provide the user options to establish an sound output equalizer setting to optimize performance for a particular gaming application. For instance GUI can present an equalizer so that the user can raise the volume of high frequencies to an enemy s footsteps from a longer distance in a gaming application.
