Communication networks may include a message center e.g. short message service center SMSC that supports messaging services e.g. a short message service SMS also referred to as text messaging . However traditional message centers do not have the ability to determine whether a message was initiated by a human e.g. using a first application such as a text messaging application or a user interface of a first device or a machine e.g. using a second application of the first device or a second device in communication with the first device . For example typical messaging services do not have the ability to distinguish between a first message that originates from the first application e.g. a text messaging application of the first device and a second message that originates from the second application e.g. a background application of the first device or an application in communication with a bulk messaging system or a telematics or tethered device . As a result there is a need to distinguish between messages that are initiated by a human and a machine. This may allow for enhanced control over the routing priority billing and screening of messaging services for example to reduce unauthorized activities associated with particular devices or generate revenue from particular applications.

A message center may be configured to transfer messages between an origination address and a destination address. The messages may include various forms of electronic communication such as electronic messaging e mail text messaging including Short Message Service SMS Multimedia Messaging Service MMS and Rich Communication Services RCS Chat voice messaging etc. The origination address may include a long code e.g. a telephone number or a short code e.g. abbreviated numeric or alphanumeric code associated with the telephone number of a first device connected to an access network. The destination address may include a long or short code associated with a destination for messages. The origination address may be used to identify a first device connected to the access network but may not indicate a message source that generated the message.

The message center may be configured to distinguish between messages initiated by a human e.g. using a first application such as a text messaging application or a user interface of a first device or a machine e.g. using a second application such as a background application of the first device or a second device in communication with the first device . The messages may include a first message generated from the first application of a first device or a second message generated from a second application of the first device or a second device in communication with the first device. For example the message source of the first message may include a first application of the first device configured to generate first messages with a user interface of the first device. Alternatively the message source of a second message may include a second application such as a background application as part of the first device or an application that is configured to distribute second messages from one or more second devices using the connection of the first device to the access network. In either case the origination address is associated with the first device not necessarily the message source. Thus the message source may be beneficial for enhanced message routing.

The messages may include a transfer layer a signaling layer and a transaction layer. The transfer layer may include a protocol e.g. a message transfer part MTP configured to provide basic routing information such as an origination address and a destination address as well as error detection between providers of communication services. The signaling layer may include a protocol e.g. a signaling connection control part SCCP configured to provide routing flow control segmentation connection orientation and error correction facilities to a signaling network. The transaction layer may include a protocol e.g. a transaction capabilities application part TCAP configured to facilitate the transfer of a payload e.g. message content and a teleservice ID which may indicate a message type e.g. a default teleservice ID . The transaction layer may also be populated e.g. using a processor of the first or second device with a teleservice ID e.g. a first or second teleservice ID associated with a message source. In addition the messages may include protocols such as session initiation protocol SIP rich communication services RCS chat and network attached storage NAS . Thus the teleservice ID may be utilized to identify the message source and route the message according the message source.

As illustrated in an exemplary system may include a first device a second device a connection an access network a signaling network a message center a database a gateway an aggregator and a destination device . The devices and message center gateway and aggregator may include a processor and a memory .

The program may be configured to generate send and receive messages from any computing system or device e.g. the first device . The program may include one or more first applications e.g. installed by a manufacturer or installed along with an operating system such as a text messaging application and one or more second applications e.g. installed by a user or subsequent to an operating system such a background application web application or a hybrid application . The first application may be adapted for a particular type of computing device e.g. the first device and may include a native application installed as part of the computing device e.g. the memory of the first device . The second application may be generalized for multiple types of computing devices e.g. including the first device and may include a background application e.g. an application configured to use the processor and memory but not necessarily the user interface a web application e.g. not installed locally as part of first device and available through an internet browser or hybrid application e.g. installed locally as part of the first device and including an embedded internet browser . The first application may be configured to receive a message e.g. message content from a user generated by the user interface write to or populate the message e.g. a first teleservice ID to a transaction layer of the message as discussed in further detail below using processor and send the message to the access network . The second application may be configured to receive a message generated by the second device write to the message e.g. a second teleservice ID to a transaction layer as discussed in further detail below using the processor and send the message to the access network . Thus the program may be configured to specify a first teleservice ID for the first application and a second teleservice ID for the second application thereby allowing subsequent routing by the message center e.g. based on teleservice ID as discussed in more detail below.

The user interface may include a display support user interfaces and or any device configured to communicate data between a user and the first device . A display may include any input output device for the receipt and presentation of information in visual or tactile form such as user interfaces or web portals.

Thus the display may present user interfaces or a web portal to a user such that the user may interact with and receive information from other devices of system .

Transceiver may communicatively connect the devices of system for example using any type of wired or wireless network connection. The wireless network may utilize a wireless transmitter e.g. cellular radiofrequency RF or Wi Fi transmitter of transceiver .

The second device may be configured to communicatively connect with the first device e.g. using connection and send a message using the access network connected to the first device . The second device may connect to the first device using the second application and connection . For example the second device may include a bulk messaging system such as a SMS publication system which may include a computing system configured connect to a second application e.g. bulk messaging software of the first device e.g. using a connection . For instance the second application may utilize an application programming interface API configured to transfer a plurality of messages using a file transfer protocol FTP a short message peer to peer SMPP a hypertext transfer protocol HTTP link or an e mail. Upon receiving the plurality of messages the second application instructs the first device to distribute the plurality of messages using the access network .

The second device may also include a telematics or a tethered device. The telematics device may include any computing device or system configured to provide telematics services for example using location information of a global positioning system GPS and a communication service of a first device connected to an access network . Using the location information and the communication service the telematics service may provide automatic driving assistance vehicle tracking container tracking cold storage tracking fleet management safety information e.g. road hazard or weather notifications emergency warning information e.g. emergency vehicle notifications and vehicle status e.g. notification of an airbag deployment mileage indicators or system issues such as transmission failure . The tethered device may include any device in wireless or wired communication with the first device .

The connections may be any wired or wireless connections between two or more endpoints e.g. devices or systems for example to facilitate transfer of messages. The connections may include any antenna or data cable technology as discussed herein. The connections may communicatively connect first device second device access network signaling network message center gateway aggregator and destination device .

System may utilize a network infrastructure as discussed above with any networking technology. System may utilize any wired or wireless network or networks. Each network may include a packet network or any other network having an infrastructure to carry communications. Exemplary networks may include one or more of a cellular network telephone network e.g. public switched telephone network PSTN global area network wide area networks a VoIP network a VoLTE Voice over LTE network fiber optic network cable network television network local area networks e.g. Ethernet wireless local area networks e.g. radio frequency RF or Wi Fi power line networks or combinations thereof. The network infrastructure may further include a direct wired connection for example any data cable technology connecting two or more devices e.g. using a universal serial bus USB or serial port . Although a single system is illustrated the system may represent a single network a combination of different networks components and technologies and or a plurality of networks.

The access network may be configured to provide communications services to a plurality of devices e.g. one or more first devices . The access network may include any radio access network configured to exchange information wirelessly using radio waves over a radio range or network that enables communication. The access network may implement any radio access technology including for example cellular 3G 4G long term evolution LTE radiofrequency RF near field communication NFC Bluetooth or Wi Fi. The access network may be configured to route messages e.g. using connection between the first device and the signaling network .

The signaling network may include set of telephony signaling protocols e.g. signaling system no. 7 SS7 for a public switched telephone network PSTN . The signaling network may be configured to provide short message services SMS set up and tear of down telephone calls number translation local number portability and prepaid billing mechanisms. The signaling network may also include a session initiation protocol SIP . The signaling network may be configured to route messages between the access network and the message center .

The message center may be configured to allow devices e.g. devices and to exchange messages e.g. SMS messages . The message center may include a short message service SMS or any text messaging service component of phone Web or communication system. The message center e.g. using processor may utilize communication protocols such as a teleservice layer protocol e.g. an international standard protocol such as IS 637 and a cellular telecommunication protocol e.g. an American National Standards Institute protocol such as ANSI 41 to facilitate the exchange of text messages between fixed line or mobile devices. The message center may also utilize communications protocols for mobility management entities MME such as 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3gPP or 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 3gPP2 . The message center may be configured to receive and store e.g. as part of memory or database as well as forward and deliver text messages e.g. using processor . For example the message center may be configured for 2G SMS e.g. using ANSI 41 over SS7 3G MMS e.g. using 3gPP2 over hypertext transfer protocol HTTP 4G SMS e.g. using ANSI 41 over SIP 4G MMS e.g. 3gPP2 over HTTP 4G RCS Chat e.g. using SIP or real time transport protocol RTP and 4G NAS e.g. a signaling protocol between a message center and an MME .

The message center may configured to utilize the teleservice ID to determine a message type or a message source. The message may include a default teleservice ID indicating a message type or a first or second teleservice ID indicating a message source. The message source may include a user of first device or a second device in communication with the first device . The message source may be indicated by a first teleservice ID associated with the first application or a second teleservice ID associated with the second application . For example the first or second teleservice ID may be utilized to determine if the message was sent by first device e.g. using user interface or first application or a second device e.g. using the second application or connection respectively.

To determine the message source the message center may compare the teleservice ID to a teleservice record as part of memory or database . The teleservice record may define the routing priority billing and screening associated with the first and second applications e.g. specified according to respective first and second teleservice IDs. The message center may receive a message read the teleservice ID from the transaction layer and compare the teleservice ID to the teleservice record. Based on routing priority billing and screening specified for the first or second teleservice ID as part of the teleservice record the message center e.g. using the processor may apply routing priority billing and screening to the message as described in further detail below.

With the message source the message center may route the message to the gateway or the destination device . If the message includes a default teleservice ID the message center may apply default routing and route the message to gateway aggregator and then to destination device . If the message includes a first or second teleservice ID the message center may apply an alternate routing and route the message to the destination device bypassing the gateway and aggregator . Thus the teleservice ID may be utilized to selectively route messages to the gateway or to the destination device bypassing the gateway and the aggregator based on the teleservice ID.

The gateway may include an SMS gateway or any other computing system configured to receive messages from the message center and translate the message into a protocol e.g. referred to as a universal protocol configured for distribution to mobile devices of different networks. The gateway may utilize protocols such as short message peer to peer SMPP hypertext transfer protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and other web service protocols. To translate messages between two or more networks e.g. two or more message centers having different protocols the gateway may include one or more protocol translators e.g. using processor configured to convert a standard or proprietary protocol of a message source to the universal protocol impedance matching devices e.g. using processor configured to maximize a power transfer or minimize a signal reflection associated with a message rate converters e.g. using processor configured to convert a rate of a message in accordance with the universal protocol fault isolators e.g. using processor to determine a fault associated with a message or signal translators e.g. using processor to translate a signaling protocol of a source message to the universal protocol . The gateway receives a message e.g. as part of memory from the message center translates the message e.g. using the processor and sends the message e.g. using the processor to the aggregator .

The aggregator may include an SMS aggregator or any other computing system configured to maintain direct connections with multiple networks of different service providers. The aggregator may aggregate messages from one or more gateways and then deliver messages to multiple networks. The aggregator may send the message to the appropriate destination device based on the destination address specified as part of the message.

The system e.g. device or message center may be configured determine a message source in addition to an origination address and a destination address of a message e.g. SMS message . The origination address may include a long code e.g. telephone number or a short code e.g. abbreviated version of a telephone number associated with the first device . The destination address may include a long code or a short code associated with the destination device . The message source may indicate whether the message was generated with a user interface of the first device or a second device in communication with the first device e.g. using a second application or connection .

The system e.g. message center may be configured to directly route a message to a destination device bypassing components of system for processing efficiency based on the teleservice ID. The program may be configured to populate the message e.g. the transaction layer with a default teleservice ID associated with a message type a first teleservice ID associated with messages generated from the user interface e.g. using the first application and a second teleservice ID associated with messages generated from the second device e.g. using second application or connection that may be associated with a destination device . For messages with the default teleservice ID the system may send the messages to the gateway and the aggregator for default processing. However for messages with the first or second teleservice ID indicating a destination device the message center may route the message directly to the destination device . Thus the system may be configured to selectively route messages based in part on the teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer.

The program may be configured to authorize the sending of messages to the access network based in part on the message source. For example the second application may be configured to access contact information of user to promote installation of the second application to one or more destination devices associated with the contact information which may be unauthorized by a user of the first device . The program may be configured to prompt a user to authorize outgoing messages based on the teleservice ID. The program may be configured to block outgoing messages generated from second devices e.g. from the second application or connection . Thus the system may selectively authorize outgoing messages based on the teleservice ID of the message.

Any portion of system e.g. devices and message center gateway and aggregator may include a computing system and or device that includes a processor and a memory . Computing systems and or devices generally include computer executable instructions where the instructions may be executable by one or more devices such as those listed below. Computer executable instructions may be compiled or interpreted from computer programs created using a variety of programming languages and or technologies including without limitation and either alone or in combination Java C C Visual Basic Java Script Perl etc. The system may take many different forms and include multiple and or alternate components and facilities as illustrated in the Figures further described below. While exemplary systems devices modules and sub modules are shown in the Figures the exemplary components illustrated in the Figures are not intended to be limiting. Indeed additional or alternative components and or implementations may be used and thus the above communication operation examples should not be construed as limiting.

In general computing systems and or devices e.g. devices and message center gateway and aggregator may employ any of a number of computer operating systems including but by no means limited to versions and or varieties of the Microsoft Windows operating system the Unix operating system e.g. the Solaris operating system distributed by Oracle Corporation of Redwood Shores Calif. the AIX UNIX operating system distributed by International Business Machines of Armonk N.Y. the Linux operating system the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems distributed by Apple Inc. of Cupertino Calif. the BlackBerry OS distributed by Research In Motion of Waterloo Canada and the Android operating system developed by the Open Handset Alliance. Examples of computing systems and or devices include without limitation mobile devices e.g. first device cellular phones smart phones super phones tablet computers next generation portable devices mobile printers handheld computers secure voice communication equipment computer workstations desktops notebooks servers networking hardware or some other computing system and or device.

The database may include one or more databases data repositories or other data stores. The database may include various kinds of mechanisms for storing accessing and retrieving various kinds of data including a hierarchical database a set of files in a file system an application database in a proprietary format a relational database management system RDBMS etc. Each such data store is generally included within a computing device employing a computer operating system such as one of those mentioned above and are accessed via a network in any one or more of a variety of manners. A file system may be accessible from a computer operating system and may include files stored in various formats. An RDBMS generally employs the Structured Query Language SQL in addition to a language for creating storing editing and executing stored procedures such as the PL SQL language mentioned above.

In some examples system elements may be implemented as computer readable instructions e.g. software on one or more computing devices e.g. servers personal computers etc. stored on computer readable media associated therewith e.g. disks memories etc. . A computer program product may comprise such instructions stored on computer readable media for carrying out the functions described herein.

As illustrated in the message e.g. generated by first device or second device may include a transfer layer a signaling layer and a transaction layer . The transfer layer may include a protocol e.g. a message transfer part MTP that is configured to provide basic routing information e.g. from the first device to the destination device and error detection to provide reliable unduplicated and in sequence transport of messages between providers of communication services e.g. using one or more signaling networks . The basic routing information as part of the transfer layer may include the origination address e.g. generated by the processor of the first device and a destination address e.g. of the destination device and generated by the processor of the first device . Thus the origination address and the destination address may be read e.g. by the processor of the first device or the message center from the transfer layer .

The signaling layer may include a protocol e.g. a signaling connection control part SCCP that is configured to extend routing flow control segmentation connection orientation and error correction facilities to a signaling network. The signaling layer may rely on the transfer layer for basic routing and error detection. Thus the signaling layer direct routing of messages as part of the signaling network .

The transaction layer may include a protocol e.g. a transaction capabilities application part TCAP configured to facilitate the transfer of multiple concurrent message dialogs between the first device and the destination device . The transaction layer may include a message payload e.g. message content and a teleservice ID. The teleservice ID may indicate a message type e.g. a short message service SMS a voicemail notification a wireless application protocol WAP or a Digital Page file and may correspond to a signaling protocol e.g. IS 637 and ANSI 41 of the message center. The teleservice ID may additionally be utilized identify the message source and route the message according the message source.

The system e.g. device or message center may be configured to determine the origination address destination address and the message source based in part on one or more portions of the message. The system may be configured to define and utilize at least a portion of the message e.g. the transaction layer to determine the message source. Using the message source the message center may be configured to apply additional routing priority billing and screening features to enhance messaging services.

To determine the message source the message center may be configured to distinguish between a first message generated from a first device e.g. using a first application or a user interface as part of the first device and a second message generated from a second device e.g. using a second application such as background web hybrid or telematics application as part of the first device or a connection with the first device . More specifically a message center may be configured to receive a message access the transfer layer signaling layer and transaction layer . The message center may utilize the transfer layer and signaling layer as described above. In addition the message center may read the teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer and apply additional routing priority billing and screening based on the teleservice ID. Thus the message center may utilize the transaction layer in addition to the transfer layer and signaling layer to enhance processing of messages.

To facilitate enhanced processing the program may be configured to populate the transaction layer of messages with a first or second teleservice ID based on whether the message was generated from a first application e.g. a user interface of the first device or a second application e.g. in communication with the second device . This may be in addition to or to replace a pre existing or pre populated default teleservice ID used to indicate a message type. To avoid the default teleservice ID range for indicating the message type the first or second teleservice IDs for enhanced processing may be selected from a reserved range of the messaging protocol e.g. IS 637 and ANSI 41 . Thus the teleservice ID may be utilized to distinguish user generated e.g. from user interface and machine generated e.g. from the second device messages. This may allow for increased accounting and billing associated with machine generated messages thereby reducing the abuse of the second devices that utilize messaging of devices and facilitating the accurate accounting and billing of unauthorized message distribution.

At decision point the message center e.g. as part of memory or database receives a message and determines if the message has a default teleservice ID or a first or second teleservice ID. If the message has a default teleservice ID the message center e.g. using the processor applies default routing. If the message has a first or second teleservice ID the message center e.g. using the processor applies direct routing.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies default routing to the message based on the default teleservice ID. For example the message center e.g. using the processor may send the message to the gateway and the aggregator as discussed above.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies a default priority to the message based on the default teleservice ID. For example the default priority may include the standard priority applied to the message type according to the protocol of the message center .

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies a default billing to the message based on the default teleservice ID. For example the default billing may include counting the message against a text messaging service plan or applying a standard text messaging rate.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies a default screening is applied to the message based on the default teleservice ID. For example the default screening may include checking if the transaction layer of the message has been flagged by device or as having offensive or prohibited content.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies direct routing based on the first or second teleservice ID. For example the message center may send the message to the destination device as discussed above.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies an alternate priority to the message based on the first or second teleservice ID. For example the alternate priority may include a high or low priority indicating the processing order or speed e.g. relative to the default priority that the message center applies to the message .

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies an alternate billing to the message based on the first or second teleservice ID. For example the alternate billing may include an increased or decreased relative count of the message against a text messaging service plan or a free or premium text messaging rate.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies an alternate screening to the message based on the first or second teleservice ID. For example the alternate screening may automatically block or reject second teleservice IDs associated with offensive or prohibited content or unauthorized services. After block the process ends.

At block the message center e.g. using processor reads at least the teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer of the message .

At decision point the message center e.g. using processor determines if the teleservice ID is a default teleservice ID associated with a message type e.g. not the message source or a first or second teleservice ID associated with the message source e.g. first device or the second device respectively . For example the first teleservice ID may indicate that the message was generated from the first application or the user interface of the first device . Alternatively the second teleservice ID may indicate that the message was generated from the second application or the connection with the second device . If the teleservice ID is not associated with the first device or the second device the message center applies default routing based on the destination address as part of the transfer layer for example to send the message to gateway as discussed above. If the teleservice ID is associated with the first device or the second device the message center may apply an alternate routing to the destination device based in part on the respective first or second teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer for example in addition to the destination address of the transfer layer . Thus the message center e.g. using processor determines if a default first or second teleservice ID is associated with the message and in response applies a routing priority billing and screening to the message based on the teleservice ID.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies a default routing based in part on the destination address as part of the transfer layer and the message type indicated by the default teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer as discussed above. For example the transaction layer may include a default teleservice ID associated with the message type e.g. SMS but may not be associated with the message source e.g. first device or the second device . Thus if the default teleservice ID is present the default routing is applied based on the destination address and the message type.

At bock the message center e.g. using processor may apply a default priority billing and screening to the message based in part on the destination address as part of the transfer layer and the message type as discussed above. For example the default priority billing and screening may be applied because the default teleservice ID may be associated with a message type and may not give an indication of the message source e.g. first device or second device .

At block the message center e.g. using processor routes the message to the gateway based on the default routing as discussed above.

At block the message center applies an alternate routing to the message based in part on the first or second teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer as discussed above. For example the alternative priority billing and screening may be applied because the first or second teleservice ID indicates that the message source is the first device or second device respectively.

At block the message center e.g. using processor may apply an alternate priority billing and screening based in part on the first or second teleservice ID.

At block the message center e.g. using processor routes the message to the destination device based on the alternate routing for example bypassing the gateway and the aggregator . After block the process ends.

At block the message center e.g. using processor reads at least the teleservice ID as part of the transaction layer of the message .

At block the message center e.g. using processor compares the teleservice ID to the teleservice record as part of the memory or database .

At decision point the message center e.g. using processor determines if the teleservice ID is a first teleservice ID associated with a first application or second teleservice ID associated with the second application as described above.

At block the message center e.g. using processor applies routing priority billing and screening associated with the first application.

At bock the message center e.g. using processor applies routing priority billing and screening associated with the second application. After block the process ends.

In other words the descriptions of processes herein are provided for the purpose of illustrating certain embodiments and should in no way be construed so as to limit the claims.

Accordingly it is to be understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative and not restrictive. Many embodiments and applications other than the examples provided would be apparent upon reading the above description. The scope should be determined not with reference to the above description but should instead be determined with reference to the appended claims along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. It is anticipated and intended that future developments will occur in the technologies discussed herein and that the disclosed systems and methods will be incorporated into such future embodiments. In sum it should be understood that the application is capable of modification and variation.

All terms used in the claims are intended to be given their broadest reasonable constructions and their ordinary meanings as understood by those knowledgeable in the technologies described herein unless an explicit indication to the contrary in made herein. In particular use of the singular articles such as a the said etc. should be read to recite one or more of the indicated elements unless a claim recites an explicit limitation to the contrary.

The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided to allow the reader to quickly ascertain the nature of the technical disclosure. It is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition in the foregoing Detailed Description it can be seen that various features are grouped together in various embodiments for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather as the following claims reflect inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.
