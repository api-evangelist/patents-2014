This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 932 507 filed Jan. 28 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

This patent application generally relates to incident control and site management and more specifically to providing a management system with web based user interfaces to facilitate communication with parties located onsite and other support members as well as management of onsite operations.

When a site such as a sports complex or a school is physically expansive it could be difficult to manage all operations at the site in real time. Such management could be especially challenging yet critical when a scheduled event or an unexpected incident is taking place across the site such as a baseball tournament or a gunman shooting. It would therefore be useful to be able to monitor the status of every location onsite in real time and direct the operations on a site wide basis in an efficient and comprehensive manner.

The headings provided herein are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed embodiments. Further the drawings have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be expanded or reduced to help improve the understanding of the embodiments. Similarly some components and or operations may be separated into different blocks or combined into a single block for the purposes of discussion of some of the embodiments. Moreover while the various embodiments are amenable to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention however is not to limit the particular embodiments described. On the contrary the embodiments are intended to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the scope of the disclosed embodiments as defined by the appended claims.

According to various embodiments disclosed in the present application a system for real time incident control and site management enables update to date monitoring of every location of a site and efficient direction of operations on a site wide basis. The system may be used for day to day management of a site or for the handling of scheduled events and unexpected incidents onsite.

As an incident occurs at a site the system communicates with parties onsite via text messaging or similar means analyzes the communication to determine a status for each unit of the site and presents a graphical overview of the site with the status information which allows a commander using the system to control the actions of the parties onsite in an efficient and effective manner. Based on ongoing communication the system refreshes the graphical overview of the site with updated status information. As an example as a shooting occurs at a school the system communicates with the teachers students staff members and other people who are on the school ground via text messaging or similar means. It analyzes the text messages and other information received from the people onsite to assess the status of each room and space of the school such as whether the shooter is present and how many are injured. The system then presents a graphical overview of the school indicating the status of each room and space which enables the proper allocation of support resources such as law enforcement agents and medical professionals. Instead of an unexpected incident the system may be operational over a scheduled event such as a game at a sports complex and a floor waxing job at a shopping mall.

The system may be implemented by one or more computing devices including a computer server and a cloud computing environment. In some embodiments it provides graphical user interfaces that can be accessed by remote devices such as a tablet and a cellular phone. In some embodiments it offers an application programming interface which enables the system to be accessed at an application level. In some embodiments the system accepts and transmits text messages voicemail messages and email messages for communication between the commanders and various parties over computer networks telephone networks mobile networks or other networks.

The data management module accepts data inputted by users of the system or received from third party sources and stores them in one or more databases. In some embodiments the data management module accepts data regarding a site. One example of such data is a floor plan showing the layout of a site which may indicate the locations of landmarks the features of individual rooms and the like. The data management module allows such data to be represented in a hierarchical manner. For example the top level may correspond to the entire site the second level may correspond to individual buildings at the site the third level may correspond to individual rooms within each building and so on.

In some embodiments the data management module accepts data regarding the likely participants. For example when the site is a school the likely participants include all employees of the school such as teachers and administrators and all students who attend the school. Such data may contain a variety of types of information including information identifying a person such as the person s name gender age title and phone number and information indicating the person s special needs such as using a wheelchair or having asthma.

In some embodiments the data management module accepts data regarding the support agencies. Such data may include information identifying an agency or trusted party such as a police department or security service potentially including its location and contact mechanisms and information specifying capabilities of the agency or the trust such as information regarding the officers and the weapons available. The data management module also accepts data regarding emergency contacts of the likely participants including information identifying an emergency contact s name phone numbers or email addresses.

The communication module manages all communication with the involved parties. In some embodiments the communication module specifies system accessibility information. For example it may make one phone number or email address available for all incoming messages or it may make one unique phone number or email address available to each site. Furthermore the communication module accepts incoming telephone calls and voicemail email text and other messages from the involved parties and delivers outgoing ones to the involved parties. It may present all the conversations graphically in real time to the commanders.

In some embodiments the communication module defines communication protocols for specific communications with the involved parties. A communication protocol may comprise a series of questions to be answered by the involved parties. Instead of a series of questions a protocol may also specify merely one or more keywords.

One communication protocol is for a check in procedure to be followed by appropriate parties which produces an estimated list of involved parties in each unit of a site. As one example when the appropriate parties are representatives of the likely participants the questions may involve asking a representative in a unit of a site such as a teacher in a classroom to report on other members in that unit such as the students and first responders in that classroom. As another example when the appropriate parties are all the likely participants a keyword may be present and every likely participant who sends a message containing that keyword would be considered checked in. Another communication protocol is for a triage or status report procedure which produces a summary of the situation in each unit of a site. As one example the questions may involve the locations of the involved parties within a unit the types of injuries sustained by the involved parties in the unit the sights and sounds outside the unit that could be observed by the involved parties in the unit and the like. As another example the keywords may be status and one of a set of status indicators such as secured hazard and critical for an incident idle operating on break for a project or event and normal counterfeit stealing excessive returns for general monitoring.

The site control module manages a process of controlling a site. In some embodiments the site control module allows a user to set up trigger conditions that would lead to the initiation of the control process especially a lockdown of the site in a crisis or any other adverse scenarios. One type of trigger condition is the receipt of a message from a relevant party such as a likely participant or a law enforcement agent containing a set of keywords. The site control module may define default measures or allow a user to specify such measures corresponding to one or more trigger conditions. One type of measure is the initiation of a site lockdown by sending a message to appropriate parties whether they are representatives of the likely participants or all the likely participants. Another type of measure is the notification of relevant parties such as the support agencies and emergency contacts of the likely participants. For non emergency situations such as day to day monitoring or a scheduled event no triggering might be defined and the site control module might simply initiate the control process at the instruction of a commander for example.

As one example when the communication module makes a single phone number available a trigger condition may specify the name of a school and the word shooting and a corresponding measure may be the initiation of a lockdown of the school. As a result upon receiving from a teacher in a classroom of a school a message including the name of the school and the word shooting the site control module would initiate a lockdown of the school by sending a message which states Lockdown initiated to appropriate parties. As another example when the communication module makes multiple phone numbers available one for each site a trigger condition may specify a single word robbery. As a result when an owner of a shop in a mall sends a message to the phone number assigned to the mall which contains the word robbery the site control module would similarly initiate a lockdown of the mall.

In some embodiments the site control module carries out a check in procedure according to a communication protocol defined by the communication module . As one example it may reach out to every likely participant to carry out the check in procedure right after it initiates a site lockdown. As another example after announcing a site lockdown it may carry out the check in procedure with an involved party in response to receiving a message from the involved party directly or through a sensor installed onsite which may detect the presence of an involved party. In some embodiments the site control module concludes a process of controlling a site by sending a message to appropriate parties. For example the message may be as simple as Lockdown terminated or Operation complete . 

The site monitoring module keeps track of the status of a site. In some embodiments it determines the status of each unit of the site using various approaches. In one approach the site monitoring module identifies a status from an incoming message that satisfies a communication protocol for a status report procedure. In another approach for a set of status indicators the site monitoring module associates each of them with an additional set of keywords. It then analyzes the incoming messages and assigns a status to a unit based on the presence of the keywords. For example for the status indicator hazard the associated keywords may include hostile and broken and for the status indicator critical the associated keywords may include bleeding and shot. Therefore when the words bleeding and shot appear frequently in the messages received from the involved parties in a particular unit of a site the site monitoring module may assign the status critical to that unit. In addition to a status indicator the site monitoring module may record descriptions of specific issues that have arisen in a unit. For example the presence of each of the keywords associated with a status indicator may lead to a description of a specific issue. When a specific issue concerns a specific involved party the site monitoring module may update the status of that involved party which may then be displayed by the data management module .

In some embodiments the site monitoring module represents the status of the site graphically. When the floor plan of the site is available the site monitoring module presents an annotated interactive version of the floor plan. For example each unit of the site may be shown in a color that corresponds to the status indicator of the unit and a user s interaction with the graphical representation of the unit may lead to the display of further information about the unit.

The external support module facilitates the coordination of support efforts from one or more support agencies such as law enforcement agencies regarding an incident at a site. For example it may receive telephone calls or messages from several police departments near a site regarding 911 calls made by the involved parties. The external support module may set up a written record for each piece of information received. Furthermore it may share the received information among the support agencies who have shared such information with the involved parties and with other relevant parties. It may also provide information available within the system to the support agencies such as data regarding the involved parties. In this manner the external support module serves as a point of contact for all incident handling efforts ensuring that no effort is duplicated and all the efforts are integrated to achieve the maximum effect.

The reporting module manages data that may be used for audit purposes. In some embodiments the reporting module manages a log to account for all the communications conducted during the process of controlling a site. For example the log may include a time stamped entry for every incoming and outgoing message and telephone call. It may also include descriptions of important checkpoints such as when the status of a room changes. is a user interface diagram illustrating an example user interface for managing a log. In this example each log entry shows a time stamp in a type of activity being logged if available such as a check in or a room status change and a description such as a summary of the activity or entire contents of an incoming or outgoing message.

In some embodiments the reporting module replays the log in a graphic or animated manner with respect to a timeline for the control process using the time stamps. For example it may display the communications differently based on the source or destination of a communication the type of a communication the keywords mentioned in a communication the length of the communication and so on.

In some embodiments the reporting module extracts various types of information from the log. One type of information is an accountability list showing a list of involved parties who have gone through the check in procedure for example. is a user interface diagram illustrating an example user interface for managing an accountability list. The user interface shows an entry for each involved party. In this example each entry shows the name of the involved party in the triage status of the involved party in such as safe bleeding or unconscious and the location of the involved party in .
