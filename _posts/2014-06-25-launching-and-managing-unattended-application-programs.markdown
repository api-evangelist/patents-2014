Embodiments of the invention relate to launching and managing unattended application programs such as content management application programs.

Custom content management application programs may be described as storing and managing various types of digitized content such as document images electronic office documents eXtensible Markup Language XML documents audio and video that are related to a business processes of a commercial organization or an institution. The content management application programs may be short running application programs or long running application programs. Conventional systems implement custom content management application programs as a Windows service or a UNIX daemon. Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and or other countries. UNIX is a registered trademark of The Open Group in the United States and or other countries. However with such implementations on demand execution in background mode is required and execution at boot time is not suitable. Also with such implementations additional C programming may be needed for writing a Windows service or a UNIX daemon.

Furthermore typical background mode processing in UNIX commands e.g. and nohup terminate the background process after the user logs off from the foreground console session.

Provided is a method for launching and managing an unattended application program. The application program is launched in background mode. In response to determining that an exit command has been received an exit command indicator is set to indicate that the exit command has been received and a notification is sent to wake up a blocked main thread of the launched application program.

Provided is a computer program product for launching and managing an unattended application program. The computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having program code embodied therewith the program code executable by at least one processor to perform launching an application program in background mode and in response to determining that an exit command has been received setting an exit command indicator to indicate that the exit command has been received and sending a notification to wake up a blocked main thread of the launched application program.

Provided is a computer system for launching and managing an unattended application program. The computer system comprises one or more processors one or more computer readable memories and one or more computer readable tangible storage devices and program instructions stored on at least one of the one or more computer readable tangible storage devices for execution by at least one of the one or more processors via at least one of the one or more memories to perform operations the operations comprising launching an application program in background mode and in response to determining that an exit command has been received setting an exit command indicator to indicate that the exit command has been received and sending a notification to wake up a blocked main thread of the launched application program.

The descriptions of the various embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration but are not intended to be exhaustive or limited to the embodiments disclosed. Many modifications and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the described embodiments. The terminology used herein was chosen to best explain the principles of the embodiments the practical application or technical improvement over technologies found in the marketplace or to enable others of ordinary skill in the art to understand the embodiments disclosed herein.

In certain embodiments the exit command indicator e.g. a flag or a bit is set to true to indicate that the exit command has been received and that the launched application program is to be terminated or set to false to indicate that the exit command has not been received and that the launched application program is not to be terminated. In certain embodiments in response to a user issuing an exit command to terminate a launched application program the exit controller sets the exit command indicator for the launched application program to true to indicate that the exit command has been received.

In certain embodiments the one or more application programs include at least one custom content management application program. In certain embodiments the one or more application programs include at least one Java application program. Java is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States and or other countries . In certain embodiments the data store is a persistent data store. A persistent data store may be described as a storage that saves the data in persistence. In certain embodiments Java Preferences Application Programming Interface API is utilized as the persistent data store. The Java Preferences API saves the data in a Windows registry on Windows platforms and saves the data in the user directory on UNIX platforms.

Embodiments provide a way to run application programs e.g. custom content management application programs in the background mode unattended mode . Running the application programs in the background mode may be described as running without human attention. Furthermore the application program continues to run in background mode even when the login user is logged off from a terminal session on a UNIX platform or the user exits from a command console on a Windows platform. On the contrary in foreground mode the application program will be terminated after the login user is logged off from a terminal session on a UNIX platform or the user exits from a command console on a Windows platform.

Embodiments provide a technique for managing unattended application programs. Embodiments allow unattended application programs to be launched and managed in background mode. Embodiments provide 

To enable the unattended mode the application program incorporates the checking mechanism before the original application program logic and incorporates the blocking mechanism after the original application program logic . This avoids the need for additional C programming and shell scripting. In certain embodiments this is a Java implementation that also enhances the portability with various platforms and maintainability of the application program. In certain embodiments even though blocks and may be invoked sequentially in the application program they will run as separate execution threads after they are started.

In certain embodiments the launched application program is a main thread the checking mechanism is a sub thread of the main thread the original application program logic is another sub thread of the main thread and the blocking mechanism is a routine of the main thread of the original application program logic .

The following utility tools support the launch termination and status checking of the application programs running in background mode 

In from the launch controller a user may launch application programs A B and C which run in background mode. In various embodiments a user may be a human user a computer program a device etc. Application programs A B and C store the process ID and additional status in the data store . Application programs A B and C may also retrieve the process ID and additional status from the data store . Even when the user logs off from the current console session the application programs A B and C continue to run in background mode.

From the exit controller the user may terminate a specific application program that is running in background mode. The exit controller updates the exit command indicator for the terminated application program in the data store . In this manner an exit command is sent to the data store for the terminated application program. When the application program detects the arrival of an exit command in the data store via the checking mechanism the application program will exit from the execution i.e. terminate . In addition the launch monitor may be used to update and retrieve the status of launched application programs.

In block the checking mechanism sleeps for a period of time e.g. set by the user launching the application program or set by a system administrator . When the checking mechanism wakes up processing continues to block .

In block the checking mechanism sets the terminate indicator in the launched application program to indicate that the exit command has been received for the launched application program e.g. sets the terminate indicator to true . In block the checking mechanism sends a notification to the blocking mechanism to wake up a blocked main thread of the launched application program.

Thus with embodiments long running application programs may be launched in background mode and will run until actively terminated. Also on demand execution is available as the application program may be launched in background mode and terminated at any time by a user.

In order to address the requirement for unattended content management application programs embodiments enable the launch and management of unattended content management application programs in background mode.

Thus embodiments provide a new type of background processing to be addressed which is different from the traditional ways of handling background processing in Unix platforms and Windows platforms.

Embodiments provide a new approach supporting on demand execution of an application program in the background i.e. an unattended mode without the complexity and overhead of additional programming or shell scripting.
