The disclosed subject matter relates to a vehicle crash management apparatus and methods of use and manufacture thereof. More particularly the disclosed subject matter relates to methods and apparatus that enhance vehicular energy management performance upon application of external stresses such as may occur upon vehicular collisions or crash events.

Stresses and in some cases extreme stresses can be communicated to vehicles under certain circumstances including vehicular collisions or crash events. These stresses can cause related art power source assemblies to become detached from the vehicular frame and or otherwise move relative to various elements of the vehicle. Movement of the power source assembly into the vehicular passenger compartment or into contact with fuel system components may result in especially severe damage. This movement can be influenced by a variety of factors including the magnitude of the stress such as resulting from crash speed mass stiffness and geometric interaction of various vehicular components.

However various vehicular design factors may make it challenging to sufficiently impede or prevent movement of the power source assembly into the vehicular passenger compartment and or into contact with fuel system components upon application of significant amounts of stress. For example space constraints and styling requirements may require the power source assembly to be disposed close to certain fuel system components such as the fuel tank and or the passenger compartment. These constraints and requirements may also limit the use of structures for managing the stresses. These issues may be especially pronounced in cases of rear and mid engine mounting.

It may therefore be beneficial to provide a vehicle crash management apparatus and methods of use and manufacture thereof that address at least one of the above and or other challenges of related art vehicles. In particular it may be beneficial to enhance vehicular energy management performance upon application of external stresses such as by controlling movement of the power source assembly and or mitigating energy caused by the external stress. For example assemblies that mount the power source assembly to the vehicular frame assembly can be configured to absorb and transfer energy that originated from the external stress. In some of these and or other embodiments the vehicular frame can be configured to guide movement of the power source assembly away from certain elements of the fuel source assembly such as the fuel tank. In some of these and or other embodiments the frame can be configured to form projections or extrusions that limit power source assembly movement. In some of these and or other embodiments the frame can be configured to include plates that shield or otherwise protect certain elements of the fuel source assembly.

Some embodiments are therefore directed to an energy management apparatus for use with a vehicle that includes a power source assembly and at least one vehicle component. The energy management apparatus can include an upper frame that at least partially encloses the power source assembly. The apparatus can also include a lower frame that defines a raised portion disposed longitudinally between the power source assembly and the at least one vehicle component. The raised portion can include an inclined portion that defines an acute angle relative to the longitudinal direction and is disposed to guide movement of the power source assembly upwardly in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and away from the at least one vehicle component upon movement of the power source assembly in the longitudinal direction. The apparatus can also include a mount assembly that mounts the power source assembly to the lower frame. The mount assembly can be configured to detach the power source assembly from the lower frame upon application of a predetermined threshold impact energy being transmitted to the power source assembly thereby enabling the power source assembly to move in the longitudinal direction and resulting in dissipation of at least a portion of the impact energy.

Some other embodiments are directed to an energy management system for use with a vehicle having an interior passenger compartment. The energy management system can include a power source assembly and at least one vehicle component. The system can also include an upper frame that at least partially encloses the power source assembly. The upper frame can include a pair of vertically extending members and a cross frame member extending between the vertically extending members. The cross frame member can be disposed between the power source assembly and the interior passenger compartment. The system can also include a lower frame that defines a raised portion disposed longitudinally between the power source assembly and the at least one component. The raised portion can include an inclined portion that defines an acute angle relative to the longitudinal direction and is disposed to guide movement of the power source assembly upwardly in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and away from the at least one vehicle component upon movement of the power source assembly in the longitudinal direction. The system can further include a mount assembly that mounts the power source assembly to the lower frame. The mount assembly can be configured to detach the power source assembly from the lower frame upon application of a predetermined threshold impact energy being transmitted to the power source assembly that results from the external stresses thereby enabling the power source assembly to move in the longitudinal direction and resulting in dissipation of at least a portion of the impact energy.

Still other embodiments are directed to a method of enhancing energy management performance upon application of external stresses to a vehicle that includes a power source assembly and at least one vehicle. The method can include enclosing the power source assembly with an upper frame and mounting the power source assembly to a lower frame with a mount assembly that is configured to fail and thereby detach the power source assembly from the lower frame upon application of a predetermined threshold impact energy being transmitted to the power source assembly that results from the external stresses thereby enabling the power source assembly to move in the longitudinal direction and resulting in dissipation of at least a portion of the impact energy. The method can further include guiding movement of the power source assembly upwardly in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and away from the at least one vehicle component upon movement of the power source assembly in the longitudinal direction. The guiding can be performed with a raised portion of the lower frame that is disposed longitudinally between the power source assembly and the at least one vehicle component the raised portion including an inclined portion that defines an acute angle relative to the longitudinal direction.

The second sub frame member can include a pair of lateral members L R and a pair of cross members . The lateral members L R can be connected to the cross members .

The lateral members L R can cooperate with the cross members to define a central open area. In exemplary embodiments the lateral members L R and the cross members can be formed as individual components and then assembled together in any appropriate manner such as but not limited to welding mechanical fasteners adhesive bonding or any combination of these exemplary connection techniques. In other exemplary embodiments the lateral members L R and the cross members can be formed as a single unitary structure. The lateral members L R and the cross members can be formed from any appropriate known related art or later developed material such as but not limited to metal metal alloy plastic carbon fiber or any combination of these exemplary materials.

The second sub frame member can include first power source mount areas L R which can be configured to receive first power source mount assemblies L R. The first power source mount assemblies L R can be configured to connect the power source assembly to the second sub frame member . The first power source mount assemblies L R can be configured to dampen vibrations generated by the power source assembly in order to reduce minimize or prevent transmission of these vibrations to other portions of the vehicle such as but not limited to the passenger compartment .

In some embodiments the first power source mount assemblies L R can each include an input member a damping member and an output member. The damper member can be directly or indirectly connected to each of the input member and the output member and can permit relative motion between the input member and the output member. The damper member can include any appropriate known related art or later developed vibration absorbing material such as but not limited to rubber elastomer oil or any combination of these exemplary materials. In other exemplary embodiments the damping member can include a computer controlled actuator that can dampen the vibrations generated or otherwise output by the power source.

The first power source mount areas L R can be formed at any appropriate one s of the lateral members L R and the cross members . In some embodiments the first power source mount areas L R can be formed adjacent the junctions of the second cross member and each of the lateral frame members L R. The first power source mount assemblies L R can be directly or indirectly connected to the first power source mount areas L R of the second sub frame member by any appropriate manner such as but not limited to welding mechanical fasteners adhesive bonding or any combination of these exemplary connection techniques.

The space frame assembly can include a bumper beam pair of bumper support frame members L R and pair of central frame members L R. The power source assembly can be mounted to at least one of the space frame assembly and the lower frame assembly such that the bumper beam pair of bumper support frame members L R and pair of central frame members L R extend about or around the power source assembly .

As will be described below the central frame members L R can be connected to other structure s of the space frame assembly . The bumper support frame members L R can include a first end connected to a respective one of the central frame members L R and a second end connected to the bumper beam . The bumper support frame members L R can extend generally in the longitudinal direction L of the vehicle . The bumper beam can extend between the bumper support frame members L R. The bumper support frame members L R can space the bumper beam from the central frame members L R in the longitudinal direction L of the vehicle .

The bumper beam and or the bumper support frame members L R can be configured to deform in response to energy transmitted or input to the bumper beam that is greater than a predetermined threshold energy. As noted above this energy input can be the result of an object that is external to the vehicle that impacts or is impacted by the bumper beam . The bumper beam and or the bumper support frame members L R can be configured to absorb at least a portion of the impact energy through deformation. The bumper beam and or the bumper support frame members L R can be configured to transmit any of the impact energy that is not absorbed by deformation to the central frame members L R. The central frame members L R can be configured to transmit this portion of the impact energy to at least another portion of the space frame assembly .

If the impact energy exceeds a predetermined threshold deformation of the bumper beam and or the bumper support frame members L R can be sufficient to cause the bumper beam and or the impacting object to engage the power source assembly . The power source assembly can be a rigid body of relatively large mass. As such the power source assembly can transmit into the space frame assembly substantially all of the impact energy input to the power source assembly by the impacting object.

In order to impede reduce or even minimize the amount of impact energy transmitted by the power source assembly to the space frame assembly the first power source mount assemblies L R can be configured to fail if a predetermined threshold impact energy is transmitted to the power source assembly . Failure of the first power source mount assemblies L R can permit the power source assembly to move in the longitudinal direction L of the vehicle . As a result at least a portion of the impact energy input to the power source assembly can be dissipated by virtue of the mechanical failure of the first power source mount assemblies L R and an additional portion of the impact energy can be transformed into kinetic energy of the power source assembly thereby reducing or even preventing the transmission of a portion of the impact energy into other portions of the space frame assembly .

If the displacement of the power source assembly is sufficient to cause the leading portion of the power source assembly to engage the first inclined portion of the first sub frame member then the first inclined portion can deflect the power source assembly upwardly in the vertical direction V as viewed in . As a result any component s and or system s mounted to the vehicle that is are on a side of the raised portion opposite the leading portion can be protected from damage or at least the damage can be reduced if the impacting object displaces the power source assembly into engagement with the raised portion of the first sub frame member .

In order to reduce or limit the amount of displacement of the power source assembly in the longitudinal direction L the first cross member can be positioned and configured to contact an engagement member of the power source assembly and resist or impede further displacement of the power source assembly in the longitudinal direction L if the leading portion has engaged the first inclined portion of the first sub frame assembly . The engagement portion can be constituted by any appropriate portion of the power source assembly . In some embodiments the engagement portion can be a functional component of the power source assembly such as but not limited to a portion of the casing or housing enclosing at least a portion of the power source assembly . In other exemplary embodiments the engagement portion can be a component that is separate from the power source assembly that can be connected to the power source assembly .

Thus in view of the lower frame assembly and the first power source mount assemblies L R can cooperate with the power source assembly to impede reduce or prevent impact energy transmitted through the power source assembly to the remainder of the space frame assembly and or other component s and or system s mounted on the vehicle . Additionally the lower frame assembly can control the direction and magnitude of the displacement of the power source assembly in response to an impact energy applied to the power source assembly such as by virtue of the first inclined portion .

As discussed above the space frame assembly can include a portion that is configured to transmit impact energy without deformation. This portion of the space frame assembly can include the central frame members L R discussed above. The space frame assembly can also include at least one portion in addition to the lower frame assembly that can control the magnitude of the displacement of the power source assembly in response to an impact energy applied to the power source assembly .

While certain embodiments of the invention are described above and disclose the best mode for practicing the various inventive aspects it should be understood that the invention can be embodied and configured in many different ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

For example the raised portion of the central frame portion of the first sub frame member is shown in the figures as being spaced from and immediately adjacent a bottom corner of the power source assembly opposite the vehicle first end . In this configuration the power source assembly needs to move longitudinally L a relatively short distance before contacting the raised portion and then being guided vertically V upward which may be beneficial by impeding or preventing contact between the power source assembly and sensitive components such as the fuel tank. In other words guiding the power source assembly upward provides clearance between the power source assembly and the fuel tank upon occurrence of a significant impact.

However the raised portion can be disposed at any other location that is beneficial. For example the raised portion can be in contact with the power source assembly such that any longitudinal L movement of the power source assembly causes the raised portion to guide the power source assembly vertically V. Alternatively the raised portion can be spaced a relatively longer distance from the power source assembly such that a relatively longer distance of longitudinal L movement of the power source assembly causes the raised portion to guide the power source assembly vertically V.

The raised portion of the central frame portion of the first sub frame member is shown in the figures as including three discrete segments in cross section including 1 a generally vertically extending member closest to the vehicle first end 2 the inclined portion defining an obtuse angle slightly larger than 90 degrees with the vertically extending member or defining an acute angle relative to the longitudinal direction so as to form a gradually inclined surface relative to the vehicle front end and 3 a declining portion that defines an angle of decline that exceeds the angle of incline of the inclined portion i.e. the declining portion declines at a steeper angle than the gradual incline of the inclined portion .

However embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any structure that is able to guide the power source assembly upwardly upon being displaced in the longitudinal direction. For example the raised portion can be formed by two separate segments such as by not including the vertically extending member. Also the relative angles of incline and decline can be different such as by making the angle of incline of the inclined portion steeper and or making the angle of decline of the declining portion less steep.

In still other embodiments the upward movement of the power source assembly can be effected by virtue of a surface of the power source assembly . For example the bottom of the power source assembly can define an angle that communicates with another surface to guide the power source assembly upwardly upon being translated longitudinally.

In the embodiments shown in the figures the power source mount assemblies include an input member a damping member and an output member and are configured to fail if a predetermined threshold impact energy is transmitted to the power source assembly . As disclosed above this failure permits the power source assembly to move in the longitudinal direction L of the vehicle resulting in at least a portion of the impact energy input to the power source assembly being dissipated by virtue of the mechanical failure of the first power source mount assemblies L R and an additional portion of the impact energy being transformed into kinetic energy of the power source assembly thereby reducing or even preventing the transmission of a portion of the impact energy into other portions of the space frame assembly .

However embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover other structures to perform this operation. In fact embodiments are intended to include any structure that connects the power source assembly to the frame in such a way as to allow the power source assembly to break free from the frame in a controlled manner after absorbing a certain amount of force. In fact this structure as an alternative to the separate power source mount assemblies can be unitarily formed as either a part of the power source assembly or as a part of the frame.

The embodiment shown in include a fuel system protection assembly having a first panel second panel and third panel positioned between the power source assembly and component s of the fuel system in order to shield the fuel system component s from the power source assembly such as to impede or prevent direct contact between the fuel system component s and the power source assembly .

However embodiments are intended to include or otherwise cover any other structures to facilitate protection of the fuel system component s such as from direct contact with the power source assembly . For example some embodiments include panels that define a specific structure shape and or material to provide enhanced performance in this regard. Still other embodiments include structures other than panels such as stoppers that impede or prevent movement of the power source assembly that would result in contact with the fuel system component s .
