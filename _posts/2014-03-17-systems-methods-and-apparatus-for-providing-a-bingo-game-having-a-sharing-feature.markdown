Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to bingo games and or computer software applications for providing bingo games. Some embodiments of this disclosure relate to gaming networks for providing bingo games including social network games single player games and or multiplayer games.

According to some embodiments a bingo game is provided in which a player uses one or more cards or tickets or other type of physical or electronic game play area or game space that include symbols e.g. alphanumeric characters and or other types of identifiers assigned to respective spaces or other designated areas on the card. One or more symbols are drawn selected or otherwise determined from a set of symbols available for the bingo game and in accordance with some embodiments the drawn symbols are compared to the symbols designated on the card to see if there are any matches. It will be readily understood that a set of symbols for a bingo game may include any range of numbers multiple ranges of numbers a non sequential range of numbers alphanumeric characters non numeric symbols letters punctuation marks and or any other representation of information.

According to some embodiments for a given bingo game the distribution of bingo symbols across cards and or the distribution of the tickets across players may be in accordance with one or more distribution algorithms and or at random. In some embodiments a bingo system generates all possible combinations of available bingo symbols as cards and distributes all of the possible cards before distributing any repeat cards.

According to some embodiments if marked or daubed spaces on a card form one or more previously designated arrangements a bingo pattern or winning pattern the card may be deemed a winning card and or the player may be eligible for a prize. In one example a player may win a prize by calling Bingo for a card with a winning pattern e.g. by clicking a Bingo button of a game interface to indicate the player thinks his electronic bingo card includes a winning bingo pattern . Daubed or marked will be used synonymously in this disclosure to refer to spaces symbols numbers etc. on a card that have been marked covered stamped daubed highlighted or otherwise identified physically visually and or graphically as potentially contributing to a winning pattern e.g. alone or in combination with one or more other marked spaces . In some embodiments spaces are daubed e.g. automatically by a gaming device and or manually by a player if they match symbols drawn for a bingo game. Alternatively or in addition one or more spaces may be daubed without requiring that the space match a drawn symbol a free daub or mark . For example a card may have one or more free daubs automatically prior to the start of play e.g. the center square of a 5 5 grid may be pre marked with a free daub and or anytime during play e.g. by receiving a free random daub in accordance with a game rule .

According to one embodiment a card includes spaces arranged in columns and rows e.g. a 5 5 grid of spaces a 3 4 array of ticket lines each having a designated number e.g. selected from a set of bingo numbers 1 75 represented in a respective space on the card.

According to some embodiments one or more symbols for a bingo game may be associated with a symbol identifier that identifies the symbol e.g. a unique bingo number and with one or more types of symbol category identifiers that identify a category group and or type associated with a symbol.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a symbol category identifier may comprise a location identifier and or a number category or group. According to some embodiments each symbol for a bingo game may be associated with one or more respective location identifiers. In one embodiment certain symbols may be designated only in certain areas of a game card. For example the B column of a 5 5 card may only include numbers selected in the range of 1 15. In another example the first column of a 90 ball bingo game ticket may only include numbers selected in the range of 1 10 the second column may only include numbers selected in the range of 11 20 and so on.

Accordingly in some embodiments a given bingo symbol may be associated with both a number or a shape color or other type of symbol identifier that distinguishes it from other symbols and location information e.g. a column identifier row identifier and or other type of location identifier including information about where the symbol may appear on the card. In one example a bingo ball may be associated with the number 3 and with a B indicating that if it appears on a card it would appear in a designated B column of spaces.

According to one embodiment a card for a bingo game may include one or more types of location identifiers. Location identifiers may include without limitation one or more column identifiers row identifiers and or other types of identifiers that uniquely identify a particular grid space row column area or other portion of a bingo card. For example each column of a 5 5 bingo card may be identified respectively as B I N G or O .

According to some embodiments symbols may be represented e.g. physically or electronically via a user interface as numbered balls. Drawn numbers themselves may be referred to in this disclosure as balls for illustrative purposes and without limitation. As used in this disclosure a symbol draw or ball draw may be used to refer to a process for selecting or otherwise determining e.g. at random numbers or other types of symbols drawn for use in comparing to symbols on a card for a bingo game. Drawn balls and drawn numbers may be used for convenience to refer to symbols selected in a symbol draw and it will be understood that such terms are not limited to balls or numbers but encompass any type of symbols drawn for a bingo game. Those of skill in the art will realize that the symbols used in an electronic bingo game may be displayed in any convenient fashion as deemed appropriate for a particular implementation and that a simulated ball draw is merely one example. The number of balls drawn and the timing of ball draws may vary according to the desired type of bingo game.

According to some embodiments a bingo game is played until at least one predetermined winning pattern is established on a bingo card. In some embodiments determining whether a winning pattern is marked properly on a card may comprise determining whether each marked space may be compared to a set of drawn symbols to verify that it is a valid mark and therefore may qualify for or contribute to a winning pattern. In another example determining if a marked pattern is a winning pattern may comprise determining whether any marked spaces are valid free daubs. According to some embodiments a bingo game is played until a predetermined number of winning patterns are achieved e.g. by one or more players and or until a time limit expires.

According to some embodiments a player must identify any matches between drawn numbers and numbers designated on the player s card s the player must take action to daub spaces on the card e.g. via a user interface in order to form potential winning patterns and or the player must take action to declare a card has one or more winning patterns e.g. by clicking a Bingo button . In one embodiment one or more daubed spaces may be undaubed by a player and or bingo game program. In one example a player may undaub a space that the player mistakenly daubed. In some embodiments one or more matching numbers may be daubed automatically and or one or more winning patterns of marked spaces may be identified automatically e.g. electronically by gaming device in accordance with instructions of a computer software program . Some embodiments may provide for automatic daubing of one or more spaces e.g. for initial free daubs and or random free daubs during play and for manual daubing by the player of one or more spaces e.g. in response to matching drawn numbers .

While some embodiments described in this disclosure may make advantageous use of the visible ball queue by including one or more special balls special balls are not required to be used with a visible ball queue and no individual special ball is required to validate the advantages of the visible ball queue functionality.

According to some embodiments players may be able to interact with a displayed ball queue on an individual and or communal or group level. According to one embodiment one or more players may indicate one or more balls e.g. in a visible queue that the respective player would like to be a special ball e.g. to become associated with one or more special functions .

In some embodiments a player may be able to indicate e.g. in a voting or other selection process via a user interface one or more balls in a visible queue the player wants to advance in the queue e.g. to the front of the queue . In some embodiments a bingo system may take the collective results of a plurality of players e.g. the votes of a community or team and subsequently modify the sequence of balls in the ball queue based on the collective results. In one embodiment players may vote e.g. via a user interface for which ball to advance in a visible queue displaying two or more upcoming ball calls. The order of balls in a queue e.g. displayed in a visible queue may be determined e.g. re ordered by a controller of the bingo system based on how many players voted for each of the balls with the ball receiving the most votes moving to the front of the queue the ball receiving the second most amount of votes moving to the second spot in the queue and so on.

According to some embodiments a player may indicate e.g. via a user interface one or more balls in a visible queue to which the player would like a win multiplier applied e.g. if the player wins with the associated number the player will win a multiplier on the resulting payout . In some embodiments a bingo system may use the respective selections of a plurality of players e.g. the votes of a community or team to determine at least one ball with which to associate a win multiplier based on the selections of the plurality of players. In one embodiment a controller of a bingo system may apply a win multiplier to one or more balls e.g. by updating the displayed indication of a ball in a queue to represent the associated multiplier by updating an associated record in a database based on the respective selections of one or more players.

In some embodiments one or more plays of a bingo game may be purchased e.g. by a player from or otherwise made available e.g. to players via a central controller or bingo system. In one embodiment game plays are available for purchase from an online service provider such as a web based retailer and or social networking service e.g. via a software application associated with a social networking web site .

According to some embodiments information associated with one or more bingo games including for example indications of payout amount s result s associated players or purchasers may be transmitted to received by and stored by a player device e.g. a computer a cell phone etc. .

According to one example implementation of an example bingo game in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention an on line bingo game is provided by a game provider as a daily bonus game. Players of the example game receive a 9 9 bingo card at the beginning of each week of play e.g. each Monday morning . Each player receives a predetermined number of free ball calls e.g. five initial ball calls per day e.g. and the corresponding numbers are automatically daubed on their cards .

According to the example game players may unlock one or more extra ball calls by performing a task such as sending one or more friend balls to their friends. Players have until the end of a predetermined period of time e.g. a week to complete as many winning bingo patterns as possible. For instance the ultimate aim may be for the player to complete a blackout pattern on the bingo card. In one example prizes may be awarded to a player at the end of the gaming session e.g. after midnight on the Sunday following a game s start on Monday and may be based on the number of bingos achieved on the card.

According to one example implementation of an example bingo game in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention an on line bingo game is provided by a game provider as a daily bonus game. According to the example implementation on a player s first session of each day the daily game referred to as Mega Bingo in this example opens automatically e.g. in response to a player logging in to a game server and a predetermined number of balls e.g. as set or determined by a game provider are called. Before after and or at any time during play of the initial ball calls a player may be presented with or otherwise given the option to send bingo balls to their friends and or other types of users in order to unlock more ball calls e.g. for the daily session .

According to this example implementation if a player does not decide to share bingo ball calls with other users play of the day s session of the week long game is terminated e.g. after all matches from the initial ball calls are daubed as appropriate . In one example the player may be sent to a game lobby or other type of user interface of a game provider. According to the example implementation a player who does not elect to share ball calls does not get a chance subsequently to change his mind until the next session e.g. until the next day s session of the daily game . Further in some embodiments the player also cannot receive any ball calls shared by his or her friends that day. In some embodiments up to a predetermined number of shared ball calls e.g. ten shared with a player by the player s friends may be stored e.g. in a database in association with the player s profile and may be utilized in a later session. For instance should the player opt to share ball calls later in the week the player may receive one or more of the stored balls.

According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation if a player does decide to share 

According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation each Mega Bingo bingo card may include a configurable number of Friend Squares . A Friend Square can only be daubed by a Mega Bingo ball that has been sent to you by a friend and the squares are not associated with a number. All friend balls received will be numberless and will automatically fill these squares until they are all daubed. In some embodiments extra or subsequent Mega Bingo balls sent to a player by his friends will assume a number e.g. and act as a standard ball call .

According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation if a player does not share Mega Bingo balls with their friends they will not be able to receive friend balls thus their Friend Squares will not be daubed. If a player does share Mega Bingo balls but does not receive any back they will not be able to fill their Friend Squares. If a player does not manage to fill their Friend Squares they will be prevented from completing several possible bingos and the blackout. Without these squares players could still potentially win a handful of bingos by the end of the week.

According to some embodiments of the example Mega Bingo game implementation Friend Squares can appear in any pattern on any square of a Mega Bingo card and there is not a minimum or maximum amount of Friend Squares required per card. In one example Friend Squares may appear in the same place on the cards of all Bingo Lane players each week. In one embodiment once a Friend Square is daubed the profile picture of the friend who sent you the ball remains on the square.

Embodiments having scopes limited by provided examples may also specifically exclude features not explicitly described or contemplated.

Neither the Title set forth at the beginning of the first page of this patent application nor the Abstract set forth at the end of this patent application is to be taken as limiting in any way the scope of the disclosed invention s .

The term product means any machine manufacture and or composition of matter as contemplated by 35 U.S.C. 101 unless expressly specified otherwise.

The terms an embodiment embodiment embodiments the embodiment the embodiments one or more embodiments some embodiments one embodiment and the like mean one or more but not all disclosed embodiments unless expressly specified otherwise.

A reference to another embodiment in describing an embodiment does not imply that the referenced embodiment is mutually exclusive with another embodiment e.g. an embodiment described before the referenced embodiment unless expressly specified otherwise. Similarly any reference to an alternate alternative and or alternate embodiment is intended to connote one or more possible variations not mutual exclusivity. In other words it is expressly contemplated that alternatives described herein may be utilized and or implemented together unless they inherently are incapable of being utilized together.

The terms including comprising and variations thereof mean including but not limited to unless expressly specified otherwise.

The term herein means in the present application including the specification its claims and figures and anything which may be incorporated by reference unless expressly specified otherwise.

The phrase at least one of when such phrase modifies a plurality of things such as an enumerated list of things means any combination of one or more of those things unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the phrase at least one of a widget a car and a wheel means i a widget ii a car iii a wheel iv a widget and a car v a widget and a wheel vi a car and a wheel or vii a widget a car and a wheel.

The phrase based on does not mean based only on unless expressly specified otherwise. In other words the phrase based on describes both based only on and based at least on . In some embodiments a first thing being based on a second thing refers specifically to the first thing taking into account the second thing in an explicit manner. In such embodiments for example a processing step based on the local weather which itself is in some manner based on or affected by for example human activity in the rainforests is not based on such human activities because it is not those activities that being explicitly analyzed included taken into account and or processed.

The term whereby is used herein only to precede a clause or other set of words that express only the intended result objective or consequence of something that is previously and explicitly recited. Thus when the term whereby is used in a claim the clause or other words that the term whereby modifies do not establish specific further limitations of the claim or otherwise restricts the meaning or scope of the claim.

The term wherein as utilized herein does not evidence intended use. The term wherein expressly refers to one or more features inclusive in a particular embodiment and does not imply or include an optional or conditional limitation.

Where a limitation of a first claim would cover one of a feature as well as more than one of a feature e.g. a limitation such as at least one widget covers one widget as well as more than one widget and where in a second claim that depends on the first claim the second claim uses a definite article the to refer to the limitation e.g. the widget this does not imply that the first claim covers only one of the feature and this does not imply that the second claim covers only one of the feature e.g. the widget can cover both one widget and more than one widget .

When an ordinal number such as first second third and so on is used as an adjective before a term that ordinal number is used unless expressly specified otherwise merely to indicate a particular feature such as to allow for distinguishing that particular referenced feature from another feature that is described by the same term or by a similar term. For example a first widget may be so named merely to allow for distinguishing it in one or more claims from a second widget so as to encompass embodiments in which 1 the first widget is or is the same as the second widget and 2 the first widget is different than or is not identical to the second widget . Thus the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate any other relationship between the two widgets and likewise does not indicate any other characteristics of either or both widgets. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget 1 does not indicate that either widget comes before or after any other in order or location 2 does not indicate that either widget occurs or acts before or after any other in time 3 does not indicate that either widget ranks above or below any other as in importance or quality and 4 does not indicate that the two referenced widgets are not identical or the same widget. In addition the mere usage of ordinal numbers does not define a numerical limit to the features identified with the ordinal numbers. For example the mere usage of the ordinal numbers first and second before the term widget does not indicate that there must be no more than two widgets.

When a single device or article is described herein more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate may alternatively be used in place of the single device or article that is described. Accordingly the functionality that is described as being possessed by a device may alternatively be possessed by more than one device or article whether or not they cooperate .

Similarly where more than one device or article is described herein whether or not they cooperate a single device or article may alternatively be used in place of the more than one device or article that is described. For example a plurality of computer based devices may be substituted with a single computer based device. Accordingly the various functionality that is described as being possessed by more than one device or article may alternatively be possessed by a single device or article.

The functionality and or the features of a single device that is described may be alternatively embodied by one or more other devices which are described but are not explicitly described as having such functionality and or features. Thus other embodiments need not include the described device itself but rather can include the one or more other devices which would in those other embodiments have such functionality features.

Devices that are in communication with each other need not be in continuous communication with each other unless expressly specified otherwise. On the contrary such devices need only transmit to each other as necessary or desirable and may actually refrain from exchanging data most of the time. For example a machine in communication with another machine via the Internet may not transmit data to the other machine for weeks at a time. In addition devices that are in communication with each other may communicate directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries.

A description of an embodiment with several components or features does not imply that all or even any of such components and or features are required. On the contrary a variety of optional components are described to illustrate the wide variety of possible embodiments of the present invention s . Unless otherwise specified explicitly no component and or feature is essential or required.

Further although process steps algorithms or the like may be described in a sequential order such processes may be configured to work in different orders. In other words any sequence or order of steps that may be explicitly described does not necessarily indicate a requirement that the steps be performed in that order. The steps of processes described herein may be performed in any order practical. Further some steps may be performed simultaneously despite being described or implied as occurring non simultaneously e.g. because one step is described after the other step . Moreover the illustration of a process by its depiction in a drawing does not imply that the illustrated process is exclusive of other variations and modifications thereto does not imply that the illustrated process or any of its steps are necessary to the invention and does not imply that the illustrated process is preferred.

Although a process may be described as including a plurality of steps that does not indicate that all or even any of the steps are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other processes that omit some or all of the described steps. Unless otherwise specified explicitly no step is essential or required.

Although a product may be described as including a plurality of components aspects qualities characteristics and or features that does not indicate that all of the plurality are essential or required. Various other embodiments within the scope of the described invention s include other products that omit some or all of the described plurality.

An enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are mutually exclusive unless expressly specified otherwise. Likewise an enumerated list of items which may or may not be numbered does not imply that any or all of the items are comprehensive of any category unless expressly specified otherwise. For example the enumerated list a computer a laptop a PDA does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are mutually exclusive and does not imply that any or all of the three items of that list are comprehensive of any category.

Headings of sections provided in this patent application and the title of this patent application are for convenience only and are not to be taken as limiting the disclosure in any way.

 Determining something can be performed in a variety of manners and therefore the term determining and like terms includes calculating computing deriving looking up e.g. in a table database or data structure ascertaining and the like.

It will be readily apparent that the various methods and algorithms described herein may be implemented by e.g. appropriately and or specially programmed general purpose computers and or computing devices. Typically a processor e.g. one or more microprocessors will receive instructions from a memory or like device and execute those instructions thereby performing one or more processes defined by those instructions. Further programs that implement such methods and algorithms may be stored and transmitted using a variety of media e.g. computer readable media in a number of manners. In some embodiments hard wired circuitry or custom hardware may be used in place of or in combination with software instructions for implementation of the processes of various embodiments. Thus embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software

A processor generally means any one or more microprocessors CPU devices computing devices microcontrollers digital signal processors or like devices as further described herein. According to some embodiments a processor may primarily comprise and or be limited to a specific class of processors referred to herein as processing devices . Processing devices are a subset of processors limited to physical devices such as CPU devices Printed Circuit Board PCB devices transistors capacitors logic gates etc. Processing devices for example explicitly exclude biological software only and or biological or software centric physical devices. While processing devices may include some degree of soft logic and or programming for example such devices must include a predominant degree of physical structure in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 101.

The term computer readable medium refers to any medium that participates in providing data e.g. instructions or other information that may be read by a computer a processor or a like device. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory. Volatile media include DRAM which typically constitutes the main memory. Transmission media include coaxial cables copper wire and fiber optics including the wires that comprise a system bus coupled to the processor. Transmission media may include or convey acoustic waves light waves and electromagnetic emissions such as those generated during RF and IR data communications. Common forms of computer readable media include for example a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM a FLASH EEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge a carrier wave or any other medium from which a computer can read.

The term computer readable memory may generally refer to a subset and or class of computer readable medium that does not include transmission media such as waveforms carrier waves electromagnetic emissions etc. Computer readable memory may typically include physical media upon which data e.g. instructions or other information are stored such as optical or magnetic disks and other persistent memory DRAM a floppy disk a flexible disk hard disk magnetic tape any other magnetic medium a CD ROM DVD any other optical medium punch cards paper tape any other physical medium with patterns of holes a RAM a PROM an EPROM a FLASH EEPROM any other memory chip or cartridge computer hard drives backup tapes Universal Serial Bus USB memory devices and the like.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying data including sequences of instructions to a processor. For example sequences of instruction i may be delivered from RAM to a processor ii may be carried over a wireless transmission medium and or iii may be formatted according to numerous formats standards or protocols such as Bluetooth TDMA CDMA 3G.

Where databases are described it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that i alternative database structures to those described may be readily employed and ii other memory structures besides databases may be readily employed. Any illustrations or descriptions of any sample databases presented herein are illustrative arrangements for stored representations of information. Any number of other arrangements may be employed besides those suggested by e.g. tables illustrated in drawings or elsewhere. Similarly any illustrated entries of the databases represent exemplary information only one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number and content of the entries can be different from those described herein. Further despite any depiction of the databases as tables other formats including relational databases object based models and or distributed databases could be used to store and manipulate the data types described herein. Likewise object methods or behaviors of a database can be used to implement various processes such as the described herein. In addition the databases may in a known manner be stored locally or remotely from a device that accesses data in such a database.

The present invention can be configured to work in a network environment including a computer that is in communication via a communications network with one or more devices. The computer may communicate with the devices directly or indirectly via a wired or wireless medium such as the Internet LAN WAN or Ethernet Token Ring or via any appropriate communications means or combination of communications means. Each of the devices may comprise computers such as those based on the Intel Pentium or Centrino processor that are adapted to communicate with the computer. Any number and type of machines may be in communication with the computer.
