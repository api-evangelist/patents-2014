The present application is a continuation pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 642 224 filed Sep. 24 2013 which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Patent Application Ser. No. 61 325 688 filed Apr. 19 2010 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This invention was made with Government support under Grant No. DE AC02 05CH11231 awarded by the United States Department of Energy. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to luminescent materials and in particular to scintillators and applications thereof.

Scintillators are materials that absorb high energy radiation e.g. gamma rays x rays high energy particles and emit light low energy photons in response. To the extent that the number of emitted photons is proportional to the total energy of the stopped radiation a scintillator provides the useful function of identifying the total energy of any radiation that is stopped.

As the nucleus of every element and each isotope of each element emits a characteristic fingerprint of gamma ray energies when suitably excited usually by neutron activation scintillator responses to such emissions provide value in security screening of shipping and trucking containers and baggage where chemical elements and isotopes of elements can be identified and imaged using arrays of segmented scintillators without opening the container. This applies both to radioactive elements nuclear nonproliferation and screening and to ordinary non radioactive elements via neutron activation of gamma emission. Scintillators are also widely used in medical imaging and diagnostics as well as oil well logging where energy resolution can often also be of value. Desirable energy resolution requires sufficient proportionality of light yield to ray energy. Non proportionality of scintillator photonic emission to the stopped radiation can degrade resolution and produce significant inaccuracies in determining the total energy of the radiation received.

It is generally accepted that non proportionality in scintillators is associated with quenching non radiative electron hole recombination in parts of the particle ray track wherein ionization density is high coupled with the characteristic variability of dE dx from beginning to end of an electron track. Prior scintillators such as CsI Tl as well as others comprise crystalline materials doped with impurities. The impurities serve as radiative recombination centers for electron hole pairs generated from the absorption of the high energy radiation. Impurities are doped throughout the host crystal to ensure efficient photonic output from the scintillator upon radiation absorption. As a result an electron hole pair does not have to travel far before contacting an impurity for radiative recombination. This limitation of carrier mobilities reduces the probability of linear i.e. trap dominated non radiative electron hole recombination thereby maximizing the light output of the scintillator. Maximization of light output by this route however has associated costs as the limitation of carrier mobility by high dopant levels throughout the host crystal can result in or exacerbate non proportional response of the scintillator to the absorbed radiation.

These and other embodiments are described in greater detail in the detailed description which follows.

The present invention can be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description and drawings and their previous and following descriptions. Elements apparatus and methods of the present invention however are not limited to the specific embodiments presented in the detailed description and drawings. It should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.

As described herein the present invention provides scintillators and methods of making and using the same. In some embodiments a scintillator comprises at least one radiation absorption region and at least one spatially discrete radiative exciton recombination region for receiving excitons from the at least one radiation absorption region. In some embodiments a scintillator comprises a plurality of radiation absorption regions and a plurality of spatially discrete radiative exciton recombination regions for receiving excitons from the plurality of radiation absorption regions.

In keeping radiation absorption and radiative exciton recombination regions spatially discrete at least some if not substantially all excitons generated in one or more radiation absorption regions are transferred to one or more radiative exciton recombination regions for recombination and photonic emission. As described herein the absence of scintillation activator in the radiation absorption material facilitates transfer of excitons out of the absorption material to the radiative exciton recombination material. A scintillator architecture wherein a radiation absorption or stopping region is spatially discrete from an exciton recombination region is a fundamental departure from prior scintillator constructions wherein radiation absorption and exciton recombination occur in the same region or material. Prior scintillator constructions for example utilize a radiation absorption material doped throughout with impurities scintillation activators to induce radiative exciton recombination throughout the absorption material.

A spatially discrete radiative exciton recombination region in some embodiments occupies a fraction of the space or volume occupied by a radiation absorption region.

In some embodiments the least mobile carriers generated in the radiation absorption region are holes. In some embodiments the least mobile charge carriers generated in the radiation absorption region are electrons.

As carrier mobility and carrier diffusion range varies from material to material spacing of spatially discrete radiative exciton recombination regions can vary depending on the identity of the material of the radiation absorption region. In some embodiments diffusion range of a carrier of a radiation absorption region is determined according to wherein D is the diffusion coefficient of the material forming the radiation absorption region and wherein D is related to carrier mobility by wherein k is the Boltzman constant T is temperature K and e is electron charge. With the carrier diffusion range of a radiation absorption region being determined according to the foregoing the appropriate spacing of spatially discrete exciton recombination regions for a scintillator described herein can be set.
