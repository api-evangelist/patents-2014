Mobile Network Operators MNOs generally provide each subscriber a communication device with a Universal Integrated Circuit Card UICC commonly known as a Subscriber Identity Module or SIM card which enables the communication device to authenticate and access a mobile network. In some instances the SIM card can be removed by the subscriber and inserted in an alternate communication device providing the subscriber continuity of network access and services from device to device. A subscriber can switch subscription to another MNO by physically swapping one SIM card for another.

In an environment involving machine to machine communications it is common for a UICC to be placed in harsh environments such as a communication device located in an automobile engine or atop a streetlight which is not easily accessible. In such applications the UICC is often embedded in the communication device and not physically replaceable. When a subscriber of a device utilizing an embedded UICC wishes to switch to another MNO the subscriber may have to replace the device.

The subject disclosure describes among other things illustrative embodiments for managing content and memory allocated to applications of a universal integrated circuit card UICC . Other embodiments are included in the subject disclosure.

The TEE referenced above is defined by a standards organization known as a Global Platform. It is recognized by the Global Platform that modern devices such as a smartphone offer a Rich Execution Environment REE providing an extensive and versatile operating environment. This brings flexibility and capability but at the same time leaves the device vulnerable to a wide range of security threats. The TEE can be designed to reside alongside the REE and provide a safe area of the device to protect assets and execute trusted code. A TEE can be an execution environment that runs alongside but isolated from an REE. The TEE has security capabilities and meets certain security related requirements such as protecting TEE assets from general software attacks defining rigid safeguards as to data and functions that a program can access and resisting a set of defined threats. There are multiple technologies that can be used to implement a TEE and the level of security achieved varies accordingly.

The TSM referenced above is also defined by the Global Platform standards organization. It is recognized by the Global Platform that the TSM can be a trusted third party which provides one or more technical roles and possibly business roles to other actors in a telecommunications environment. A TSM is trusted by the other actors to be in charge of service management and delivery. The TSM acts as an aggregator and may simultaneously support several service providers and mobile network operators while maintaining confidentiality between the actors.

The MNO TSM referenced above is not defined by the Global Platform standards organization but is widely referred to in the industry. The MNO TSM implements one or more aspects of SDM Security Domain Management as defined by Global Platform on behalf of an MNO Mobile Network Operator . The SP TSM referenced above is also not defined by the Global Platform standards organization but is widely referred to in the industry. The SP TSM implements one or more aspects of SDM Security Domain Management as defined by Global Platform on behalf of a SP Service Provider .

A secure element SE is also a term defined by the Global Platform standards organization. It is recognized by the Global Platform that the SE is a component in a communication device providing the security and confidentiality required to support various business models. An SE can exist in any form factor such as a UICC an Embedded SE a Secure Memory Card etc.

The SEI referenced above is also defined by the Global Platform standards organization. It is recognized by the Global Platform that the SEI role holds the ultimate responsibility for the Global Platform card. It has the responsibility to develop the card product profile to choose the platform and application technologies to a design card layout. It usually holds a particular Security Domain in the SE the Issuer Security Domain ISD . Card Content Management CCM operations that can be performed on the ISD are associated to the Security Domain Manager role that an SE provider may also play.

A security domain SD is also a term defined by the Global Platform standards organization. It is recognized by the Global Platform that SD s act as the on card representatives of off card authorities. There are three main types of SD reflecting the three types of off card authority recognized by a card 

The three types of SDs described above are referred to simply as SDs in the subject disclosure. SDs support security services such as key handling encryption decryption digital signature generation and verification for their providers Card Issuer Application Provider or Controlling Authority applications. Each SD is established on behalf of a Card Issuer an Application Provider or a Controlling Authority when these off card entities require the use of keys that are completely isolated from each other.

The SM SR referenced above is defined by the GSM Association GSMA . It is recognized by the GSMA that the SM SR securely performs functions which directly manage the operational and provisioning profiles on the eUICC and possibly in future specifications promulgated by the GSMA the UICC . The SM DP referenced above is also defined by the GSMA. It is recognized by the GSMA that the SM DP prepares operational and provisioning profiles to be securely provisioned on the eUICC and possibly the UICC e.g. encryption of a profile.

Portions of the systems of and can be described in part by standards organizations that generate specifications for consistent application of services. Illustrations of such specifications include without limitation Messaging Specification for Management of Mobile NFC GPS SPE002 TEE System Architecture GPD SPE009 Reprogrammable SIMs Technology Evolution and Implications as prepared by OFCOM Card Specification GPC SPE034 each of the aforementioned specifications and subsequent derivatives being incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Referring to the telecommunications system illustrated therein can be managed in part according to method shown in . Method can begin with step in which a Telco SEI receives a request to modify the UICC of communication device . For illustration purposes only and show two types of UICCs removable and embedded . However it will be understood in the subject disclosure that methods and of and respectively can be applied to removable or embedded UICCs.

In step the Telco SEI can generate a package including configuration data to modify the UICC . The configuration data can comprise one or more authentication keys one or more network access parameters one or more service operator applications or combinations thereof. In one embodiment the service operator application can be a network based application that configures the communication device to comply with operational requirements of a communication system from which the communication device receives communication services. The network based application can be a subscriber identity module SIM application a universal subscriber identity module USIM application or an internet protocol multimedia services identity module ISIM application. The UICC executes the SIM application the USIM application or the ISIM application depending on whether the network of operates as a 2G 3G LTE or IMS IP Multimedia Subsystem network.

At step the Telco SEI can instruct an OTA system to transmit the package. The OTA system can perform this step by generating transport data which is combined with the package provided by the Telco SEI and encrypted with a transport key in step . At step the OTA system transmits the encrypted package to the communication device . The communication device delivers at step the encrypted package to the UICC which decrypts it with its own transport key. Once decrypted the UICC provisions itself according to the configuration data. Steps can represent a legacy process currently used by existing telecommunications operators to program a UICC.

At step the Telco SEI provides the MNO TSM of the Telco remote management function system information relating to the configuration data to enable the MNO TSM to manage content and memory allocation of the UICC . The information provided to the MNO TSM can be any portion of the configuration data useful for managing content and memory of the UICC . In step the MNO TSM can use the information provided in step to manage content and memory allocated to SD containers of the UICC . The MNO TSM can update content and memory allocation in several ways. For example it can modify content remove content or add content. The MNO TSM can also allocate more or less memory to any of the SD containers or remove an SD container if necessary. Such updates can occur as needed in step .

Independent of the MNO TSM s role a TEE service provider SP can generate a second package encrypted with a TEE key for delivery to the communication device . Alternatively the TEE Management Function can generate the second package encrypted with the TEE key. The second package can include a trusted application to be executed by the communication device which for example may have been purchased by the subscriber of the communication device . The TEE SP or TEE Management Function can also check that the communication device and UICC are capable of executing the trusted application before the second package is transmitted. This can be accomplished by way of a database lookup to determine available resources of the communication device and UICC . The second encrypted package can be further encrypted by the OTA system in step with a transport key and transmitted to the TEE function of the communication device which may operate outside of the UICC . The TEE function can decrypt the second package with the transport key and the TEE key. In step the TEE SP or TEE Management Function can provide the MNO TSM information relating to the transaction such as the addition of content details about the content etc. to enable the MNO TSM to continue managing content and memory allocation of the UICC.

The MNO TSM discussed in the foregoing embodiments can perform a central function of managing content and memory allocation of the UICC . The MNO TSM can serve a role of consolidating all actions of any system whether managed by the same service provider or unaffiliated service providers.

Referring to the telecommunications system as depicted in such system can be managed in part according to method shown in . Method can begin with step in which a mobile wallet trusted manager system MW TSM receives a request from a service provider payment system to add remove or update a mobile wallet service of the UICC . This step can represent for example adding removing or updating a credit card account service bank account service or other suitable payment mechanism of a user which is managed by way of the UICC .

At step the MW TSM can verify that the UICC and the communication device are capable of satisfying the request. In one embodiment step can represent a validation that the communication device and UICC have the computing resources and encryption technology to perform the requested task. Step can be performed by the MW TSM by retrieving information from a local or remote database that maintains records descriptive of resources available for communication devices and their corresponding UICC s a log of mobile wallet SD containers in use and so on. In another embodiment step can result in the MW TSM communicating with the MNO TSM to inquire about content and memory allocated to the UICC as an additional or alternate validation process for determining whether the request can be satisfied.

Once the MW TSM validates that the communication device and UICC can satisfy the request the MW TSM proceeds to step where it generates a script encrypted with an application key and instructs an MW OTA system to transmit the encrypted script. At step the MW OTA system generates an encrypted package with the transport key that includes the encrypted script and transport data. The MW OTA system transmits in step the encrypted package to the communication device . The communication device then conveys the encrypted script at step to the UICC for processing the mobile wallet script in a mobile wallet SD container.

At step the MW TSM provides the MNO TSM information relating to the script and or the MW SD container to enable the MNO TSM to further manage content and memory allocation of the UICC at step . As in the method of the MNO TSM manages content and memory of the UICC as updates are detected in step . For instance the MW TSM can be called on to provision the UICC with additional MW SD containers. In this instance steps through would be invoked and the MNO TSM at step would be informed of these updates and would use the additional information provided by the MW TSM to continue to management memory and content of the UICC . Additionally updates to the communication device can also occur which can cause additional updates to be conveyed to the MNO TSM . For example if a new trusted application is generated by the TEE SP or TEE Management Function causing the execution of steps through the MNO TSM detects the update in step and updates its records to continue managing content and memory allocated to the SD containers of the UICC . As before the MNO TSM can be a central authority for managing content and memory allocated to the UICC and in some instances the communication device as third party providers make updates to the UICC or the communication device . The MNO TSM can at all add or reduce memory allocated to any of the SD containers and or remove SD containers if necessary to maintain a balanced use of resources of the UICC .

Referring to the telecommunications system as depicted in such system can further be managed in part according to method shown in . Method can begin with step where the SM DP receives a request from an MNO to modify a UICC . This step can represent a transfer of service from one MNO to another MNO or the instantiation of new service with an MNO for a communication device that has yet to be brought into service. At step the SM DP generates a first package with configuration data to satisfy the request generated by the MNO . The first package is encrypted by the SM DP with an application key. In step the SM DP transmits the first encrypted package to an SM SR system of a first service provider SM SR SP1 . The SM SR SP 1 sends the OTA system of the same service provider OTA SP1 a second package including the first encrypted package and transport data. At step the OTA SP1 encrypts the second package with a transport key and transmits it to communication device for provisioning the UICC . Although the communication device is shown to use an embedded UICC method is also applicable to removable UICCs. The communication device then delivers at step the second encrypted package to the UICC which it decrypts with the transport and application keys for provisioning the UICC . At step the SM SR SP1 provides the MNO TSM of the same service provider MNO TSM SP1 information relating to the configuration data used to provision the UICC to enable in step the MNO TSM SP1 to manage content and memory allocation of the UICC .

It should be noted that SM SR SP1 and the MNO TSM SP1 can be integrated in a common system such as the remote management function system of the first service provider. Similarly the TEE management system of the first service provider TEE SP1 can also be integrated in the remote management function system . The remote management function system can comprise a number of servers operating cooperatively and managed exclusively by the first service provider.

Referring back to as UICC updates occur the MNO TSM SP1 is informed at step of such updates to continuing manage content and memory allocated to the UICC . As before the MNO TSM SP1 can increase or decrease memory allocated to SD containers of the UICC or remove one or more SD containers.

Once the UICC has been provisioned at step the MNO system of the other service provider can further provision the UICC by way of an MNO OTA system of the other service provider. In one embodiment the first service provider may have arrangements with other service providers to delegate management of UICC s when subscribers switch MNO s. If the first service provider determines at step that a subscriber has switched to another service provider which has a pre arrangement with the first service provider then the MNO TSM SP1 can delegate content and memory management of the UICC to an MNO TSM of the other service provider MNO TSM SP2 not shown in . The delegation can be performed by the MNO TSM SP1 transmitting to the MNO TSM SP2 sufficient information to enable the MNO TSM SP2 to manage content and memory of the UICC from where the MNO TSM SP1 left off. Once the transfer is complete the MNO TSM SP2 can begin managing content and memory allocated to the UICC . Delegation between MNO TSM s of managing content and memory of UICC s can be performed multiple times subscribers switch between MNO s.

To perform the above features each of the one or more instances of the communication device can comprise a wireline and or wireless transceiver herein transceiver a user interface UI a power supply a location receiver a motion sensor an orientation sensor a universal integrated circuit card UICC and a controller for managing operations thereof.

The touch screen display can be equipped with capacitive resistive or other forms of sensing technology to detect how much surface area of a user s finger has been placed on a portion of the touch screen display. This sensing information can be used to control the manipulation of the GUI elements or other functions of the user interface. The display can be an integral part of the housing assembly of the communication device or an independent device communicatively coupled thereto by a tethered wireline interface such as a cable or a wireless interface.

The audio system can further include a microphone for receiving audible signals of an end user. The audio system can also be used for voice recognition applications. The UI can further include an image sensor such as a charged coupled device CCD camera for capturing still or moving images.

The power supply can utilize common power management technologies such as replaceable and rechargeable batteries supply regulation technologies and or charging system technologies for supplying energy to the components of the communication device to facilitate long range or short range portable applications. Alternatively or in combination the charging system can utilize external power sources such as DC power supplied over a physical interface such as a USB port or other suitable tethering technologies.

The location receiver can utilize location technology such as a global positioning system GPS receiver capable of assisted GPS for identifying a location of the communication device based on signals generated by a constellation of GPS satellites which can be used for facilitating location services such as navigation. The motion sensor can utilize motion sensing technology such as an accelerometer a gyroscope or other suitable motion sensing technology to detect motion of the communication device in three dimensional space. The orientation sensor can utilize orientation sensing technology such as a magnetometer to detect the orientation of the communication device north south west and east as well as combined orientations in degrees minutes or other suitable orientation metrics . The UICC can be a removable UICC or embedded UICC. The UICC can have its own computing resources such as a microprocessor memory and an input output communication interface enabling it to be communicatively coupled to the controller of the communication device. The UICC can execute a subscriber identity module application a universal subscriber identity module or an internet protocol multimedia services identity module application for managing communications between the communication device and wireless base stations of a cellular communications network.
