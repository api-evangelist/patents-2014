title: Associating user interactions across multiple applications on a client device
abstract: An online system transmits third-party content originating from a third-party system to a client device. The third-party content includes a pointer to a third-party application associated with the third-party system. When the client device receives an interaction with the third-party content from a user of the client device, the client device executes the third-party application and generates an attribution identifier from which the user's identity cannot be determined. The attribution identifier is transmitted to the online system. Subsequently, the client device determines information describing interactions by the user with the third-party application that is transmitted to the third-party system along with the attribution identifier. The third-party system transmits the attribution identifier and the information describing interaction with the third-party application to the online system, which matches the attribution identifiers to associate the interaction with the third-party content with the interactions with the third-party application.

This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 990 338 filed May 8 2014 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A social networking system or an online system allows its users to connect to and communicate with other social networking system users. Users may create profiles on a social networking system that are tied to their identities and include information about the users such as interests and demographic information. The users may be individuals or entities such as corporations or charities. Because of the increasing popularity of social networking systems and the increasing amount of user specific information maintained by social networking systems a social networking system provides an ideal forum for advertisers to increase awareness about products or services by presenting advertisements to social networking system users.

Users of a social networking system or other online system increasingly use mobile devices such as smartphones or tablet computers to access the social networking system or other online system. Typically an application executing on the mobile device exchanges information with the social networking system or online system to provide the user with content. However applications are conventionally associated with specific online systems so a user frequently accesses multiple applications to retrieve content from various online systems or other sources. Because accessing multiple applications to access different content is time consuming users may infrequently interact with certain applications causing the user to overlook highly relevant or interesting content presented by infrequently accessed applications.

An online system such as a social networking system facilitates communication e.g. sharing content from sources external to the online system among users of client devices such as mobile devices. The online system may deliver content e.g. social network content images video audio other media advertisements to users of the online system through an application that executes on a client device. The content may include a pointer specifying a third party application executing on the client device where the pointer identifies content for presentation by the third party application. When a user interacts with content including such a pointer the client device launches the third party application which presents the content identified by the pointer. If the third party application specified by the pointer is not installed on the user s client device the user may be prompted to install the third party application specified by the pointer.

When the user interacts with content including the pointer specifying the third party application via an application executing on the client device and associated with the online system the application associated with the online system communicates information about the interaction to the online system generates an attribution identifier associated with the interaction with the content including the pointer and stores the attribution identifier in a storage of the client device that is capable of being accessed by multiple applications executing on the client device. The identity of the user interacting with the content including the pointer cannot be ascertained from the attribution identifier. The application associated with the online system communicates the attribution identifier and other information related to the interaction with the third party application to the online system.

The third party application specified by the identifier executes and displays the content identified by the pointer in the content from the online system with which the user interacted. Additionally the third party application generates an execution identifier corresponding to execution of the third party application. This execution identifier may serve as a temporary user identifier for a user who has not created an account with a third party system associated with the third party application or who has not logged into their account with the third party system associated with the third party application. As the user interacts with the third party application the third party application stores information describing user interactions with the third party application e.g. presentation of content to the user a registration process to create an account on the third party application associates the user interactions with the third party application with the generated execution identifier and communicates these interactions to the third party system associated with the third party application. In some embodiments the third party system sends the attribution identifier and the information describing user interactions with the third party application associated with the execution identifier to the online system which identifies the user based on the execution identifier and associates the interactions with the third party application with information associated with the user by the online system.

The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.

The client device is one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input displaying content and transmitting and or receiving data via a network . In one embodiment the client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. Alternatively or additionally the client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. The client device is configured to communicate via the network .

In one embodiment the client device executes the client application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the online system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the online system via the network . The client device also executes a third party application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the third party system . The client device may interact with the online system or the third party system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

Besides the client application and the third party application the client device includes a shared storage accessible by multiple applications such as the client application and the third party application executing on the client device . In one embodiment the shared storage allows an application to temporarily or permanently store data for later access by the application or by one or more additional applications. For example the client application stores data e.g. numerical data a string of data in the shared storage and the third party application retrieves the stored data. The shared storage may be implemented as a queue a stack an array or any other suitable data structure and may optionally include constraints on quantities of data stored or the duration for which data is stored in the shared storage .

The online system facilitates communication including sharing of content among users. For example the online system is a social networking system. The online system includes information describing users of the online system such as characteristics provided to the online system by users as part of a user profile. The online system may deliver content such as media e.g. images video audio animations or social network content e.g. posts stories status updates media advertisements to users of the online system through the client application . By interacting with the client application users may view or interact with content from the online system or communicate content to the online system . In one embodiment content provided by the online system includes a pointer identifying the third party application . A pointer includes a reference such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL a file address or location a Uniform Resource Name URN . The pointer may also identify a location of third party content maintained by the third party system or a location from which the client device may download the third party application .

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with mobile device or with the online system which is further described in conjunction with . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing the third party application or communicating data to the client device for use by the third party application . In other embodiments a third party system provides third party content or other information for presentation via the client device . A third party website may also communicate information to the online system such as advertisements third party content or information about the third party application . The third party application provides an interface for a user to upload content to the third party system or to access or interact with content maintained by the third party system . Example third party applications provide functionality for media sharing media capture media editing through user friendly effects messaging social networking organization email scheduling event planning playing or retrieving music news distribution accessing sports content e commerce travel navigation and reviewing restaurants. Third party content includes any content pertaining to the functionality of third party system and may include additional content such as advertisements received by the third party system or advertisements for the third party system or third party application .

The client devices are configured to communicate via a network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

The online system sends the third party content including the pointer to the client application executing on the client device for presentation to a user of the online system . For example the online system selects the third party content including the pointer for presentation to the user and may send additional content for presentation along with the third party content including the pointer or the user of the client device requests the third party content including the pointer from the online system . The client application presents the third party content including the pointer and receives an interaction with the third party content including the pointer. For example the user requests to view the third party content using the third party application . As another example the user requests to view additional third party content associated with the same entity as the third party content including the pointer.

In response to the received interaction with the third party content including the pointer the client application identifies the third party application from the pointer and sends an instruction to the third party application to launch the third party application . In one embodiment the third party application retrieves the third party content from the third party system for presentation to the user. In addition to communicating an instruction to the third party application to execute the third party application the client application generates an attribution identifier corresponding to the received interaction with the third party content. The attribution identifier is generated through a process that is not reversible to obtain the identity of the user. For example the attribution identifier is generated using a hash of an identifier associated with the client device . The client application sends the attribution identifier along with a record of the received interaction to the online system and stores the attribution identifier in the shared storage of the client device .

After the third party application receives the instruction from the client application the third party application retrieves the attribution identifier from the shared storage . The third party application also logs information describing the user s interactions with the third party application . For example the third party application records additional content items that the user views through the third party application . The third party application sends the attribution identifier along with information describing interactions by the user with the third party application to the third party system .

The third party system receives the attribution identifier and the information describing interactions with the third party application and sends the attribution identifier and the information describing interactions with the third party application to the online system . The online system determines whether the attribution identifier received from the third party system matches the attribution identifier received from the client application . If the attribution identifier received from the third party system matches the attribution identifier received from the client application the online system associates the interaction received along with the attribution identifier from the client application with the information describing interactions with the third party application received from the third party system along with the attribution identifier received from the third party system . Hence the online system uses attribution identifiers received from the client application and received from the third party system to associate interactions received via the client application with subsequent interaction received via the third party application .

Each user of the online system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the online system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding social networking system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the social networking system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the online system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the online system for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the online system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the online system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the online system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from mobile applications or third party applications separate from the online system . Objects received from a third party system or from a third party application are referred to herein as third party content. In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence online system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the online system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the online system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the online system to track user actions on the online system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the online system . Users may interact with various objects on the online system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links and checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the online system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the online system as well as with other applications operating on the online system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the online system . These actions may include interactions with a third party application executing on a client device and associated with the third party system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of an online system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the online system . Because users of the online system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the online system to the online system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

The action logger may also associate interactions with a third party application with a user profile maintained by the online system . While a third party system may be unable to identify a user profile maintained by the online system that is associated with interactions received by the third party application the third party system may communicate data to the online system that allows the online system to infer the user profile maintained by the online system maintained associated with the interactions received by the third party application associated with the third party system . In one embodiment the online system receives an attribution identifier from a client application when a user performs an interaction with the client application causing the client application to communicate an instruction to the third party application that launches the third party application . Along with the attribution identifier the client application reports the interaction causing creation of the attribution identifier. As described above in conjunction with the attribution identifier is generated through a process that is not reversible to determine the identity of the user from the attribution identifier alone. The third party application communicates the attribution identifier to the third party system which subsequently sends the attribution identifier and information describing interactions with the third party application associated with the third party system to the online system . For example the information describing interactions with the third party application identify content viewed through the third party application and time spent accessing the third party application . The action logger associates information describing interactions with the third party application received from the third party system along with an attribution identifier matching an attribution identifier received from the client application and associates the information describing the interactions with the third party application with a user profile associated with a user corresponding to the attribution identifier received from the client application . In addition to matching attribution identifiers the action logger may perform additional actions to associate interactions with the third party application with a user profile in the online system e.g. account for times when an attribution identifier was received from the client application and when an attribution identifier was received from a third party system when comparing the attribution identifiers .

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the online system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the online system such as expressing interest in a page on the online system sharing a link with other users of the online system and commenting on posts made by other users of the online system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the online system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the online system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s interest for an object a topic or another user in the online system based on the actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 Now U.S. Pat. No. 9 070 141 Issued Jun. 30 2015 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 Now U.S. Pat. No. 9 317 812 Issued Apr. 19 2016 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

In one embodiment the online system identifies stories likely to be of interest to a user through a newsfeed presented to the user. A story presented to a user describes an action taken by an additional user connected to the user and identifies the additional user. In some embodiments a story describing an action performed by a user may be accessible to users not connected to the user that performed the action. The newsfeed manager may generate stories for presentation to a user based on information in the action log and in the edge store or may select candidate stories included in content store . A story may incorporate third party content received from a third party system . In some embodiments a story incorporating third party content may include an explicit indication that content included in the story originated in the third party system or that that content in the story is associated with a third party application . A story including content associated with a third party application or including content received from a third party system may also include a pointer to the third party application allowing a user of the online system to view the content associated with the third party application or received from the third party system via the third party application . One or more of the candidate stories are selected and presented to a user by the newsfeed manager .

For example the newsfeed manager receives a request to present one or more stories to an online system user. The newsfeed manager accesses one or more of the user profile store the content store the action log and the edge store to retrieve information about the identified user. For example stories or other data associated with users connected to the identified user are retrieved. The retrieved stories or other data are analyzed by the newsfeed manager to identify content likely to be relevant to the identified user. For example stories associated with users not connected to the identified user or stories associated with users for which the identified user has less than a threshold affinity are discarded as candidate stories. Based on various criteria the newsfeed manager selects one or more of the candidate stories for presentation to the identified user.

In various embodiments the newsfeed manager presents stories to a user through a newsfeed including a plurality of stories selected for presentation to the user. The newsfeed may include a limited number of stories or may include a complete set of candidate stories. The number of stories included in a newsfeed may be determined in part by a user preference included in the user profile store . The newsfeed manager may also determine the order in which selected stories are presented via the newsfeed. For example the newsfeed manager determines that a user has a highest affinity for a specific user and increases the number of stories in the newsfeed associated with the specific user or modifies the positions in the newsfeed where stories associated with the specific user are presented.

The newsfeed manager may also account for actions by a user indicating a preference for types of stories and selects stories having the same or similar types for inclusion in the newsfeed. Additionally the newsfeed manager may analyze stories received by online system from various users to obtain information about user preferences or actions from the analyzed stories. This information may be used to refine subsequent selection of stories for newsfeeds presented to various users.

The authorization server enforces one or more privacy settings of the users of the online system . A privacy setting of a user determines how particular information associated with a user can be shared and may be stored in the user profile of a user in the user profile store or stored in the authorization server and associated with a user profile. In one embodiment a privacy setting specifies particular information associated with a user and identifies the entity or entities with whom the specified information may be shared. Examples of entities with which information can be shared may include other users applications third party systems or any entity that can potentially access the information. Examples of information that can be shared by a user include user profile information like profile photo phone numbers associated with the user user s connections actions taken by the user such as adding a connection changing user profile information and the like.

The privacy setting specification may be provided at different levels of granularity. In one embodiment a privacy setting may identify specific information to be shared with other users. For example the privacy setting identifies a work phone number or a specific set of related information such as personal information including profile photo home phone number and status. Alternatively the privacy setting may apply to all the information associated with the user. Specification of the set of entities that can access particular information may also be specified at various levels of granularity. Various sets of entities with which information can be shared may include for example all users connected to the user a set of users connected to the user additional users connected to users connected to the user all applications all third party systems specific third party systems or all external systems.

One embodiment uses an enumeration of entities to specify the entities allowed to access identified information or to identify types of information presented to different entities. For example the user may specify types of actions that are communicated to other users or communicated to a specified group of users. Alternatively the user may specify types of actions or other information that is not published or presented to other users.

The authorization server includes logic to determine if certain information associated with a user can be accessed by a user s friends third party system and or other applications and entities. For example a third party system that attempts to access a user s comment about a uniform resource locator URL associated with the third party system must get authorization from the authorization server to access information associated with the user. Based on the user s privacy settings the authorization server determines if another user a third party system an application or another entity is allowed to access information associated with the user including information about actions taken by the user. For example the authorization server uses a user s privacy setting to determine if the user s comment about a URL associated with the third party system can be presented to the third party system or can be presented to another user. This enables a user s privacy setting to specify which other users or other entities are allowed to receive data about the user s actions or other data associated with the user.

In some embodiments the authorization server may include user permissions regulating association of a user profile associated with a user and maintained by the online system with interactions with a third party application . These user permissions may be used to determine whether to associate information describing user interactions with a third party application with a user profile associated with a user of the online system . Additionally these user permissions allow a user to specify an extent to which information in a user profile associated with a user may be used to personalize one or more interfaces of a third party application associated with one or more interactions that are associated with the user s user profile maintained by the online system .

The web server links the online system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the online system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native mobile device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

An online system receives third party content originating from a third party system that includes a pointer to a third party application associated with the third party system . A user associated with the third party system creates the third party content or the third party system may generate the third party content. For example the third party content includes an image and a pointer to the third party application allowing the image to be viewed using the third party application . The third party content may also include a unique identifier of the third party content in the third party system or other suitable information for retrieving the third party content from the third party system . The online system may assign its own unique identifier to the third party content or use the identifier of the third party content in the third party system .

The online system transmits the third party content to a client device for presentation in a client application associated with the online system . In one embodiment the online system incorporates the third party content into a story generated by the online system including the third party content and the pointer to the third party application . For example the online system selects the story for inclusion in a newsfeed for a user based on affinity between the user and the story containing the third party content. For example the user has a high affinity for the story if the user has a high affinity for a user identified by the story or if the user has given positive feedback to the online system for previously presented stories including content similar to the third party content. In some embodiments the online system modifies the user s affinity for a story including the third party content if the third party system compensates the online system for presenting the story or if the third party content was received within a threshold time interval from a current time by the online system . Alternatively or additionally to using affinity the online system uses one or more deterministic rules specified by a user s preferences to filter stories for presentation to the user based on characteristics of stories. Example characteristics of stories used for filtering include a user identified by a story a user generating a story a type of third party content included in a story a source of content included in a story e.g. the third party system a source application e.g. the third party application of the third party content included in a story or a location associated with the third party content. Alternatively or additionally to the online system selecting the third party content for presentation to a user of the client device the user may request to view the third party content. For example the user of the client device requests to view content associated with a specified user associated with the third party content.

The client application executing on the client device presents the third party content that the client device receives from the online system . If the user of the client device interacts with the third party content presented by the client application the online system obtains an attribution identifier and a record of an interaction with the third party content via the client application . The record of the interaction describes the interaction with the third party content. An example record of the interaction includes the third party content or an identifier of the third party content an identifier of the client device an identifier of a user profile associated with the client application a time of the interaction or other suitable information. In various embodiments the record of the interaction includes one or more of an identifier of the client device an identifier of the client application an identifier of an operating system of the client device or an identifier of another software or hardware component of the client device . The record of the interaction data may also indicate a state of the client device such as an indication of whether the third party application identified by the pointer included in the third party content is installed on the client device .

The online system receives the attribution identifier from the client application in response to the interaction which causes the client device to launch the third party application identified by the pointer included in the third party content. In one embodiment the client device generates the attribution identifier through a hash function that maps an input to an output. The hash function uses data describing the interaction as an input and deterministically generates an attribution identifier from the input so that the original input may not be determined in a deterministic or computationally feasible manner. To ensure that the identity of the user performing the interaction cannot be determined from the attribution identifier the client device may use a cryptographic hash function in some embodiments. Alternatively or additionally to using a hash function the client device may randomly generate the attribution identifier. The attribution identifier may include additional data to associate the attribution identifier with the client application . For example the attribution identifier includes a standard prefix or postfix. Alternatively to receiving the attribution identifier the online system receives interaction data describing the interaction with the third party content from the client device generates an attribution identifier through a hash of the interaction data and transmits the generated attribution identifier to the client device .

Subsequently the online system receives an attribution identifier from the third party system as well as information describing interactions with the third party application associated with the third party system . The third party system receives the attribution identifier and the information describing interactions from the third party application . In one embodiment the information describing interactions with the third party system are associated with an execution identifier generated by the third party application . The execution identifier identifies interactions corresponding to execution or launch of the third party application from the client application . For users that do not register or log in with the third party system the execution identifier may act as a temporary user identifier. The online system may receive the attribution identifier from the third party system in real time e.g. before the third party content is retrieved by the third party application as actions are logged in the third party application or as a batch process e.g. periodically or in response to receiving information describing interactions and associated identifiers .

The information describing interactions with the third party application may specify attributes of interactions with the third party content e.g. duration of an interaction a description of actions performed in response to an interaction . Example interactions with the third party application include navigation commands to view different portions of text or images navigation commands though audio or video data or social interactions such as comments or actions indicating approval or disapproval. Interactions described by the information may also include interactions with other third party content. In one embodiment the third party application presents the user with a registration interface prior to presenting the third party content or the third party content is the registration interface. In this case the described interactions described include interactions with the registration process and the description of the interactions indicates progress through fields of the registration interface e.g. time spent on different fields or views of the registration interface successful submissions irregular or incorrect submissions interactions with preview content accessible without registering . The information describing interactions with the third party application may include metrics associated with interactions with the third party application . An example metric is time spent accessing the third party application or a number of interactions with third party content. Another example metric is revenue associated with advertisements with which the user interacts. In one embodiment the attribution identifier obtained from the client device and or the attribution identifier received from the third party system do not include a user identifier used by the online system or used by the third party system to protect user privacy.

The online system determines whether the attribution identifier obtained from the client device matches the attribution identifier received from the third party system . The online system applies attribution rules to the attribution identifier obtained from the client device and the attribution identifier received from the third party system as well as the information describing interactions with the third party application as part of an attribution model. In one embodiment the online system matches the attribution identifier received from the third party system with the attribution identifier obtained from the client device . If the attribution identifier received from the third party system matches the attribution identifier obtained from the client device the online system associates interactions with the third party application received from the third party system with a user profile associated with the attribution identifier obtained from the client device .

The attribution model infers that user interactions with the third party application that are associated with the attribution identifier received from the third party system correspond to the interaction with the content including the pointer to the third party content via the client application . If the user interacts with content including pointers to third party content multiple times via the client application then the online system receives information describing various interactions with the third party application each associated with a different attribution identifier corresponding to an execution of the third party application . The attribution model provides rules for matching an execution of the third party application by interacting with content including a pointer to the third party application via the client application to corresponding information describing interaction with the third party application . One example rule matches information describing interaction with a third party application with an attribution identifier obtained from the client device in response to an interaction with the third party content including the pointer received within a threshold time interval from receipt from the third party system of the attribution identifier and information describing interaction with the third party application . Other example attribution rules associate information describing interaction with a third party application with each attribution identifier obtained from the client device from interaction with different third party content within a threshold period of time before receipt of the information describing interaction with the third party application .

The online system associates the information describing interaction with the third party application with the interaction with the client application in response to determining that the attribution identifier obtained from the client device matches the attribution identifier received from the third party application . The online system may further associate the information describing interaction with the third party application with a user profile of the user maintained by the online system . In one embodiment matching information describing interaction with the third party application to interaction with the client application provides better metrics for evaluating effectiveness of advertisements included in content. For example advertisers pay an amount to the online system for an advertisement impression by a user a higher amount for an interaction with an advertisement that causes execution of the third party application and a still higher amount for an interaction with an advertisement that causes valuable actions in the third party application e.g. engaging in a commercial transaction registering for a user account with the third party system or otherwise interacting with third party content . Associating user interactions with the client application and with the third party application also increases understanding of how pointers to third party content affect usage of the online system . For example this association data may indicate whether revenue gains from offering advertisements with links to a third party application are offset by revenue losses from less time spent interacting with the online system .

In one embodiment associating interactions with a third party application with one or more interactions with the client application may enhance user experience with the third party application . For example if the user does not have a user account with the third party system the third party application presents the user with a preconfigured profile created by the third party application based on the user profile maintained by the online system for the user. As another example the third party application personalizes a registration interface using content likely to appeal to a user based on information associated with the user by the online system e.g. content based on the user s interests publicly available content associated with user profiles of users that are connected to the user in the online system . In another example third party content is personalized for the user based on its user profile maintained by the online system even if the user is not logged into an account maintained by the third party system for the user. Hence associating the user s interaction with the third party application with the user profile in the online system allows personalization of advertisements or recommendations presented to a user via the third party system even if the third party system does not maintain an account for the user.

The client device presents the third party content through the client application . For example the client application retrieves media from the online system or from the third party system using a pointer in the third party content. For example the third party content is a low resolution or a partially obscured image with accompanying text explaining that the full high quality image may be viewed in the third party application . The third party content may also include a graphical or textual indication that the third party content originated in the third party system . In one embodiment the client device determines whether the third party application is installed on the client device and displays an indication of whether selection of the indication would open the third party application or would initiate a download of the third party application .

The client device receives an interaction with the third party content presented through a client application executing on the client device . Examples of an interaction with the third party content include selection of the third party content to expand a preview of the third party content within the client application or selection of a graphical representation of the pointer to the third party content. An interaction may be an interaction with a graphical indication that the third party content originated in the third party system or an interaction with information identifying a user of the third party system authoring the third party content. Additional examples of interaction with the third party content include presenting the third party content to the user of client device i.e. an impression of the content or selecting a pointer to install the third party application if it is not installed on the client device .

The client device obtains an attribution identifier corresponding to the client application and the third party content. In one embodiment the client application captures data e.g. an identifier of the third party content an identifier describing the interaction with the third party content an identifier associated with the user by the online system describing the received interaction and generates the attribution identifier e.g. with a hash function . The client device stores the generated attribution identifier in the shared storage . In an alternative embodiment the client application transmits the data describing the interaction with the third party content to the online system which generates an attribution identifier. The client device receives the generated attribution identifier from the online system and stores the generated attribution identifier in the shared storage .

The client device transmits the attribution identifier and a description of the received interaction with the third party content via the client application to the online system . The client application may transmit the description of the interaction and one or more identifiers associated with the interaction e.g. a client device identifier an identifier of the user performing the interaction etc. substantially in real time after receiving the interaction. Alternatively the client device transmits the attribution identifier and the description of the received interaction periodically or in response to a condition closing terminating or minimizing the third party application or the client application . In an alternative embodiment where the online system generates the attribution identifier the attribution identifier is not sent to the online system which stores the attribution identifier after generation.

The client device executes the third party application in response to receiving the interaction with the third party content through the client application . In one embodiment when the third party application is executed the third party application operates in a particular state based on information in the pointer included in the third party content. For example the third party application is executed to present a state displaying the third party content or a state displaying content related to a user associated with the third party content. For example based on information in the pointer the third party application retrieves the third party content from the third party system and presents the third party content when it is executed . Executing the third party application may include prompting the user to register with or log in to the third party system by providing user data in one or more fields presented by the third party application .

Executing the third party application may comprise installing the third party application on the client device . For example the client device determines whether the third party application is installed on the client device or whether at least a threshold version of the third party application is installed to warrant updating the third party application to a more recent version . In response to determining that the third party application is not installed on the client device the client device prompts the user to download the third party application after receiving the interaction with the third party content presented by the client application . To install the third party application the client device retrieves the third party application from the third party system or from a different entity e.g. a server hosting available applications for purchase or free download and installs the third party application . After installation the client device presents the third party content in the third party application or the user is prompted to register or log in to the third party system .

Based on the pointer to the third party content the third party application retrieves the third party content from the third party system or from any other suitable source and presents the third party content. The third party content may include elements that were presented in the third party content presented by the client application . For example the third party content is a higher quality version of an image presented as third party content by the client application . In one embodiment the third party content may be a registration interface for creating an account with the third party system or for otherwise initializing user interaction with the third party system .

The client device determines information describing interaction with the third party application by the user of the client device . For example the third party application captures data identifying a user interaction with the third party content identifying a user interaction with additional third party content or identifying user interaction with an advertisement. Example interactions with content via the third party application include impressions of content or an amount of time the client device spends presenting content via third party application e.g. visually or aurally . If the third party application presents the user with a registration or log in process the third party application determines information describing interactions with the registration such as data entered and cumulative progress through the registration process. The client device may alternatively or additionally determine metrics e.g. number of interactions time of interactions associated revenue corresponding to interactions with the third party application .

In one embodiment the third party application retrieves the attribution identifier from the shared storage and generates an execution identifier which identifies the execution of the third party application and is associated with interactions with the third party application after execution of the third party application . For example a user closes the third party application re executes the client application and again selects the pointer to the third party application . In this example the third party application executes again retrieves another attribution identifier form the shared storage and generates another execution identifier to associate with subsequent interactions of the user with the third party application . The execution identifier may be generated using various deterministic or random techniques. For example the execution identifier is generated by applying a hash function to input describing interaction with the client application . In one embodiment the third party application applies a hash function to the attribution identifier retrieved from the shared storage or to other available information e.g. a device identifier an identifier of the user in the third party system . Interactions with the third party application are associated with the generated execution identifier.

The client device transmits the information describing interaction with the third party application to the third party system in association with the attribution identifier. The client device may transmit additional information to the third party system such as the generated execution identifier the device identifier a third party content identifier a third party user identifier or other information associated with execution of the third party application . The information describing interaction with the third party application and the attribution identifier may be transmitted in real time as the user interacts with the third party application may be transmitted at periodic intervals or may be transmitted in response to one or more interactions e.g. closing terminating or minimizing the third party application .

In one embodiment the third party application uses different user interfaces to present the third party content depending on whether the user selects third party content that is publicly available or private third party content that another user has elected to make available to the user. In this embodiment corresponds to publicly available third party content and corresponds to privately available third party content accessible by the user interacting with the client application . In a thumbnail image of the third party content is displayed as part of a user profile page of the user that posted the third party content . This user profile page includes descriptive information about the user that posted the third party content and other third party content uploaded by the user that posed the third party content .
