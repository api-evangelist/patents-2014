title: Using polling results as discrete metrics for content quality prediction model
abstract: A social networking system presents content items to users, who then provide feedback regarding pairs of content items. The feedback includes a selection of a content item of the pair of content items that was preferred by the user over the other content item. The social networking system uses this information to train a predictive model that scores content items based on quality. The content items may be advertisements. The social networking system uses the pair-wise comparisons of the advertisements to determine feedback coefficients in an advertising quality score prediction model using regression analysis of the pair-wise comparisons for each predictive factor in the model. In this way, the pair-wise comparisons are used to train the prediction model to understand which advertisements are more enjoyable than others. A feedback coefficient for each predictive factor may be computed based on the preferences received from the group of users.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 082 396 filed Apr. 7 2011. The contents of this application are incorporated herein by reference.

This invention relates generally to social networking and in particular to training a content quality metric prediction model using polling results.

Online advertising has quickly become a major channel through which advertisers market their products and services. Traditional performance metrics are used primarily to determine the effectiveness of advertisements measured for example by click through and conversion rates. These traditional performance metrics do not evaluate the quality of an advertisement including the content of the advertisement. Hence the question of whether users actually enjoyed an advertisement remains unanswered by these performance metrics.

One problem of measuring and predicting the quality of advertising stems from the inherently subjective nature of audiovisual content and people s reactions to it. This is illustrated by the example of a music competition in which three judges rate on a scale from 1 to 10 the performance of a singer without being able to judge the singer s visual performance. In this hypothetical the judges are tasked with quantitatively scoring the singer based on the singer s vocal ability and musical performance. Each of the judges may arrive at different scores due to their relative scoring biases. One judge may be very generous in the scoring and only delineate between singers on a much smaller scale than another judge who may be very harsh in his scoring. Regardless an absolute winner of the competition is eventually determined by normalizing the scores. But the judges scores are only applicable to the specific singers in the competition not all singers in the world.

Similar to the singing competition hypothetical advertising models have relied on the effectiveness of an advertisement such as asking a focus group how likely they are to buy the product mentioned in the advertisement in the next 6 months on a scale of 1 to 5. Advertisers and publishers have no way to determine based on the data gathered which advertisements are of higher quality and which advertisements are of lower quality. Based on the data gathered advertisers may only extrapolate on a small sample size the subjective opinions of focus group members. Advertisers rely on the focus groups to determine if the advertisement will be effective not whether the people in the focus groups actually enjoyed the advertisement.

Attractive advertisements tend to increase engagement with the advertiser s brand leading to more user traffic on the publisher s website and an increase in the overall advertisement fees collected by the online services. Social networking systems have also enabled advertisers to let users share interesting advertisements with their connections on the social networking system creating viral advertising. This word of mouth advertising is difficult to generate because advertisers and publishers do not have an accurate sense of what advertisements are enjoyable and consequently more likely to go viral.

To take advantage of the millions of users that use social networking systems advertisers need better metrics on the content of their advertisements. Publishers of advertisements have not created tools or techniques for advertisers to receive feedback on the quality of their advertisements with respect to the user experience of the content within the advertisements. Tools and methods are needed to address this problem of determining a discrete measurement of content quality.

Embodiments of the invention relate to predicting a quality metric for content based on user polling. A social networking system presents content items to users who then provide feedback regarding pairs of content items. The feedback includes a selection of a content item of the pair of content items that was preferred by the user over the other content item. The social networking system uses this user feedback information to train a predictive model that scores content items based on a prediction of the perceived quality of the content items to a user.

In one embodiment the content items are advertisements that are provided by advertisers. The social networking system uses the pair wise comparisons of the advertisements to determine feedback coefficients in an advertising quality score prediction model using regression analysis of the pair wise comparisons for each predictive factor in the model. In this way the pair wise comparisons are used to train the prediction model to understand which advertisements are more enjoyable than others.

In one embodiment a feedback coefficient for each predictive factor is computed based on the preferences received from the group of users. The feedback coefficient is computed by estimating the feedback response from similar users based on a statistical model. The statistical model may take into account the feedback received from the group of users.

In one embodiment the social networking system generates a content item in response to receiving a request for the content item from a particular user. The content item may be embedded with the selected advertisements and then sent to the particular user. The content item may also include one or more graphical user elements e.g. icons symbols a string of characters or any visual elements or any combination thereof for receiving the feedback response about the selected advertisements from the user.

In one embodiment feedback coefficients for predictive factors in the model are computed by logistical regression analysis. A quality score for a content item is calculated using a formula that combines feedback coefficients multiplied by the probabilities that a user feedback event is likely to occur along with other probability values generated by other processes. For example positive or negative feedback probabilities may be generated by other processes based on feedback received from users. The feedback probabilities represent the users expected interest in the advertisement. The feedback coefficients represent the weight given to the value of the advertisement to the social networking system. The combination of the feedback coefficients multiplied by the feedback probabilities may be linear and non linear. In one embodiment quality scores may be computed for content items such as advertisements for ranking purposes in presenting the content items to users of the social networking system.

A social networking system offers its users the ability to communicate and interact with other users of the social networking system. Users join the social networking system and add connections to a number of other users to whom they desire to be connected. Users of social networking system can provide information about them and this information is stored as user profiles for the users. For example users can provide their age gender geographical location education history employment history and the like. The information provided by users may be used by the social networking system to direct information to the user. For example the social networking system may recommend social groups events and potential friends to a user. The social networking system may also use user profile information to direct content items such as advertisements to the user ensuring that only relevant advertisements are directed to the user. Relevant advertisements ensure that advertising spending reaches their intended audiences rather than wasting shrinking resources on users that are likely to ignore the advertisement. Similarly relevant content items enhance the user experience on the social networking system enabling a user to view more interesting and relevant content items.

After a content item such as an advertisement has been presented to a user of a social networking system a user may choose to mark that advertisement as misleading offensive uninteresting repetitive or otherwise not relevant. The selection of an X on the advertisement provides user feedback to the social networking system for millions of advertisements that are served to users. Using this user feedback feedback probabilities may be generated to estimate the likelihood that a user may mark an advertisement as misleading offensive uninteresting or otherwise not relevant. Similarly users may select an X on all content items on the social networking system to remove that content item from the stream of content items being displayed to the user. Such a selection of an X on a content item indicates the user s disapproving preference about that content item. Conversely a content item may be expressly liked meaning that the user has selected a link that indicates the user s approving preference about the content item. A user may also impliedly signify approval of a content item by interacting with it such as re sharing the content item or commenting on it. A feedback probability estimating the likelihood that a user may click on an advertisement may also be generated using the user s past history in clicking on advertisements or particular interest in the topic of the advertisement such as a pop music concert.

For advertisements as with other types of content items users may be more or less likely to share the advertisement with their friends and connections on the social networking system. Recording the history of a user s sharing patterns including the type of content item such as an advertisement for an upcoming Britney Spears show the social networking system can generate a probability value for a user that the user will share a newly presented advertisement. These probability values and feedback probabilities may be obtained and then used to determine overall quality scores for users as described for example in U.S. application Ser. No. 12 611 874 entitled User Feedback Based Selection and Prioritizing of Online Advertisements filed on Nov. 3 2009 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

As used herein feedback coefficients are numerical values that indicate objective measurements of quality for the feedback probabilities and other probability values that may be combined to generate an overall quality score. Quality scores may be generated for content items for the purpose of ranking highly relevant content items for users of a social networking system. Quality scores may also be calculated for advertisements to rank advertisements that will be shown to users that are of higher quality higher relevance and or higher value to the social networking system and the advertisers e.g. since higher quality advertisements encourage engagement with the social networking system .

Pair wise comparison objects are used by a polling analysis module to quantify the objective quality of polling content objects . The polling analysis module uses regression models to generate feedback coefficients that are stored as feedback coefficient objects . Additionally user profile objects associated with each user of the social networking system are used by the polling analysis module in order to generate a quality score for polling content objects and published content objects that are submitted by publishing users such as advertisers using the content publisher module .

Returning to the above example polled user had a preference of a Pepsi ad over a Gum ad as illustrated by . Polled user presented with polling content objects and preferred a Britney ad over a Democrats ad as stored in the pair wise comparison object . Polled user disfavored a Target ad polling content object over a Giants ad polling content object as stored in the pair wise comparison object . It is noted that polling content objects need not be regular advertising banners but may also include interactive games videos fan pages heavy involvement in a group dedicated to a brand and so on in one embodiment.

In another embodiment pair wise comparisons may be captured by analyzing declared interests in user profile objects in conjunction with the frequency of interaction with those interests. For example if a user declares an interest in Cher and Britney but only shares content items that are related to Britney the polling module may infer that the user has a preference of Britney over Cher and store that preference as a pair wise comparison object . In yet another embodiment a polling module uses such information about users from user profile objects to select polling content objects that are relevant to polled users . Then pair wise comparison objects may be generated after a polled user explicitly chooses one polling content object over another.

A content presentation module may use the quality metric or score generated by the polling analysis module in adjudicating the over quality and therefore potential revenue generator of a published content object for ranking and targeting purposes. Targeted users receive published content objects from the content presentation module as part of the user experience in the social networking system . In one embodiment the content presentation module targets advertisements published content objects to targeted users using the quality score generated by the polling analysis module . In another embodiment the content presentation module targets other content items such as links photos video and applications that are stored as published content objects and to targeted users as ranked by the quality score assigned by the polling analysis module . Ranking and targeting content items based on the quality score increases the likelihood that users will remain engaged on the social networking system as well as the likelihood that users will share the high quality content items with their connections on the social networking system . Higher engagement with the social networking system as well as higher engagement with advertisements benefits both advertisers and administrators of the social networking system because the advertising dollars have more efficiency in brand penetration impressions and other measurable marketing metrics.

The client devices comprise one or more computing devices that can receive user input and can transmit and receive data via the network . In one embodiment the client device is a conventional computer system executing for example a Microsoft Windows compatible operating system OS Apple OS X and or a Linux distribution. In another embodiment the client device can be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA mobile telephone smart phone etc. The client device is configured to communicate via network . The client device can execute an application for example a browser application that allows a user of the client device to interact with the social networking system . In another embodiment the client device interacts with the social networking system through an application programming interface API that runs on the native operating system of the client device such as iOS 4 and ANDROID.

In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. Thus the network can include links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Similarly the networking protocols used on the network can include multiprotocol label switching MPLS the transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP the User Datagram Protocol UDP the hypertext transport protocol HTTP the simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and the file transfer protocol FTP . The data exchanged over the network can be represented using technologies and or formats including the hypertext markup language HTML and the extensible markup language XML . In addition all or some of links can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer SSL transport layer security TLS and Internet Protocol security IPsec .

User account information and other related information for a user are stored in the user profile store . The user profile information stored in user profile store describes the users of the social networking system including biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. The user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with identification information of users of the social networking system displayed in an image. A user profile store maintains profile information about users of the social networking system such as age gender interests geographic location email addresses credit card information and other personalized information. The user profile store also maintains references to the actions stored in the action log and performed on objects in the content store .

The web server links the social networking system via the network to one or more client devices the web server serves web pages as well as other web related content such as Java Flash XML and so forth. The web server may provide the functionality of receiving and routing messages between the social networking system and the client devices for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text and SMS short message service messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. The user can send a request to the web server to upload information for example images or videos that are stored in the published content store . Additionally the web server may provide API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as iOS ANDROID webOS and RIM.

The action logger is capable of receiving communications from the web server about user actions on and or off the social networking system . The action logger populates an action log with information about user actions to track them. Such actions may include for example adding a connection to the other user sending a message to the other user uploading an image reading a message from the other user viewing content associated with the other user attending an event posted by another user among others. In addition a number of actions described in connection with other objects are directed at particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well. The polling module may in one embodiment use the information in the action log as recorded by the action logger to generate pair wise comparison objects from the frequency of interaction with a certain keyword topic or interest. In one embodiment the polling module in one embodiment may use information gathered from external websites via the web server over the network in order to generate pair wise comparison objects stored in the pair wise comparison store measuring the interaction clicks on external websites. For example a user who visits the external website for GAP gap.com one hundred times a month may have a strong brand affinity for GAP. Contrastingly if that user only visits CNN.com once a month a pair wise comparison object may be generated by the polling module to indicate that the user prefers content on the external websites for GAP over CNN.

Pair wise comparison objects are generated by the polling module and are stored in the pair wise comparison store in the social networking system . Polling content objects are stored in the polling content store and published content objects are stored in the published content store . Feedback coefficient objects generated by the polling analysis module are stored in the feedback coefficient store .

The content presentation module may provide published content objects stored in the published content store to client devices and or external websites via the web server over the network . The content publisher module may receive content items from an external website or client devices over the network via the web server .

An external data gathering module interfaces with external websites to gather information about users of the social networking system . External websites may be used by the polling module to poll a user regarding a pair of advertisements for example. Information gathered from the external websites by the external data gathering module would be used by the polling analysis module in generating a pair wise comparison object in one embodiment. Additionally an external data gathering module may in one embodiment use the action logger in recording the actions of users on external websites and synthesizing a pair wise comparison object based on the actions such as purchasing a pair of Puma shoes or clicking on an advertisement hosted on an external website for a new Mini Cooper. In another embodiment third parties may help aggregate such information about users of a social networking system that indicates preferences between different types of advertising based on the actions of the users. As a result the generation of pair wise comparison objects can be outsourced in one embodiment.

A pair wise comparison analysis module develops regression models and identifies predictive factors that surface as a result of gathering pair wise comparison information. For example suppose that a polled user chooses an advertisement for Britney s upcoming concert tour over an advertisement for The Strokes s new album and similar users to the polled user also overwhelmingly choose Britney advertisements over advertisements for Mariah Carey s newest music video. The pair wise comparison analysis module using the feedback coefficient generating module recognizes predictive factors that indicate a higher feedback coefficient value. In this example the similarity of users such as demographics location and interests was a predictive factor in how the similar users preferred the Britney advertisements over other music advertisements. Using regression analysis for that predictive factor a feedback coefficient value can be generated using the feedback coefficient generating module .

The feedback coefficient generating module uses regression models to estimate feedback coefficients for a probability value in a quality score formula on the social networking system . Each predictive factor including the feedback probabilities and other probabilities has a separate regression model. The predictive factors in one embodiment include the probability that a user will mark the advertisement as uninteresting repetitive offensive or otherwise irrelevant probability that the user will click on the advertisement probability that the advertisement is a social advertisement and probability that the user will share the advertisement with his or her connections on the social networking system. Predictive factors may be added or removed at the discretion of the administrators of the social networking system .

The regression model for each predictive factor assigns a feedback coefficient value to each of the predictive factors based on the pair wise comparisons received from the polled users. A logistic regression can be used to calculate the feedback coefficient value for each of the predictive factors. In one embodiment the feedback coefficient values are customized according to each user of the social networking system. In such an embodiment the feedback coefficient value varies depending on the individual user. In another embodiment the feedback coefficient values for the predictive factors are held constant based on the regression analysis of the pair wise comparisons received from the polled users. A machine learning module may also be used to finalize the feedback coefficient values in the feedback coefficient generating module .

A quality prediction module determines a quality score that indicates how engaged a specific user may be with a particular content item such as an advertisement. The quality score of an advertisement for a specific user would be a combination of the feedback coefficient values multiplied by their respective probability values associated with the specific user. This combination may in one embodiment be non linear meaning that some probability values may be exponentially larger than others as selected by administrators of the social networking system . The polling analysis module in one embodiment adapts the regression model to include or exclude predictive factors that are determined to be relevant or not relevant in accurately predicting the quality score of content items based on machine learning and heuristics analysis of the targeted users.

At least one predictive factor associated with the preference is identified . The predictive factors may include any signals of information available in the social networking system such as static data e.g. information in a user s profile such as interests social data e.g. information about the user s connections historical data e.g. information about the user s previous interactions with content items and any other information signal that may be helpful in predicting a user s impression of a content item s quality. The identified predictive factors are analyzed using a regression model which is trained using the results of the pair wise comparisons . A feedback coefficient associated with each identified predictive factor is adjusted or otherwise obtained based on this training. In one embodiment an initial feedback coefficient is predetermined by administrators of the social networking system . As more feedback is received from polled users the pair wise comparisons can be incorporated into the feedback coefficients using this process. Finally if other predictive factors associated with the pair wise comparisons have been identified then the process repeats at step . Otherwise the feedback coefficients for the quality metric formulas associated with the pair wise comparison are stored . Once the model is obtained it may then be used to predict other users impressions of the quality of selected content items.
