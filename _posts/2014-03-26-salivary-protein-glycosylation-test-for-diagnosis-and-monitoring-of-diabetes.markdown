This invention was made with Government support under Grant Contract No. R43 DE020973 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in the invention.

Embodiments herein relate to the field of diabetes and more specifically to the diagnosis and monitoring of subjects who have pre diabetes diabetes or diabetic complications.

The elevated glucose levels seen in pre diabetes gestational diabetes and established diabetes can affect protein biomarkers found in biological fluids. For example glycemic control may affect direct non enzymatic protein glycation in which glucose becomes covalently linked to target proteins through the formation of a Schiff base between the aldehyde group of the glucose molecule and the amino group of a lysine residue in a protein. The Schiff base then undergoes an Amadori rearrangement and oxidation to form an advanced glycation end product. One example of an advanced glycation end product is hemoglobin A1c HbA1c . The blood levels of HbA1c represent the average blood glucose BG level over the previous 3 months reflecting the lifespan of the red blood cells that carry hemoglobin.

There are a number of issues that arise with using HbA1c to monitor glucose homeostasis including its inability to reflect shorter term variations in BG significant genetic and non glycemic effects on HbA1c levels and significant age dependent and ethnic variations in the relationship between HbA1c levels and average BG levels. The use of glycated albumin or fructosamine as an alternative offers the advantage of reflecting a shorter response time e.g. representing the average BG level over the previous 2 4 weeks but the effects of the various factors that hamper the utility of HbA1c on the relationship between these glycated proteins and previous BG levels remain problematic.

In order to facilitate review of the various embodiments of this disclosure the following explanations of specific terms are provided 

As used herein the term analyte refers to an atom molecule group of molecules or compound of natural or synthetic origin e.g. aldehydes glycolipids or glycoproteins sought to be detected or measured. Analytes may include but are not limited to aldehydes antibodies drugs hormones antigens haptens glycoproteins glycolipids carbohydrates apoproteins and cofactors.

As used herein the term biological sample refers to any sample obtained from a plant or animal subject. As used herein biological samples include all clinical samples useful for detection of glycosylation profile protein amount or glycosylation pattern of proteins in subjects including but not limited to cells tissues and bodily fluids such as blood derivatives and fractions of blood such as serum extracted galls biopsied or surgically removed tissue including tissues that are for example unfixed frozen fixed in formalin and or embedded in paraffin tears mucus saliva milk skin scrapes surface washings urine sputum sweat semen vaginal secretion fluid from ulcers and or other surface eruptions blisters abscesses and or extracts of tissues cells or organs cerebrospinal fluid prostate fluid pus or bone marrow aspirates. The biological sample may also be a laboratory research sample such as a cell culture supernatant. In particular examples the sample is urine or saliva. The sample may be collected or obtained using methods well known to those skilled in the art.

As used herein the term chemically oxidizing refers to a process that involves deliberately contacting a biological sample such as a saliva sample with a chemical oxidizing reagent. As used herein the term chemically oxidizing excludes naturally occurring oxidizing processes such as those that occur when biological samples are exposed to oxygen such as may be present in ambient air. Rather the term encompasses chemical oxidizing processes resulting from deliberate contact with a solid or liquid oxidizing agent. Generally such chemical oxidation results in all or most of the sialic acid and or fucose in the sample becoming oxidized such as at least 50 at least 70 at least 90 or even more of the sialic acid and or fucose present in the sample becoming oxidized.

As used herein the term detecting refers to quantitatively or qualitatively determining the presence of the analyte s under investigation such as a glycoprotein or an aldehyde.

As used herein the term diabetes mellitus refers to a disease caused by a relative or absolute lack of insulin leading to uncontrolled carbohydrate metabolism commonly simplified to diabetes though diabetes mellitus should not be confused with diabetes insipidus. As used herein diabetes refers to diabetes mellitus unless otherwise indicated. A diabetic condition includes pre diabetes and diabetes. Type 1 diabetes sometimes referred to as insulin dependent diabetes or juvenile onset diabetes is an auto immune disease characterized by destruction of the pancreatic cells that leads to a total or near total lack of insulin. In type 2 diabetes T2DM sometimes referred to as non insulin dependent diabetes or adult onset diabetes the body does not respond to insulin though it is present. As used herein the term metabolic condition is used to refer to type 1 diabetes type 2 diabetes pre diabetes and diabetes complications.

Symptoms of diabetes include excessive thirst polydipsia frequent urination polyuria extreme hunger or constant eating polyphagia unexplained weight loss presence of glucose in the urine glycosuria tiredness or fatigue changes in vision numbness or tingling in the extremities hands feet slow healing wounds or sores and abnormally high frequency of infection. Diabetes may be clinically diagnosed by a fasting plasma glucose FPG concentration of greater than or equal to 7.0 mmol L 126 mg dL or a plasma glucose concentration of greater than or equal to 11.1 mmol L 200 mg dL at about two hours after an oral glucose tolerance test OGTT with a 75 g load. A more detailed description of diabetes may be found in J. B. Wyngaarden et al. eds. W.B. Saunders Co. Philadelphia 1992 19ed. .

As used herein the term glycosylation refers to covalent modification of a biomolecule such as a protein or lipid with one or more oligosaccharide chains. Proteins having at least one oligosaccharide modification are referred to as glycoproteins or glycosylated proteins. In the case of proteins glycosylation is usually N linked or O linked. N linked glycosylation refers to linkage of an oligosaccharide to the side chain amino group of an asparagine residue in a protein. O linked glycosylation refers to linkage of an oligosaccharide to the hydroxyl side chain of a serine threonine or hydroxylysine amino acid in a protein.

The oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins are enormously varied due to the combination of various sugars for example N acetylglucosamine N acetylgalactosamine N acetyllactosamine mannose galactose glucose N acetylneuraminic acid or fucose and the presence of branched structures such as biantennary triantennary or tetra antennary structures .

As used herein the term lateral flow device refers to a device that absorbs or adsorbs a liquid sample routes that liquid sample to a detection zone and uses a detection method to generate a detectable signal in response to the presence or absence of a specific analyte such as a glycoprotein glycolipid or aldehyde . The device may be a test strip used in lateral flow chromatography in which a test sample fluid suspected of containing an analyte flows for example by capillary action through the strip which is frequently made of bibulous materials such as paper nitrocellulose and cellulose . The test fluid and any suspended analyte may flow along the strip to a detection zone in which the analyte if present interacts with a detection agent to indicate a presence absence and or quantity of the analyte. A lateral flow device may produce a test result that is qualitative or quantitative.

Numerous lateral flow analytical devices have been disclosed and include those shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 313 734 4 435 504 4 775 636 4 703 017 4 740 468 4 806 311 4 806 312 4 861 711 4 855 240 4 857 453 4 943 522 4 945 042 4 496 654 5 001 049 5 075 078 5 126 241 5 451 504 5 424 193 5 712 172 6 258 548 6 555 390 6 699 722 and 6 368 876 EP 0810436 and WO 92 12428 WO 94 01775 WO 95 16207 and WO 97 06439 each of which is incorporated by reference.

Many lateral flow devices are one step lateral flow assays in which a biological fluid is placed in a sample area on a bibulous strip though non bibulous materials may be used and rendered bibulous by applying a surfactant to the material and allowed to migrate along the strip until the liquid comes into contact with a chemical reagent or specific binding partner that interacts with an analyte such as an aldehyde glycoprotein or glycolipid in the liquid. Once the analyte interacts with the chemical reagent or specific binding partner a signal such as a fluorescent or otherwise visible dye indicates that the interaction has occurred. Multiple discrete chemical reagents or specific binding partners may be placed on the strip for example in parallel lines to detect multiple analytes in the liquid. The test strips may also incorporate control indicators which provide a signal that the test has adequately been performed even if a positive signal indicating the presence or absence of an analyte is not seen on the strip.

As used herein two solid components are in operable contact or contiguous contact when they are in contact either directly or indirectly in such a manner that an aqueous liquid may flow from one of the two components to the other substantially uninterruptedly by capillarity or otherwise. Direct or contiguous contact means that the two elements are in physical contact such as edge to edge or front to back. When two components are in direct contact they may overlap with an overlap of about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm. However the components may be placed with abutting edges. Indirect contact means that the two elements are not in physical contact but are bridged by one or more conductors. Operable contact may also be referred to as fluid transmitting or fluid continuous contact.

As used herein the term sample application area refers to an area where a fluid sample is introduced to a chromatographic test strip such as a chromatographic test strip present in a lateral flow device. In one example the sample may be introduced to the sample application area by external application as with a dropper or other applicator. In another example the sample application area may be directly immersed in the sample such as when a test strip is dipped into a container holding a sample. In yet another example the sample may be poured or expressed onto the sample application area.

As used herein the terms solid support and substrate refer to any material which is insoluble or may be made insoluble by a subsequent reaction. Numerous and varied solid supports are known to those in the art and include without limitation nitrocellulose the walls of wells of a reaction tray multi well plates test tubes polystyrene beads magnetic beads membranes and microparticles such as latex particles . Any suitable porous material with sufficient porosity to allow access by detector reagents and a suitable surface affinity to immobilize capture reagents e.g. antibodies is contemplated by this term. For example the porous structure of nitrocellulose has excellent absorption and adsorption qualities for a wide variety of reagents for instance capture reagents. Nylon possesses similar characteristics and is also suitable. Microporous structures are useful as are materials with gel structure in the hydrated state.

Further examples of useful solid supports include natural polymeric carbohydrates and their synthetically modified cross linked or substituted derivatives such as agar agarose cross linked alginic acid substituted and cross linked guar gums cellulose esters especially with nitric acid and carboxylic acids mixed cellulose esters and cellulose ethers natural polymers containing nitrogen such as proteins and derivatives including cross linked or modified gelatins natural hydrocarbon polymers such as latex and rubber synthetic polymers which may be prepared with suitably porous structures such as vinyl polymers including polyethylene polypropylene polystyrene polyvinylchloride polyvinylacetate and its partially hydrolyzed derivatives polyacrylamides polymethacrylates copolymers and terpolymers of the above polycondensates such as polyesters polyamides and other polymers such as polyurethanes or polyepoxides porous inorganic materials such as sulfates or carbonates of alkaline earth metals and magnesium including barium sulfate calcium sulfate calcium carbonate silicates of alkali and alkaline earth metals aluminum and magnesium and aluminum or silicon oxides or hydrates such as clays alumina talc kaolin zeolite silica gel glass or glass fibers in some examples these materials may be used as filters with the above polymeric materials and mixtures or copolymers of the above classes such as graft copolymers obtained by initializing polymerization of synthetic polymers on a pre existing natural polymer.

The surface of a solid support may be activated by chemical processes that cause covalent linkage of an agent e.g. a chemical reagent to the support. However any other suitable method may be used for immobilizing an agent e.g. a chemical reagent to a solid support including without limitation ionic interactions hydrophobic interactions covalent interactions and the like. A solid phase may be chosen for its intrinsic ability to attract and immobilize an agent such as a chemical reagent. The factor may include a charged substance that is oppositely charged with respect to for example the chemical reagent. Except as otherwise physically constrained a solid support may be used in any suitable shapes such as films sheets strips or plates or it may be coated onto or bonded or laminated to appropriate inert carriers such as paper glass plastic films or fabrics. As used herein a lateral flow substrate is any solid support or substrate that is useful in a lateral flow device.

As used herein the term subject refers to a living multi cellular vertebrate organisms a category that includes human and non human mammals such as laboratory or veterinary subjects .

Embodiments herein provide methods and tests for diagnosing and or monitoring a metabolic condition such as diabetes in a subject wherein the methods and tests measure salivary glycoproteins. In various embodiments the methods are based on the oxidation of glycoproteins in a sample from the subject such as saliva or urine for example using sodium metaperiodate and then detecting the aldehydes generated during oxidation using a chemical detection method. In various embodiments the method is based on the finding that the specific glycoproteins oxidized in the sample primarily sialic acid and fucose provide an accurate measure of glycemic control when compared to traditional monitoring tools such as HbA1c and fructosamine.

This finding is unexpected because previous studies with lectin binding demonstrated that a five member panel of lectins e.g. lectin Concanavalin A agglutinin lectin and lectin was needed for the most accurate prediction of glycemic status. These lectins bind to sialic acid and fucose but also mannose galactose and N acetylglucosamine. By contrast the methods disclosed herein only require detection of the oxidation products of sialic acid and fucose. An additional advantage of the method is that as a purely chemical detection method it does not rely on lectins or antibodies to bind carbohydrate moieties present on glycoproteins.

HbA1c and fructosamine tests measure direct non enzymatic protein glycation. The presently disclosed methods instead measure proteins that are modified by intracellular glycosylation as opposed to non enzymatic glycation thus avoiding the problems associated with glycation based tests. Hyperglycemia increases the flux of glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway which provides the UDP GlcNAc and GalNAc precursors for the addition of various carbohydrate moieties to proteins through both linked O glycosylation of intracellular proteins as well as linked mucin type O and linked N glycosylation of cell surface and secreted proteins. O glycosylation of intracellular proteins modulates the ability of various cells to respond to insulin and without being bound by theory the levels of secreted mucin type O and N glycosylated proteins may reflect altered cellular metabolism due to hyperglycemia. Additionally without being bound by theory hyperlipidemia may regulate hexosamine biosynthetic pathway activity. Thus the determination of glycoprotein levels in biological fluid represents a more rapid sensitive and inherently physiological response to metabolic control when compared to conventional glycated protein biomarkers.

While virtually all assessments of glycemic status currently employ blood samples there are many instances in which this is not ideal either because of patient age or attitude toward fingersticks or venipuncture or hygiene issues in rural or underdeveloped areas. By contrast saliva has a number of distinct advantages as a diagnostic fluid including being non invasive and being obtainable without special training or equipment and it may be especially advantageous for pediatric or elderly populations and amenable to large scale population studies. Thus the methods disclosed herein employ salivary and in some cases urinary glycoprotein analysis for short term assessment of glycemic control.

Also disclosed in various embodiments are plate assays dipstick tests and lateral flow devices for detecting salivary glycoproteins. In some embodiments the tests may include a two membrane dipstick test for detecting and or quantifying glycosylated salivary proteins in pre oxidized saliva samples. Other embodiments are three membrane lateral flow devices that oxidize the glycoproteins in a salivary sample and then detect the resulting aldehydes.

A total of ten subjects were recruited from a pool of 70 type 2 diabetes patients under care at Nizam s Institute of Medical Sciences Hyderabad India. Clinical characteristics of the subjects are shown in Table 1.

Subjects underwent continuous glucose monitoring CGM using Guardian REAL Time monitors Medtronic Inc. Northridge Calif. for 28 continuous days with weekly study visits for device calibration and sample collection. Subjects course of treatment for diabetes was not altered based on CGM results. The average number of BG measures obtained during the study follow up was 6909 436 mean SD per subject. Subjects were asked not to eat or smoke for at least 8 hours prior to study visits occurring between 8 AM and 9 AM on 1 7 14 21 and 28 days following the baseline visit. Unstimulated saliva samples were collected at every study visit and standard blood draws were performed at baseline and at day 28. In addition clinical parameters including height weight and blood pressure were obtained at baseline and at the final study visit.

Saliva samples were diluted 1 5 in 2 acetic acid pH 4.5. Duplicate 50 L aliquots of diluted sample were added per well of a 96 well Reacti Bind polystyrene plate Thermo Scientific Rockford Ill. followed by 25 L of 10 mM sodium metaperiodate made immediately before use in 2 acetic acid pH 4.5 . The plate was agitated on a rotary shaker for 30 seconds and then covered and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. At the end of the incubation 150 l of AHMT solution 175 mg 4 Amino 3 hydrazino 5 mercapto 1 2 4 triazole in 35 ml 1N NaOH Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. was added. The plate was agitated on a rotary shaker for 30 seconds then covered and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The absorbance at 550 nm was determined using an ELx800 plate reader BioTek Winooski Vt. . Results were normalized by total protein concentration and reported in arbitrary units AU . Blood samples were processed using an AU400e chemical analyzer Olympus Center Valley Pa. for fructosamine quantification and an HLC 723 G8 high performance liquid chromatograph Tosoh Bioscience King of Prussia Pa. for HbA1c measurements.

Baseline characteristics of the subject population were tabulated as well as the 28 day change in relevant clinical parameters. One subject was missing CGM data for days 20 28 and was excluded from all CGM analyses for those days. To quantify glycemic control from the CGM data average BG standard deviation SD of BG and mean amplitude of glycemic excursion MAGE 30 were calculated and matched to 7 14 21 and 28 day study visits. Due to the small sample size analyses were primarily descriptive and included plots of salivary glycosylation measures across time with HbA1c fructosamine average BG BG SD and average MAGE. Pearson s correlation coefficients were computed and plotted for all measures at baseline and days 1 7 14 21 and 28. An exploratory longitudinal repeated measures analysis was conducted to assess the ability of measured salivary glycosylation to predict average BG BG SD and MAGE at 7 14 21 and 28 day intervals and to determine the interval for which salivary glycosylation is most predictive. A secondary analysis on the effect of blood glucose variability on the relationship between average BG with fructosamine and salivary glycosylation was conducted by creating groups of high and low BG variability according to BG SD and correlating average BG with fructosamine and salivary glycosylation separately for each variability group. To maximize the difference in variability between the groups the high and low BG variability groups included four subjects with the highest and lowest variability respectively. Reported p values are two sided. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS software Version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows.

An analysis of salivary glycosylation was undertaken using the methods described above in Examples 1 4 in a series of 10 subjects with type 2 diabetes who had undergone 28 days of CGM in order to ascertain if salivary glycoprotein levels were correlated with relative glycemia. As shown in baseline salivary glycosylation measures were strongly correlated with baseline fructosamine values r 0.65 p 0.06 and moderately correlated with HbA1c r 0.30 p 0.40 . Salivary glycosylation was strongly correlated with fructosamine and moderately correlated with hemoglobin A1c.

Longitudinal values of salivary glycosylation were plotted over time to analyze the range and variability in these subjects . Salivary glycosylation mean SD and range were calculated for each subject and are shown below in Table 2. To measure the relationship between the variability in salivary glycosylation and variability in BG SD salivary glycosylation was correlated with SD BG over all available data and a strong correlation was found between the two measures r 0.56 p 0.12 .

Pearson s correlation coefficients and corresponding p values for correlation of salivary glycosylation measurements with average BG BG SD and MAGE across 7 14 21 and 28 days indicated that the strongest relationship was between salivary glycosylation and average BG over 21 days r 0.56 p 0.23 at day 21 and r 0.42 p 0.26 at day 28 . Results from this analysis are displayed in which illustrate the relationship between salivary glycosylation and average BG BG SD and mean amplitude of glucose excursion MAGE over 21 day periods wherein salivary glycosylation is plotted against 21 day average blood glucose blood glucose standard deviation and MAGE for days 21 and 28 in accordance with various embodiments. The results of an exploratory longitudinal repeated measure analysis confirmed this finding with salivary glycosylation having a significant longitudinal relationship with average BG over 21 days p

CGM measures of glycemic control were correlated with measures of salivary glycosylation fructosamine and HbA1c. illustrate a comparison of 21 day average BG with salivary glycosylation fructosamine and HbA1c wherein the average blood glucose over 21 days is plotted against salivary glycosylation fructosamine and hemoglobin A1c for study day 28 in accordance with various embodiments. As shown in salivary glycosylation measures demonstrated stronger correlation with average BG over 21 days than did HbA1c or fructosamine. There was a strong positive relationship between salivary glycosylation and average blood glucose. Average blood glucose was poorly correlated with fructosamine and hemoglobin A1c. Table 3 provides the Pearson s correlation coefficients for average BG BG SD and MAGE over 21 days with day 28 salivary glycosylation fructosamine and HbA1c. Salivary glycosylation was the strongest predictor of average BG and BG SD compared to fructosamine and HbA1c while fructosamine was the strongest predictor of MAGE.

A sub analysis was performed to determine if the relationship of salivary glycosylation and fructosamine with average BG was mediated by BG variability. Subjects in the low variability group had an average BG SD of 31 mg dL while subjects in the high variability group had a BG SD of 65 mg dL. For subjects in the low variability group fructosamine was a strong predictor r 0.98 of average blood glucose however for the high variability group increases in fructosamine strongly predicted decreases in average BG directly opposite of what would be clinically expected. Salivary glycosylation was a strong predictor of average BG in both the low and high variability group r 0.82 r 0.64 and this was not greatly affected by BG variability. illustrate these relationships. More specifically illustrate a correlation of 21 day average blood glucose and fructosamine by subjects with low and high blood glucose variability wherein the average blood glucose is correlated with fructosamine and salivary glycosylation for individuals with low and high blood glucose variability in accordance with various embodiments. Increased blood glucose variability weakened the relationship of average blood glucose with fructosamine but not with salivary glycosylation in accordance with various embodiments.

In the methods described above sialic acid and fucose are readily oxidized to generate aldehydes and illustrate the two chemical reactions involved in the salivary glycosylation methods described herein the periodate oxidation of vicinal diols that generates aldehydes and the 4 amino 3 hydrazino 5 mercapto 1 2 4 triazole reactivity with aldehydes AHMT which reaction generates a color change for instance that may be detected visually or with a colorimeter.

The array of approaches to determine glycemic control ranges from purely glucose based parameters such as random BG testing routinely employed by individuals with type 1 diabetes and fasting BG and oral glucose tolerance tests to assess impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance in pre diabetes and type 2 diabetes to indices of hyperglycemia induced protein glycation HbA1c fructosamine and glycated albumin and reabsorption of 1 5 anhydroglucitol. Glycemic variability has emerged as a potentially important aspect of monitoring glycemic control that may be more associated with the development of complications such as cardiovascular disease than average BG levels. Although the clinical utility of assessing glycemic variability in routine screening or monitoring remains controversial the effect of glycemic variability on the performance of assays for average BG is important as discussed below. The existing assays for long and short term average glycemia have several disadvantages notably the inability of HbA1c to reflect intrinsic variability in glucose levels in individual patients and discrepancies in the average glucose levels derived from different measurements the so called glycation gap .

Described herein is an alternative parameter of glycemia total protein glycosylation that is driven by cellular metabolism and that is discernible in saliva. Specifically baseline salivary glycosylation measures are strongly correlated with fructosamine r 0.65 a measure of 2 to 4 week glycemic control. Additionally compared to HbA1c and fructosamine salivary glycosylation measures were better predictors of average BG and SD BG over a 21 day interval. Furthermore salivary glycosylation measures exhibited a stronger correlation with measures of glycemic control than fructosamine or HbA1c and in terms of predicting hyperglycemia the accuracy of fructosamine was affected by BG variability while the accuracy of salivary glycosylation was not.

Thus salivary glycosylation is a powerful alternative biomarker for recent hyperglycemia as it has better ability to predict 21 day blood glucose measures than HbA1c or fructosamine. Additionally the ability to use saliva rather than blood constitutes a separate significant advantage for salivary glycosylation. An important use for a non invasive indicator of short term glycemia would be to allow patients on therapy to more conveniently monitor their glycemic control. This may increase the currently low rate of adherence to diabetes medications an increase in which would have the potential for significant healthcare cost savings.

Although the assays described above in Examples 1 6 produce accurate results that correlate well with a 21 day average glucose in some embodiments a dipstick based test may be more desirable for point of care use than a liquid based assay carried out in a microtiter plate. Thus in some embodiments the disclosed methods may be carried out using a dipstick based test. However in various embodiments adapting the plate assay to be used in a dipstick format may be challenging. For example immobilization of AHMT requires the selection of the optimal membrane substrate in all more than 50 different membranes were evaluated and only a few proved adequate the optimal reagent concentration and the optimal reaction time and the stability of the colorimetric result may be difficult to achieve as well. In some embodiments incorporation of periodate and alkali into the membrane may be challenging as well.

In some embodiments a two membrane dipstick test may be used in place of the solid phase assay depicted in . In an exemplary two membrane dipstick test a membrane device is used that includes an AHMT membrane and an alkali membrane. Surprisingly simple aqueous solutions of NaOH do not work when dried on a membrane. However when 80 aqueous Ethanol was used as the solvent for NaOH the resulting membrane greatly improved the reaction speed. The oxidation step is carried out for thirty seconds before application of the sample to the dipstick membranes the sample is added to the membrane and the dipstick is read using a colorimeter after five minutes.

In some embodiments a three membrane dipstick test may be used in place of the solid phase assay depicted in . In an exemplary three membrane dipstick test a membrane device is used that includes an AHMT membrane an alkali membrane and a sodium metaperiodate membrane. Solutions of sodium metaperiodate in acetic acid did not perform well when dried on membranes and sodium metaperiodate in MES buffer pH 5 commonly used for glycoprotein oxidation studies produced unacceptably high background signal in the absence of glycoprotein. However sodium metaperiodate dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 5.5 works well and is stable when dried on VWR 692 glass fiber membrane. are a table and a digital image demonstrating the feasibility of a one step assay.

In contrast with the liquid plate assay described above in Example 6 which requires making a fresh solution of AHMT in NaOH immediately prior to use the two membrane dipstick test circumvents this problem by including two separate membranes separated by a mesh layer one with immobilized AHMT and the other with NaOH. In various embodiments the two membranes cannot make intimate contact with one another or the AHMT will be inactivated. Therefore the mesh separator is used to prevent intimate contact between the membranes.

Whereas the liquid assay requires 60 minutes of incubation with AHMT following periodate oxidation the solid phase assay only requires 5 10 minutes. The initial adduct of aldehyde with AHMT is colorless and only after subsequent oxidation by 02 from air does it turn purple. This process is diffusion limited and the high surface area of the membranes where the AHMT is immobilized facilitates this portion of the reaction.

Additionally the selection of membranes is important. In various embodiments the membranes must be chosen to not react with periodate AHMT or NaOH and they require sufficient porosity to allow flow from one membrane to the other.

In various embodiments the disclosed methods and test devices may be used to determine a glycemic state in a subject for instance diagnosing a metabolic condition such as diabetes pre diabetes or gestational diabetes in a subject or determining a degree of glycemic control in a subject. In some embodiments s saliva sample may be obtained from a subject and subjected to the methods disclosed herein or applied to a test device as disclosed herein such as a lateral flow device. In some embodiments the sample may be oxidized and then applied to a dipstick two membrane test as disclosed herein.

The methods and test devices described herein may produce a quantifiable result that may be assessed visually or with the aid of a colorimetric reading device. Once a result is obtained it may be compared with a standard such as the example shown in . A result that is significantly higher than an established normal reference range may indicate that the subject has diabetes pre diabetes or gestational diabetes.

In some embodiments the disclosed methods and tests may be used to monitor a glycemic state in a subject for instance to establish a baseline degree of glycemic control e.g. a single point measurement that corresponds with an average blood glucose value for the preceding three week period or to monitor changes in glycemic control over time e.g. to determine whether glycemic control has improved or deteriorated over a period of time or in response to a change in therapy . In this example a test result that is higher than a previous test result may indicate worsening glycemic control wherein a test result that is lower than a previous test result may reflect an improvement in glycemic control. In various embodiments the test may be repeated periodically such as every three weeks every six weeks every three months every four months every six months or yearly.
