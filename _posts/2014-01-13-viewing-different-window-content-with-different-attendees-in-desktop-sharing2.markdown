title: Viewing different window content with different attendees in desktop sharing
abstract: A presenter device transmits, to an attendee device participating in an online desktop sharing session, image data of a plurality of windows. The plurality of windows comprises a foreground window obscuring at least a portion of at least one background window. The presenter device captures image data of at least one background window including the obscured portion of the background window without altering the display of the presenter device. A request is received from the attendee device for image data of at least one background window to display the background window over the foreground window on a display of the attendee device. In response to receiving the request, the presenter device transmits the captured image data of the background window, including any obscured portion, to the attendee device.

The present disclosure relates to the display of window content in an online desktop sharing session.

In online web based meetings involving desktop sharing windows displayed on a presenter s device can be shared with a plurality of meeting attendees by simultaneously displaying the image of the windows on the attendees devices. The desktop on the presenter s device is captured as a series of images including all of the visible windows. Typically the image data form the presenter s desktop is transmitted to a meeting server which then distributes the image data to all of the attendee devices. As multiple windows may overlap and obscure each other some portions of the background windows may not be visible unless the presenter brings that window to the foreground.

A presenter device transmits to an attendee device participating in an online desktop sharing session image data of a plurality of windows. The plurality of windows comprises a foreground window obscuring at least a portion of at least one background window. The presenter device captures image data of at least one background window including the obscured portion of the background window without altering the display of the presenter device. A request is received from the attendee device for image data of at least one background window to display the background window over the foreground window on a display of the attendee device. In response to receiving the indication the presenter device transmits the captured image data of the background window including any obscured portion to the attendee device.

Referring to an online conference system is shown that enables a meeting server to facilitate a desktop sharing session in which presenter device shares a computer desktop with attendee devices and over network . Only four attendee devices are shown in but any number of attendee devices may be included in system . Presenter device and attendee devices may take a variety of forms including a desktop computer laptop computer mobile cellular phone tablet computer etc. Network may be any type of network e.g. any combination of Internet intranet local area network LAN wide area network WAN wired network wireless network etc. that connects computing devices e.g. presenter device and attendee devices . Meeting server may be used for example to mediate transactions between presenter device and attendee devices . Server may also perform caching or other time bandwidth saving techniques. It should be understood that in a web based conference system each device may communicate with the server through a browser application having one or more plug ins that enable web based meeting and allow for the transmission of data to the meeting server and the reception of data from the meeting server during a conference meeting session.

Referring to a simplified block diagram of an example device e.g. presenter device or attendee device is shown. For simplicity shows a block diagram of one of the attendee devices generically referred or labeled with reference numeral . The device includes a processor to process instructions relevant to a conference meeting session supported by the system memory to store a variety of data and software instructions e.g. display data for shared documents applications as well software instructions for a browser application to enable the connectivity and display of data during a conference session etc. . The device also includes a network interface unit e.g. card to communicate with other devices over network and a user interface unit to receive input from a user and a display . The display may be used to display the user interface e.g. a desktop with windows and other data associated with functions of the device as well as user interface elements associated with the conference session by way of software for a browser application stored in memory . The user interface unit may be in the form of a keyboard mouse and or a touchscreen user interface integrated with display to allow for a user of the attendee device to interface with the device. Memory may comprise read only memory ROM random access memory RAM magnetic disk storage media devices optical storage media devices flash memory devices electrical optical or other physical tangible e.g. non transitory memory storage devices. The processor is for example a microprocessor or microcontroller that executes instructions for implementing the processes described herein. Thus in general the memory may comprise one or more tangible non transitory computer readable storage media e.g. a memory device encoded with software comprising computer executable instructions and when the software is executed by the processor it is operable to perform the operations described herein. While attendee device and host device will be described as different devices they differ only in their respective roles in the conference session. In general a user device that can be configured to be an attendee device may also be configured to be a host device at different times in the same or different conference sessions.

Typically in desktop sharing sessions attendees are constrained to viewing the windows on the shared desktop in the same z order as the presenter. As used herein the term z order refers to the order of windows in a desktop and determines which window will be visible when the position of two or more windows overlaps. Occasionally an attendee may want to bring a different window to the front of the display and view the desktop windows in a different z order than the presenter. For example an attendee who is helping troubleshoot an issue on the presenter device may want to view a log file in one window while the presenter is talking about the issue in a different window.

In order to enable the functionality described herein presenter device captures image data of the presenter device s desktop and transmits the image data to the attendee devices . The image data is reproduced at the attendee devices allowing the attendees to view the same desktop displayed on the presenter device . The meeting server may function as an intermediary to this transmission of image data. In order to allow obscured windows to be displayed on attendee devices the presenter device captures image data of the background windows. While the description focuses on windows in a desktop sharing session the techniques presented herein may be directed toward other visual aspects of the presenter s desktop such as browser tabs within a window. To capture the image data of the background windows an operating system Application Programming Interface API may be used such as WM PRINT or WM PRINTCLIENT in the Microsoft Windows operating system.

In one example the presenter device may capture image data from all of the windows and continuously transmit updated window images to the meeting server and or the attendee devices . In another example the image data of the background windows may be captured continuously but only transmitted in response to a request by one or more attendee devices. In yet another example the image data for the windows may be captured only in response to a request from one or more attendee device for the image data of that window. The transmission of image data from background windows may begin automatically or be triggered by actions of the presenter or attendees. Additionally the image data may be cached on one or more of the presenter device the meeting server or the attendee devices .

The image data from the background window may be further processed e.g. to add user interface elements or to combine the image of the background window with image data from the rest of the desktop. As part of the processing the position and size of each of the windows may be tracked. In one example the image data of the background windows is processed at the meeting server and or at the presenter device . The image data of background windows may additionally be cached at the meeting server and or the presenter device. The image data of all of the background windows may be captured at the beginning of the desktop sharing session and updated continually. Alternatively the image data of the background windows may not be captured until an attendee device performs an action that requires additional image data from the background windows. Three examples of attendee actions that trigger the need for additional image data are described below with respect to .

Referring now to a screenshot from the display of a presenter device sharing a desktop with a plurality of windows in shown. The desktop displayed on the presenter device includes a foreground window with a title bar and window name . In this example desktop also includes background window with title bar and window name and background window with title bar and window name . In other examples more or fewer background windows may be shared in the sharing session. While desktop is being shared a user interface element is displayed on the presenter device to enable the presenter to control various aspects of the sharing session.

In one example user interface element includes a button that controls the window z order i.e. which window is displayed in front of other windows on the attendee devices in the desktop sharing session. As will be explained below in more detail an attendee device may be configured to display a window z order different from the window z order on the presenter device. In this example button opens to display a list of names of attendee devices e.g. Alice Betty Candy and Debra that are displaying the windows in a different z order than the presenter. In accordance with the techniques presented herein by clicking on a particular attendee device name the presenter can force that attendee device to restore the z order of the windows to match the z order of the presenter device. Additionally the list of names may include an entry that will force all of the attendee devices to match the z order of the windows displayed on the presenter device.

Referring now to another example of a user interface element on the presenter device to control the z order of the windows displayed on attendee devices is shown. In this example user interface element is displayed on the presenter device and shows all of the participants in the desktop sharing session including the presenter e.g. Carolyn and the attendees and e.g. Harold James Elaine and Karen . Each attendee is associated with an element e.g. a button to switch the z order displayed on the attendee device to match the z order displayed on the presenter device. Buttons and may be configured to switch the display of attendee devices and respectively. Additionally in this example user interface element includes a display of which window each attendee device is displaying in the foreground. The name of window displayed in the foreground by attendee devices and are shown at and respectively. In the depicted example Harold s device is displaying the window titled 3.doc James s device is displaying the window titled 1.doc and Elaine s and Karen s devices are both displaying the window titled 2.txt in the foreground. User interface element may show all of the participants in the desktop sharing session or it may only show the attendee devices that are viewing the windows in a different z order. For the example in which element is displaying all of the participants in the desktop sharing session a button to switch the attendee s display may be omitted if a particular attendee device is displaying the windows in the same z order as the presenter device.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows another example of a user interface element that displays which attendee devices are displaying each window in the foreground. In this example windows and are displayed with additional elements and in their respective title bars and . Element shows how many attendee devices are displaying window in the foreground and may be expanded to display a list of the attendee devices e.g. Alice Betty Carrie Elaine and James that are displaying window in the foreground. In this example element shows that only a single attendee device is displaying window in the foreground and displays the name of the attendee device e.g. Harold directly in the title bar .

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows the display of an attendee device with the windows from a shared desktop. An attendee device displays image data provided by the presenter device possibly through the meeting server that reproduces desktop image on the attendee device s display. In this example desktop includes windows and initially in the same z order as the presenter device. Desktop also includes an indication of which desktop e.g. Carolyn s desktop the attendee device is currently displaying as well as a user interface element e.g. button to restore the z order of the windows to match the presenter device. In the initial screenshot shown in window is displayed in the foreground with background windows and partially obscured.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows the display of an attendee device with the windows from a shared desktop with a different window displayed in the foreground. In this example the attendee has indicated e.g. by clicking on the title bar that the attendee device should display window in the foreground. Window is brought to the front partially obscuring windows and . User interface element displays a list of all of the windows shared in the desktop sharing session and allows the attendee to select any window to bring to the foreground. For example in bringing window to the front the title bar of window is completely obscured and element allows the attendee to bring window back to the front without having to move window in order to reveal the title bar of window .

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows the display of an attendee device before and after the attendee has selected a background window to bring to the front. In this example an attendee device displays desktop with windows and . Initially window is in the foreground with windows and in the background partially obscured by window . The attendee then triggers window to come to the foreground without changing the position of any of the windows. The attendee device then displays window in front of windows and while the presenter device does not change the display of the shared windows in its display. In some examples the presenter device may add or modify a user interface element to indicate that the attendee has brought window to the foreground as described with respect to .

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows the display of an attendee device before and after the attendee has moved the position of the foreground window uncovering some of the background window that was previously obscured. In this example window is in the foreground of desktop and windows and are in the background. The attendee moves window uncovering additional portions of the background windows and . In order to enable the attendee device to display desktop with the moved window either the presenter device or the meeting server supplies the attendee device with additional image data captured from the background windows on the presenter device. In one example any windows moved on an attendee device are also moved on the display of the presenter device. This preserves some control of the presenter over what information on the presenter device is displayed on the attendee devices.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows the display of an attendee device before and after the attendee has brought a background window to the front and changed the size and position of the background window. Initially in this example window is in the foreground and windows and are in the background. The attendee brings window to the foreground on the attendee device and moves and resizes the window . The additional image data required to display all of window and any uncovered portions of window are received from either the presenter device or the meeting server. The change in position and size of window are displayed on the presenter device but the change in z order is not directly displayed on the presenter device.

Other user interface elements may be added to inform participants in the desktop sharing session that a particular attendee device has brought a different window to the foreground. In one example a history bar updates every time an attendee device changes the foreground window. The update may include a message that indicates which window the attendee device has brought to the foreground for example Attendee A is viewing window Z now. In another example a notification window may pop up on the bottom of the participants desktop and then disappear in a short time. In yet another example the border of window may flash when any attendee brings that window to the foreground on their respective display.

Additionally any or all of the user interface elements on the attendee device may be allowed or denied by the presenter device. The permissions for each user interface element may be specific to each window in the shared desktop session. In other words the presenter may disable notifications when an attendee device displays one window e.g. enhanced drawings of presentation in the foreground while enabling notifications when an attendee device displays any other type of window. Further the presenter may allow or deny permission for each window to be brought to the front at all. For instance the presenter may block the attendee devices from bringing the presenter s email inbox window to the front and viewing potentially sensitive communications. However the presenter may enable bringing to the foreground a specific email that is open in a separate window which may be specifically relevant to the sharing session.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows an example of a user interface element added to an attendee device s display. In this example a thumbnail showing the presenter s view of the shared desktop is displayed on the attendee device s display. This thumbnail allows the attendee to see information as it is presented by the presenter which helps maintain the context of the sharing session. However the attendee is also free to adjust the view of the attendee device s display so that the attendee can view other information that may be useful.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows another example of a user interface element added to an attendee device s display. In this example user interface element is displayed on the attendee device s display of desktop . User interface element includes a list of the windows that the participants of the sharing session have in the foreground of their respective displays. For the example shown in the list of user interface element includes entry that shows the attendee that the host has the window named Saml.pdf in the foreground and entry that shows the attendee device has the window named VC.exe in the foreground. In another example user interface element may list all of the windows in the shared desktop or only the windows that are in the foreground of one or more attendee devices. Additionally user interface element may allow for an attendee to click on a particular list entry and bring the associated window to the front of the display. This would allow each attendee device to switch to another attendee s view and improve communication efficiency.

Referring now to a simulated screenshot shows an example of a user interface element added to the attendee devices display to highlight the foreground window of the presenter device. In this example the attendee device has brought window to the front and the presenter device s foreground window is displayed as window behind window . To illustrate to the attendee which window the presenter device is currently displaying border is added to window . The attendee may then move and or resize the windows so that none of window is obscured by window as shown in .

Referring now to a flow diagram of an example process for a presenter device capturing and transmitting background window image data is shown. In step the presenter device transmits image data of a plurality of windows in a desktop sharing session. The image data may be directly transmitted to the attendee devices or it may be transmitted to a meeting server which would forward the image data to the attendee devices. In step the presenter device captures image data from the background windows which may be obscured by the foreground windows. The image data of the background windows may be cached either at the presenter device or at the meeting server. If an attendee device requests the background window image data e.g. the attendee device is going to bring a background window to the front of the attendee device as determined at step then the presenter device transmits the captured image data of the background window at step . In another example the presenter device captures the background window image data after the attendee has requested the background window image data to provide updated image data.

Referring now to a flow diagram of an example process for an attendee device bringing a background window to the front is shown. In step the attendee device receives image data of a plurality of windows in a desktop sharing session. The attendee device displays the image data in step . In step the attendee device receives a selection of one of the background windows to bring to the front of the display. In one example the selection of the attendee may be received by the attendee device through a user interface e.g. keyboard mouse click touch interface etc. . In step the attendee device transmits an indication of the selected background window and receives the image data in return at step . In step the attendee device uses the background window image data to display the selected window over the foreground window of the presenter device.

In summary the above examples describe a system and method for allowing attendees in a desktop sharing session to view a different shared document than the presenter or the other attendees. This improves the efficiency of document sharing because an attendee does not have to interrupt the presenter to switch to an obscured document. Additionally an attendee s status is visible to the presenter allowing the presenter to switch to a different shared document that one or more attendees may be discussing. This improves collaboration and communication between desktop sharing participants.

In particular the above examples describe a method comprising transmitting to an attendee device participating in an online desktop sharing session image data of a plurality of windows displayed on a presenter device participating in the online desktop sharing session. The plurality of windows comprises a foreground window obscuring at least a portion of at least one background window. The method further comprises capturing image data of at least one background window including the obscured portion of the background window without altering the display of the presenter device. A request is received from the attendee device for image data of at least one background window to display the background window over the foreground window on a display of the attendee device. In response to receiving the indication the method comprises transmitting the captured image data of the background window including any obscured portion to the attendee device.

Further the above examples describe an attendee device participating in an online desktop sharing session by receiving image data of a plurality of windows displayed on a presenter device. The plurality of windows includes a foreground window obscuring at least a portion of at least one background window. The attendee device displays the plurality of windows on its display. In response to a user input the attendee device receives a selection of one of the background windows to display over the foreground window. The attendee device transmits an indication that the attendee device requires image data of the selected background window to display the selected background window over the foreground window. The attendee device receives image data of the selected background window including any portion that was obscured by the foreground window and displays the image data of the selected background window over the foreground window on the display of the attendee device.

The above description is intended by way of example only. Various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the concepts described herein and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.
