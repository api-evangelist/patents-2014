The present application relates to U.S. Application Ser. No. 61 888 358 filed on Oct. 8 2013 and titled AUTOMATED CAPTION POSITIONING Automated caption positioning provisional application which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The technical field relates generally to transcription of content and more particularly to systems and methods for automated delivery of transcription products.

Media content for example video and audio content is becoming increasingly prevalent as a medium on the internet. Much of this content is time sensitive and transient. For example news and popular culture videos often receive the vast majority of internet accesses in the first few days if not hours after they are posted online. Also some educational materials including video and audio recordings of lectures are posted on the internet and intended to be consumed almost immediately by students.

For the hearing impaired individuals with attention deficits and non native speakers of the language in which the video audio content is recorded this content presents significant challenges. Legislation and regulations often mandate that this content be made accessible to this population of consumers. Typically content providers make available transcripts and captions of this content to assist this population and to more generally e.g. even with non impaired users increase engagement with the online media. Time coded transcriptions of the content also make possible advanced capabilities such as the interactive transcript plugins and archive search plugins provided by 3Play Media of Cambridge Mass. Additionally associating transcripts descriptive summaries and internet search keywords with the media content can increase the chances that the content will be found by search engines such as the GOOGLE search engine.

However given the time sensitive and transient nature of this content making transcripts captions and these related products available in time for them to be of use for this population is difficult and costly. Often associating some form of transcription with the media within hours is desired. This can be accomplished using fully automated means to produce a transcript but it is well known that such automated transcripts are often too replete with errors to be of much use to the target population. This is particularly true when the automation is real time automatic speech recognition ASR since the state of the art of real time ASR is restricted by computational constraints e.g. CPU and memory availability in achieving accuracy. Moreover once real time ASR transcripts have been made publicly available for media it is impractical to modify these using for example confidence thresholds on the ASR quality. In particular since real time ASR systems typically output words phrases or sentences in synchronization with the receipt of the audio these systems are not amenable to automated modification of the output at a later time. Further when real time ASR systems do provide a confidence metric this metric is typically used to modify the visual appearance of the text e.g. by coloring unconfident words or phrases differently than confident regions and not to prevent display of the unconfident sections of the transcript.

Embodiments disclosed herein address the problems described above among other problems by automatically delivering increasingly accurate versions of the transcription products e.g. transcripts captions captions encoded in media files or other products derived from transcripts such as internet search keywords for inclusion with online media. Initially in at least one embodiment transcription products may be provided automatically for the media subject to a configurable quality threshold. Subsequently in this embodiment the transcription products are edited by a human transcriptionist and updated versions of the transcription products are delivered to be included with the media again subject to configurable thresholds on the estimated accuracy of the transcript products.

Still other aspects embodiments and advantages of these exemplary aspects and embodiments are discussed in detail below. Moreover it is to be understood that both the foregoing information and the following detailed description are merely illustrative examples of various aspects and embodiments and are intended to provide an overview or framework for understanding the nature and character of the claimed aspects and embodiments. Any embodiment disclosed herein may be combined with any other embodiment. References to an embodiment an example some embodiments some examples an alternate embodiment various embodiments one embodiment at least one embodiment this and other embodiments or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of such terms herein are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

At least one embodiment disclosed herein includes apparatus and processes for implementing using a computer system a transcription job market. In some embodiments the transcription job market receives transcription request information from customers that identifies media files with encoded audio content that the customers seek to have transcribed. In these embodiments the transcription job market creates and posts jobs associated with the media files.

In other embodiments the transcription job market manages market elements to ensure that jobs are being completed according to schedule and with quality. These market elements may include one or more attributes of one or more jobs. In some embodiments the transcription job market receives information from editors that identifies jobs that the editors seek to complete. In these embodiments the transcription job market further provides tools used by the editors to complete their transcription tasks. These tasks may produce transcriptions that are time coded and transcriptions that lack time coding i.e. are non time coded. 

In some embodiments the transcription request information may include a schedule that specifies a requested due date and time for one or more transcription products derived from the media files identified in the transcription request information. In at least one embodiment the transcription request information includes an ASAP due date and time that indicates the customer seeks progressive delivery of the transcription products. In this embodiment in response to receiving an ASAP due date and time the transcription job market provides multiple versions of the transcription products to the customer as each version becomes available. Each of these versions may have a higher quality level than its previous version. In some embodiments the quality level required prior to delivery of each version may be specified by distinct quality threshold criteria. These quality criteria may be included in the transcription request information or may be specified by configurable parameters of the transcription job market.

In other embodiments the schedule specifies particular status indicators that trigger the creation and delivery of the one or more transcription products. For example the schedule may specify that identified transcription products are to be delivered after the transcription information from which they are derived has been processed by ASR technology has been edited by a human or has been quality checked by a human. Further the schedule may specify that portions of the identified transcription products may be delivered as they become available. For example the schedule may specify that a transcription segment covering the first five minutes of a thirty minute lecture is to be transmitted upon the segment having passed a quality check by a human.

Various embodiments implement a transcription system using one or more computer systems. illustrates one of these embodiments a transcription system . As shown includes a server computer client computers and a customer an editor an administrator networks and and an automatic speech recognition ASR device . The server computer includes several components a customer interface an editor interface a system interface an administrator interface a market engine a market data storage a media file storage and a delivery agent .

As shown in the system interface exchanges i.e. sends or receives media file information with the ASR device . The customer interface exchanges information with the client computer via the network . The editor interface exchanges information with the client computer via the network . The networks and may include any communication network through which computer systems may exchange information. For example the network the network and the network may be a public network such as the internet and may include other public or private networks such as LANs WANs extranets and intranets.

Information within the transcription system including data within the market data storage and the media file storage may be stored in any logical construction capable of holding information on a computer readable medium including among other structures file systems flat files indexed files hierarchical databases relational databases or object oriented databases. The data may be modeled using unique and foreign key relationships and indexes. The unique and foreign key relationships and indexes may be established between the various fields and tables to ensure both data integrity and data interchange performance. In one embodiment the media file storage includes a file system configured to store media files and other transcription system data and acts as a file server for other components of the transcription system. In another embodiment the media file storage includes identifiers for files stored on another computer system configured to serve files to the components of the transcription system.

Information may flow between the components illustrated in or any of the elements components and subsystems disclosed herein using a variety of techniques. Such techniques include for example passing the information over a network using standard protocols such as TCP IP or HTTP passing the information between modules in memory and passing the information by writing to a file database data store or some other non volatile data storage device. In addition pointers or other references to information may be transmitted and received in place of in combination with or in addition to copies of the information. Conversely the information may be exchanged in place of in combination with or in addition to pointers or other references to the information. Other techniques and protocols for communicating information may be used without departing from the scope of the examples and embodiments disclosed herein.

One goal of the transcription system is to receive media files from customers and to provide both final and intermediate transcriptions of the content included in the media files to the customers. One vehicle used by the transcription system to achieve this goal is a transcription job. Within the transcription system transcription jobs are associated with media files and are capable of assuming several states during processing. illustrates an exemplary process during the execution of which a transcription job assumes several different states.

As shown in the process begins when the transcription system receives transcription request information that identifies a media file to transcribe in act . The transcription request information may also include delivery criteria that specifies a schedule e.g. one or more delivery times quality levels or other criteria defining conditions to be satisfied prior to delivery of transcription products. In some embodiments the transcription system receives the transcription request information and the media file via an upload from a customer interface such as the customer interface or as a result of a previously received media file being split per act below. Upon receipt of the transcription request information and the media file the transcription system creates a job associates the job with the media file and sets the job to a new state . In act the transcription system sets the job to an ASR in progress state generates draft transcription information and determines a pay rate for the job. When executing the act some embodiments track completion percentage of the draft transcription during ASR processing. Record of completion percentage is used to execute subsequent delivery processes where ASR processing is not complete due to the schedule or interruption by another delivery request. Further these embodiments compute one or more metrics that characterize the quality of the draft transcription. Draft transcriptions may be full transcriptions or partial transcriptions where ASR processing is not completed . Some embodiments incorporate information descriptive of the completion percentage and quality metrics into the draft transcription information.

In act the transcription system posts the job making the job available for editors to claim and sets the job to an available state . Jobs in the available state correspond to draft transcriptions that have completed ASR processing. As described further below in some embodiments in accord with the transcription system monitors the due dates and times of available jobs and if necessary alters the pay rate or other job characteristics of the available jobs to ensure the available jobs are completed by the due date and time.

In act the transcription system accepts an offer by an editor to claim the job and sets the job to an assigned state . In the illustrated embodiment jobs in the assigned state are not available for claiming by other editors. In act the transcription system determines whether the predicted completion date and time for the job as assigned occurs before the due date and time. If so the transcription system executes act . Otherwise the transcription system executes act .

In the act the transcription system determines whether to revoke the job. If so the transcription system executes the act . Otherwise the transcription system executes the act .

In the act the transcription system records and monitors actual progress in transcribing the media file associated with the job as the progress is being made by editors. Also in the act the transcription system sets the job to an editing in progress state .

In the act the transcription system determines whether the job is progressing according to schedule. If so the transcription system executes act . Otherwise the transcription system executes act .

In the act the transcription system determines whether to split the media file associated with the job into multiple media files. For example the transcription system may split the media file into one segment for any work already completed and into another segment for work yet to be completed. This split may enable the transcription system to further improve the quality on a segment by segment basis. For example a segment which has been edited may be split from other segments so that the edited segment may proceed to quality assurance QA . Thus splitting the media file may enable the transcription system to provide partial but progressive delivery of one or more transcription products to customers. If the transcription system splits the media file the transcription system stores the edited completed segment and executes the act for any segments that include content not completely transcribed. If in the act the transcription system determines to not split the media file the transcription system executes the act .

In the act the transcription system determines whether the content of the media file associated with the job is completely transcribed. If so the transcription system stores the edited complete transcription and sets the state of the job to a complete state and the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system executes the act .

In some embodiments completed transcriptions may be the subject of other jobs such as QA jobs as described further below. Components included within various embodiments of the transcription system and acts performed as part of the process by these components are described further below.

According to various embodiments illustrated by the market engine is configured to both add jobs to the transcription job market provided by the transcription system and to maintain the efficiency of the transcription job market once the market is operational. To achieve these goals in some embodiments the market engine exchanges market information with the customer interface the administrator interface the editor interface the system interface the market data storage the media file storage and the delivery agent . Market information may include any information used to maintain the transcription job market or stored within the market data storage . Specific examples of market information include media file information job information customer information editor information administrator information and transcription request information. Each of these types of information is described further below with reference to .

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to identify unprocessed media files stored in the media file storage . In some of these embodiments the market engine identifies unprocessed media files after receiving an indication of the storage of one or more unprocessed media files from another component such as the customer interface which is described further below. In others of these embodiments the market engine identifies unprocessed media files by periodically executing a query or some other identification process that identifies new unprocessed media files by referencing information stored in the market data storage or the media file storage . In some embodiments the market engine is also configured to send a request for ASR processing of unprocessed media files to the system interface . This request may include information specifying that only a limited portion of the unprocessed media file e.g. a specified time period be processed. Further in at least one embodiment the market engine tracks completion percentage of the draft transcription during subsequent ASR processing. The market engine may store in the market data storage the completion percentage associated with partial transcriptions stored in the media file storage .

In these embodiments the system interface is configured to receive requests for ASR processing and in response to these requests provide the unprocessed media files to the ASR device along with any requested limits on the ASR processing. The ASR device is configured to receive a media file to perform transcoding and automatic speech recognition on the received media file in accord with the request and to respond with draft transcription information that includes a draft time coded or non time coded transcription of the content of the received media file and a predicted cost of editing the draft transcription. This predicted cost referred to herein as the ASR cost is based on information computed as part of the ASR processing and a cost model. The cost model may be a general model or may be associated with the project customer or editor associated with the media file. A project is a set of media files grouped by a customer according to domain due date and time or other media file attribute. Projects are described further below. Cost models predict the cost of editing a draft transcription and are described further with reference to below. The system interface is further configured to receive the draft transcription information store the draft transcription information in the media file storage store the location of the draft transcription information in the market data storage and notify the market engine of the availability of the draft transcription information.

In one example illustrated by the market engine receives an identifier of a newly stored media file from the customer interface . Responsive to receipt of this identifier the market engine provides a request to perform ASR processing on the media file to the system interface . The system interface in turn retrieves the media file from the media file storage and provides the media file along with a set of parameters that indicate appropriate language acoustic cost and formatting models to the ASR device . The ASR device responds with draft transcription information that includes a time coded draft transcription lattices search statistics ASR cost and other associated data. The system interface receives the draft transcription information stores the draft transcription information in the media file storage stores the location of the draft transcription information in the market data storage and notifies the market engine of the availability of the draft transcription information.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to perform a variety of processes in response to receiving a notification that draft transcription information is available. For instance in one example after receiving a notification that draft transcription information is available the market engine notifies the delivery agent that draft transcription information is available by providing the delivery agent with a notification describing the location and status of the draft transcription information. In another example the market engine employs natural language processing techniques to determine the type of content or domain included in the media file associated with the draft transcription information and stores this information in the market data storage . In another example the market engine determines the duration of the content included in the media file and stores the duration in the market data storage . In another example after receiving a notification that draft transcription information is available the market engine determines an initial pay rate for editing the draft transcription included in the draft transcription information and stores job information associated with the draft transcription in the market data storage . In this example the initial pay rate included in the job information is determined using the due date and time difficulty duration domain and ASR cost of the media file associated with the draft transcription information. In other examples other combinations of these factors may be used or these factors may be weighted differently from one another. For instance in one example due date and time and duration may be replaced with times real time. In another example the weight applied to any particular factor may be 0.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to periodically publish or push notifications to editors that indicate the availability of new jobs. In one of these embodiments the market engine tailors these notifications by sending them only to particular editors or groups of editors such as those editors who have permission to edit the jobs. In other embodiments the market engine tailors notifications based on other job characteristics such as the type of job editing QA etc difficult domain or due date and time. In some examples the market engine sends notifications to editors based on their ability to complete jobs having the attribute to which that the notification is tailored. Continuing the previous examples the market engine may send notifications to editors who may assume particular roles editor QA etc. who have a track record of handling difficult jobs who are well versed in a particular domain or who are highly efficient.

In at least one embodiment the market engine notifies editors of near term future job availability based on the upstream workflow. In this embodiment as files are being uploaded by customers and processed by the ASR device the market engine predicts how many more jobs will be available and based on one or more the attributes of these jobs such as duration domain etc. the market engine sends out advanced notice to one or more editors via the editor interface .

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to determine the difficulty of successfully editing the draft transcription and store the difficulty in the market data storage . In these embodiments the market engine may base this determination on a variety of factors. For example in one embodiment the market engine calculates the difficulty using an equation that includes weighted variables for one or more of the following factors the content type domain of the media file the historical difficulty of media files from the customer or the project the draft transcription information and acoustic factors such as noise level signal to noise ratio bandwidth and distortion .

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to create and post jobs corresponding to unedited media files thereby making the jobs available to the editors for claiming and completion. According to one example as part of this processing the market engine stores an association between each job and a media file targeted for work by the job. This action is performed so that factors affecting pay rate such as those described above can be located in a media file table.

As described further below with reference to the editor interface editors claim jobs by indicating their preferences on a user interface provided by the editor interface . After a job is claimed the job is removed from the market so that no other editors can access the job. However until the editor has actually begun to edit the job it is relatively easy for the job to be put back on the market. Typically leaving the original claim in place is preferred. However in some embodiments the market engine is configured to determine whether the editor who claimed the job will be able to complete the job before the due date and time. In these embodiments the market engine is configured to make this determination based on the job characteristics difficulty domain duration etc. and the editor s historical proficiency as stored in the market data storage . For example the editor may be associated with a times real time statistic stored in the market data storage . The times real time statistic measures editor productivity and is calculated by dividing the time it takes for the editor to complete each job by the duration of the media file associated with each job. In some embodiments the market engine is configured to use this statistic to estimate the completion time of the job based on duration multiplied by times real time . In some embodiments the market engine is configured to condition this statistic based on job attributes and thus compute the statistic from similar jobs performed by the editor in the past. The set of historical jobs used to compute the times real time statistic may include all jobs performed by the editor a subset of jobs which have similar attributes to the present job or other combinations of historical jobs including those that were not performed by the editor. The market engine may calculate this statistic as a mean a median a duration weighted mean or using summaries of historical processing times for the editor or other editors for different media file subsets.

In other embodiments if the market engine determines that an editor may be unlikely to complete a job before the due date and time the market engine may reverse the assignment and put the job back on the market thus allowing some number of other editors to claim the job. In some these embodiments the market engine determines the likelihood that the editor will complete the job before its due date and time using one or more of the following factors historical productivity of the editor in general or more specifically when editing media files having a characteristic in common with the media file associated with the job the number of jobs currently claimed by the editor the number of jobs the editor has in progress and the due dates and times of the jobs claimed by the editor. When the market engine reverses an assignment the original editor is informed of this condition via the editor interface . The market engine may or may not allow the original editor to reclaim the job from the market depending on whether data indicates interest of other editors in the job. One example of an indicator of interest is whether the job is being previewed by any other editors. Another factor which may influence this decision is if the total volume of unedited draft transcriptions exceeds a threshold.

In some embodiments the market engine determines a likelihood of completion for each possible combination of editor and job. In these embodiments the market engine may calculate this likelihood using any combination of the factors discussed above historical productivity number of jobs claimed number of jobs in progress due dates and times of claimed jobs etc. . Further in some embodiments the market engine prevents editors from claiming jobs for which the editor s likelihood of completion metric transgresses a threshold. In these embodiments the threshold is a configurable parameter. Further according to these embodiments the market engine may prevent an editor from claiming a job in a variety of ways including rejecting an offer from the editor to claim the job and causing the job to not be display to the editor within the editor interface via for example a meta rule. Meta rules are discussed further below.

In other embodiments if the market engine determines that an editor may be unlikely to complete a job before the due date and time the market engine sends a notification to the editor who claimed the job via the editor interface . The notification may include a variety of information such as a notification that the job may be revoked shortly or including a link to allow the editor to voluntarily release the job.

In several embodiments the market engine is configured to give permission to many editors to edit the same draft transcription and to offer all editors the same pay rate to do so. In some alternative embodiments however the market engine is configured to determine if based on historical information some editors display an increased proficiency with particular types of media files for example in certain domains and to increase the pay rate for these editors when transcribing media files having the particular type. In addition some embodiments of the market engine are configured to adjust the pay rate based on overall editor experience levels as well as the historical productivity of the editors both in general and on the type of media file for which the rate is being set.

In general the market engine sets the pay rate based on the aforementioned factors such as job difficulty required times real time and ASR cost. However to maintain an efficient market in some embodiments the market engine is configured to determine when market conditions suggest intervening actions and to in some cases automatically take those intervening actions. For example when the market is saturated with non difficult jobs an abnormally large amount of unassigned difficult jobs may develop. According to this example to correct the inefficiency in the market the market engine intervenes by increasing the pay rate of difficult jobs or decreasing the pay rate of low difficulty jobs. In still another example the market engine intervenes to increase the pay rate of a job where the proximity of the current date and time and due date and time for the media file associated with the job transgresses a threshold.

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to use the preview functionality as an indicator of job difficulty and appropriate pay rate. For instance in one example the market engine detects that the number of editors that have previewed a job and not claimed it has exceeded a threshold. Alternatively in another example the market engine detects that the total preview duration of an unclaimed job has transgressed a threshold. These phenomena may indicate that the job is more difficult than is reflected by the current pay rate. The market engine may then intervene to increase the pay rate to improve the chance that the job will be claimed or to split the file into segments.

Additionally in some embodiments the market engine monitors the status of and information associated with all jobs available on the market. This information includes difficulty pay rate due date and time domain and summary information such as the number of editors with permission to edit a draft transcription the amount of time a job has been on the market the number of previews of the media file associated with a job and other data concerning the market status of the job and its associated media file. In some embodiments the market engine is configured to use this information to ensure that problem jobs are accepted. For example the market engine may increase the pay rate may enable a larger number of editors to access to the file or may cut the file into shorter segments thus producing several less difficult editing jobs for the same media file.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to under certain conditions hide some of the low difficulty jobs in order to create a more competitive environment or to induce editors to work on difficult jobs. Additionally in some embodiments the market engine is configured to encourage the editors to accept less desirable jobs by bundling jobs together with more desirable jobs. For example the market engine may group a selection of jobs with variable difficulty together so that a single editor would need to claim all of these jobs instead of claiming only low difficulty jobs. Other characteristics that may determine the desirability of a job and which may be used to determine the bundling include customer project domain e.g. interesting content and historical time waiting on the market for the customer project.

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to analyze the overall status of the market prior to modifying job characteristics. For instance in one example the market engine monitors the amount of work available in the market and if the amount transgresses a threshold increases the pay rate for jobs that are within a threshold value of their due dates and times. In other embodiments the market engine is configured to analyze the dynamics of the overall market to determine intervening actions to perform. In one example the market engine measures the rate at which jobs are being accepted and measures the number of jobs or duration of the jobs and estimates the time at which only the least popular jobs will remain in the market. If the market engine determines that this time is sufficiently ahead of the due date and time for these jobs then the market engine may wait before increasing the pay rate.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to set meta rules to affect the behavior of the market. Meta rules globally modify the behavior of the market by affecting how all or some of the available jobs will appear on the market. For instance the market engine may set a meta rule that prevents some percentage of the jobs from being available to any editors for a certain time period. The market engine may use this rule during periods when there is a surplus of work and therefore help to smooth out the flow of files through the system. Or the market engine may set a meta rule to make files available only to relatively inexperienced editors for a certain time period. The market engine may use this rule where many relatively easy jobs are being processed by the market so that the market presents a good opportunity to give less experienced editors more work in learning how to efficiently operate the editing platform. Or the market engine may set a meta rule that automatically send some percentage of jobs to multiple editors for cross validation. Various embodiments may implement a variety of meta rules and embodiments are not limited to a particular meta rule or set of meta rules.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to implement a rewards program to encourage editors to claim difficult jobs. In one embodiment the market engine issues rewards points to editors for completing files and bonus points for completing difficult files. In this embodiment the editor interface is configured to serve a rewards screen via the user interface rendered on the client computer . The rewards screen is configured to receive requests to redeem reward and bonus points for goods and services or access to low difficulty media files.

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to estimate the expected completion time of the editing job and further refine the market clearing processes discussed above. If the market engine determines that the current progress is not sufficient to complete the file on time the editor may be notified of this fact via the editor interface and should the condition persist the market engine is configured to make the job available to other editors i.e. to put the jobs back on the market . In some circumstances the market engine may revoke the entire job from the original editor. In this case the job is put back on the market as if no work had been done. In other cases the market engine may dynamically split the job at the point where the original editor has completed editing creating one or more new jobs that are comprised of the remaining file content. The market engine puts these one or more new jobs on the market and the original editor is paid only for the completed work. In this situation the market engine may notify the delivery agent of the status and location of any completed transcription segments. This functionality enables partial and progressive delivery to the customer of transcription products based on the completed segments as described further below with reference to the delivery agent and the processes it executes.

In some embodiments the market engine is configured to process a delivery request or partial delivery request received from another component such as the customer interface . In these embodiments in response to receiving a delivery request the market engine determines the status and location of the transcription identified in the request and provides a notification including the status and location information the delivery agent . In response to receiving a partial delivery request targeting a media file being processed in a job the market engine dynamically splits the job at the point where the original editor has completed editing and creates one or more new jobs that are comprised of the remaining file content. The market engine puts these one or more new jobs on the market and the original editor is paid only for the completed work. Further in these embodiments the market engine notifies the delivery agent of the status and location of completed segments stored as a result of the job split. It is appreciate that the splitting functionality described herein may apply to any jobs being processed by the transcription system such as QA jobs.

In another embodiment in response to receiving a partial delivery request targeting a media file being processed in a job the market engine stores one or more segments of the transcription up to the point where the editor has completed editing without interrupting the job. In this embodiment the market engine notifies the delivery agent of the status and location of completed segments.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to perform a variety of processes after receiving an indication that a job has been completed. For example if a newly completed draft transcription information was split into segments then the market engine concatenates completed segments together into a completed transcript. In another example the market engine notifies the delivery agent of the location and status of the completed transcript.

In another example the market engine is configured to compare the completed time coded transcript with the draft transcription produced by the ASR device . In this example the market engine uses the number of corrections performed on the transcript to compute a standard distance metric such as the Levenshtein distance. The market engine stores this measurement in the market data storage for later use in determining an objective difficulty for the editing job.

In various embodiments the market engine is configured to use the objective difficulty in a variety of processes. For example in some embodiments the market engine uses the objective difficulty for a set of jobs to adjust the historical times real time statistic for an editor to determine the actual price that the customer pays for the transcription service or as input to the automated difficulty determination process discussed herein.

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to prior to making the completed transcript available to the customer create and post a new job to validate the completed transcription or the completed segments of a transcription. For example in one embodiment the market engine creates and posts a QA job on the same market as the editing jobs. This QA job may target completed transcriptions or a completed segment of a transcription. A subset of editors may be qualified for the QA role and the profiles of this subset may include a QA attribute. These editors would then be permitted to view preview and claim the QA jobs in the market via the editor interface . However the editor of the original transcript would not have permission to QA their own job even if the editor in general is qualified to perform in a QA role. The profiles of some editors may include a QA attribute but lack an editor attribute. These editors would only be permitted to view preview and claim QA jobs.

As the QA jobs normally require much less work than the original editing job in some embodiments the market engine is configured to set the pay rate for the QA jobs at a lower level. However in other embodiments the market engine is configured to monitor and adjust the pay rate for the QA jobs as for the editing jobs with similar factors determining the pay rate including file difficulty the ASR cost the proximity of the file due date and time and the media file duration. Additionally in some embodiments the market engine is configured to use QA specific factors to determine the pay rate for QA jobs. For example in one embodiment the market engine adjusts the pay rate based on the number of flags in the edited transcript the historical proficiency of the original editor the times real time it took to produce the completed transcription and the ASR distance metric for the media file. Flags are set during the editing process and indicate problem content within the edited transcript. For example flags may indicate content that is unclear or that requires additional research to ensure accurate spelling. In some embodiments the flags are standardized to facilitate automatic processing by the components of the transcription system.

After this QA processing is complete in some embodiments the market engine is configured to make the final time coded transcription or its final time coded segments available to the customer who may then download the transcription or transcription segments for his or her own use via the customer interface . In other embodiments after the QA processing is complete the market engine notifies the delivery agent of the status and location of the final time coded transcription or its final time coded segments. The final transcription or its final segments is also maintained in the media file storage for reference and further processing as discussed herein.

In some embodiments to periodically measure editor proficiency the market engine is configured to allow a media file to be edited by multiple editors. For instance in one example the market engine periodically creates several different editing jobs from the same media file and these jobs are claimed and processed by multiple editors. The market engine tracks the underlying media file and does not assign more than one of these jobs to the same editor. After several editors edit the same file the market engine executes a ROVER or similar process to determine intra editor agreement and thereby assign quality scores to individual editors the quality score being proportional to the number of words in the editor s final transcript which have high agreement among the other editors. In addition the market engine may use the ROVER process to produce the final transcript. In this case the market engine may assign different weights to different editors based on the editor characteristics domain or customer expertise historical transcription proficiency etc .

In other embodiments the market engine is configured to build cost models that are used to determine predicted costs for editing draft transcriptions. In some of these embodiments the market engine is configured to generate cost models based on variety of information including historical productivity information such as times real time statistics and ASR distance information. Further in these embodiments the cost models may be specific to particular editors customers or projects. For instance in one example the market engine builds cost models that accept a unique identifier for a media file the ASR information time coded draft transcription lattices search statistics acoustic characteristics for the media file and an indication of an editor customer or project associated with the media file and that return a projected transcription cost that is conditioned on historical productivity associated with the editor customer or project. Once these models are built the market engine stores them in the media file storage .

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to progressively deliver transcription products to customers. When executing according to this configuration the delivery agent exchanges market information with customer interface the market engine the market data storage and the media file storage . Market information may include any information used to maintain the transcription job market or stored within the market data storage . Specific examples of market information include media file information job information customer information editor information administrator information and transcription request information. Each of these types of information is described further below with reference to .

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to receive notifications from other components of the transcription system such as the customer interface and the market engine . These notifications may include transcription request information and may describe the status and location of transcription information corresponding to a media file being processed by the transcription system . In some embodiments in response to receiving these notifications the delivery agent may take one of several actions as specified by previously received parameters and the transcription request information.

For example the delivery agent may create transcription products using the transcription information. These transcription products may include transcriptions e.g. time coded and non time coded captions frames such as those described in the Intelligent Captions application and the Automated caption positioning provisional application captions encoded in media files for example a copy of the media file uploaded to the system and auxiliary deliverables such as search keywords descriptive summarization and other metadata derived either automatically or manually from the transcription information. These auxiliary products may be derived automatically from the transcription at any stage using natural language processing algorithms such as TextRank GRASSHOPPER and maximum entropy modeling. The auxiliary deliverables may be used on web sites to optimize for search engine ranking of the page by for example directly encoding the auxiliary deliverables into the HTML that constitutes the web sites.

As described in the Intelligent Captions application in some embodiments the delivery agent produces caption frames from the transcription information via natural language processes which determine syntactic boundaries for example sentence and paragraph boundaries. The delivery agent may convert caption frames into various caption formats for embedding internet based media players or may include the caption frames directly into a version of the original media file to provide open or closed caption playback for the media file.

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to automatically exchange status information with the client computer . For example in one embodiment the delivery agent may receive transcription request information that includes a status postback URL which is stored in the market data storage in association with the media file. In this embodiment the delivery agent periodically posts an HTTP request to this URL which includes information about the transcription product status. Examples of status information include automatic transcription 25 complete automatic transcription complete editing pass 50 complete QA 75 complete final transcript complete etc. The status information may also include the estimated accuracy of the transcription information at its current stage of processing the estimated completion time of the current stage of processing the estimated delivery time of the final transcription the number of flagged tokens in the current transcription etc. The delivery agent may also exchange status information with the client computer in response to a request to do so transmitted by the client computer .

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to automatically create and transmit transcription products to the client computer . In some of these embodiments when executing according to this configuration the delivery agent identifies transcription products that are ready for transmission via the customer interface in response to receiving transcription request information from the customer interface . This transcription request information may be originally received by the customer interface through an HTTP API and may include information identifying the transcription products and requesting immediate delivery of the transcription products. In others of these embodiments the delivery agent identifies transcription products that are ready for delivery by periodically executing a query or some other identification process that identifies transcription products by referencing information stored in the market data storage or the media file storage . This query may be executed according to one or more configurable parameters stored in the market data storage .

For example the customer s system e.g. client computer may be configured to request a transcription be delivered when a status postback generated by the delivery agent indicates that the editing stage of processing is complete but prior to the QA stage of processing . This request for transcription delivery may be encoded into transcription request information indicating immediate delivery of a transcription. Alternatively the customer s system may be configured to request the transcription when a quality metric e.g. estimated accuracy in the status postback request is above a given quality threshold value. According to this example the delivery agent responds to receipt of the transcription request information by transmitting the requested transcription to the customer s computer.

In another example the delivery agent is configured to compute a quality metric e.g. a confidence level or estimated accuracy for transcriptions as the transcriptions are processed and edited in the transcription system . When executing according to this configuration the delivery agent computes the quality metric using measures derived from the transcoding automatic speech recognition or natural language processes. For example the delivery agent may compute a quality metric using ASR lattice depth acoustic model scores language model scores internal search metrics audio quality measure and metadata associated with the media file such as duration project and customer. In some embodiments the delivery agent determines the quality metric by mapping a confidence level into a range that is indicative of an estimated accuracy for the draft transcription. In at least one embodiment the delivery agent associates quality metrics with sub regions of the draft transcription for example words textual tokens sentences and paragraphs. These quality metrics may be similar to or the same as those used in computation of the ASR cost.

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to use the quality metric to determine whether or not the transcription products are automatically delivered to the customer s system or web page. For example a customer may configure a quality threshold value for the quality metric e.g. through either a configurable parameter in the transcription system or transcription request information . The delivery agent may transmit transcription products derived from a transcription where the quality metric value exceeds a quality threshold value for example 80 estimated accuracy. In other embodiments where quality metric value is computed for sub regions of the transcription the delivery agent may provide only those sub regions whose quality metric values exceed the configured quality threshold value. In at least one embodiment the delivery agent is configured to restrict delivery of sub regions to sub regions of sentence length or greater. Since the transcription products produced from this subsetting process are time coded omission of the lower quality regions would not pose a problem for the experience.

In another embodiment the delivery agent is configured to create and transmit transcription products based on partial transcription information. In some of these embodiments when executing according to this configuration the delivery agent identifies transcription products that are ready for transmission via the customer interface in response to receiving transcription request information from the customer interface . This transcription request information may be originally received by the customer interface through an HTTP API and may include information identifying the transcription products and requesting immediate delivery of portions of the transcription products. In others of these embodiments the delivery agent identifies transcription products that are ready for partial delivery by periodically executing a query or some other identification process that identifies transcription products by referencing information stored in the market data storage or the media file storage . This query may be executed according to one or more configurable parameters stored in the market data storage .

For example in one embodiment the delivery agent is configured to deliver a portion of an automatically generated draft transcription whatever portion of the draft transcription has been completed to the customer system after a specified duration of the audio has been processed. Or the customer system may be configured to request the latest available transcription products after a configurable period of processing time e.g. post initial file delivery has elapsed. In this case the delivery agent is configured to deliver the latest available transcription products to the customer s system since this will have the greatest accuracy. For instance if the editing stage of processing is partially completed the delivery agent delivers to the customer s system a version of the transcription that is partially edited by the human transcriptionist and is otherwise comprised of the automated draft transcription along with other transcription products produced from this partially edited transcription. Similarly if the file were at the time of the customer request in the midst of the QA stage of processing the delivered transcription products would be partially checked and possibly modified by the QA expert and otherwise comprised of or derived from the transcription produced by the human editor.

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to use a quality metric to determine whether or not the transcription products based on a partially processed transcription are automatically created and delivered to the customer s system or web page. For example in the case where a transcription product based on partially edited transcript is requested by the customer system the quality metric threshold value would be applied to the current state of the transcription. In one case where the quality metric is estimated accuracy the value of the estimated accuracy is computed from a weighted sum of the average final editing accuracy e.g. 99 and the estimated accuracy computed from the draft transcription information. In at least one embodiment the delivery agent is configured to weight the editing accuracy proportionally to the percentage of the transcript which had been edited and weight the estimated accuracy proportionally to the remaining percentage Estimated Accuracy Percent Editing Completed 0.99 1 Percent Editing Completed Estimated Automated Accuracy 

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to modify the Estimated Accuracy described above by the actual accuracy determined by the edits that have been completed. For example if the Estimated Accuracy is 82 but the observed accuracy computed for example by a Levenshtein distance between the edited transcription and the draft transcription for the edited portion only was 85 the delivery agent would increase the Estimated Accuracy to 85 or to a value somewhere between 82 and 85 in proportion to the Percent Editing Completed factor. In some embodiments the delivery agent computes a similar calculation on the transcription during the QA stage of the processing where the average editing accuracy is interpolated with the average QA accuracy e.g. 99.6 again according to how much of the transcript has been processed by QA e.g. a Percent QA completed factor at the time of the delivery request.

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to evaluate a distinct accuracy threshold for each potential delivery. For example the threshold might increase as the final file deadline approaches so that a less accurate transcription may be acceptable earlier in the process whereas the most accurate transcription would be required at the deadline.

In some embodiments the delivery agent is configured to automatically transmit transcription products by embedding the transcription products directly onto a web page for example by modifying plugin HTML code to point to the updated resource URL or executing an HTTP API to modify the web page HTML code. In other embodiments the delivery agent is configured to transmit the transcription products to an FTP folder specified in the transcription request information or a configurable parameter.

While the delivery agent is illustrated as a component distinct from the market engine in it is appreciated that the delivery agent may be incorporated into the market engine according to some embodiments. In addition processes executed by the delivery agent according to various embodiments are described further below with reference to .

In some embodiments customers may be given access to the transcripts for final editing via the customer interface . In these embodiments the market engine uses the customer edits as the gold standard reference for computing editor accuracy. In other embodiments the market engine is configured to use times real time stored in the market data storage at the time of job upload as a factor in determining editor proficiency. Typically the market engine also adjusts the editing time and thus the historical editing productivity for editors by an objective difficulty such as the ASR distance because more difficult files will necessarily take longer to edit.

In some embodiments the customer interface is configured to provide a user interface to the customer via the network and the client computer . For instance in one embodiment the customer interface is configured to serve a browser based user interface to the customer that is rendered by a web browser running on the client computer . In this embodiment the customer interface exchanges customer and media file information with the customer via this user interface. Media file information may include one or more media files or information descriptive of the attributes of one or more media files. Specific examples of media file information include a media file to be transcribed a type of content included in a media file a date and time a transcription of a media file is due a domain of the subject matter presented in the content a unique identifier of a media file and storage location of a media file. Media file information is described further below with reference to .

According to an example illustrated by the customer interface receives media file information from the user interface. This media file information includes a media file and information indicating a date and time that transcription of the media file is due and a type of content included in the media file. Responsive to receipt of this media file information the customer interface stores the media files in the media file storage and stores a unique identifier of the media file the due date and time and the content type in the market data storage .

According to an example illustrated by the customer interface receives media file information from the user interface. This media file information includes a media file and media file information indicating a domain of the subject matter of the content included in the media file or a project to be associated with the media file from which the domain may be derived. Responsive to receipt of this media file information the customer interface stores the media files in the media file storage and stores a unique identifier of the media file and other media file information in the market data storage .

According to another example illustrated by the customer interface provides media file information to the user interface. This media file information includes unique identifiers of one or more media files previously received from the customer the due dates and times associated with the received media files and the project information associated with the received media files. In this example the customer interface receives modifications to the provided media file information made by the customer via the user interface. Responsive to receiving the modifications the customer interface stores the modifications in the market data storage .

According to another example illustrated by the customer interface provides media file information to the user interface. This media file information includes one or more unique identifiers of one or more media files previously received from the customer and other attributes of these files including for example the due dates and times content types prices difficulties and statuses or states of jobs associated with the previously received media files. As discussed above with reference to examples of job states include New ASR In Progress Available Assigned Editing In Progress and Complete. In some embodiments the customer interface serves media file information as one web page while in other embodiments the customer interface serves this media file information as multiple web pages. It is to be appreciated that different due dates and times and content type may be associated with different prices to the customer. Customer prices may also be impacted by other factors that impact the underlying transcription cost including how objectively difficult the media file transcription is to edit as described above.

In another example the customer interface serves media file information that includes final transcription information to the user interface rendered by the client computer . This final transcription information includes a final time coded or non time coded transcription of the content included in a media file. The time coded transcription is comprised of a textual representation of the content of the media file where each textual token has associated with it indicia of the location in the media file to which it applies. The textual tokens may include words numerics punctuation speaker identification formatting directives non verbal indicators such as BACKGROUND NOISE MUSIC LAUGHTER PAUSING and other markings that may be useful in describing the media file content. The empty string may also be used as a textual token in which case the location indicia serves to keep the transcription synchronized with the media file content in the absence of useful textual information. In the case of the draft transcription from the ASR device these empty string tokens may be used if the ASR process was confident that some transcription worthy event has occurred at that location but is unsure of the particular identity of that event. In this case having the location indicia associated with the event facilitates synchronized correction by the editor.

In other embodiments the customer interface is configured to receive a request to edit final transcription information from the user interface and in response to the request to provide an editing platform such as the editing screen described below with reference to the editor interface to the user interface. In this example the editing platform enables customers to edit the final transcription information. Also in this example the user interface includes elements that enable the customer to initiate an upload of the edited final transcription information to the customer interface . The customer interface in turn receives the edited final transcription information stores the final transcription information in the media file storage and stores an association between the edited final transcription information and the media file with content that was transcribed in the market data storage .

Although the examples described above focus on a web based implementation of the customer interface embodiments are not limited to a web based design. Other technologies such as technologies employing a specialized non browser based client may be used to implement the user interface without departing from the scope of the aspects and embodiments disclosed herein. For instance according to one embodiment the customer interface is a simple locally executed upload client that allows the customer to do nothing more than upload media files to the server via FTP or some other protocol. In other embodiments the customer interface is configured to perform a variety of processes in response to exchanging information via the user interface. For instance in one embodiment after receiving one or more media files via the user interface the customer interface provides the market engine with an identifier of newly stored unprocessed media files.

In some embodiments the customer interface is configured to provide a system interface to the client computer via the network . For instance in one embodiment the customer interface implements an HTTP API through which the client computer exchanges transcription request information with the customer interface . The transcription request information may include project information e.g. an identifier of a project customer information e.g. an identifier of a customer media file information e.g. an identifier of a media file values of one or more estimated accuracy thresholds identifiers of one or more requested transcription products a request for a partial delivery of transcription products associated with the media file a request for status regarding the generation of the transcription products a status postback identifier a delivery point identifier and responses to any requests. In some embodiments the status postback identifier and the delivery point identifier may include URI s URL s an FTP folder identifier along with authentication credentials or the like. In response to receiving the transcription request information the customer interface may store the transcription request information in the market data storage in association with the identifier of the media file project or customer from which the requested transcription products are to be generated. In addition responsive to receiving the transcription request information the customer interface may store the media file identified in the transcription request information in the media file storage . Transcription request information is described further below with reference to .

Using transcription request information the client computer may predefine a schedule for the progressive creation and delivery of transcription products. This schedule may apply to a specific media file all media files associated with a project or all media files associated with a customer. For example the client computer may transmit transcription request information requesting that draft transcriptions be transmitted to a customer for all media files provided by the customer. This transcription request information may be received by the customer interface and stored in the market data storage before any of the media files are received. In another example the client computer may transmit transcription request information requesting that draft transcriptions with quality metrics that exceed an identified threshold be transmitted to the customer. In this case the transcription request information may further request that the edited transcription not be transmitted but the QA transcription be transmitted. Other combinations of delivery criteria specifying stage of processing quality level receipt of an express delivery request prior deliveries made or not made time since start of media file processing time until final deadline time elapsed since prior deliveries made or requested estimated time until next stage is complete estimated time until final transcript is complete etc. may be used to trigger automated creation and delivery and the embodiments disclosed herein are not limited to a particular combination of delivery criteria. In addition these delivery criteria may be specified in advance of media file processing during media file processing or in response to receiving particular media file processing status information.

In some embodiments the customer interface is configured to perform a variety of processes in response to exchanging information via the system interface with the client computer . For instance in one embodiment after receiving transcription request information specifying a request for partial delivery of one or more transcription products the customer interface provides the request for delivery or partial delivery to the market engine . In another embodiment after receiving transcription request information specifying a request for status regarding the generation of the transcription products the customer interface provides the request for status regarding the generation of the transcription products to the delivery agent .

In some embodiments the administrator interface is configured to provide a user interface to the administrator via the network and the client computer . For instance in one embodiment the administrator interface is configured to serve a browser based user interface to the administrator that is rendered by a web browser running on the client computer . In this embodiment the administrator interface exchanges market information with the administrator via this user interface. Market information may include any information used to maintain the transcription job market and stored within the market data storage . Specific examples of market information include a media file information job information customer information editor information administrator information and transcription request information. Market information is described further below with reference to . Using the administrator interface the administrator acts as a transcription manager who regulates the transcription job market as a whole to promote its efficient allocation of resources.

In these embodiments the administrator interface is also configured to receive a request from the user interface to provide a preview of a media file and in response to the request serve a preview screen for the requested media file to the user interface. This preview screen provides the content of the media file and the draft transcription associated with the media file. More particular in some embodiments the preview screen is configured to provide the media file content in the form of for example a streamed version of the original file as well as the draft transcription information for the media file which includes time codes. This information enables the preview screen to display the draft transcription in synchronization with the media file content. A preview may consist of all or some of this information.

According to an example illustrated by the administrator interface provides media file information to the user interface. This media file information includes one or more unique identifiers of one or more media files previously received from the customer the content types associated with the received media files and the difficulties associated with the received media files. In this example responsive to receipt of an indication that the administrator wishes to preview a media file the administrator interface provides a preview of the media file and the draft transcription information associated with the media file. Further in this example the administrator interface receives modifications to the provided media file information made by the administrator via the user interface. Responsive to receiving the modifications the administrator interface stores the modifications in the market data storage .

In other embodiments the administrator interface is also configured to receive a request from the user interface to provide an administrator view of all jobs available on the market and in response to the request serve an administrator screen to the user interface. This administrator view is configured to display the same information available to editors viewing the job market difficulty pay rate due date and time domain etc. and also displays additional information to assist the administrator. For example the administrator view may display the number of editors with permission to edit each available media file the amount of time each job has been on the market the number of previews of the media file and other data concerning the market status of the media file. In this way the administrator view displays information that enables administrators to ensure that the media file is accepted as an editing job.

The administrator interface is also configured receive a request from the user interface to modify information displayed by administrator view and in response to the request store the modified information. Thus the administrator view may increase the pay rate may manually enable a larger number or smaller number of editors access to the file or may cut the file into shorter segments thus producing several editing jobs for the same media file. The administrator view may also bundle jobs together to ensure that all editors have access to a reasonable cross section of work. For example the administrator view may group a selection of jobs with variable difficulty together so that a single editor would need to accept all of these jobs instead of just picking low difficulty jobs for themselves. The administrator view may also throttle the supply of low difficulty jobs in order to create a more competitive environment or to induce editors to work on difficult jobs. The administrator view may also record as accepted a claim offer that is higher than the pay rate for a job.

In other embodiments the administrator interface is also configured to receive a request from the user interface to provide a meta rules view and in response to the request serve a meta rules screen to the user interface. Meta rules globally modify the behavior of the market by affecting how all or some of the available jobs will appear on the market. In some embodiments the administrator interface is configured receive a request from the user interface to add to or modify meta rules displayed by meta rules view and in response to the request store the newly introduced meta rule information.

In other embodiments the administrator interface is also configured to receive a request from the user interface to provide a market view of jobs available on the market and in response to the request serve a market screen to the user interface. The market screen is configured to provide summarized information about jobs organized according to one or more job or associated media file attributes.

Although the examples described above focus on a web based implementation of the administrator interface embodiments are not limited to a web based design. Other technologies such as technologies employing a specialized non browser based client may be used without departing from the scope of the aspects and embodiments disclosed herein.

In some embodiments the editor interface is configured to provide a user interface to the editor via the network and the client computer . For instance in one embodiment the editor interface is configured to serve a browser based user interface to the editor that is rendered by a web browser running on the client computer . In this embodiment the editor interface exchanges media file information editor information and job information with the editor via this user interface. Editor information may include information associated with an editor profile or the history of an editor within the transcription job market. Job information may include information associated with transcription jobs that are available or that have been completed via the transcription job market. Specific examples of editor information include a unique identifier of the editor domains of subject matter in which the editor is qualified to work and identifiers of currently claimed jobs. Specific examples of job information include a unique identifier of the job a deadline for the job and a pay rate for the job. Media file information editor information and job information are described further below with reference to .

In these embodiments the editor interface is configured to provide job information only for jobs that the editor is permitted to work. In one example the editor interface determines that an editor is permitted to edit a draft transcription based on a complex of factors. If a media file associated with the draft transcription has a specific content type then in some examples the editor interface will only provide job information associated with the media file to editors qualified to edit that specific content type. In other examples the editor interface may provide job information associated with more difficult files to more experienced editors. In still other examples the editor interface provides job information for jobs associated with specific customers to particular subset of editors. This approach may be advantageous for example if there are confidentiality concerns and only that subset of editors have signed non disclosure agreements. Thus examples of the editor interface do not provide job information to the editor for jobs claimed by another editor or for jobs that the editor does not have permission to claim.

In other embodiments the editor interface is configured to receive a request from the user interface to provide a preview of a media file and in response to the request serve a preview screen for the requested media file to the user interface. This preview screen provides the content of the media file and the draft transcription information associated with the media file. Editors may be given access to the preview screen for a media file before they choose to accept the editing job at the given pay rate. The preview screen includes the media file content in the form of for example a streamed version of the original media file as well as the draft transcription information for the media file which includes time codes. This information enables the preview screen to display and draft transcription in synchronization with playback of the media file content. A preview may consist of all or some of this content. The editors may access the preview screen content and thereby assess for themselves the difficulty of the editing job and then make a judgment as to whether they are willing to accept the job at the current pay rate. This enables editors to select content that they are interested in and to reveal their expertise or preferences for subject matter that would otherwise by unknown to administrators. In aggregate this will tend to improve transcription quality since the jobs will be better matched to editors than if randomly assigned.

According to an example illustrated by the editor interface provides job information to the user interface. This job information includes one or more unique identifiers of one or more jobs available for the editor identifiers of the media files associated with the jobs pay rates of the jobs domain information and durations of the content of the media file associated with the job. In this example responsive to receipt of an indication that the editor wishes to preview a media file the editor interface provides a preview of the media file and the draft transcription information associated with the media file. If the editor wishes to claim the job the editor indicates this intent by interacting with the user interface and the user interface transmits a request to claim the job for the editor to the editor interface . Next in this example the editor interface receives the request to claim an available job from the user interface and responsive to receiving this request the editor interface records the job as claimed in the market data storage .

In other embodiments the editor interface is configured to receive a request from the user interface to edit a draft transcription and in response to the request serve an editing screen to the user interface. The editing screen is configured to provide a variety of tools for editing and correcting the draft transcription. For instance the editing screen provides access to the original file or a converted version of the original file along with the draft transcription information by referencing information contained in both the market data storage and the media file storage .

In one embodiment once an editor begins working on a job the editing screen provides the complete media file content and time coded draft transcription information for editing using client computer based editing software. The editor interface also transitions the job into a working state by recording the working state for the job in the market data storage .

The editing process consists of playing the media file content and following along with the draft transcription modifying the draft transcription information as necessary to ensure that the saved draft transcription reflects the content of the media file. According to some embodiments as the editor modifies the draft transcription information the editing screen communicates with the editor interface to indicate progress through the editing job. The editing screen tracks the time point into the file that the editor is playing as well as the parts of the draft transcription information that has been modified in order to estimate progress. The progress is communicated back to the editor interface and the editor interface then stores this progress in the market data storage in association with the editing job. In the course of editing a job the editor may come across words or phrases that are difficult to understand. The editing screen allows editors to flag these regions so that they may be reviewed and possibly corrected by an administrator. A flag may indicate complete unintelligibility or may include a guess as to the correct word but with an indicator that it is a guess. For each job the prevalence of corrected flags in the edited transcript is stored in the market data storage and the market engine may use stored flags as an indicator of editor proficiency to aid with future job assignment. In some embodiments the editing screen allows editors to store auxiliary deliverables such as search keywords descriptive summarization and other metadata derived from the transcription information during editing jobs and QA jobs.

In other embodiments the editor interface is configured to receive a request from the user interface to save an edited draft transcription and in response to the request save the edited draft transcription to the media file storage and update progress information for the job in the market data storage . In some embodiments saving the progress information triggers estimation of a new completion date and time which is then evaluated relative to the due date and time as discussed with reference to below.

According to an example illustrated by the editor interface provides job information to the user interface. This job information includes one or more unique identifiers of one or more jobs available for the editor identifiers of the media files associated with the jobs pay rates of the jobs durations of the content of the media file associated with the job and progress the editor has made editing the draft transcription associated with the job. In this example responsive to receipt of an indication that the editor wishes to edit the draft transcription the editor interface serves an editing screen to the user interface.

In some embodiments the editing screen is configured to receive an indication that the editor has completed a job. In these embodiments the editing screen is also configured to in response to receiving the indication store the edited draft transcription information as final transcription information in the media file storage and update the market data storage to include an association between the media file and the final transcription information.

The examples described above focus on a web based implementation of the editor interface . However embodiments are not limited to a web based design. Other technologies such as technologies employing a specialized non browser based client may be used without departing from the scope of the aspects and embodiments disclosed herein.

Upon receipt of an indication that the editor has completed the job the transcription system saves the completed job and the process ends.

Other embodiments perform processes that monitor jobs to ensure the jobs are completed according to schedule using a transcription system such as the transcription system described above. One example of such a process is illustrated in . According to this example a process includes several acts that are described further below.

In act the transcription system determines whether a job should be assessed for attribute adjustment. The transcription system may make this determination based on a variety of factors including receipt of a request to assess the job from a component of the system or an entity external to the system e.g. a request for immediate delivery of the job s output or expiration of a predetermined period of time since the job was previously assessed i.e. a wait time. If the job should not be assessed the process ends. Otherwise the process executes act .

In the act the transcription system determines whether the job is assigned. If so the transcription system executes act . Otherwise the transcription system determines whether the job is in progress in act . If not the transcription system executes act . Otherwise the transcription system executes the act .

In the acts and the transcription system predicts the completion date and time of the job using one or more of the following factors the current date and time the amount of progress already complete for the job historical productivity of the editor in general or more specifically when editing media files having a characteristic in common with the media file associated with the job the number of jobs currently claimed by the editor the number of jobs the editor has in progress and the due dates and times of the jobs claimed by the editor.

In some embodiments the following equation is used to predict the completion date and time of the job 1 1 2 

In act the transcription system determines whether the predicted completion date and time of the job is before the due date and time of the job. If so the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system executes act .

In act the transcription system determines whether the predicted completion date and time of the job is before the due date and time of the job. If so the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system executes a process that sets the job attributes automatically in act . This process is described further below with reference to . Once the job attributes have been set the process ends.

In act the transcription system determines whether the predicted completion date and time of the job is before the due date and time of the job. If so the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system determines whether to revoke the job in act . If not the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system revokes the job in act .

In act the transcription system determines whether to split the job. If not the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system splits the job in act and the process ends.

As discussed above with reference to some embodiments perform processes that set attributes of jobs using a transcription system such as the transcription system described above. One example of such a process is illustrated in . According to this example a process includes several acts that are described further below.

In act the transcription system determines if the job is available. In not the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system determines a pay rate for the job in act . The transcription system may make this determination based on any of a variety of factors including due date and time difficulty domain and ASR cost.

In act the transcription system predicts a completion date and time for the job for each editor. The transcription system may make this determination based on any of a variety of factors including difficulty domain and historical XRT of previously completed similar jobs.

In act the transcription system determines whether the completion date and time is prior to the due date and time for the job. If so the process ends. Otherwise the transcription system determines whether the number of previews provided for the job transgresses a threshold in act . If not the transcription system executes act . Otherwise the transcription system executes act .

In act the transcription system modifies the pay rate based on the difference between the due date and time to the completion date and time and the process ends. For instance the transcription system may set the modified pay rate equal to the unmodified pay rate plus a date and time increment amount multiplied by the difference between the due date and time and the completion date and time.

In act the transcription system modifies the wait time for reassessment of the job and the process ends. For instance the transcription system may set the modified wait time equal to the unmodified wait time plus an increment amount.

Other embodiments perform processes that progressively deliver transcription products to customers using a transcription system such as the transcription system described above. One example of such a process is illustrated in . According to this example a process includes several acts described further below.

In act a delivery agent such as the delivery agent described above with reference to receives a notification. This notification may be generated by the transcription system from a previously configured schedule or may be received from another component of the transcription system such as the customer interface or the market engine both of which are described above with reference to . The notification may include transcription request information. For example the notification may include a request for status from an external system such as the client computer described above with reference to . Alternatively the notification may include status and location information for one or more transcriptions.

In act the delivery agent parses the notification to determine whether the notification is a request for status from an external system. If so the delivery agent executes act . Otherwise the delivery agent executes act .

In the act the delivery agent retrieves the requested status information and transmits the requested status information to the external system. In some embodiments the delivery agent retrieves the requested status information from the notification. In other embodiments the delivery agent retrieves the requested status information from a market data store such as the market data store described above with reference to . In other embodiments the delivery agent transmits the requested status information to the external system via the customer interface. The customer interface may facilitate this transfer using an HTTP API implemented by the client computer. After execution of the act the process ends.

In the act the delivery agent determines whether the notification is a request for delivery of one or more transcription products. If so the delivery agent executes act . Otherwise the delivery agent optionally records an indication that the notification was erroneous and the process ends.

In the act the delivery agent determines the status of the transcription that is the basis for the requested transcription products. In some embodiments the delivery agent determines the status of the transcription by parsing the notification. In other embodiments the delivery agent determines the status of the transcription by querying the market data storage. The status of the transcription may indicate previous processing that the transcription has undergone e.g. ASR processing edited by a human editor quality checked by a human editor etc. . . . . The status of the transcription may also indicate that particular portions have not undergone identified processing while other portions have e.g. a first portion has undergone ASR processing a second portion has undergone human editing and a third portion has undergone QA .

In the act the delivery agent determines whether the status of the transcription meets combination criteria or quality threshold criteria included in the notification. If so the delivery agent proceeds to act . Otherwise the delivery agent proceeds to the act . The combination criteria in the notification may specify any combination of identified process completion criteria e.g. criteria regarding processes that a transcription has undergone and transcription segmentation criteria e.g. criteria regarding whether the transcription covers an entire media file or only segments of the media file . For example the combination criteria may specify that only full transcriptions that have completed QA are requested for delivery. Alternatively the combination criteria may specify that any segment of a transcription that has completed ASR processing is requested for delivery. The combination criteria may also specify that segments of a transcription that have completed editing are requested for delivery if other segments of the transcription have completed QA. Embodiments are not limited to any particular combination criteria or set of combination criteria and any combination of identified process criteria and transcription segmentation criteria is intended to be within the scope of this disclosure.

In some embodiments the quality threshold criteria in the notification may specify quality threshold criteria for each distinct element of combination criteria. In these embodiments within the act the delivery agent computes a value of a quality metric that indicates the confidence level or estimated accuracy of the transcription or segments of the transcription that meet the combination criteria corresponding to the quality threshold criteria. Where the value of the quality metric is in a predefined relationship e.g. greater than or equal to to the quality threshold value the delivery agent deems the quality threshold criteria as being met and will not proceed to the act unless the combination criteria described above is not met.

In the act the delivery agent generates transcription products specified in the notification from the transcription information. In act the delivery agent transmits the transcription products to a delivery point specified in the notification and the process ends.

Processes through each depict one particular sequence of acts in a particular example. The acts included in these processes may be performed by or using one or more computer systems specially configured as discussed herein. Some acts are optional and as such may be omitted in accord with one or more examples. Additionally the order of acts can be altered or other acts can be added without departing from the scope of the systems and methods discussed herein. Furthermore as discussed above in at least one example the acts are performed on a particular specially configured machine namely a transcription system configured according to the examples and embodiments disclosed herein.

The embodiments described herein progressively deliver transcription products of increasing quality in an iterative manner. In a simple example the embodiments disclosed herein provide a first transcription generated from conventional ASR processing usually within one hour of receipt of a media file a second transcription generated from human editing which represents a near final version in which most errors are corrected and remaining problem areas e.g. difficult words are flagged and a third transcription generated from human QA nearly perfect quality . Any of these transcriptions and products derived from them may be selectively delivered only where the transcription meets quality threshold criteria. Additionally subsets of each transcription may be selectively tested and delivered according to customer specifications.

Having thus described several aspects of at least one example it is to be appreciated that various alterations modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. For instance examples disclosed herein may also be used in other contexts. Such alterations modifications and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure and are intended to be within the scope of the examples discussed herein. Accordingly the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only.
