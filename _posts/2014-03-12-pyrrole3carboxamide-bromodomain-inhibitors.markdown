Bromodomains refer to conserved protein structural folds which bind to N acetylated lysine residues that are found in some proteins. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteinfs is comprised of four members BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRDt . Each member of the BET family employs two bromodomains to recognize N acetylated lysine residues found primarily but not exclusively on the amino terminal tails of histone proteins. These interactions modulate gene expression by recruiting transcription factors to specific genome locations within chromatin. For example histone bound BRD4 recruits the transcription factor P TEFb to promoters resulting in the expression of a subset of genes involved in cell cycle progression Yang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 28 967 976 2008 . BRD2 and BRD3 also function as transcriptional regulators of growth promoting genes LeRoy et al. Mol. Cell 30 51 60 2008 . BET family members were recently established as being important for the maintenance of several cancer types Zuber et al. Nature 478 524 528 2011 Mertz et al Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci. 108 16669 16674 2011 Delmore et al. Cell 146 1 14 2011 Dawson et al. Nature 478 529 533 2011 . BET family members have also been implicated in mediating acute inflammatory responses through the canonical NF KB pathway Huang et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 29 1375 1387 2009 resulting in the upregulation of genes associated with the production of cytokines Nicodeme et al. Nature 468 1119 1123 2010 . Suppression of cytokine induction by BET bromodomain inhibitors has been shown to be an effective approach to treat inflammation mediated kidney disease in an animal model Zhang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 287 28840 28851 2012 . BRD2 function has been linked to predisposition for dyslipidemia or improper regulation of adipogenesis elevated inflammatory profiles and increased susceptibility to autoimmune diseases Denis Discovery Medicine 10 489 499 2010 . The human immunodeficiency virus utilizes BRD4 to initiate transcription of viral RNA from stably integrated viral DNA Jang et al. Mol. Cell 19 523 534 2005 . BET bromodomain inhibitors have also been shown to reactivate HIV transcription in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection Banerjee et al J. Leukocyte Biol. doi 10.1189 jlb.0312165 . BRDt has an important role in spermatogenesis that is blocked by BET bromodomain inhibitors Matzuk et al. Cell 150 673 684 2012 . Thus compounds that inhibit the binding of BET family bromodomains to their cognate acetylated lysine proteins are being pursued for the treatment of cancer inflammatory diseases kidney diseases diseases involving metabolism or fat accumulation and some viral infections as well as for providing a method for male contraception. Accordingly there is an ongoing medical need to develop new drugs to treat these indications.

It should be recognized that if there are more than one substitution on a moiety each non hydrogen radical may be identical or different unless otherwise stated .

If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted the moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted. If a moiety is described as being optionally substituted with up to a particular number of non hydrogen radicals that moiety may be either 1 not substituted or 2 substituted by up to that particular number of non hydrogen radicals or by up to the maximum number of substitutable positions on the moiety whichever is less. Thus for example if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non hydrogen radicals then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate tetrazolyl which has only one substitutable position would be optionally substituted with up to one non hydrogen radical. To illustrate further if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non hydrogen radicals whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non hydrogen radical.

The terms treat treating and treatment refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a disease and or its attendant symptoms.

This invention also provides for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient therefor. The phrase pharmaceutical composition refers to a composition suitable for administration in medical or veterinary use.

The pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a compound of formula I alone or or in combination with a second active pharmaceutical agent may be administered to the subjects orally rectally parenterally intracisternally intravaginally intraperitoneally topically as by powders ointments or drops bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term parenterally as used herein refers to modes of administration which include intravenous intramuscular intraperitoneal intrasternal subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as used herein means a non toxic inert solid semi solid or liquid filler diluent encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as but not limited to lactose glucose and sucrose starches such as but not limited to corn starch and potato starch cellulose and its derivatives such as but not limited to sodium carboxymethyl cellulose ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate powdered tragacanth malt gelatin talc excipients such as but not limited to cocoa butter and suppository waxes oils such as but not limited to peanut oil cottonseed oil safflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil glycols such a propylene glycol esters such as but not limited to ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate agar buffering agents such as but not limited to magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide alginic acid pyrogen free water isotonic saline Ringer s solution ethyl alcohol and phosphate buffer solutions as well as other non toxic compatible lubricants such as but not limited to sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate as well as coloring agents releasing agents coating agents sweetening flavoring and perfuming agents preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition according to the judgment of the formulator.

Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions dispersions suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers diluents solvents or vehicles include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like vegetable oils such as olive oil injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate and suitable mixtures thereof. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of the drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form may be accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.

The injectable formulations can be sterilized for example by filtration through a bacterial retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.

The compounds utilized in the pharmaceutical method of the invention can be administered at the initial dosage of about 0.001 mg kg to about 100 mg kg daily. In certain embodiments the daily dose range is from about 0.1 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. The dosages however may be varied depending upon the requirements of the subject the severity of the condition being treated and the compound being employed. Determination of the proper dosage for a particular situation is within the skill of the practitioner. Treatment may be initiated with smaller dosages which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under circumstances is reached. For convenience the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired.

Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules using such carriers as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.

The solid dosage forms of tablets dragees capsules pills and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art.
