Client device may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a tablet computer a handheld device a mobile phone a kiosk a vending machine a billboard or any suitable information handling system. In particular embodiments a client device is an embedded computer and may have flash memory e.g. a solid state drive instead of a hard disk drive. In particular embodiments a client device is a thin client having limited processing capabilities and limited storage and such a thin client may require minimal management and updates. A client device may communicate with a server via one or more protocols such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure HTTPS File Transfer Protocol FTP Common Internet File System CIFS Independent Computing Architecture ICA protocol developed by Citrix Systems Inc. Remote Desktop Protocol RDP developed by Microsoft Corporation or any suitable protocol or combination of protocols.

A server may include one or more of a computing device a desktop computer a laptop computer a database a corporate server a repository server a configuration application server a domain name system DNS server a dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP server a virtual machine e.g. VMware Virtual Machine a desktop session e.g. Microsoft Terminal Server a published application e.g. Microsoft Terminal Server or any suitable information handling system. As an example a private e.g. corporate network may include a device manager server and a repository server each configured to communicate with multiple client devices across one or more domains sites or subnets of network . In particular embodiments a server may include one or more servers or functions of one or more servers. A client device may access software resources provided by a server such as for example operating systems add ons content or any other suitable data applications or images. In particular embodiments a client may access resources provided by a server only after providing suitable authentication information. Alternatively a server may provide software or other resources automatically to one or more client devices .

It may be desirable in the case of a private e.g. corporate network including multiple sites or subnets to deploy software including e.g. all or part of one or more operating systems applications add ons or data to one or more client devices across one or more sites or subnets. The client devices may for example be located remotely from one or more servers including e.g. device managers or resource repositories and as such there may be challenges in deploying software or other resources to the client devices. As an example limited connectivity or limited speed due to bandwidth constraints or network latencies may create delays in deploying software. As another example remote sites or subnets may not include managed components or may not have any personnel with information technology expertise necessary to implement software deployment to client devices at the sites or subnets. Additionally as the size of operating system images or other content e.g. videos increases deploying software or other data to remote sites or subnets may be further delayed. These issues may be further exacerbated in the case of embedded computers such as thin clients which may have limited processing capability and limited storage space. Traditional approaches involving using a static remote software repository for each subnet or site may not be feasible due to cost or management and monitoring requirements.

In particular embodiments one or more servers of a network may include a device manager that may manage one or more client devices e.g. thin clients of one or more sites or subnets of the network. The device manager may for example be a software based management tool that allows for software imaging software updates and software configurations to be deployed to the clients from one or more servers. The device manager may also perform any other suitable management function to manage client devices including for example enabling or performing e.g. automatically device discovery tracking of assets e.g. hardware or software inventory at client devices monitoring the status or health of client devices applying one or more policies to client devices including e.g. network settings of the client devices or remote administration and shadowing of client devices. The device manager may deliver any suitable resources including for example operating systems add ons content or any other suitable data applications or images to one or more thin client devices of network .

In particular embodiments client device may run an operating system that uses code signing for security such as the Google Android Operating System. The operating system may require that an application or any other executable code be signed using a digital signature before being permitted to execute. The digital signature may be used to identify the source or author of the application. The source of the application may be used by the operating system to determine the level of trust given to the application. For example the device manufacturer may sign the operating system and applications distributed with the operating system with a key associated with the device manufacturer. The key associated with the manufacturer may be referred to as a platform key. The operating system may be operable to recognize and trust code signed with the platform key and give applications signed with the platform key the ability to call most or all application programming interfaces APIs available to the operating system. The operating system may be operable to give applications signed with the platform key access to data that is typically only accessible to the operating system.

Applications that are not signed with the platform key or another key recognized by the operating system as trusted may be treated as an untrusted application. The operating system may be operable to limit an untrusted application s access to a subset of APIs available from the operating system. For example the operating system may be operable to limit the ability of an untrusted application to make changes to the user interface UI or configuration of the device . The operating system may be operable to limit an untrusted application such that it may only access data created by the untrusted application itself or data that is made generally available to applications running on the device e.g. publicly shared memory or shared data . The operating system may be operable to limit an untrusted application such that it may not access data associated with other untrusted or trusted applications on the client device . In some embodiments an untrusted application may be permitted to access APIs or data associated with other applications installed on the device. The operating system may grant the untrusted application access to the APIs and data of other applications if the user or other application explicitly grants access to the untrusted application. The operating system may grant the untrusted application access to the APIs and data of other applications automatically if the other applications are signed with the same key used to sign the untrusted application.

In particular embodiments a platform trust extension is provided. The platform trust extension may be pre installed with the operating system with the client device during manufacturing. Alternatively the platform trust extension may be installed on the client device after purchase. For example the platform trust extension may be purchased and downloaded from an application store. The platform trust extension may comprise one or more trusted applications or executable code. The platform trust extension may be signed with a platform key or another key that is trusted by the operating system.

In particular embodiments the platform trust extension may define an additional trust level or security level . The additional trust level is given less trust than the level of trust given to the platform trust extension. For example the additional trust level may only be granted a subset of the permissions granted to the platform trust extension s trust level. In a particular embodiment the additional trust level is given the same permissions as the trust level of the platform trust extension except for the ability to alter the permissions or trust level of other applications. In a particular embodiment applications at the additional trust level are permitted to make changes to the UI or configuration of the device .

In particular embodiments the platform trust extension is operable to determine at install time or run time whether an application should be executed at the additional trust level. An application that the platform trust extension recognizes as an application that should be executed at the additional trust level may be referred to as a platform trust extension recognized application or a semi trusted application. A particular embodiment is described with reference to . At step the determination process begins. At step the platform trust extension may check the application against a user managed list of applications or application sources e.g. keys to be semi trusted. If there is a match the platform trust extension permits the application to run at the additional trust level at step . If there is no match the platform trust extension may check the application against an organization managed list of applications or application sources to be semi trusted at step . If there is a match the platform trust extension permits the application to run at the additional trust level at step . If there is no match the platform trust extension may check the application to determine if it is signed with a key associated with the provider of the platform trust extension at step . If the application is signed with a key associated with the provider of the platform trust extension then the application is permitted to run at the additional trust level at step . If there is no match the platform trust extension may check the key used to sign the application against a list of keys to be semi trusted that is maintained at least in part by the provider of the platform trust extension at step . If there is a match the application may be permitted to run at the additional trust level at step . If the platform trust extension is unable to verify that the application is to be recognized by the platform trust extension or semi trusted the application is only permitted to run at the untrusted level at step . It should be appreciated that in particular embodiments not all of the illustrated steps may be performed by the platform trust extension or that the platform trust extension may vary the order in which the steps are performed.

In particular embodiments a user may maintain a list of applications or application sources whose applications should be permitted to execute at the additional trust level. In other words the user may maintain a list of semi trusted applications or application sources. A particular embodiment is described with reference to . At step the process begins. At step the user accesses a user interface for the platform trust extension. The user may be presented with a list of applications installed on the client device . The user may be presented with a list of sources for the application installed on the client device . For example the user interface may enumerate all of the keys used to sign applications on the client device and present any information identifying the source of the keys. For example the list may contain an entry for Dell Inc. if there is a key on the device that was used to sign an application and the key self identifies as belonging to Dell Inc. At step the user may select one or more applications or one or more keys to be semi trusted. At step the user interface may ask the user to confirm that the selected applications or keys should be granted permission to run at the additional trust level. At step the platform trust extension adds the applications or keys selected by the user to a list of applications or keys to a data store that is owned by the platform trust extension. This data may be later used in a determination process for example in the process depicted in at step .

In particular embodiments an organization may maintain a list of applications or application sources whose applications should be permitted to execute at the additional trust level on devices owned or controlled by the organization. In other words an organization may maintain a list of semi trusted applications or semi trusted application sources for one or more client devices owned or controlled by the organization. A particular embodiment is described with reference to . At step the process begins. At step an administrator or a person authorized by the organization accesses a user interface for the platform trust extension. The administrator may be presented with a list of applications installed on the client device or a list of applications available to be installed on the client device . For example applications available to be installed on the client device may comprise a list of applications available in an application store. The administrator may be presented with a list of sources for the applications installed or available to be installed on the client device . For example the user interface may enumerate all of the keys used to sign applications installed or available to be installed on the client device and present any information identifying the source of the keys. At step the administrator may select one or more applications or one or more keys to be semi trusted. At step the user interface may ask the administrator to confirm that the selected applications or keys should be granted permission to run at the additional trust level. At step the platform trust extension adds the applications or keys selected by the administrator to a list of applications or keys to a data store that is associated with the organization and the platform trust extension. This data may be later used in a determination process executed by a platform trust extension for example in the process depicted in at step .

In another particular embodiment the provider of the platform trust extension may sign an application with a key associated with the platform trust extension provider. For example the platform trust extension provider may operate a certified developers program. If a developer complies with the requirements set by the platform trust extension provider the certified developer may submit its application for signing by the platform trust extension provider. In a particular embodiment the platform trust extension provider uses one or more keys that a platform trust extension is operable to recognize as a key to semi trusted. In other words the provider may sign the application with a key that a platform trust extension recognizes and is operable to permit the an application signed with the key to run at the additional trust level. After the platform trust extension provider signs the application with one of the keys the provider returns the signed application to the developer for distribution. In a particular embodiment a platform trust extension will recognize the signed application as an application to be executed at the additional trust level for example as depicted in at step .

In another particular embodiment the platform trust extension provider may maintain a list of keys that should be semi trusted and a platform trust extension will permit applications signed with those keys to run at the additional trust level. For example the platform trust extension provider may operate a certified developers program. If a developer complies with the requirements of the program the certified developer may submit one or more keys that it uses to sign its applications to the platform trust extension provider. The platform trust extension provider may add these keys to a list maintained by the platform trust extension provider as a list of semi trusted keys. The platform trust extension may be operable to recognize that a key on the platform trust extension provider s list was used to sign an application and permit the application to run at the additional trust level. For example a platform trust extension may make this determination in the process depicted in at step .

It should be appreciated that the platform trust extension provider or the organization owning or controlling client device may maintain one or more lists of applications or sources of applications to be semi trusted. The respective lists provided to the platform trust extension on client device may be filtered by the platform trust extension provider or organization based upon a number of factors that include but are not limited to the region of the device language of the device or the identity of the registered user of the device. The lists may be distributed as a static file accompanying the platform trust extension or the client device or may be distributed in a dynamic method. For example the lists may be implemented as one or more web or cloud services called by a platform trust extension either in a batch transaction or dynamically at run time. For example a platform trust extension may periodically contact a cloud service and download the most current list available from the platform trust extension provider or the organization. Alternatively a platform trust extension may submit the identifying information for an application and receive a result from a web or cloud service indicating whether the application should be semi trusted.
