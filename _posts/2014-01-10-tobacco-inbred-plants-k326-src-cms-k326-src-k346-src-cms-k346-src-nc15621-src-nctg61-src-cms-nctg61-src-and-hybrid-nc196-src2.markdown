Tobacco L. is an important commercial crop in the United States as well as in other countries. In tobacco plants N demethylation of nicotine results in nornicotine a secondary alkaloid known to be a precursor for formation of N Nitrosonornicotine NNN in cured leaves. NNN is an undesired component of cured leaves.

The predominant alkaloid found in commercial tobacco varieties is nicotine typically accounting for 90 95 of the total alkaloid pool. The remaining alkaloid fraction is comprised primarily of three additional pyridine alkaloids nornicotine anabasine and anatabine. Nornicotine is generated directly from nicotine through the activity of the enzyme nicotine N demethylase. Nornicotine usually represents less than 5 of the total pyridine alkaloid pool but through a process termed conversion tobacco plants that initially produce very low amounts of nornicotine give rise to progeny that metabolically convert a large percentage of leaf nicotine to nornicotine. In tobacco plants that have genetically converted termed converters the great majority of nornicotine production occurs during the senescence and curing of the mature leaf Wernsman and Matzinger 1968 12 226 228 . Burley tobaccos are particularly prone to genetic conversion with rates as high as 20 per generation observed in some cultivars.

During the curing and processing of the tobacco leaf a portion of the nornicotine is metabolized to the compound NNN a tobacco specific nitrosamine TSNA that has been asserted to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals Hecht and Hoffmann 1990 8 273 294 Hoffmann et al 1994 41 1 52 Hecht 1998 11 559 603 . In flue cured tobaccos TSNAs are found to be predominantly formed through the reaction of alkaloids with the minute amounts of nitrogen oxides present in combustion gases formed by the direct fired heating systems found in traditional curing barns Peele and Gentry 1999 Formation of Tobacco specific Nitrosamines in Flue cured Tobacco CORESTA Meeting Agro Phyto Groups Suzhou China . Retrofitting these curing barns with heat exchangers virtually eliminated the mixing of combustion gases with the curing air and dramatically reduced the formation of TSNAs in tobaccos cured in this manner Boyette and Hamm 2001 27 17 22. . In contrast in the air cured Burley tobaccos TSNA formation proceeds primarily through reaction of tobacco alkaloids with nitrite a process catalyzed by leaf borne microbes Bush et al. 2001 27 23 46 . Thus far attempts to reduce TSNAs through modification of curing conditions while maintaining acceptable quality standards have not proven to be successful for the air cured tobaccos.

Further details for the casing process can be found in Edited by L. Davis and M. Nielsen Blackwell Science 1999.

A tobacco plant of the present disclosure designated K326 SRC CMS K326 SRC K346 SRC CMS K346 SRC NC1562 1 SRC NCTG 61 SRC CMS NCTG 61 SRC or hybrid cultivar NC196 SRC carrying the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles can be used in a plant breeding program to create useful lines cultivars varieties progeny inbreds and hybrids. Thus in some aspects an F F F or later generation tobacco plant containing the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles is crossed with a second plant and progeny of the cross are identified in which the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles are present. It will be appreciated that the second plant will be K326 K346 NC1562 1 NCTG 61 and hybrid cultivar NC196 or any other species or line optionally with an additional desirable trait such as herbicide resistance mentioned below.

In still other aspects methods of the present disclosure further include self pollinating or pollinating a male sterile pollen acceptor with a pollen donor capable of being used in production of a progeny of the present disclosure such as a male sterile hybrid of the present disclosure. Either the male sterile pollen acceptor plant or the pollen donor plant has at least one mutant allele two or even three mutant alleles at a nicotine demethylase locus such as the cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S. In an aspect all three alleles at each nicotine demethylase locus are mutant alleles making the plant homozygous for cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S.

Breeding can be carried out via any known procedures. DNA fingerprinting SNP or similar technologies may be used in a marker assisted selection MAS breeding program to transfer or breed mutant alleles of a nicotine demethylase gene into other tobaccos. For example a breeder can create segregating populations from hybridizations of a genotype containing cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles with an agronomically desirable genotype. Plants in the For backcross generations can be screened using a marker developed from cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop or cyp82e10 P381S alleles or a fragment thereof using one of the techniques known in the art or listed herein. Plants identified as possessing one or more cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles can be backcrossed or self pollinated to create a second population to be screened. Depending on the expected inheritance pattern or the MAS technology used it may be necessary to self pollinate the selected plants before each cycle of backcrossing to aid identification of the desired individual plants. Backcrossing or other breeding procedure can be repeated until the desired phenotype of the recurrent parent is recovered. A recurrent parent in the present disclosure can be K326 SRC CMS K326 SRC K346 SRC CMS K346 SRC NC1562 1 SRC NCTG 61 SRC CMS NCTG 61 SRC or NC 196 SRC. Other breeding techniques can be found for example in Wernsman E. A. and Rufty R. C. 1987. Chapter Seventeen. Tobacco. Pages 669 698 In Cultivar Development. Crop Species. W. H. Fehr ed. MacMillan Publishing Go. Inc. New York N.Y. incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The result of a plant breeding program using the mutant tobacco plants described herein includes useful lines cultivars varieties progeny inbreds and hybrids. As used herein the term cultivar or variety refers to a population of plants that share constant characteristics which separate them from other plants of the same species. A cultivar or variety is often although not always sold commercially. While possessing one or more distinctive traits a cultivar or variety is further characterized by a very small overall variation between individuals within that variety. A pure line variety may be created by several generations of self pollination and selection or vegetative propagation from a single parent using tissue or cell culture techniques. A cultivar or variety can be essentially derived from another cultivar line or variety. As defined by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants Dec. 2 1961 as revised at Geneva on Nov. 10 1972 on Oct. 23 1978 and on Mar. 19 1991 a cultivar or variety is essentially derived from an initial cultivar or variety if a it is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety or from a cultivar or variety that is predominantly derived from the initial cultivar or variety while retaining the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety b it is clearly distinguishable from the initial cultivar or variety and c except for the differences which result from the act of derivation it conforms to the initial cultivar or variety in the expression of the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of the initial cultivar or variety. Essentially derived varieties can be obtained for example by the selection of a natural or induced mutant a somaclonal variant a variant individual from plants of the initial variety backerossing or transformation. A line as distinguished from a cultivar or variety most often denotes a group of plants used non commercially for example in plant research. A line typically displays little overall variation between individuals for one or more traits of interest although there may be some variation between individuals for other traits.

Hybrid tobacco varieties can be produced by preventing self pollination of female parent plants i.e. seed parents of a first variety permitting pollen from male parent plants of a second variety to fertilize the female parent plants and allowing Fhybrid seeds to form on the female plants. Self pollination of female plants can be prevented by emasculating the flowers at an early stage of flower development. Alternatively pollen formation can be prevented on the female parent plants using a form of male sterility. For example male sterility can be produced by cytoplasmic male sterility CMS or transgenic male sterility wherein a transgene inhibits microsporogenesis and or pollen formation or self incompatibility. Female parent plants containing CMS are particularly useful. In aspects in which the female parent plants are CMS pollen may be harvested from male fertile plants and applied manually to the stigmas of CMS female parent plants and the resulting Fseed is harvested.

Plants can be used to form single cross tobacco Fhybrids. Alternatively three way crosses can be carried out wherein a single cross Fhybrid is used as a female parent and is crossed with a different male parent. As another alternative double cross hybrids can be created wherein the Fprogeny of two different single crosses are themselves crossed. Self incompatibility can be used to particular advantage to prevent self pollination of female parents when forming a double cross hybrid.

Successful crosses yield Fplants that are fertile have cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles and can be backcrossed with one of the parents such as K326 SRC CMS K326 SRC K346 SRC CMS K346 SRC NC1562 1 SRC NCTG 61 SRC CMS NCTG 61 SRC or NC 196 SRC if desired. In some aspects a plant population in the Fgeneration is screened for cyp82e4 W329Stop the cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles. Selected plants can be crossed with one of the parents and the first backcross BC1 generation plants are self pollinated to produce a BC1 Fpopulation that is again screened for variant nicotine demethylase gene expression e.g. the null version of the nicotine demethylase gene . The process of backcrossing self pollination and screening is repeated for example at least 4 times until the final screening produces a plant that is fertile and reasonably similar to the recurrent parent. This plant if desired is self pollinated and the progeny are subsequently screened again to confirm that the plant exhibits the same low nicotine conversion phenotype as K326 SRC CMS K326 SRC K346 SRC CMS K346 SRC NC1562 1 SRC NCTG 61 SRC CMS NCTG 61 SRC or NC 196 SRC. Breeder s seed of the selected plant is produced using standard methods including for example field testing confirmation of the null condition for nicotine demethylase chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the level of alkaloids and or chemical analyses of cured leaf to determine the ratio of nornicotine to nicotine nornicotine.

In one aspect a Fprogeny is the result of a cross between K326 SRC and CMS K326 SRC to generate Fprogeny that are male sterile. In another aspect a Fprogeny is the result of a cross between K346 SRC and CMS K346 SRC to generate Fprogeny that are male sterile. Male sterile tobacco plants may be produced by any method known in the art. Methods of producing male sterile tobacco are described in Wernsman E. A. and Rufty R. C. 1987. Chapter Seventeen. Tobacco. Pages 669 698 In Cultivar Development. Crop Species. W. H. Fehr ed. MacMillan Publishing Go. Inc. New York N.Y. 761 pp.

A plant comprising a mutation in a nicotine demethylase gene can be identified by selecting or screening the mutagenized plant material or progeny thereof. Such screening and selection methodologies are known to those having ordinary skill in the art. Examples of screening and selection methodologies include but are not limited to Southern analysis PCR amplification for detection of a polynucleotide Northern blots RNase protection primer extension RT PCR amplification for detecting RNA transcripts enzymatic assays for detecting enzyme or ribozyme activity of polypeptides and polynucleotides and protein gel electrophoresis Western blots immunoprecipitation and enzyme linked immunoassays to detect polypeptides.

Having now generally described the disclosure the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples that are provided by way of illustration and are not intended to be limiting of the present disclosure unless specified.

K326 SRC is a backcross derived version of flue cured tobacco cultivar K326 carrying introduced mutations in three genes CYP82E4 SEQ ID NO 5 CYP82E5 SEQ ID NO 8 and CYP82E10 SEQ ID NO 9 previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes Lewis et al. 2010 . The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 and CYP82E5 cyp82e5v2 W422Stop SEQ ID NO 2 encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 cyp82e10 P381S SEQ ID NO 11 does not encode for a premature stop codon but does render the gene product non functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine Lewis et al. 2010 . When in homozygous condition the three mutations result in tobacco plants with 1 reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine and 2 a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N nitrosonornicotine NNN a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 also provides phenotypic stability for the nicotine conversion trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome LC method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars.

The original tobacco cultivar K326 is a fertile inbred line. CMS K326 is a cytoplasmic male sterile version of K326. To develop K326 SRC an individual plant of K326 is pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98 325 6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. Findividuals originating from this cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent K326 to produce BCFprogeny. BCFprogeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BCFplant is backcrossed to K326 to produce BCFprogeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BCF BCF BCF BCF and BCFstages. At the BCFstage individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self pollinated to produce BCFseed. A large number of BCFprogeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. A single BCFplant homozygous for all three mutations is self pollinated to produce a BCFfamily K326 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of K326 were replaced by the mutant cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles .

The male sterile CMS version of K326 SRC CMS K326 SRC is produced by crossing a plant of CMS K326 as a female with pollen of K326 SRC to produce male sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is then subsequently backcrossed as a female to K326 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS K326 SRC line. Because the line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with K326 SRC.

K326 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry yield and physical quality at three North Carolina field research locations during 2012 Oxford Rocky Mount Kinston . K326 is included for comparison. The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20 plant plots. Plots are harvested and flue cured. Plot weights are used to determine per acre yields. Cured leaf is evaluated by a former USDA tobacco grader. Fifty gram composite leaf samples are collected from each plot and analyzed for percent nicotine nornicotine anatabine anabasine and percent nicotine conversion using gas chromatography equipment.

Comparisons using the least significant difference LSD test indicates that K326 SRC has significantly P

In an independent testing K326 SRC is further evaluated for NNN levels in both tobacco filler and cigarette smoke by gas chromatography. Percent nicotine conversion in tobacco filler is also measured. K326 is included for comparison. K326 SRC has a lower level of NNN compared to K326 in both tobacco filler 0.22 versus 0.53 ppm and cigarette smoke 0.015 versus 0.04 ng mg Total Particle Matter TPM . Percent nicotine conversion is lower in K326 SRC tobacco filler 0.8 than K326 tobacco filler 3.1 .

K346 SRC is a backcross derived version of flue cured tobacco cultivar K346 carrying introduced null mutations in three genes CYP82E4 SEQ ID NO 5 CYP82E5 SEQ ID NO 8 and CYP82E10 SEQ ID NO 9 previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes Lewis et al. 2010 . The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 and CYP82E5 cyp82e5v2 W422Stop SEQ ID NO 2 encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 cyp82e10 P381S SEQ ID NO 11 does not encode for a premature stop codon but does render the gene product non functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine Lewis et al. 2010 . When in homozygous condition the three mutations result in tobacco plants with 1 reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine and 2 a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N nitrosonornicotine NNN a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 also provides phenotypic stability for the nicotine conversion trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome LC method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars.

The original tobacco cultivar K346 is a fertile inbred line. CMS K346 is a cytoplasmic male sterile version of the original K346. To develop K346 SRC an individual plant of K346 is initially pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98 325 6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. Findividuals originating from this cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parent K346 to produce BCFprogeny. BCFprogeny are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single triple heterozygous BCFplant is backcrossed to K346 to produce BCFprogeny. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BCF BCF BCF BCF and BCFstages. At the BCFstage individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self pollinated to produce BCFseed. A large number of BCFprogeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. A single BCFplant homozygous for all three mutations is self pollinated to produce a BCFfamily K346 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of K346 were replaced by the mutant cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles .

The male sterile CMS version of K346 SRC CMS K346 SRC is produced by crossing a plant of CMS K346 as a female with pollen of K346 SRC to produce male sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is then subsequently backcrossed as a female to K346 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS K346 SRC line. Because the line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with K346 SRC.

K346 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry yield and physical quality at three North Carolina field research locations during 2012 Oxford Rocky Mount Kinston . K346 is included for comparison.

Hybrid cultivar NC196 SRC is a backcross derived version of flue cured tobacco cultivar NC196 carrying introduced deleterious mutations in three genes CYP82E4 SEQ ID NO 5 CYP82E5 SEQ ID NO 8 and CYP82E10 SEQ ID NO 9 previously documented to encode for nicotine demethylase enzymes Lewis et al. 2010 . The introduced mutations in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 and CYP82E5 cyp82e5v2 W422Stop SEQ ID NO 2 encode for premature stop codons which render the genes non functional. The introduced mutation in CYP82E10 cyp82e10 P381S SEQ ID NO 11 does not encode for a premature stop codon but does render the gene product non functional for converting nicotine to nornicotine Lewis et al. 2010 . When in homozygous condition the three mutations result in tobacco plants with 1 reduced genetic capacity to demethylate nicotine to form nornicotine and 2 a corresponding diminished potential to accumulate N nitrosonornicotine NNN a potent carcinogen found in many tobacco products. The mutation in CYP82E4 cyp82e4 W329Stop SEQ ID NO 1 also provides phenotypic stability for the nicotine conversion trait and eliminates the requirement to utilize the cumbersome LC method for reducing levels of nornicotine in tobacco cultivars.

The original tobacco cultivar NC196 is a hybrid generated by pollinating plants of a male sterile breeding line CMS NCTG 61 with pollen produced by fertile breeding line NC1562 1. To develop hybrid cultivar NC196 SRC individual plants of fertile NCTG 61 and NC1562 1 are first pollinated with a plant of the genetic background DH98 325 6 carrying mutations in each of the three nicotine demethylase genes. Findividuals originating from each cross and heterozygous for each mutation are backcrossed to the recurrent parents NCTG 61 or NC1562 1 to produce BCFprogenies.

BCFprogenies are screened using genotyping methodologies to identify individuals heterozygous for all three mutations. A single BCFplant from each pedigree is backcrossed to either NCTG 61 or NC1562 1 respectively to produce BCFprogenies. The process of backcrossing and identification of individuals heterozygous for all three mutations is repeated through the BCF BCF BCF BCF and BCFstages. At the BCFstage individuals heterozygous for all three mutations from each pedigree are self pollinated to produce BCFseed. A large number of BCFprogeny from each pedigree are genotyped to identify individuals homozygous for all three mutations. BCFplants homozygous for all three mutations are self pollinated to produce BCFfamilies NCTG 61 SRC and NC1562 1 SRC in which the wild type CYP82E4 CYP82E5v2 and CYP82E10 alleles of NCTG 61 and NC1562 1 are replaced by the mutant cyp82e4 W329Stop cyp82e5v2 W422Stop and cyp82e10 P381S alleles .

The female parental line of NC196 CMS NCTG 61 is cytoplasmic male sterile which causes pollen to not be produced. To develop CMS NCTG 61 SRC a plant of CMS NCTG 61 is crossed with NCTG 61 SRC to produce male sterile plants heterozygous for all three mutations. A single male sterile plant resulting from this cross is backcrossed as a female to NCTG 61 SRC to produce progeny that are segregating for individuals homozygous for all three mutations. Triple homozygous individuals are identified by DNA genotyping to produce the CMS NCTG 61 SRC line. Because the line is male sterile it is maintained via pollination with NCTG 61 SRC.

Hybrid cultivar NC196 SRC is produced by pollinating plants of CMS NCTG 61 SRC with pollen of NC1562 1 SRC.

Hybrid cultivar NC196 SRC is evaluated for cured leaf chemistry yield and physical quality at three North Carolina field research locations during 2012 Oxford Rocky Mount Kinston . Hybrid cultivar NC196 is included for comparison. The experimental design at each location is a randomized complete block design with four replications. Experimental units are single 20 plant plots.
