title: Merchant/customer POS interaction system
abstract: Systems and methods for providing merchant/customer interaction include determining that a tablet computer is in a merchant orientation, retrieving merchant product information according to a received instruction and merchant orientation information, and displaying a merchant screen on the tablet computer that includes the merchant product information according to the merchant orientation information. A change in the orientation of the tablet computer enclosure/stand is then detected from the merchant orientation to a customer orientation. In response, the merchant screen is transitioned on the tablet computer display to a customer screen as the tablet computer enclosure/stand changes orientations by moving the merchant screen and the customer screen linearly while in a stacked orientation. The customer screen includes the merchant product information displayed according to customer orientation information such that the merchant product information is displayed differently on the customer screen relative to the merchant screen.

The present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 921 352 filed on Dec. 27 2013.

The present disclosure generally relates to online and or mobile payments and more particularly to a merchant customer interaction system that may be used for online and or mobile payments in a physical store setting.

More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as for example the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on line merchant or retailer and the consumer and payment is typically made by entering credit card or other financial information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on line or mobile payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.

Merchant customer interactions in physical merchant locations have been conventionally limited to interactive kiosks and Point Of Sale POS devices. Kiosks are provided for customer use and may include a computer and display that are provided in the physical merchant location and that allow customers to search for items for sale by the merchant. POS devices are provided for merchant use and may include a register product identification equipment e.g. scanners and a display so that users can see the cost of their items when they are identified. These systems limit the ability of the merchant and customers to interact as they are typically provided for either the customer or the merchant and the only interaction occurs when the customer cannot find something using the kiosk or when the customer views an item price and pays the merchant for their item s .

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

The present disclosure describes systems and methods for providing merchant customer interactions as well as Point Of Sale POS functionalities. In the embodiments discussed below those systems and methods include a POS device with a tablet computer and a tablet computer enclosure stand that provide what is referred to herein as a rocker POS tablet . The tablet computer enclosure stand of the rocket POS tablet has a triangularly shaped cross section with three primary use surfaces a tablet computer display surface and two base surfaces that share a common edge and operate to support the rocker POS tablet in different orientations. Software and hardware devices in the rocket POS tablet provide for the recognition of the different orientations such that when the rocker POS tablet is in a merchant orientation merchant product information is displayed differently than when the rocker POS tablet is in a customer orientation. In operation the rocker POS tablet may be positioned on a support surface and transitioned between its different orientations and during transition a merchant screen is transitioned to a customer screen by moving or more accurately providing the illusion of movement of the stacked merchant screen and customer screen linearly relative to the tablet computer display. The display of merchant product differently in the merchant orientation and the customer orientation allows the merchant to view merchant specific product information e.g. inventory data product margins costs customer data etc. then transition the POS rocket tablet to the customer orientation so that the customer may view customer specific information e.g. product images .

In some embodiments of the present disclosure customers may interact with merchants with the help of a payment service provider. For example as discussed below the rocker POS tablet may be a merchant device operated by a merchant. While conventional payment techniques such as credit cards are discussed below as being enabled by the rocker POS tablet in other embodiments the customer may pay using a customer device and a payment service provider account. A payment service provider may use a payment service provider device to provide payment service provider accounts to merchants and customers by for example linking financial accounts of the merchant and customer that are provided by account providers using account provider devices to those payment service provider accounts. Transactions may then be conducted between the merchants and customers by for example the customer using their customer device and merchant using their merchant device to provide details of a purchase to the payment service provider device and the payment service provider using the payment service provider device to transfer funds from the financial account of the customer to the financial account of the merchant to pay for a product. However this is only one example of how the rocker POS tablet may accept a payment and while other examples are presented below any payment technique is envisioned as falling within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to a method for providing merchant customer interactions is illustrated. The method described and illustrated below may be performed with any of the rocker POS tablets or and or a rocker POS tablet that includes any combinations of the features of the rocker POS tablets or . In the discussions below illustrate a merchant customer payment interaction enabled by the method while illustrate a merchant customer service interaction enabled by the method . However one of skill in the art in possession of the present disclosure will recognize that a wide variety of other merchant customer interactions will fall within its scope.

Referring first to an embodiment of the method begins at block where a rocker POS tablet is determined to be in a first orientation. illustrate the tablet computer enclosure stand POS rocker tablet in a first orientation A that is referred to below as a merchant orientation A. In the merchant orientation A the tablet computer enclosure stand POS rocker tablet is positioned on a support surface such that the first base surface engages the support surface as illustrated in . The tablet computer and or the tablet computer enclosure stand or may include an orientation determination device such as for example a gyroscope an accelerometer a camera combinations thereof and or a variety of other devices known in the art that provide data that may be processed to determine an orientation or a change in orientation of the tablet computer . In an embodiment of block the processing system in the tablet computer may retrieve orientation information from the orientation determination device s and reference a database in a non transitory computer readable medium that stores merchant orientation information and customer orientation information.

In an embodiment a user of the rocker POS tablet may define the merchant orientation A with merchant orientation information that provides the orientation data associated with the rocker POS tablet when in the first base surface is laid flat on the support surface . For example when the tablet computer in the tablet computer housing is oriented at the angle to the support surface illustrated in that tablet computer is associated with particular orientation data and that orientation data may be defined as the merchant orientation A and stored in the database. Thus at block the orientation determination device s in the tablet computer may provide orientation data that describes the angle that the tablet computer is oriented at relative to the support surface and the processor in the tablet computer may determine that that orientation data is associated with the merchant orientation A in the database.

In an embodiment the merchant orientation information associated with the merchant orientation A in the database provides information on how a variety of information should be displayed on the tablet computer display . For example the merchant orientation information may define which types of information may be displayed how that information may be displayed which types of information are accessible. The merchant orientation information is used in the systems and methods described herein to provide merchant users the ability to access and view information that is meant for the merchant users but not for customer users. As such the merchant orientation information may ensure that data retrieved by merchant users is displayed in a manner that provides the merchant users with the ability to quickly and easily sort through product data process a purchase and or provide a number of other merchant actions known in the art.

The method then proceeds to block where merchant product information is retrieved. In an embodiment while in the merchant orientation A instructions may be received through the tablet computer . For example the tablet computer display may be a touch screen display that allows a user to provide inputs that may be interpreted as instructions to retrieve merchant product information perform payment functions and or perform a variety of other functions known in the art. Referring now to the rocker POS tablet is illustrated displaying a merchant home screen while in the merchant orientation A. In an embodiment when the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet is positioned in the merchant orientation A the tablet computer may operate to display the merchant home screen according to the merchant orientation information. To contrast when the rocker POST tablet is in the customer orientation discussed below a customer home screen may be displayed that is different from the merchant home screen and includes for example a customer kiosk screen that allows a customer to browse through products offered at the physical merchant location.

In the illustrated embodiment the merchant home screen includes a plurality of rocker POS tablet functionality buttons including a user sign in button a view inventory button a check out customer button and a find customer button . For example in the illustrated embodiment a user of the rocker POS tablet may be logged in and the user sign in button may be selected to log that user out and log in a different user. In another example the view inventory button may be selected to view merchant product information associated with an inventory at the physical merchant location discussed in further detail below. In another example the check out customer button may be selected to check a customer out when that customer is purchasing products and or services referred to henceforth as products discussed in further detail below. In another example the find customers in store button may be selected to locate customers within the physical merchant location e.g. customers that have signed in to a physical merchant location system that provides for the tracking of those customers . While a few examples have been provided one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of functionality may be provided on the merchant home screen while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to the merchant user of the rocker POS tablet has selected the check out customer button on the merchant home screen when the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet was in the merchant orientation A. In response the scanning device has been activated illustrated in to allow products to be scanned into the tablet computer e.g. by positioning products such that an identification code is located in a scanning field . In this manner products that the customer wishes to purchase may be scanned into the tablet computer using the scanning device . In addition one or more merchant screens may be provided on the rocker POS tablet that allow the user to enter products into the tablet computer e.g. by selecting products displayed on the merchant screen . When all products are scanned or entered in a credit card of the customer may be run through the credit card slot such that that credit card is read by the credit card reader in the tablet computer enclosure stand as illustrated in

The method then proceeds to block where merchant screen s are displayed. In an embodiment the instruction s received at block may be used to retrieve merchant product information customer information and or other information known in the art and that retrieved information may be provided on a merchant screen according to the merchant orientation information. Referring now to the rocker POS tablet is illustrated displaying a merchant screen according to the merchant orientation information associated with the merchant orientation A in the database. The merchant screen includes retrieved merchant product information such as a product image product purchase details e.g. product descriptions and price in the illustrated embodiment and amount due information . The merchant screen also includes retrieved customer information such as a credit card number a customer name e.g. retrieved from a database using the credit card number and links to information about the customers previous visits to the physical merchant location previous purchases from the physical merchant location and rewards from purchasing at the physical merchant location. Thus while in the merchant orientation A the merchant screen s provided include may include information only intended for viewing by the merchant user such as credit card information customer information collected by the merchant and or a variety of other merchant intended information known in the art.

The method then proceeds to block where a change in the orientation of the rocker POS tablet is detected. Referring to when the user has completed merchant operations with the rocker POS tablet in the merchant orientation A e.g. scanning products entering products reading cards etc. the merchant user may rotate the rocker POS tablet to reorient the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet into a customer orientation C. illustrates an embodiment of the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the merchant orientation A to an intermediate orientation B by rotating the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet in the direction indicated in about the engagement of the common second edge and the support surface . illustrates an embodiment of the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the intermediate orientation B to the customer orientation C by continuing to rotate the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet about the engagement of the common second edge and the support surface until the second base surface engages the support surface

The method then proceeds to block where the merchant screen is transitioned to a customer screen. While discussed as separate method blocks one of skill in the art will recognize that blocks and may occur substantially simultaneously. As discussed above a user of the rocker POS tablet may define the merchant orientation A with merchant orientation information that includes the orientation data associated with the rocker POS tablet when in the first base surface is laid flat on the support surface . Similarly the user of the rocker POS tablet may define the customer orientation C with customer orientation information that includes the orientation data associated with the rocker POS tablet when in the second base surface is laid flat on the support surface . For example when oriented at an angle to the support surface the tablet computer in the tablet computer housing is associated with orientation data and that orientation data may be defined as the customer orientation C and stored in the database. Thus at block the orientation determination device s in the tablet computer may provide orientation data that describes the angle that the tablet computer is oriented at relative to the support surface and the processor in the tablet computer may determine that that orientation data is associated with a transition of the tablet computer from the merchant orientation A to the customer orientation C.

In response to detecting the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet the tablet computer may operate to transition the merchant screen to a customer screen . illustrates the rocker POS tablet in the intermediate orientation B and transitioning from the merchant screen to the customer screen . In the illustrated embodiment the merchant screen and the customer screen are positioned in a stacked orientation with from the merchant user s point of view the customer screen stacked upside down on top of the merchant screen and during the transition of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the merchant orientation A to the intermediate orientation B the stacked merchant screen customer screen are rendered by the tablet computer such that they appear to move linearly in a direction D relative to the tablet computer display .

Similarly to the merchant orientation information discussed above the customer orientation information associated with the customer orientation C in the database provides information on how a variety of information should be displayed on the tablet computer display . For example the customer orientation information may define which types of information may be displayed how that information may be displayed which types of information are accessible. The customer orientation information is used in the systems and methods described herein to provide customers with merchant product information in an easy to understand manner and without the detail provided to the merchant users or including information meant for viewing by merchant users but not by customers. As such the customer orientation information may ensure that merchant product information retrieved by merchant users is displayed to customers in a manner that provides the customers with the ability to quickly and easily understand what they are purchasing and how to complete the purchase.

In the embodiment illustrated in the customer screen includes a total amount due along with a tip section that allows the customer user to select a predetermined tip amount or provide a tip amount. In response to being provided the rocker POS tablet in the customer orientation C such that the customer screen is displayed the customer may select a tip amount in the tip section such that a customer screen is displayed as illustrated in . The customer screen provides a signing section that allows the customer to provide their signature to complete the card purchase of the products from the merchant.

Thus systems and methods for providing merchant customer payment interactions have been described that utilize a rocker POS tablet that provides merchant screens while in a merchant orientation to allow the merchant to retrieve collect and compile product information for products the customer would like to purchase and then translates to related but different customers screens when the rocker POS tablet is reoriented to a customer orientation in order to allow the customer to pay for those products. This combination of reorientation hardware and software provides for fluid and easy interactions between the merchant and the customer using the same tablet device while ensuring information meant for the merchant is not displayed to the customer by transitioning between merchant screens and customer screens that display similar information differently based on an orientation change and without the need to provide any other input to the rocker POS tablet. In the illustrated payment interaction example the merchant user may scan or enter products read credit card information and retrieve customer information when the rocker POS tablet is in the merchant orientation with all of that information displayed to the merchant user. Upon transition of the rocker POS tablet to the customer orientation that information is modified according to the customer orientation information such that only information meant for the customer is displayed e.g. an amount due an ability to provide a tip amount and the ability to provide a signature. 

Referring now to and with reference to an embodiment of the method begins at block where a rocker POS tablet is determined to be in a first orientation. illustrate the tablet computer enclosure stand POS rocker tablet in the merchant orientation A also illustrated in . The determination that the rocker POS tablet is in the merchant orientation A may be performed substantially as described above. The method then proceeds to block where merchant product information is retrieved. In an embodiment while in the merchant orientation A the instructions may be received through the merchant home screen of the rocker POS tablet while in the merchant orientation A illustrated in

Referring now to the merchant user of the rocker POS tablet may have selected the view inventory button on the merchant home screen when the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet was in the merchant orientation A. In response a complete merchant inventory screen illustrated in may be displayed that includes inventory data for the physical merchant location. For example includes a screen shot of the display of inventory data for suits including rows of different suits with information in columns that includes identification numbers suit color suit style number of suits in stock and suit price. At block the merchant user may provide instructions to the tablet computer by selecting some of the rows that include suits of interest for a customer that that user is helping by filtering the results using a filtering term and or by performing a variety of other actions known in the art. For example a customer may ask the user for a suit for a specific occasion and the user may then filter the inventory data and or select suits in that inventory data that are appropriate for that occasion.

The method then proceeds to block where merchant screen s are displayed. In an embodiment the instruction s received at block may be used to retrieve merchant product information customer information and or other information known in the art and that retrieved information may be provided on a merchant screen according to the merchant orientation information. Referring now to the rocker POS tablet is illustrated displaying a merchant screen . The merchant screen is displaying merchant product information that includes the suits that the merchant user selected for the customer at block . The product information in the illustrated embodiment includes items numbers colors style indicators inventor stock numbers and prices of each of the selected suits. However in this embodiment or other embodiments e.g. with different products services being sold by the merchant to the customer other information intended for the merchant may be displayed on the merchant screen including for example margin numbers for each product merchant incentives for selling particular products and or a variety of other merchant intended information known in the art.

The method then proceeds to block where a change in the orientation of the rocker POS tablet is detected. Referring to when the user has completed merchant operations with the rocker POS tablet in the merchant orientation A e.g. selecting suits that might be of interest to the customer etc. the user may reorient the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet into a customer orientation. illustrates an embodiment of the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the merchant orientation A to an intermediate orientation B by rotating the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet about the engagement of the second edge and the support surface . illustrates an embodiment of the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the intermediate orientation B to a customer orientation C by continuing to rotate the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet about the engagement of the second edge and the support surface until the second base surface engages the support surface

The method then proceeds to block where the merchant screen is transitioned to a customer screen. In response to detecting the change in orientation of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet substantially as described above the tablet computer may operate to transition the merchant screen to a customer screen . illustrates the rocker POS tablet in the intermediate orientation B and transitioning from the merchant screen to the customer screen . In the illustrated embodiment the merchant screen and the customer screen are positioned in a stacked orientation with from the merchant user s point of view the customer screen stacked upside down on top of the merchant screen and during the transition of the tablet computer enclosure stand rocker POS tablet from the merchant orientation A to the intermediate orientation B the stacked merchant screen customer screen are rendered by the tablet computer such that they appear to move linearly in a direction E relative to the tablet computer display .

In the embodiment illustrated in the customer screen includes product images and . In an embodiment each of the product images may correspond to a product described in the rows of the merchant product information on the merchant screen . For example the customer orientation information associated with the customer orientation C in the database may define that the suits selected by the merchant in the product information should be displayed to in the customer orientation C to a customer as product images associated with those suits in a database. Thus the merchant user may manipulate the inventory data on the merchant screen such that the merchant screen is provided with the merchant product information and then change the orientation of the rocker POS tablet to cause the tablet computer to retrieve and display the product images for the products associated with the merchant product information while ensuring that inventory data or other sensitive data is not displayed to the customer.

Thus systems and methods for providing merchant customer service interactions have been described that utilize a rocker POS tablet that provides merchant screens while in a merchant orientation to allow the merchant to retrieve collect and compile product information for products the customer would like to purchase and then translates to related but different customers screens when the rocker POS tablet is reoriented to a customer orientation in order to allow the customer to view images of those products and select products to purchase or view. This combination of reorientation hardware and software provides for fluid and easy interactions between the merchant and the customer using the same tablet device while ensuring information meant for the merchant is not displayed to the customer by transitioning between merchant screens and customer screens that display similar information differently based on an orientation change and without the need to provide any other input to the rocker POS tablet. In the illustrated service interaction example the merchant user may search through product inventories view product sale incentives or product margins narrow the list of products to be displayed to the user based on instructions from that user when the rocker POS tablet is in the merchant orientation with all of that information displayed to the merchant user. Upon transition of the rocker POS tablet to the customer orientation that information is modified according to the customer orientation information such that only information that would be of interest to the customer is displayed e.g. the product images and or descriptions.
