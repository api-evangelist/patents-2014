Unless otherwise defined all technical terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used in this specification and the appended claims the singular forms a an and the include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Any reference to or herein is intended to encompass and or unless otherwise stated.

In one embodiment a robotic sign described herein comprises a sign post a user interface one or more sign arms sign faces a back end subsystem and associated software.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a robotic sign includes an elongated sign post onto which three sign arms are attached. The sign arms are movably attached to the sign post such that each is independently able to rotate contiguously about the sign post. Further in this embodiment the robotic sign includes a decorative base for mounting the sign to a horizontal surface and a user interface panel that displays a graphic user interface for interacting with the sign.

In some embodiments a robotic sign comprises an elongated sign post onto which one or more robotic arms are movably attached. In further embodiments a robotic sign comprises an elongated sign post that optionally breaks down into two or more smaller reversibly connectable pieces for easy transport storage and or installation. In further embodiments the sign post comprises an end which includes adaptations for fixation to a surface. In some embodiments the sign post is a vertical sign post for attachment to a horizontal surface such as the ground or a base structure. In other embodiments the sign post is a horizontal sign post for attachment to a vertical surface such as the side of a building. For example the bottom end of the sign post is optionally cemented into the ground or bolted or welded to a base structure such as a plate. In some embodiments the base structure is optionally adapted for increased mobility such as by placing it on wheels or castors or the like.

In some embodiments a robotic sign comprises one or more sign arms. In further embodiments the sign arms are adapted and coupled to the sign post such that they can move in order to point in different directions and towards various locations. The movement of the arms about the sign post may be accomplished via any mechanism known to those having skill in the art. For example the movement of the arms may be performed by an electrical motor embedded inside the sign arm. The sign arms are capable of full 360 degree rotational freedom for continuous uninterrupted rotation. This rotational freedom may be accomplished by using slip rings to avoid tangling in the power and data wiring. The sign arms may move on the Y axis up down by incorporating an extender on the arm such as for example at the end of the arm.

In some embodiments internal sensors in the sign arms are used to calibrate the position of the arms. Calibration may occur as the system comes on line or at the occurrence of any other condition wherein a calibration is necessary or desirable. In some embodiments the robotic sign system will be able to determine its exact location by using GPS coordinates magnetometers or any other location determination system known to those skilled in the art and through such systems know where it is and where each of its constituent arms is pointing regardless of where it is installed. In some embodiments a closed loop feedback system using an encoder is used for real time positional information of each arm and thereby keeps track of which way each arm is pointing.

In some embodiments when wind speeds exceed a predetermined threshold the sign arms may move to face the opposite direction from the source of the wind. This is a safety protocol that will override other behavior of the sign in order to minimize the risk of the sign arms sustaining damage in heavy wind. In further embodiments the sign arms may disengage from the gear box in the event that some other external force is applied. For example in the event that a person forcibly moves an arm the arm may disengage from the gear box in order to prevent damage to the mechanism.

The sign arms and interface may be detachably coupled to the sign post such that they can be easily removed for storage and or transportation of the system.

Referring to in some embodiments a sign arm described herein comprises tinted or transparent glass or plastic a display segment a cuff access panel a ball bearing a bearing retainer a slip ring a protective cover post segment gears an encoder a uC motor controller a motor a thrust bearing and an arm chassis .

In some embodiments inside the sign arm there is a motor controller board. In further embodiments the motor controller board runs a software program that takes instructions over a RS485 bus from the main client program running inside the interface panel and performs the necessary functions to control the direction and speed of the motor and take positional feedback from the in arm sensors. In some embodiments a display item comprises display item information that includes a location or a direction in which to position the sign arm. In further embodiments the sign arm is positioned via a series of movements that form an animation such as a series of rotations or partial rotations.

The sign arm positioning feedback system optionally comprises one or more sensors described further herein . Using the positional feedback from these sensors the controller can accurately determine the direction the arm is pointing. By setting the power output and direction of the motor the controller can move the arm to a new location. As the arm is moving the controller is constantly monitoring the feedback sensors for the arm s new location. As the distance between the current location and the target location decreases the controller knows that the arm is getting closer to the target and therefore it starts slowing down the speed of the motor and the arm comes to a rest or brake when the new target location is hit.

In some embodiments the controller connected to a magnetometer which may be located in any suitable location such as located at the tip of the sign arm. The magnetometer gives the controller a compass reading as reference to where it s pointing. This way the sign can get installed very quickly in a location without the need for a manual calibration. When the sign is installed using manual calibration all sign arms are manually moved to a known compass location e.g. North and the controller program is given the instruction that it calibrated to start from this known position.

In some embodiments the sign arm has a static part which is coupled to the main center shaft. This static part may comprise of a set of gears and a small magnet. Since the magnet does not rotate with the arm a magnetic sensor reed switch triggers a reading every time the arm passes by this magnet. This way there is a fixed reference point to where the arm is pointing. When calibrated the arm using either manual calibration or a magnetometer the system monitors the number of encoder pulses the current location is in a clockwise movement from the last time the reed switch was triggered.

In some embodiments a rotary quadrature encoder gives constant real time feedback to the controller based on the relative position of the arm. The encoder also gives back information on which direction the arm is moving. This is helpful should any external force act upon the arm while in operation in either direction the controller will still be aware of the position of the arm.

In some embodiments the signs systems networks and methods described herein include a mechanism for addressing each arm. In some embodiments software sends specific commands to each arm and an addressing scheme is built into each arm. In further embodiments a mechanical DIP switch allows the operator to define a unique address for each arm on a sign installation.

When selecting a motor for robotic sign arms it is important to consider the size and torque to speed ratio. In a particular embodiment a robotic sign system uses a 1.8 degree per step stepper motor NEMA 17 sized frame. Suitable motors include those with at least 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 or 30 degrees per step. Suitable stepper motors include those having one of the following common step angles 0.36 0.72 0.9 1.8 3.75 or 7.5 . The stepper motors small step angle and relatively high torque to speed ratio allows us to drive the arms at a reasonable speed with adequate torque in mild weather or indoor applications without needing to add too much gearing.

A general rule of thumb for the requirements of the motor is that it can move the arm from standstill to full speed in about 1.5 to 3 seconds of acceleration time or at least 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 seconds of acceleration time. And the full speed of the arm should be around 0.2 RPM 5 seconds for one revolution . Depending on the size weight and inertia of the arm and also depending on the external forces such as wind load the power of the motor would need to be adjusted.

In some embodiments operating duty cycle and heat concerns need to be factored in to the decision of the motor. In certain embodiments in an outdoor operation under hot and humid climate a motor with high thermal operation rating and high IP NEMA ratings is a necessity.

In some applications the system includes one or more brushed or brushless AC or DC motor or one or more AC induction motors.

In some applications the system includes one or more DC Servo motors. In some situations this type of motor needs more care to be placed in the gearing for the sign since the servo motor typically operates at higher speeds than a stepper motor.

In some embodiments the signs systems networks and methods described herein include a mechanism adapted to brake each arm. In order to make sure that the sign arms work in windy conditions each sign arm should be fitted with a braking mechanism. Non limiting examples include an electromagnetic brake. In various embodiments when a motor with hold functionality like a stepper motor is used then it is used to hold the sign arm in place.

Each sign arm comprises one or more faces. In some embodiments one or more display screens are attached to a sign arm face. In a particular embodiment a sign arm comprises two faces each with a display screen for displaying information such as text graphical or video content. The screens optionally use any technology capable of displaying visual information now known or later invented such as for example LED LCD plasma or the like. The sign faces may display location information and iconography for locations at which the sign arms are pointing. When more than one sign arm is pointing toward the same location the sign faces may be used to form a larger display surface allowing the system to render more information to a user. See e.g. .

In some embodiments the devices systems networks and methods described herein include robotic signs or use of the same. In some embodiments each sign arm has 2 sides of screens. In certain embodiments these signs are controlled by a micro controller in each arm. A command is sent from the master controller in the bottom of the sign which is interpreted by the micro controller which subsequently draws the content to the screens. A raw frame buffer data could also be sent through from the master controller directly to the screens to be rendered effectively bypassing the controller for the rendering. Depending on the specifics on the screen resolution number of arm and internal data bandwidth in the sign rendering the content in each arm as opposed to in the master controller may be the only option. Depending on the specific installation requirements the screens could be made up of any display technology such as individual LEDs including RGB Colored LEDs in a matrix LED backlit TFT LCD e ink like displays etc. For outdoor applications a sufficiently bright screen with high contrast is necessary. Using high brightness discreet LED in a matrix is a good choice other outdoor sunlight readable displays such as transflective displays are favorable. Passive display technology could be used such as e ink or similar. This would also have the side effect of low power usage and the potential for operation with solar panels.

The dimensions of an LED array are customized. In some embodiments each axis of a LED array includes at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200 or 300 LEDs. In one embodiment a display comprises a 16 176 LED array which displays custom fonts icons etc. In another embodiment a display comprises a 32 192 LED array which displays custom fonts icons etc.

Furthermore to enhance the optics of the display especially when using discrete LEDs some embodiments cover the LEDs with a dark tinted glass or plastic in order to get the contrast up. In certain embodiments since darker material usually get s the contrast to go up but at the same time reduces the overall brightness of the display. In some embodiments 12 30 of all light is the best pairing with the discrete LEDs.

In some embodiments the optical screen in front of the sign is formed into little lenses for each pixel in order to enhance the appearance of each pixel. By molding machining or other way of fabrication we can put a special lens in front of each pixel this would help us do 2 things 1 focus the emitted light forwards and downwards to optimize the overall observed brightness of the screens 2 make each pixel appear larger and closer to its neighboring pixels.

In some embodiments the signs systems networks and methods described herein include an interface. The interface may be any user interface known to those skilled in the art such as a panel with an input mechanism. In some embodiments the interface is a screen that displays a map of the location in which the system is placed. The interface panel has input options for a user to select options and navigate through information. In some embodiments the interface is coupled to the system in any convenient way as in for example by mounting it onto the sign post at a convenient height for users. The interface may have a graphical user interface to display menu options and or other information to users and or buttons and or a touch screen or some other combination known to those skilled in the art in order to allow users to select from menu options. The menu options provided may enable users to request data relating to various categories of information such as but not limited to food shopping transportation services special events and the like. The system may include functionality to send directions or other information collected from the system to users such as for example by sending the information to users wireless devices such as smart phones smart watches and the like.

Various options may be available to users and are limited only by the imagination. Options may be static or they may change. Options may change manually by administrative input or may change automatically as in for example 

The various options on this list as well as other options that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art can dictate which menu options appear but can also cause the content of the sign faces to change for a given menu option.

In addition to a touch based interface users may interact with the system through any other interaction methods currently known to those skilled in the art or later invented. For example the system may detect a user s heart beat heart rate detect the type of clothing they are wearing determine what they are holding and the like and display information related to that collected information. For example a woman holding a shopping bag from a shoe store may receive information about additional shoe shopping in the vicinity.

When a user selects one of the menu options at least one of the sign arms will update its position and content in order to display information relevant to the selected option.

The system may connect to the internet via any methods known to those skilled in the art such as for example via Wi Fi wired Ethernet cellular network and or fiber optic network. The interface may provide the internet connection.

The smart sign may further comprise a computer the interface computer which may be operatively coupled to the interface the smart sign and a back end system. The interface computer may be operatively coupled to the sign arms and sign faces via any method known to those skilled in the art as in for example over a RS485 serial bus.

The interface computer serves as the communications port between the back end system and the sign arms and display faces. The interface computer may communicate in real time with the sign arms and sign faces as well as with the back end system. The interface computer may be coupled to a plurality of input sensors such as for example optical systems and climate sensors such as wind speed and temperature.
