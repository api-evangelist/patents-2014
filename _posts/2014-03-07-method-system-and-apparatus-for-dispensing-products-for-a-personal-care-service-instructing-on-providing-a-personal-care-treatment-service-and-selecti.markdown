This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional application Ser. No. 61 847 214 filed on Jul. 17 2013 the complete contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

The invention relates to methods systems and apparatus for dispensing products for a personal care and more particularly to a method system and apparatus for facilitating the dispensing of personal care products such as a beauty product such as for example a hair colorant where the hair colorant components are delivered in a dosage to provide a resultant hair colorant product having the desired characteristics. The invention also may be configured to dispense shampoo conditioner skin and scalp treatments and other beauty and personal care products.

Beauty treatments often involve the use of products to enhance repair or rejuvenate the skin hair or body of an individual to improve or change the appearance or characteristic of the individual. One example of a beauty treatment involves hair coloring. Hair coloring compositions are used for coloring human hair. They may be applied by individuals in the home or professionally in salons and studios. The purpose of hair coloring is to bring about a particular look with the color which for some individuals may involve returning graying hair to its original color and for others may involve altering the individual s hair color by changing it to a different color which may be for reasons that the individual desires such as for example a fashion trend or style .

Hair coloring generally is distributed in tubes and bottles. In some cases the components of a hair colorant may need to be separately provided in order to prolong their useful life or because of certain adverse chemical reactions that may take place if stored together. The colorist often utilizes colorant from one or more tubes. In many cases the colorant or coloring chemicals are wasted as some of the chemical remains in the tube. Generally the tubes are supplied containing 2 oz. of colorant. In addition the colorist or stylist carrying out the coloring of an individual s hair may be required to mix colors which in some cases may require a small amount of one particular color. Often where a small amount of coloring compound is used the remainder of the coloring compound in the tube must be disposed of leading to waste both of chemicals as well as the container that held the coloring and packaging. In addition mixing colors to arrive at a desired color involves time in measuring and matching the colorant components to arrive at the desired color.

The tubes for hair coloring are usually hand squeezed from the bottom. Most hair coloring jobs require an admixture of colors and hence mixing of dyes from different tubes. The hair colors or dyes must be mixed with a developer and in some cases a bleach may be added. Once the dyes are squeezed from the tubes the dyes as well as developer and bleach that also may have been added are mixed together which is conventionally performed by hand. One prior attempt to automate removal of the dyes from their tubes is disclosed in US Patent Application no. 2009 0161481 which provides rollers that receive the end of the tube compress it therebetween and squeeze the dye therefrom. The roller motor may be controlled to provide a desired amount of rotation or squeezing. The 481 application also discloses a separate agitator that is used to mix the dyes that have been squeezed from the tube or alternatively a separate mixing station.

U.S. Pat. No. 7 758 347 B2 discloses a system for simulating a resulting custom hair color imparted to hair by a custom hair coloring composition formulated from a mixture of two different hair color preparations with a computer system for generating a visual image representative of a likely resulting custom hair color.

EP 1 374 720 discloses a method for selecting a desired resulting custom hair color imparted to hair by a hair dye product. A user may use a touch screen to select a hair coloring product such as a product on a store shelf and the user may enter information about the product or scan the bar code of the product to enter the information. The screen may display a message prompting the user to input information relating to the type of coloration desired grey coverage root coverage or highlight and or information relating to the initial condition of the hair apart from its initial color e.g. previously colored never colored and or damaged . The 720 patent document discloses that the information may be later used by a micro processing system to predict the resulting color of the coloration and or predict a suitable product for the type of coloration desired. The 720 patent document further discloses displaying visual images on a computer screen for comparison. The 720 patent further discloses a loyalty card smart card RFI chip and CD Disk as a marketing tool that may be used with its device to allow the consumers to earn points discounts or coupons.

EP 0 443 741 A discloses an apparatus and a method to formulate a custom mixed cosmetic product in response to specific input criteria disclosed to be combinations of hair damage criteria hair porosity criteria and hair diameter criteria. The 741 patent document discloses formulating and dispensing a custom mixed cosmetic hair treatment product at the point of sale in response to input criteria. Containers for storing cosmetically functional mixtures that are adapted to interact when proper amounts are mixed to form a cosmetic hair treatment product are disclosed. Mating male and female members with a different shape are provided as a locking means for connecting a container to a reservoir to ensure that the proper mixture is located in the proper container position.

EP 1 817 976 discloses a method that involves inputting into a computer system an initial hair color of the hair a first shade component amount from a defined collection a second color shade component amount from the collection and one or more amounts of one or more additional color shade components from the defined collection. The 976 patent documents discloses using a computer to predict a likely resulting custom hair color based on the inputted initial hair color of the hair and the inputted component amounts and to generate a visual image that represents the likely color to simulate the hair.

In addition alternative blends may be made to adjust the custom blend such as for time of year other treatment applied and the like.

Currently in the industry the area behind a shampoo area is known as a backbar . The present invention provides a solution that automates the salon hair care products so the task may became automated and therefore a benefit is that salons may greatly reduce or eliminate potential waste and theft by having what were previously the backbar products dispensed in the same or similar way for each individual hair salon client. According to one preferred embodiment the hair products e.g. shampoos conditioners treatments and the like may be dispensed onto a biodegradable dose cup and then carried to the sink.

According to another embodiment a warehouse location may be implemented to serve as a fulfillment center where customers may order hair care products on line and have the order filled and shipped from the fulfillment center. Alternately the client customer orders may be automatically refilled per client customer s request. The warehouse or fulfillment location preferably also warehouses bulk product for locations as well as performing the fill and ship operations for consumers that place on line orders. Preferably the warehouse location has a communication network that communicates with the locations that it serves. Accordingly the apparatus for dispensing products hair coloring treatments shampoo and conditioners preferably has a communication component that communicates with the warehouse network. The apparatus is configured with a sensing mechanism that senses the number of dispenses of a particular product and or the amount of product dispensed and or levels of product remaining so that when the product level is low or at a predetermined threshold or level a communication is made from the apparatus to the warehouse and products may be shipped automatically from the warehouse to the location where the apparatus is located. According to a preferred embodiment the control mechanism may be configured with software having instructions to record the installation of a product bag on the machine. The dispensings from the pump which may be the total duration of the pump operation may be determinative of the need to replace a bag. For example the control mechanism may be programmed with instructions to implement an inventory search or reorder routine when the pump has operated for a particular duration that corresponds with an amount of product dispensed from its respective product bag. An identification tag may be provided on each product bag. According to preferred embodiments the identification tag preferably is a communicative tag that contains information that may be electronically read and communicated. According to an alternate embodiment the component container such as a bag or a box in which the bag is contained has an RFID element e.g. such as an RFID chip or tag associated with it that identifies information about the product component in the bag which may for example include the product name manufacturer batch and lot numbers expiration date shipment date quantity as well as temperature changes. As used herein RFID tag or chip refers to an RFID component that may be provided with information that may be read with a reader through interrogation of the RFID component.

RFID components generally involve the use of an interrogator that includes an interrogator antenna or coil and a transceiver with decoder . A transponder is provided with a transponder antenna or coil and is generally referred to as the RFID tag. The RFID tag may be programmed with a unique serial number or other identifying data uniquely identifying that particular tag from other tags in addition to other information about the component in the container such as the product name manufacturer batch and lot numbers expiration date shipment date quantity as well as temperature changes that the product may have gone through . The RFID tag is read with an interrogator antenna which emits signals which preferably are radio signals. Interrogators may read and write data to the RFID tag. Generally the antenna may be used to relay the information between the RFID tag and the transceiver which decodes the information transmitted . The sensing and monitoring mechanism of the invention preferably employ RFID components including RFID tags that are placed on the containers and in some embodiments on the pumps and lines antennae which are preferably short range antennae or interrogators with limited field that are respectively placed on the dispensing device to read the RFID tag of a respectively placed container and wider range antennae used to detect the presence of the containers in a broader area e.g. at the salon or location of the dispensing device to keep track of product component inventory . According to preferred embodiments the information obtained from the interrogation of the RFID tags is communicated to a server or other data handling component or computing device. Preferably the system is configured to distinguish inventory of component containers present in the salon from components that are at the salon but already in use on the dispensing device. Although the RFID tags of the respective containers installed on the device and in use may be sensed by the wide range interrogator or antenna if they may be read by the same frequency the information sensed and relayed by the limited range antenna may be used to identify the in use component based on the unique identification as a component already in use and therefore separate from the supply inventory. According to preferred embodiments the RFID tags are passive tags. Alternatively active tags may be used but generally they are more expensive due to the inclusion of a power source such as for example a battery.

According to preferred embodiments an RFID tag or chip may be positioned at a location on the container such as the box as part of a sensing and monitoring mechanism for providing an indication of product level in the bag or preferably determining a threshold level e.g. such as for example a low level of product . The control mechanism may monitor the information about the component container including information obtained in connection with the reading of the respective RFID tag as well as RFID generated or sensed information e.g. temperature . A sensing and monitoring mechanism is employed to sense the presence of beauty product components and monitor their presence and usage.

According to one embodiment the sensing and monitoring mechanism for sensing and monitoring the usage of the beauty component in the container or bag such as for example a hair colorant component is configured to provide an output that corresponds to a condition. One condition is when the amount of the hair colorant in the container reaches a low level. The sensing of a low level indication preferably generates an output where the preferred output may be to generate at least one instruction to check the supply of that component on hand and another instruction to reorder the component. The component containers in inventory which may be present at the hair salon location e.g. where the dispensing apparatus is deployed and operated preferably each include an RFID tag that includes the identity of the product component as well as other information about the product component. The apparatus is therefore able to make a determination whether there exists inventory at the apparatus location. The RFID tags preferably may be interrogated by a signal generated or issued by a signal issuing component which may include for example an interrogator or antenna configured to read the RFID tag and a transponder as well as including through a Wi Fi access point or router or other communication component that may be used to transmit signals encoded or decoded .

An interrogator is configured to generate a signal and read the RFID tags that are respectively associated with the respective containers. The inventory control system preferably is used in conjunction with a computing component including for example the control system or remote computer that includes software with instructions for implementing captures of the RFID information data from containers on the device as well as containers located at the dispensing location. In addition the inventory control system may include a communication link between the dispenser and a remote computing component through which supplies may be ordered.

The inventory control system also facilitates guarding against product waste through theft or misplacement of items . The RFID tag also may be configured to provide a location of where a product bag has been sensed. For example where theft is a concern according to some embodiments the RFID tag is configured so that it may be interrogated through a signal to provide its location. According to a preferred embodiment the RFID tag of each container may be utilized to monitor the beauty product component prior to its installation and use as well as during its use on the device and after it has been consumed. Monitoring may be implemented by keeping track of the pump operation of each respective pump and respective dispensings for each component. The information regarding the usage of components preferably is stored on a storage component of the device or server. The usage information preferably is communicated to a monitoring mechanism such as for example a computing component configured with software to receive and store information relating to the usage of the component product and container based on pump dispensings and component install date evaluate the level of content and generate an output that may be a reorder of the product or a check on inventory or both if there is none or a low level of inventory of product . For example the output generated may correspond to a condition where the amount of said beauty product component in a bag has reached a low level. The output may be an instruction that is issued or generated to the salon device text message or other notification mechanism to check the supply on hand of the beauty product component whose condition was sensed to be at a low level. The output also may generate an automatic reorder of the low level component which may be done when the level is sensed to be low or after the inventory level of that component at the dispensing location has been checked for the presence of additional inventory.

According to a preferred embodiment as shown in a sensor such as for example an RFID tag is provided on the container and is shown positioned at a location on the container so that when the container is placed on the dispensing apparatus the tag aligns with a reader antenna .

Preferably as with the tag an RFID tag is provided on each one of the respective containers installed on the device . The reader antenna is disposed at a reading distance to interrogate the RFID tag . The antenna for example may be a near field short range UHF antenna and a plurality of antenna may be provided so that for each slot or space on the apparatus for a container there is a corresponding respective antenna to read the container RFID tag. The RFID tags preferably are provided with identification data that identifies each beauty product component bag and its contents independent of any other beauty product component bag e.g. though a unique serial number assigned to the RFID tag . A reader is provided on the device at each location where a container is to be installed so it is able to interrogate the RFID tag of a container that is installed in the device at the reader location. A temperature sensor for sensing temperature may be provided in conjunction with the RFID tag so that temperature information also is included as part of the RFID data or information relayed. Where the temperature sensor or component also is associated with a container or bag the temperature component also may provide information and the sensed information may include the RFID information about the container as well as the temperature or temperature change that the container and its contents have undergone. According to a preferred embodiment the temperature sensor or component senses the temperature of a component bag in regard to its respective RFID identification data and the temperature sensor in connection with the reader communicates the RFID identification data and usage information to a computing component where the information may be processed to determine the stability of beauty product component in the bag. The computing component designated to receive the information may be on the dispenser itself such as the control mechanism or may be remote from the dispenser and dispensing location and linked through a communication network e.g. Internet VPN or the like .

According to one preferred embodiment communication with an RFID tag provided on the beauty component bag may be carried out using an open wireless standard that provides the ability for exchanging data between another component such as a server or base station and other machines using radio transmissions or other network or communication transmission such as through the Internet a VPN and the like. The sensing and monitoring mechanism determines an amount of beauty product component present within the container such as for example the bag or container . The sensing and monitoring mechanism preferably includes a sensor chip such as an RFID tag that is mounted on the container. The sensing and monitoring mechanism also may be used for sensing a component level at the location of use such as a salon. Although the sensing and monitoring mechanism may be used to determine the level of component in a container or bag and potential available inventory on hand of a component for use in the apparatus e.g. at a salon the sensing and monitoring mechanism also may be implemented to monitor beauty products purchased by the consumer for use at home. This is done preferably through user data such as anticipated need and usage previous orders and expected usage. For example the user may purchase beauty products such as for example shampoo. According to some embodiments the shampoo may be specially formulated and customized for that user. According to a preferred embodiment the server may be configured with instructions to monitor the user s use or expected usage of product based on historic usage by that user frequency of reorders information from the user profile and anticipated or expected use or combinations of these. The system software also may include instructions that provide the user such as the consumer with an option that automatically places an order for more inventory of the product that is low such as a shampoo or alternatively or in addition provides the user with an option or reminder to place an order. According to a preferred embodiment as discussed herein the consumer may be introduced to products at a salon where the product is used on and even formulated specially for the consumer and the consumer may have the ability to purchase the same product. The product may be made available through a distribution center that is linked to the consumer information that the salon uses and may store. The consumer therefore may purchase the same formulation even if a custom formulation. The formulation also if desired may remain proprietary so the consumer may not have the ability to purchase the product other than at the salon where it is used on or sold to the consumer or from a distribution location e.g. online order that is prepared and shipped to the consumer from a distribution location . The apparatus may be used at a salon location or may also be used at a central distribution location so products may be produced packaged and shipped to the consumer. The apparatus may be provided in multiple units where a distribution location required more demand than a salon. Alternatively the apparatus may be scaled to be larger to produce multiple containers of customized product at a time. A label or bar code associating the consumer identification with the container in which it is dispensed. Alternatively or in addition thereto the information may be provided on a chip or tag such as for example an RFID tag. According to preferred embodiments of the invention the communication between sensor enabled devices such as for example product containers may take place through the use of components including those associated for use with machine to machine communications which may include sensors RFID elements Wi Fi and or other communications links such as cellular. In addition the control mechanism of the invention may include software with instructions to instruct a hardware processor to aid a networked device to store and interpret data and make decisions such as whether to reorder product or generate an alert of a product expiration or other condition. The product usage for the apparatus as well as home use of a product may be monitored with the control mechanism which may be part of the apparatus or through communications links to a server that may be remote from the control mechanism of the apparatus which may be provided to link through a communications network preferably thorough one or more communicating devices.

The apparatus may be configured with a control mechanism that includes a timer. The timer may be alternatively or additionally includes as part of a sensing and monitoring mechanism. According to a preferred embodiment the timer may be associated with the sensing and monitoring mechanism and be configured to operate so that when product is dispensed the time of dispensing is recorded and considered. For example for some component products that are used more frequently than other components the level for reorder may be different versus the level of reorder for product components that are not consumed as rapidly .

Information relayed from the sensing and monitoring mechanism including RFID sensed information relating to usage and inventory as well as timed usage information may be provided to a computing component that is linked with the distribution and or warehousing of the product and product components used by the apparatus . According to a preferred embodiment information may be relayed from the apparatus to a warehouse ordering component which may comprise a computer with a network connection that is linked for communication with the dispensing apparatus . The ordering component may be programmed to receive information communicated by the apparatus . The information communicated by the apparatus may include the levels of product. According to some embodiments the ordering component also is linked to an order database which preferably includes the product shipments and the product levels as well as product to be ordered may also take into account product shipped from the warehouse to the apparatus location. For example where an apparatus sensing and monitoring mechanism includes a component that senses and communicates that the level of a product is low the warehouse ordering component may receive that information but may not ship a product if the warehouse ordering component already has information that the apparatus location has product stock on hand e.g. of the component or product associated with that low level value and that product stock on hand is suitable. Alternatively according to some embodiments the warehouse component may receive information or interrogate the apparatus location through issuance of instructions to activate one or more readers or interrogators to scan for the existence of component at that location. According to some embodiments the warehouse ordering component may be configured to determine when stock is insufficient and when levels of product being used by the apparatus are low so that a timely shipment of product may be provided to the apparatus location before depletion of the current supply that the apparatus already has immediately available to it.

According to a preferred embodiment the warehouse location preferably includes an apparatus for filling shampoo treatment and conditioner for internet sales. The warehouse location preferably also has an apparatus which may be similar to the apparatus but designed for larger multiple orders and for packaging an already dispensed and mixed product.

Although the apparatus includes a stage on which a container such as the bowl is placed to receive components dispensed from the dispensing nozzles according to an alternate embodiment a conveyor type arrangement of dispensing nozzles may be provided as an alternative. For example according to a one alternate embodiment a conveyor belt countertop is provided in place of or on the stage and the nozzles are arranged in a linear arrangement with dispensing of each component taking place through delivery to the container or bowl when it has reached the location below where the nozzle is positioned along the conveyor path. For example a durable thick rubber like material for easy cleaning which preferably is resistant to the hair care products may be used to convey product. The conveyor may be encased and have an aesthetic quality to it. According to one embodiment the conveyor is placed within a glass or visible panel . Preferably a container is provided for receiving the product. The container is moved along the conveyor. For example according to one embodiment the conveyor has notches or another type of means for securing the container as the product is being dispensed from the dispensing apparatus. The container may make stops so the conveyor may stop at one or more locations along the apparatus as the products or product components are dispensed. According to one embodiment a sensor such as for example an object detecting device is provided to detect whether a container is in the proper place. This facilitates reduction of both accidents and product waste as the sensor preferably is linked for communication to the apparatus controls e.g. such as a control mechanism so that when an out of place container is sensed then the apparatus ceases dispensing and sends an alert signal to the operator or other appropriate individual or component designated to receive the alert. According to this alternate embodiment the product is dispensed in a linear fashion and the apparatus includes a processor and media such as a chip flash memory or a hard drive that contains instructions for instructing the processor to control the distance of travel of the conveyor or belt in order to position the container under the appropriate dispensing tube or nozzle of the dispensing apparatus. The container may move along the path of travel or conveying path to each necessary fill point and then move on to the next point. The apparatus also may include an alerting mechanism that emits a sound to alert that the fill is starting and finishing or even to announce the number being filled the number corresponding to the order number of the order for the hair product desired to be dispensed from the apparatus . According to some preferred embodiments the panel or a voice alert may be provides to provide an ingredient count such as blending begins now or such as filling 1 4 7 12 . . . or blend complete. 

According to embodiments of the invention the dispensing apparatus includes a plurality of tubes or lines such as the lines shown and described herein that connect with a respective product containers or component bags such as a bag contained in a box . According to a preferred embodiment as shown and discussed herein the beauty product component is a hair color component provided in a bag housed within a cardboard box. The product component bag preferably has a port with a connector that connects with the product container or bag. According to the alternate embodiment where the apparatus is configured to dispense along a linear path the lines or tubes used to deliver product from the bag to the container may be uniform so that the tube may be made a consistent measurable length making the apparatus more economical and reducing the supply of parts required to maintain the apparatus . In addition the apparatus may be configured with the display and or control mechanism separately located from the pumps bags and other parts of the apparatus . The control mechanism and or display may communicate to the remotely situated pump mechanism through a secondary control provided on the apparatus that receives the instruction from the remotely situated control mechanism component and or associated display and operates the apparatus pump mechanism to deliver appropriate amounts of components to the desired receptacle such as the bowl . According to preferred embodiments the control mechanism regulates the operation of the pumping mechanism to deliver dosages of the respective beauty product components to the dispensing outlet of the device to provide a beauty product. The control mechanism also receives instructions which may be from a salon application operating on a salon computing device or from a local or remote server e.g. the salon network operator server to produce a beauty product by regulating the operation of the respective plurality of peristaltic pumps of the device to deliver dosages of beauty product components from the respective bags containing the respective beauty product components.

According to some embodiments the devices according to the invention may be configured to include the dispensing features in one room and the product containers in another room or location which is out of the sight of the area where the dispensing apparatus is used. According to some embodiments the apparatus may be configured to be installed as an over the counter concept or alternatively may be installed as a locked room and load from behind concept. According to one embodiment the apparatus may be configured to allow the installer to determine the most suitable way for the application e.g. over the counter or load from behind .

The dispensing apparatus may be configured to dispense hair coloring hair care products as well as other personal care products such as for example shampoos hair conditioners lotions and creams.

According to one exemplary embodiment the dispensing apparatus is configured to dispense components required for hair coloring and dispenses a hair dye formed from the dispensed components. One preferred embodiment is configured to dispense colors such as for example three primary colors an oxidant which may involve multiple levels of oxidant and hence two separate components and a viscosity regulating agent. According to this latter embodiment up to sixty four dispensing lines are connected with at least sixty four pumps to dispense the components to a container. Preferably the components may be supplied in bags with a port or connector for connecting to one of the designated lines or tubes of the apparatus that has been designated for that component. Colors keyed connectors or other identifying elements may be used to ensure the proper component containers or bags are connected to the appropriate tube or line. Although three colors two oxidants and one viscosity regulating agent are described there may be greater or fewer colorant components including for example more colors or other components for regulating and stabilizing the hair colorant to be dispensed from the apparatus. According to one preferred embodiment sensors such as for example RFID tags may be implemented for identifying and certifying that the appropriate colors or components are installed in the correct location on the dispensing device . According to a preferred embodiment as shown in a small range or limited field antenna is mounted at a location on the dispensing device to align with the RFID tag of a component container that is installed on the device so that while the component such as a container or bag is in place on the device the RFID tag is read. The antenna is shown mounted on the rear wall of the shelf . The antenna range is limited so as not to read RFID tags from adjacent containers also installed on the device . Upon installation of the component the component s RFID tag passes or aligns with the antenna and the antenna provides a first reading of the RFID tag identifying the component container . The container in which the product component is supplied includes a bag that is encased within a casing such as for example the cardboard box . In this alternate configuration the container is installed on a shelf of the dispensing device . The dispensing device depicted in is constructed similar to the device shown and described herein but with a shelf on the frame in place of the hooks and support . A tube preferably connects with the bag and may either make a connection within the box or alternatively extend through an opening the box lower panel . As discussed herein in connection with the bag and tube the line or tube may be preattached to the bag and according to another option a nozzle not shown in may be preattached to the opposite end of the line or tube . The casing such as the box protects the bag and contents held therein during storage shipping and handling. The shelf may be provided with slots formed thereon to provide bays within which the containers such as the container may be seated. The shelf preferably has at least an opening in a wall thereof such as the lower wall to provide a space for the line or tube to extend. The bays or slots formed by the shelf preferably are provided for each container and are formed at a location proximate to the pump serving to deliver the component from the bag . The RFID tag preferably may store bits of information including for example in code or other form information that identifies for example the manufacturer expiration date product serial number unique product identification number product content and other information. One preferred example is an RFID tag or chip that stores 96 bits which are embedded into the tag. The bits of information may employ naming convention or code to make use of the storage capability to maximize the information embedded such as a code representing a manufacturer of the component. The antenna preferably is coupled with a transceiver or other component that receives the information from interrogation of the RFID tag and stores or communicates that information over a network or on or to a server. The information also may be processed to determine whether a replacement of that component needs to be shipped to the location of the dispensing device .

The device also may have a mechanism to make sure that the proper component is dispensed when called for. For example in the case that the RFID tag is read and the information communicated and processed for example with the device control mechanism or to a remote server that receives the information and processes it and the component RFID tag identifies the component as the wrong component for that position or location in the dispensing device then a signal or alert is sent. The signal or alert also may be coupled with an instruction that prevents further dispensing of the components from the machine until the proper component is installed in its proper location or until an override of the alert or instruction is made. Similarly if an empty component container or bag is installed for example a previously used component container then the RFID tag may be read and the processing of the information is able to identify the component through its RFID tag as signifying an empty component container. An alert or shut down of further dispensing may be implemented until the situation is remedied. In a preferred embodiment the antenna may be about a 4 inch by 4 inch size and may face a 2 to 3 inch area on the dispensing device where the component container is to be seated. Consequently when the component container is removed from the device or its slot position on the device then the antenna also senses the removal by the lack of RFID tag readable signal. The removal may be processed as an event signifying the component container has been removed or may have been consumed . The RFID removal event may be processed to correspond with the component dispensing information based on the record of pump dispensing of that component from its container . If the information matches then no instructions may be provided but where the dispensing expected usage does not correspond with the depletion of the use of the component in that bag then an alert may be generated and provided to an appropriate person or device e.g. such as the salon network operator or operator of the salon using the dispensing device . Although the limited range antenna is implemented for use in connection with reading of component containers on the device a broader range interrogator may be utilized at one or more locations throughout the dispensing device location e.g. such as the premises of the salon to detect the presence of inventory that may be present at the salon or location of the dispensing device . The information may be processed to provide information on components that have not been depleted e.g. exclude empty containers that may be in waste disposal or to exclude components already installed on the device so that a true inventory may be read. This may be done by processing the information determined to identify through the RFID tags on the component containers sensed and excluding component containers whose RFID tag or unique identifier code or bits were recoded as already having been previously installed and consumed and also excluding those component containers that are indicated to be in use on the device. Alternatively the reader or other component designed to read RFID tags of the containers to identify inventory may be assigned or limited to select locations of the salon premises where inventory is stored away from disposal and the device .

According to a preferred embodiment the device preferably is configured so that the containers that contain the beauty product components may be placed in locations on the device such as for example as shown in the alternate shelf depiction of where a container is positioned on a shelf or slot . When placed at a designated location on the device the RFID tag of the container is read with the antenna positioned at that slot. See The device and preferably the control mechanism identifies the component in the slot. The slot or container location on the device corresponds with a particular pump of the device . The control mechanism or software that is provided on a local or remote server designates that pump to correspond with the component whose tag is read and the contents identified. For example a recognition feature or mechanism correlates the pumps and respective component associated with a particular pump e.g. through the RFID tag and slot identification as well as possibly the pump identification or position and line coming into the pump . According to a preferred embodiment the device is configured to identify the slot location of the component so that when that component is called for by a formula or instruction to provide a dosage of that component the dispensing is done by that corresponding pump. Therefore in the event that a container is placed in the wrong slot the pumping mechanism will be operated to deliver the proper component or if it is not present then it will not dispense the component merely because there is a container in the slot. In addition in the event that the container is installed on the device but is not in a designated slot the device automatically adapts to the new configuration based on where the component container is placed on the device e.g. which slot it is placed . Instructions preferably are provided in software that is stored on the control mechanism of the device a remote or local server or multiple locations e.g. the device and a server . The pumping mechanism therefore preferably is controlled to deliver the proper component that corresponds with the pump that the component is associated. According to preferred embodiments the container containing a component may be placed anywhere in the machine e.g. at any slot and to be delivered by any pump and the control mechanism is configured with software containing instructions to detect and identify what the product component is based on the RFID reading.

According to an alternate embodiment the mechanism for identifying the container to deliver the respective dosage preferably may include positioning an RFID reader or tag on a pump and alternately an RFID tag on the line or tube so that the RFID tag of the line may be read to identify the line passing through the pump as corresponding with a component container. The component container RFID tag and line RFID tag preferably may be the same in the embodiments where the component is supplied as a component unit with a bag containing a content of a product component and a line attached to the bag as well as in some embodiments a nozzle attached to the line at the line end opposite the bag end . The line and container including the bag may be recycled and according to some embodiments the RFID tag is removed and replaced. According to alternate embodiments an RFID is provided that is readdressable so that the same RFID tag is reinitialized with alternate information.

The dispensing apparatus and warehouse component preferably are networked and a server may be provided at the warehouse for communication with the apparatus served by that warehouse or other dispensing apparatus that require supplies.

Although the device may be operated remotely through a tablet or other remote computing device or may be operated through a local or remotely linked server preferably the control mechanism on the device itself may be used to dispense products from the device . For example preferably multiple failsafe solutions are built into the device . According to preferred embodiments critical data to operate the machine is stored on the PLC or control mechanism in the event of a complete internet or other communication interruption. The device also may be configured with a built in hotspot to insure communication continues with the device and remote computing components and or a server in the event of an internet failure. According to preferred embodiments the device includes a power supply back up to provide for suitable time of operation such as for example an hour of operating time in the event of a power failure. In addition the device preferably is programmable to designate alternate products for association with a particular pump. For example in the event of a specific pump failure according to some embodiments a product component may be moved to another pump. According to alternate embodiments the device may be configured with an alternate empty pump space and may have a pump that is provided in the space but which is not connected to deliver a component. The alternate pump may be assigned a location and may be activated should one of the other pumps fail. In the case of a failure of one of the other pumps the line may be switched over to the alternate pump and the alternate pump may be designated in place of the pump it is replacing.

As discussed herein one preferred embodiment for providing components is in a container configured as a bag. The bag is configured to allow dispensing of content therefrom while minimizing the empty space in the bag that would otherwise be taken up by air and potentially oxidize or ruin the component.

For example where the client or user has been introduced to or recommended to use a custom formulated shampoo and that client desires to reorder the product the product reorder component may implement reorder functions such as for example reminders or automatic reorder and fulfillment of product. This may be done through the cc server preferably in association with the client app .

According to one embodiment clients or users may utilize an app or application through their own respective personal computing devices such as for example a tablet see . The client or user app or application preferably is configured with software containing instructions to receive information and push information to the cloud center . The information provided by the user through the user app or indirectly by the user s use of the user app is preferably made available to selective salons such as for example stylists or technicians of the salon that the user may visit and or engage to provide a hair treatment or other beauty treatment . The salon for example desiring to use the applications and system may purchase or lease a dispensing apparatus and integrate the user app and communications of data between the user and salon capabilities through the use of the salon app on the stylist pad . The management of the communications may be handled through a server such as a cloud server or center and or the cc server . A website may be provided for use by a client or customer. The website may be used to handle communications similar to the client app or application and may include features that allow the client to make appointments view promotions. Clients will also be able to book appointments find a networked salon location and buy retail from the network salon operator such as the cc corp retail supported by the network salon system provider as represented by the component portion . The website also may serve as a portal to the cc server and features associated with the network salon operator such as purchase of retail products and support. The client app preferably is configured to provide the user or client with the ability to make selections using the app to buy retail lookup salons make appointments and update the client profile. For example the client may utilize the app to locate the nearest network salon operator system salon e.g. such as a Color Culture system salon anywhere in the world where the salons are located and make an appointment. The client app also is configured to receive information and provide the client with the ability to see recommended products and new styles which may be based on the client profile and or which may be based on data collected based on other clients and users as well as salons as to what are the trends popular choices and currently desired styles colors effects. The client app also may implement alerts including through geo fencing where a client is in proximity to a salon . Social media sites e.g. such as for example Facebook Twitter LinkedIn and others may be integrated into the client app to work in conjunction therewith and may allow features the client has selected to be shared or communicated with others as well as for the salon to social network with the user. According to one embodiment the client app may include an integrated client loyalty program feature which accesses the data relating to client purchases and salon visits and provides a corresponding reward according to a reward system. The app also may be configured to integrate with the salon appointment schedule or calendar to show availability of appointments and personnel and permit the client to make an appointment. The app also may provide reviews of different colors effects styles as well as salons to provide the user with further information. The app also may be used to generate text messages such as reminders for appointments reordering of products or to advise of a new feature or product that is available.

The salon that utilizes the system preferably will be able to run reports reorder products and make payments right from a salon portal associated with the salon component portion of the system. The salon also will also be able to look at trends through data made available by a server that provides information based on data collected and reported for users of products and or salons utilization of products styles and trends. According to a preferred embodiment the cc server processes data to generate reports on trends which may include purchase and use trends for products style trends as well as other salon and user selected options. The cc server may include as part of the cc server or in association therewith a report server that generates reports which may be used by the salon network operator cc in this example to tailor advertising and promotions to what customers currently desire. The salon network operator also may communicate to the salon the trend information to alert the salon personnel as to more likely sales opportunities and suggestions that the customer may be more likely to accept. In addition the salon also will have access to an education system to certify a stylist to use the cc system which may be implemented as a salon app on the salon pad or other computing devices of the salon . The salon also may dispense from a dispensing device such as the dispensing apparatus and or sell products at the salon where the salon serves as a point of sale for products. The cc system preferably provides the salon with the ability to receive instruction demonstrate representative effects for applications of beauty products such as hair colorants styles cuts and effects and deliver the result through the implementation of custom formulations that correspond with the selected representative implementations. According to a preferred embodiment a dispensing apparatus is linked for communication to receive corresponding data from the salon app for example operating on the stylist pad or from the client app . The mechanism utilized for communications between the selection source and the dispensing apparatus preferably may be a server such as for example the cloud center or server the cc server or may take place through the cc system . Preferably regardless of how the communication takes place the client profile is updated to reflect the selections and applications as well as formulation dispensed and or applied to the client as well as style cut effects and other information. The cc server and report server preferably also receive the information and may aggregate information to generate reports based on any variable such as most widely used color or most widely used color by customers having a prior hair condition e.g. blond hair or customers located in a particular geographic region. The data may be stored locally on the cc server or on a separate data repository such as for example a cloud server or center .

The salon app preferably is implemented on a stylist computing device such as a stylist pad . The salon app provides the salon personnel with the ability to image the user and implement steps to provide a responsive representation that permits a haircut to be represented on an individual and allows the cut to be displayed by simulating the cut as if the stylist was using a tool such as scissors on the person s actual hair. A depiction of a representative cut or styling by allowing the manipulation of the user s depicted hair to remove as much or as little hair as desired and in locations desired and to have the image depicted on the display represent the progression of a style or haircut being carried out on the person s hair depicted on the display. However in accordance with the preferred embodiments the depiction is carried out prior to manipulation of the persons physical hair.

According to a preferred embodiment the app or application is depicted in use with a tablet computing device and screen displays are shown in . The depictions may be on the tablet of a client or user or alternately may be on the stylist pad such as the pad depicted in . Although some portions of the app or application may not be suitable for initialization by the consumer user such as imaging the user on a green screen background the app generally is utilized in a similar manner whether by the stylist or client. Referring to there is illustrated an exemplary embodiment of a screen display for the application or app depicting a language selection screen . The screen display preferably is shown as part of a tablet though the screen display may be provided on another computing device such as for example a phone see e.g. . The language selection screen presents selection options for the user to choose a language for communications and displays conducted with the app. The app preferably is configured with a translation engine that relays the communications in the language selected by the user to discernable information such as another language that may be read and evaluated by the server and processor that processes and stores the information. Although English is shown as the language in which the language selection options appear the language selection screen preferably is configured to depict languages in their respective characters e.g. Chinese . According to some embodiments upon making a language selection the language selection options may appear in the already selected language rather than the language characters or language represented by the selection options.

Referring to an exemplary embodiment of a screen display depicting a user profile entry screen is shown. Fields are provided on the screen into which a user may enter information that the system uses to evaluate and present options for the user including to provide appropriate formulations to achieve desired results such as desired effects colors textures skin scalp treatments based on the user profile information. User profile information optionally may be entered at a salon e.g. by a salon technician and may be reviewed for conformation at the salon. Screen Referring to there is shown an exemplary screen display depicting a scalp condition screen . A first scalp image is depicted on the scalp condition screen . The first scalp image preferably is a representation of the scalp condition of a user. The scalp condition representation of the user s scalp may be assigned a category type and the image or type or both may be stored in the user profile. The first scalp image may be an actual photograph that the user has taken and uploaded of the user s actual scalp or alternatively the image may be a selection that the user has made based on a menu of options or a selection of image options that may be generated to appear on the display of the user s computing device or tablet . A second scalp image representing the desired scalp condition e.g. a healthy scalp of a person of similar age gender and race is depicted on the scalp condition screen . The healthy scalp represents the target for the user s scalp condition such as for example what the desired condition would look like after appropriate treatment has been applied to the user s scalp. The user or individual therefore may have the user profile stored from which considerations of scalp condition when appropriate for selection of products or components to use or mix as part of a dispensed product may be taken into account. For example the example image of a healthy scalp may be generated in connection with the user information from the user profile and the generation of the scalp image may be based on things such as user age demographic and other physical and or genetic properties or characteristics of that user.

Referring to there is illustrated an exemplary embodiment of a screen display depicting a user photo upload screen . Preferably a user may take a photograph and upload the image to the system server e.g. such as an OPC or cloud server shown in or cc server shown in . The image preferably is stored as part of the user profile and may be used by the system to manipulate the effects colors styles cuts and treatments when using the app. The image preferably is made available to the user through use of the app and preferably also is available to the salon so the salon technician may use the image to manipulate it and apply a style color cut or other treatment or effect and store the image. The salon personnel may manipulate and store a new version of the image that is a treated image depicting a hair treatment that the user may select.

According to a preferred embodiment the process may be carried out in front of the individual or client user at the salon or may be done prior to the client user coming to the salon. As an alternate option the salon technician may manipulate the image to apply particular modifications to the client user s hair and may make the proposed modified image available to the user as a recommendation. The user s application may include a link or message that the image has been posted for the user to access. Alternately the client user may deselect the option so only the client user may make manipulations prior to coming into the salon for the user s appointment or so that the salon may manipulate the image so as to prepare for the user s visit or scheduled appointment but not transmit it or make it available for access to the client user s application. The individual s user image is preferably manipulated to depict the user face and hair on a green screen background.

According to a preferred embodiment the user s hair is manipulated so that it may be changed and may be a manipulatable variable. According to one preferred embodiment a green screen process may be utilized to generate the separate image portion the user s hair that may be manipulated apart from the user s face. shows an exemplary embodiment of a screen display depicting an image of the individual where the individual is displayed on a green screen appearing as a green background. The image of the individual preferably is stored as data which may be a local storage on the computing device on which the image was input or taken or may be uploaded to the salon network server such as the cc server shown in or both. The individual s hair preferably is provided as a separate image and according to a preferred embodiment may be depicted on a green screen background separate and apart from the client s face and body. As illustrated in screen display depicts an image on a green screen showing the individual user or client s hair the hair being depicted apart from the client s face and body see the hair being provided on a green background . One preferred process for producing the image of the hair separate from the client s face involves placing a green cape on the client which preferably matches the green screen background and positioning a green face mask which also preferably matches the green screen background in front of the client s face . The image of the hair may then be taken and that may be designated to serve as a manipulatable image. The manipulatable hair image preferably is joined together with the image of the client s face . The resultant image therefore includes an image of the client but where the hair image is a manipulatable variable that may be modified to correspond with and display a desired treatment or other effect. One preferred embodiment stores the manipulatable hair image separately from the other image portion i.e. the background the individual s face and body . Manipulations may be made to the client s depicted hair to try on different colors effects and cuts as discussed herein . The hair image preferably is saved with the manipulations which may be permanently to a file or in temporary storage as a computer file and the image is combined with the face image of the individual to provide an image of the individual with the hair that is manipulated to display a representation of the desired effect treatment style or cut. In this manner changes are made to the variable image portion while the client face body and background may remain unchanged.

As discussed in connection with the preferred embodiment the client s image is photographed on a green screen background at the salon or by the user . The manipulation of the user image to separate the hair image preferably is carried out using the green screen background and imaging the individual on the background with the face mask and cape as discussed. Alternatively the separation of the user hair image may be done through a computing application. The computing application may be configured to evaluate the pixels forming the image and determine where pixels change densities or coloration and may attempt to approximate the user s hair profile and apply an instruction to change the pixels outside of the profile to green or other color e.g. gray or neutral . The app or application such as for example the salon app used by a salon personnel may be used to capture an image of an individual such as a client for manipulation of that image to apply a process to the individual s hair. The image is taken see e.g. and . According to a preferred embodiment an image adjustment may be applied to the image of the individual or the individual s hair image e.g. . The application or app preferably includes an image adjustment mechanism with instructions to alter the image condition in order to provide a natural tonality. Preferably the natural tonality corresponds with a predetermined color temperature and more preferably a color temperature of 3000 to 3500 degrees K. The image condition level may be presented on the screen and provide options for altering the image color level or tonality of the color to a natural condition if the image color level is not already a natural condition . For example where the image has been taken in incandescent room lighting and has a generally yellow or warm cast to it e.g. 2700 degrees K the image may be adjusted with the image adjustment mechanism which the user may select e.g. from a slide switch button on the screen to alter the image from its initial color condition to a preferred natural condition e.g. for example from 2700K to 3500 degrees K . The adjusted image may then be saved and provide the image from which manipulations are made using the application software as described and shown herein. Once the image is adjusted to a natural color or tone condition then a level value is assigned to the person s hair. This is done by establishing a natural level for the natural hair of the individual which is the individual or client s hair as it exists naturally without any applied treatment i.e. without even a previously applied treatment so for example if the individual has naturally blond hair and the hair is colored to black in the image then the natural level will be based on the blond hair regardless of the existing present color black . The level preferably is assigned a level value from a scale value which in the United States corresponds to a scale value of from between 1 to 10 and in Europe corresponds to a scale value of from between 1 to 12 although the values from 1 to 5 for both the U.S. and Europe may track one another the end of the scale or higher values generally are different and not correspondent . Preferably the software is programmed with instructions to use one scale or the other and the information is processed to provide a result that corresponds with the use of either scale which a user may preselect when making initial settings for the application software or may alter based on the initial determinations and assignments for a particular client individual . In addition a level translation component may be provided for the software so that in the event a U.S. initiated client profile is called up for use at a salon in Europe the software is able to make the adjustments. In addition to assigning the client hair a natural level e.g. in the U.S. from 1 to 10 the actual level existing at the time of the photograph is assigned. The actual level is established based on the level of the client hair as imaged preferably after tonal correction or adjustment to a natural condition as discussed herein . For example the naturally blond client with black hair would have an actual level value assigned using the same level scales 1 to 10 or 1 to 12 as discussed based on the black hair. A color and level may be on the person s hair from a treatment e.g. treatment prior to being imaged . The actual level value takes that into account. At this point therefore the system has received from selections and assignment of levels a natural condition level and an actual condition level for the client individual. The application preferably displays the hair image on the display screen and provides the user such as the salon personnel with the ability to slide the level control such as for example a slide bar displayed on the screen to scroll up or down a selector graphic on the screen display to reach a desired level and have that desired level displayed on the screen. For example the person s hair image may lighten or darken. Darkening is represented in a saturation of pigment to represent darker hair. Lightening is visually exposing the undertone that an observer would see if the hair were actually lightened. The tones go from red at lower levels e.g. like 2 4 to orange gold and yellow as the levels go lighter and higher e.g. to 10 or 12. By manipulation of the image in this manner the display of the image exposes the undertone of the hair at that desired level. The selection therefore may be made including the undertone at the desired level.

According to a preferred embodiment once any prior color adjustment has been made and the levels natural level value and actual level value are selected and stored the color selection may be made and applied to display color selections to the hair image to provide a display of an altered color hair image see e.g. and the color selection screen . The user such as for example the salon stylist may manipulate the individual s hair image on the display screen by using a control on the screen display such as a dial to select or dial the desired enhancing or correcting tones to establish a desired visual end result which may for example be to overlay color filters on the hair in order to balance and adjust visible undertones at a desired level which may be done based on selections and manipulations on the screen display and through corresponding instructions provided in the software in connection with the processing of the inputs and selections . For example if the stylist sees orange undertones and wants red then the selections may be made to manipulate the hair image on the display screen to add red tones. Preferably the application software is programmed with instructions to compare the levels assigned to the hair of a person and compare the selection made as the desired or target hair color and provide a formula solution that corresponds with the desired target. The software preferably is programmed with instructions to assign an expected undertone to a hair level based on the input information such as the tonal levels for that person. The formula therefore preferably produces the resultant selected image made on the display e.g. at the color selection screen . The dispensing device may be instructed to dispense a corresponding formula as needed or desired.

The individual or client user as well as the salon technician may use the app to manipulate the hair displayed in the image and preferably the manipulation is done with the user face and body portion present as part of the displayed representation the hair image also being a part of the displayed representation. One example of a preferred manipulation involves applying a particular color to the hair. Referring to there is illustrated an exemplary embodiment of a screen display depicting a shape modification screen . Options for hair shape are presented to the user and a selection menu is provided for providing alternative options for selection and application to depict the shape on the user including on the user to show the user s face and body with the hair depicted as the selected hair shape option. The app preferably displays options based on the user image and the green screen segregation of the hair as discussed herein to produce on the display a manipulatable image or image portion of the user s hair see e.g. . The shape modification screen shows a first selection option and associated shape image that appears in the center of the selection options menu . Although three shape selection option images are shown on the shape modification screen there may be additional shapes that the user may select. These additional shapes may be presented to the user through a menu or scrolling option such as for example scrolling right or left of the center shape image of the selection options menu . The center shape image is shown as the first selection option which preferably is bordered by a selection box and a save option is included for saving the selected image which in the embodiment is depicted as the save button . The selected shape may be saved and the user may proceed to make further manipulations to the user hair image . For example the user may apply a color change to the selection option image for which a shape has been selected.

As shown in a screen display is illustrated depicting a color selection screen . A color selection menu is provided and displays potential hair color selection options for the user which preferably include a plurality of colors which according to some embodiments may be depicted as a color wheel representing hair of a representative color. The user may make selections of the color options and may apply these options to the image in the main image window . The user s hair image may be changed on the color selection screen as the user elects to apply a color option from the menu . Although the user s hair image is shown with the hair from the selection option image the selection of a selection option image and hair image may be represented on the color selection screen when applying color manipulations where the selection option image was selected prior to making selections on the color selection screen . The user may scroll through and make changes to the color of the hair image . A secondary image window is shown to depict the user s previous or current color such as a hair image with a cut applied for example if the selection option image was made to serve as a reference to the change being depicted in the main image window . A user may designate a hair color selection and save that selection using the save button . According to an alternate embodiment the user may select a plurality of options being considered and save the options e.g. such as for example three colors . The user may therefore manipulate the hair image so that the hair displayed represents the shape selected as depicted in the image of as well as the color desired selected at the color selection screen .

A cut option may be provided to the user or may be provided only for the salon app for the professional to use . The cut options provide a representation of the cut process and allows for dynamic manipulation of the user s hair through single cutting strokes to be made to the hair representation. The cut process may be simulated and displayed to depict the actual cut. At points along the cut process the salon technician may receive user feedback for example where the user is viewing the image while the technician is carrying out the cutting process on the image on the display. The application provides for the ability to undo a change made to the hair so that the cutting may be redone from any point previously. The application provides for the touch screen of a touch screen display to be manipulated by the salon technician by tracing a finger or stylus over the area of the touch screen showing the user s hair image that a modification is to be made. The cutting preferably corresponds to the area traced over and the tracing applies cutting to that area. The cutting may be applied as a light cut by a single tracing and additional cutting may be shown corresponding with additional tracings of the area. Referring to a cut selection tool menu is illustrated depicting a plurality of tools for applying a representation of a cut process to the hair of the person depicted in the image. The tools are provided for manipulation of the hair image such as for example any of those images to which a prior manipulation has been made to apply a cut to the image displayed as the user s hair . The cut is shown in as depicting the hair image portion of the existing haircut or shape that has been removed e.g. by cutting or applying a cutting tool in an alternate rendition shown in a ghost like representation on the screen . The cut is applied to the hair image to provide a new shape or cut to the hair. The image of the person is shown with the manipulated hair image in solid form and preferably with a color option applied thereto. The tools may be implemented to modify the image from the original hair image to the resultant haircut image and preferably the hair image is dynamically correspondent with the application of the cutting tool so that the image on the display screen is presented in a form adjusted for each application of a tool. The user and stylist may view the process being applied to cut the hair as the hair is being manipulated to simulate a cut so that at any point the user or stylist may make changes or revert back. According to a preferred embodiment the screen displays a representation of hair treatment to the image on the screen including stages of a haircut to be done by manipulating the hair image presented on the screen. The haircut is represented on the individual depicted showing the individual s face and body and which allows the cut to be displayed by simulating the cut as if the stylist was using a tool such as scissors on the person s actual hair. The manipulation allows for viewing of the depiction of a representative cut or styling to be shown where the operator such as the stylist may manipulate the user s depicted hair to remove as much or as little hair as desired and in locations desired and to have the image depicted on the display represent the progression of a style or haircut being carried out on the person s hair depicted on the display so that the depiction is carried out prior to the actual manipulation e.g. cutting of the persons physical hair. Alternatively the manipulation depiction on the display may be carried out at the salon as instruction and guidance during the process while actual cuts are being made e.g. while the user is receiving a haircut to the user or individual s actual physical hair e.g. at the salon so as to depict on the screen a potential next step or stage in the cutting process.

According to a preferred embodiment the image of the person is taken using a recording device such as for example a camera e.g. a stand alone camera phone camera or camera on a tablet . The image preferably includes the person s hair and face and may also include part of the upper body e.g. shoulders or part necessary to depict the hair in the image e.g. such as those with longer hair . The image preferably is stored on a storage media such as a hard drive flash memory or removable disk media. The image if not taken on the tablet phone or computing device that is running the application software is uploaded so that it is available to the application or app software. This may involve uploading to the network salon server e.g. the cloud server and or cc server a salon local computing device or other computing device. Preferably the photograph is stored in association with and as part of a user profile. After the image is captured and is available to the application the imaged is processed by transforming the image. The transformation of the image involves separating the hair from the face and body portion if the body portion also is part of the image . Next the hair image is processed by evaluating the hair image in view of a grayscale to determine a grayscale level for the hair image and assigning a grayscale level to the hair image. Assigning a grayscale level may be done manually by salon personnel using the application or with software of the application configured to process the image and based on a grayscale comparison assign to the image a preferred grayscale level. Once the desired grayscale level is determined and assigned to that hair image the image is assigned a tone. The tone assigned may be from a tone level and may be done manually by the salon personnel or alternatively may be done by the application software which includes instructions for processing the image for tone assignment by comparing the image properties to a tone level scale and assigning a tone level to the image. Subsequent to the initial establishment of the gray scale values subsequent refinements or alterations to the grayscale value may be made to lighten and or darken the hair even where one or more other manipulations have taken place. With the image being assigned both a grayscale level and a tone level the brush brushstroke tool is used to manipulate the hair to create the desired dimension. One exemplary depiction of the usage of the brushstroke tool is shown in applying it to the hair of the user wherein shows the resultant hair image with the simulated cut hair depicted on the screen as the lightened or ghosted hair image . The hair image depicted in is transformed so that the hair image in is shown with the simulated transformation made to the hair on the screen using the tools here the brushstroke tool with the manipulation shown as the transformed hair image and cut away or tool manipulated portion of the hair illustrated as the hair image a separately identifiable ghosted image . For example once the tool is applied to the hair image shown in then the desired dimension is processed and then separated out from the hair image based on the manipulations made by the user using the tools . The processor processes the input. The input preferably is made using a computing device such as for example a tablet with a touch screen on which the user may trace with the user s finger or stylus or other input tool to generate manipulations to the hair displayed on the screen and have those manipulation processed by the processor which in addition to applying the manipulation based on the manipulation tool selected from the tool menu and based on the use of that tool on the image separates those manipulated portions out and displays them as the transformed portion of the image as shown in the exemplary depiction of the hair image of . This process may be repeated for multiple tonal and dimensional effects and may be applied in any order desired by the user so for example a user is able to switch between the manipulation tools for cutting and styling the hair and the color level application and tone applications. According to a preferred embodiment the image manipulations for the transformation of the color and tone levels may be stored and a specific formula may be selected or generated by the application or other software configured to receive the application inputs so that the dispensing machine receives information to dispense a formula that when applied on that user s hair will produce the desired effect. For example the color and tone level may be reproduced on the user s hair to resemble the displayed manipulations corresponding to those selections. The user may require separate applications to produce the hair image having the desired color and effects. Preferably the application software is configured with instructions to handle each effect separately and to store one or more manipulations to the hair for example where those manipulations correspond to a formula that is to be applied to achieve the resultant effect. For example each separation preferably is interpreted to correspond with a specific formula and sent to the machine to be dispensed. For example a transformed hair image may have a first separation or associated formula that provides a base color for the hair a second separation that provides a second formula for the hair which is a highlight and a third separation that has associated with it a third formula for the hair which is a lowlight. Each of the separation or separate formulas may be stored in the client profile and be dispensed from the dispensing machine. The dispensing of the separation formulations also are recorded thereby presenting the potential where multiple separation formula are utilized but not accounted for. The system also may link dispensings from the dispensing apparatus with the client profile so that at the salon where treatments have been dispensed and applied there is a record of the dispensings which may be stored and collected for usage in billing at the salon location. The dispensings and user profile information may be used to generate an invoice for the customer at the salon location based on the manipulations applied e.g. a cut and the products dispensed.

The system method and device also provide for matching or coloring one part of the user s hair separate from other parts. For example a user may use one s finger or other implement to work the display and address the area of the hair appearing on the display image that the user desires to work on such as by coloring it duplicating a color on the screen and altering the color palettes and grayscale to match another portion of the hair image or another image. One example is treatment of hair regrowth. The application may be used to identify the regrowth area of the hair and generate or derive one formula for the regrowth area another for the midshaft and ends or alternately separate formulas each for the regrowth area midshaft and ends. Another example is where the regrowth area is desired to match to the existing hair areas of the midshaft and ends. The system method and apparatus or device may be utilized to provide a matching formulation. This may be done as described herein by imaging the person and applying the manipulations to the hair. The hair image of the person would show the regrowth area color e.g. gray and the midshaft and ends e.g. brown . However the color manipulation that is done by utilizing the transformations and selections depicted on the screen displays is applied to the regrowth area of the hair appearing in the hair image and the midshaft and ends image may be left unchanged. In this manner the color of the regrowth area may be manipulated on the screen so that the regrowth area of the image matches the midshaft and or ends image color appearing on the display. The formula therefore may be generated to provide the resultant effect which in this example is to color the gray hair regrowth portion of the hair to match the surrounding hair. The user of the application may make these transformations on the screen and the software may process the manipulations and associate the selections e.g. the color and or effects selections to provide a formulation to the dispensing machine to produce the product e.g. colorant that when applied to the regrowth area of the individual s hair will produce a hair color that matches the surrounding hair e.g. midshaft and or ends . This is an example but the color selection and manipulation tools provide for coloring one or more separate portions of the hair apart from other portions so multiple formulations may be generated to achieve multiple effects. The image therefore provides for transformation and saving of the image where portions have been manipulated differently than other portions. For example there may be a cut manipulation a first color manipulation a highlight manipulation and so forth. The application provides for a user and salon personnel to preview the hair image transformation with the selections being applied. Before any manipulation of the hair color begins the user may adjust the image to an exact color match of the actual color of the client. This will balance light variations from location to location. Therefore each image will be an exact representation of what is actually there unaltered by existing light conditions.

In addition for the shape similar to the coloring process described herein the hair image is separated from the face portion of the image and is manipulated through multiplication or subtraction of the actual image. The user or stylist may make changes to arrive at a manipulated hair depiction and may save the changes. For example the user or salon personnel may select between options and save multiple options to have them display on a screen for comparison. shows an alternate image of a user upload photograph depicted on a display screen with an options menu and techniques menu . According to one embodiment the options open a selection menu from which manipulations may be applied to the hair image depicted. A techniques menu may be selected to provide a menu of techniques that may be applied to the hair image of the user to depict a technique that may be applied to alter the appearance of the hair. A secondary image window is shown to depict another image of the user which may provide a reference and which may include an alternate treatment style color or other option for comparison with the alternate image user upload photograph . According to an alternate embodiment the user upload image or photograph may be manipulated as discussed herein in connection with the image however there may be limitations when using that photograph. shows a first image window corresponding to image A and second image window corresponding to image B . A different treatment option is applied to each image so a comparison may be presented for preview and further selection. The image with the applications desired to manipulate the hair to a desired changed representation preferably is uploaded to the server such as for example the cc server or other server as represented in so that the data may be saved and the salon and user may have access to the desired selections. The user may receive services at a salon. Preferably the user selections whether by the client or individual user or a salon stylist user may be evaluated with the cc system which preferably includes a control system to provide a formulation that may be used to produce the desired treatment or effect selected. The formulation may be a product that is dispensed by the dispensing apparatus .

According to preferred embodiments the consumer or stylist using an application may derive and select a customized formulation. For example referring to the selection image screen may display Option A showing one image of a color of the person s hair and Option B showing another image of the person s hair. The user may desire something between the two shades displayed on each of the respective images. In this example the software is configured with the formulas corresponding with the formulations that correspond with the result on the person for images A and B. The person may make a color selection that is between A and B. Preferably the software is configured to provide the option for a middle shade and have that image appear on the screen as augmented or changed A or B or as a new image C . The desired result and expected outcome may be accomplished through the customization of the software to dispense components that provide the in between shading. This option also is provided for the stylist so that the stylist may manipulate and make selections of colors on the display screen and receive and view actual image depictions of the effects of the change on the image of the hair being styled. For example the options provided for the stylist may include the ability to mix and select colors levels and shades as well as experiment by applying alternate developer selections to determine the resultant effect likely on the hair of the individual. The software of the application program is configured with instructions to generate a display of the user s hair image the hair that is being manipulated to show the manipulation effect of the addition of the colors amount of developers and other choices or selections. For example the software may be configured to dispense a portion of the component or for example such as oz. less than the formula. This may be done according to predetermined instructions provided for the software for colorants developers and other components. The changes to the existing formulas that the software has stored may be implemented by the designation of a change amount so that when the processor receives an instruction for a selection and the software determines that the selection is not a formula from its known established formulas then the software ascertains the closest formula and makes a corresponding alteration of a component of the known established formula which may be an addition or subtraction of component or alteration of the component amount . An altering instruction may be provided so that software has an instruction corresponding with the selection. The altering instruction may implement a change to a closest known formula and thereby provide and save a new formula. The new formula may be dispensed from the dispensing apparatus based on instructions to operate the pumps to deliver the new formula that is a customized formula e.g. between two corresponding formula image options . The control mechanism of the device allows the stylist or salon personnel to create numerous custom color formulations based on generations that the stylist may customize using the stylist application on a computing device such as a tablet.

According to a preferred embodiment the client may be presented with selection options that include a dial slide or level control that corresponds with the hair image on the screen display.
