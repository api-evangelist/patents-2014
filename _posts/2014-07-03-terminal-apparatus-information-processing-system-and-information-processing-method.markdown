The present application claims priority to and incorporates by reference the entire contents of Japanese Patent Application No. 2013 145020 filed in Japan on Jul. 10 2013.

The present invention relates to a terminal apparatus an information processing system and an information processing method that provides information over a network.

Systems for providing electronic information related to a printed paper medium to a user viewing the printed paper medium are conventionally known. An example of such a system is disclosed in Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 2010 140250.

According to Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 2010 140250 a management server extracts features from original data of a printed paper medium using a feature extraction scheme appropriate for recognizing an image which includes text prepares indexes based on the extracted features and registers the indexes. More specifically the management server performs a partial search process on a partial image which is acquired by a user by capturing an image of the printed paper medium with a mobile camera phone or the like and then transmitted to the management server. The management server identifies a text or an article in the partial image and transmits article information to the user s mobile camera phone.

According to Japanese Laid open Patent Application No. 2010 140250 the management server can append a uniform resource locator URL of a related content to the article information to be transmitted to the user s mobile camera phone. Accordingly the user can view not only the article information transmitted to the user s mobile camera phone but also the related content at the URL.

Meanwhile application software hereinafter image capture and transmission application into which an image capturing function and a function of transmitting a captured image to a management server are integrated can be installed in a mobile camera phone of a user. The image capture and transmission application provides convenience to the user by eliminating the user s need to designate a URL of the management server and launch the captured image transmitting function each time.

It is expected that if the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application are available from another application the convenience will be further enhanced. For example functionality of an event application for some event may be extended so that the event application can use the functions provided by the imago capture and transmission application. This extension allows a user to acquire content specific to the event based on a captured image by utilizing the functions of the image capture and transmission application available in the event application.

As described above conventionally to make the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application available from the event application a method of incorporating the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application into the event application is typically used. This method allows a user to utilize the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application without sacrificing usability or the like. Furthermore because this method allows the user to utilize the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application and the event application as a single application the user can perform a series of operations smoothly.

However the method described above is disadvantageous in that porting the functions provided by the image capture and transmission application into the event application requires long time development and much manpower which lead to an increase in cost. Furthermore because the development is from scratch long time will disadvantageously be required from specification study to the actual development. More specifically an increase in the time period from specification study to start of the development not only results in a great rise in cost but also makes it difficult to adapt to a quick need of a customer. For these reasons development for causing functions of applications to collaborate or integrating them can lead to inefficiency and non flexibility.

Under the circumstances there is a need to make it possible to easily configure a function which is provided by an application and utilized by a further application depending on the purpose of the further application.

It is an object of the present invention to at least partially solve the problems in the conventional technology.

The above and other objects features advantages and technical and industrial significance of this invention will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments of the invention when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.

Prior to the description of the embodiments description about an image search system applicable to the embodiments is presented to facilitate understanding. The image search system extracts an object from an image captured using an image capture device compares the extracted object against objects stored in a database in advance and determines which object of the objects stored in the database is most similar to the object extracted from the captured image. The image search system then presents link information to a commercial web site or the like associated in advance with the determined object to a user.

Multiple commercial web sites hereinafter commercial sites denoted by A and B are also connected to the network . The commercial sites A and B are capable of receiving purchase orders over the network and dispatching commercial goods ordered.

The terminal apparatus is capable of carrying out wired or wireless communications with the network . The terminal apparatus is capable of performing operation in accordance with a command received over the network . Furthermore the terminal apparatus which includes a user interface UI including a display device and an input device is capable of displaying an image received over the network via the UI and transmitting data over the network in accordance with user s manipulation of the UI.

The terminal apparatus has an image capturing function and is capable of capturing an image of a subject in accordance with an operation instructing to capture an image performed on the UI. The terminal apparatus is capable of transmitting the captured image acquired by the image capture to the network .

The image search server to which a database DB is connected is capable of performing a search process according to the embodiment in accordance with a request received over the network . In the embodiment pieces of index data for use in search for image data A and image data B are stored in the DB and associated with respective pieces of associated information. Each index data is data obtained by analyzing the image data in binary form and converting the image data into a structure for search.

Alternatively the image data may be stored as it is in the DB . File names and paths of the image data may be stored in the DB .

The image search server receives image data over the network searches through the DB based on the image data and acquires associated information associated with the image data as a search result. The image search server returns the associated information obtained as the search result to a transmission source of the image data.

For example assume that the image data A and image data B respectively represent a content page corresponding to content of a catalog magazine and a front cover page corresponding to a front cover of the catalog magazine. illustrates an example of the image data A representing an image A of the content page. illustrates an example of the image data B representing an image B of the front cover page.

The target regions and are used as indicators for identifying the object and the objects and respectively. Each target region can be of any size so long as the target region encompasses an entire object and is smaller than a size of an image which contains the object.

Associated information is described below. Associated information is for example information indicating a function associated with an object contained in an image. More specifically the associated information includes information for access to attribute information of the object. Accordingly in practice the associated information can be considered as stored in the DB as being associated with the object contained in the image.

For example associated information of the object contained in the image A representing the content page can be a uniform resource locator URL of the commercial site A where a commercial good represented by the object is sold or a URL of a shopping web site at which an order for purchasing the commercial good can be issued. For another example the associated information can be a telephone number or an electronic mail e mail address of a store selling the commercial good. For still another example information for download of a data file containing data about the commercial good and the like can be used as the associated information. Meanwhile multiple pieces of associated information can be associated with a single object in the DB .

For still another example a URL of a web site for introducing the catalog magazine which includes the front cover page on the network can be used as the associated information of the objects and contained in the image B representing the front cover page.

The receiving unit receives data transmitted over the network . For example the receiving unit receives a captured image hereinafter the captured image A transmitted from the terminal apparatus .

The extraction unit extracts an object contained in the captured image A received by the receiving unit by performing image analysis on the captured image A and detecting feature points of the captured image A. For example the extraction unit detects feature points of the captured image A by binarizing the captured image A and performing edge detection and normalization on the binarized captured image A. The object is represented by the detected feature points.

The calculation unit compares the feature points of the captured image A extracted by the extraction unit with feature points representing each of the objects retrieved with indexes stored in the DB . The calculation unit calculates based on a result of the comparison similarity between the object contained in the captured image A and each of the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB . The similarity can be calculated by comparing relationship between the feature points extracted from the image for each of the images. For example similarity can be evaluated as follows. Feature values are calculated by expressing relationship of feature points into a numerical form. An absolute value of a difference between the feature values is calculated for each pair of images. If the absolute value of the difference between images is smaller the similarity is determined as higher.

The search unit searches through the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB for an image with high similarity with the object contained in the captured image A based on the similarity calculated by the calculation unit . As a result of the search the search unit outputs a single index containing the object with the highest similarity with the object contained in the captured image A among the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB .

Alternatively the search unit may output a predetermined number of indexes in an order from one including objects with the highest similarity with the object contained in the captured image A among the objects as a search result. Further alternatively the search unit may output one or more indexes with which the objects with similarity equal to or higher than a threshold value are retrieved as a search result. Further alternatively the search unit may output every index with similarity within a predetermined margin of e.g. 5 from a maximum similarity calculated from the captured image A as a search result.

The presenting unit retrieves associated information associated with the index which is the search result output from the search unit from the DB and presents transmits the associated information to the terminal apparatus . Accordingly the presenting unit has a function as a transmitting unit which transmits associated information to the terminal apparatus . This presentation of the associated information may be performed by directly transmitting the associated information to the terminal apparatus . Alternatively the presentation may be performed by creating a web page containing the associated information and presenting information e.g. the URL of the web page for access to the web page to the terminal apparatus . The terminal apparatus can acquire the associated information by accessing the web page.

Alternatively the terminal apparatus may acquire the associated information using application software hereinafter abbreviated as application installed into the terminal apparatus in advance. The application is configured to perform a series of operations starting from image capture of the captured image A and ending with displaying the presented associated information.

The image search server can be embodied in a typical computer information processing apparatus including a central processing unit CPU and a storage such as a random access memory RAM a read only memory RAM and a hard disk drive. The image search server is not necessarily embodied in a single computer. Alternatively the image search server may be configured to operate in a distributed manner on multiple computers.

The receiving unit the extraction unit the calculation unit the search unit the presenting unit and the control unit described above are implemented by a search program running on the CPU. Alternatively some or all of the receiving unit the extraction unit the calculation unit the search unit the presenting unit and the control unit may be implemented by discrete hardware components which operate in cooperation with each other. The search program for performing the search process according to the embodiment may be provided as being recorded in a non transitory tangible computer readable recording medium such as a compact disk read only memory CD ROM and a digital versatile disk DVD as a file in an installable format or an executable format.

The search program for performing the search process according to the embodiment may be configured to be stored in a computer connected to a communication network such as the Internet and provided by downloading over the communication network. The search program for performing the search process according to the embodiment may be configured to be provided or distributed over a communication network such as the Internet.

The search program for performing the search process according to the embodiment is configured in modules including for example the units described above the receiving unit the extraction unit the calculation unit the search unit the presenting unit and the control unit . From the viewpoint of actual hardware for example the CPU reads out the search program from the storage medium and executes the search program to load the units onto the main storage device e.g. the RAM thereby generating the units on the main storage device.

The terminal apparatus configured as descried above may be used in the following manner for example. A user obtains the captured image A and a captured image B by capturing images of pages of a catalog magazine using the terminal apparatus . In this example it is assumed that the captured images A and B are an image obtained by capturing a content page of the catalog magazine and an image obtained by capturing a front cover page of the same respectively. The user may transmit the captured image A for example to the image search server over the network .

The captured image A is received by the receiving unit of the image search server . The extraction unit detects feature points of the received captured image A and extracts an object. The calculation unit calculates based on the feature points detected by the extraction unit similarity between the object contained in the captured image A and each of the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB . The search unit searches for and retrieves an index based on a result of the calculation and outputs the index as a search result. The presenting unit retrieves associated information from the DB based on the search result output from the search unit and presents the associated information to the terminal apparatus which is the transmission source of the captured image A.

The user can access the commercial site A for example based on the associated information presented to the terminal apparatus by the image search server and purchase a commercial good indicated by the object contained in the captured image A.

Assume that for example an image containing an object closely similar to the object contained in the image A illustrated in is captured as the captured image A using the terminal apparatus . Further assume that the image A containing the object and the image B containing the object which is the reduced version of the object are stored in the DB .

In this scenario it is possible that the image B rather than the image A is undesirably retrieved as a result of search performed based on similarity calculated from feature points detected from the captured image A. In this case a user cannot acquire desired associated information. To prevent such an undesirable situation according to the embodiment the search unit performs search through images stored in the DB based on a ratio between a size of a target region image capture range and a size of an object.

This is described more specifically below with reference to . In the image A illustrated in the object is placed to take up large space relative to the image A the target region is set such that the size of the target region is slightly larger than the size of the object . By contrast in the image B illustrated in the object which is the reduced version of the object is placed the target region is considerably large relative to the whole area of the image B or in other words the size of the target region is sufficiently larger than the size of the object .

Assume that a first ratio which is the ratio of the size of the object to the size of the target region of the image A calculated from their areas is 1 2 for example. On the other hand a second ratio which is the ratio of the size of the object to the size of the target region of the image B calculated from their areas is 1 16 for example. Thus the second ratio differs considerably from the first ratio. It is noted that the method for calculating the ratio of the sizes is not limited to the area based method. Such information indicating the ratios of the sizes may be calculated in advance and stored in the DB as being contained in the indexes.

As for the captured image A received from the terminal apparatus it is conceivable to calculate a ratio of the size of the object extracted by the extraction unit to the size of the captured image A. Assume that the captured image A is for example such an image as the image A illustrated in and a third ratio which is the ratio of the size of an object in this example the object to the size of the captured image A is 1 4.

In this case the third ratio is closer to the first ratio than to the second ratio. Therefore the search unit outputs an index corresponding to the image A as a result of the search performed based on the captured image A. The presenting unit presents the associated information associated with the index corresponding to the image A to the terminal apparatus . Selecting an index based on the ratio of the size of the object to the image size in this manner allows more reliable selection of a desired index.

The IDs can be of any format so long as the IDs allow identification of the respective pieces of index data stored in the DB . In a case where the pieces of index data stored in the DB are for retrieving respective objects on pages of a catalog magazine a value containing a page number of a page where the object is contained can be used as the ID.

Referring to an element enclosed in tags and of a first line of the part a range of the target region is defined by for example upper left coordinates x1 y1 and lower left coordinates x2 y2 .

Each of elements enclosed in tags and in parts and defines a single piece of associated information. Multiple pieces of associated information can be defined for a single target region in this manner. An element enclosed in tags and in the part defines a title of the associated information. An element enclosed in tags and defines a type of the associated information. In this example address information on the network is defined as the associated information by an element enclosed in tags and .

The XML code thus defines the target regions in the page and the associated information for the target regions. Accordingly it is possible to perform a function defined by the associated information associated with the object contained in the target region in the page.

The search unit calculates the ratio of the size of the object to the size of the captured image A in Step S. It is assumed that object size to target region size ratios are calculated in advance for each image stored in the DB . Information indicating the ratio of the each image stored in the DB can be embedded in the XML code in advance.

In Step S the calculation unit compares the object extracted from the captured image A against the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB . More specifically the calculation unit calculates similarity between the object contained in the captured image A and each of the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB .

In Step S the search unit determines whether or not the indexes stored in the DB contain an index with which an object matching the object contained in the captured object A is retrieved based on the similarity calculated in Step S. In this example among the objects retrieved with the indexes stored in the DB an object having a similarity equal to or higher than a threshold value is determined as the index with which the object matching the object contained in the captured image A is retrieved.

If it is determined in Step that there is an index for which the objects match the search unit causes processing to proceed to Step S. In Step S the search unit determines whether or not the indexes stored in the DB contain multiple indexes for which the objects match. If the search unit determines that the indexes contain only a single index for which the objects match the search unit determines that the single index is a search result to be output and causes processing to proceed to Step S. On the other hand if the search unit determines that the indexes contain multiple indexes for which the objects match the search unit causes processing to proceed to Step S.

In Step S the search unit calculates the object size to target region size ratio of each of the multiple objects retrieved with the respective multiple indexes. These ratios of the multiple objects may be calculated and stored in the DB in advance. The search unit also calculates the ratio of the size of the object contained in the captured image A to the size of the captured image A. The search unit determines which ratio among the ratios calculated from the respective multiple objects is closest to the ratio calculated from the captured image A selects an index with which the object having the closest ratio is retrieved as the search result to be output and causes processing to proceed to Step S.

In Step S the presenting unit retrieves associated information associated with the index which is the search result output from the search unit from the DB . The presenting unit then presents the retrieved associated information to the terminal apparatus which is the transmission source of the captured image A. The series of operations according to the flowchart illustrated in is then completed.

If the search unit determines that the indexes contain no index for which the objects match in Step S processing proceeds to Step S. In Step S the presenting unit presents to the terminal apparatus a message indicating that no index for which the objects match is stored in the DB . The series of operations indicated in the flowchart illustrated in is then completed.

If the presenting unit determines that multiple associated pieces of information are associated with the target region in Step S the presenting unit causes processing to proceed to Step S. In Step S the presenting unit creates a function list of functions indicated by the multiple pieces of associated information and presents a selection screen for selecting a single function from the function list to the terminal apparatus For example in a situation where URL and a telephone number are associated with the identified target region as pieces of associated information the presenting unit creates a selection screen for selecting either a function of accessing the URL address or a telephone function of calling the telephone number and presents the selection screen to the terminal apparatus . The series of operations according to the flowchart illustrated in is then completed.

If the presenting unit determines that only a single piece of associated information is associated with the target region in Step S the presenting unit causes processing to proceed to Step S. In Step S the presenting unit creates a screen for performing a function indicated by the single piece of associated information and presents the screen to the terminal apparatus . The series of operations according to the flowchart illustrated in is then completed.

If the presenting unit determines that the DB does not contain associated information associated with the target region identified in Step S the presenting unit causes processing to proceed to Step S. In Step S the presenting unit presents a predetermined specific screen to the terminal apparatus . The series of operations according to the flowchart illustrated in are then completed.

Although in the example described above the image search server selects the single index from the multiple indexes in Step S it is not limited thereto. More specifically a configuration in which a user is prompted to select a single index from multiple indexes may alternatively be employed.

Step S is performed as follows in Step S the presenting unit creates a screen for presenting information indicating the multiple indexes for which matching is determined to a user and presents the screen to the terminal apparatus . For example the presenting unit may create a screen where images of the objects retrieved with the multiple indexes are displayed and present the screen to the terminal apparatus .

The presenting unit is on standby until receiving from the terminal apparatus a result of selection or more specifically a single index object image selected from the multiple indexes object images Step S . Upon receiving a notification that a single index is selected from the presented multiple indexes in Step S from the terminal apparatus the presenting unit selects one from the multiple object images of indexes for which matching is determined according to the received result in Step S. The presenting unit retrieves associated information associated with the index with which the selected object is retrieved from the DB and presents the associated information to the terminal apparatus .

Presenting multiple images to a user in this manner also allows the user to select a desired image more reliably.

The terminal apparatus configured as described above may be configured to display the respective information presented by the presenting unit of the image search server using a browser application for viewing web sites on the network . Furthermore the terminal apparatus may be configured to transmit requests and data to the image search server using the browser application.

This end may be attained as follows for example. The presenting unit of the image search server generates a file of display control data for presenting the respective information to the terminal apparatus using for example hypertext markup language HTML or one of scripting languages of various types and places the generated file at a predetermined address on the network . The presenting unit sends the address to the terminal apparatus so that the terminal apparatus can access the display control data and display the respective information presented by the presenting unit on the terminal apparatus .

If the series of image search operations starting from transmission of a captured image from the terminal apparatus and ending with display of presented information can be comprehensively performed by a single piece of application software great convenience will be provided to users. In the embodiment the series of operations involved in the image search is to be executed by a single piece of application software which is referred to as the image search application .

An information processing system according to a first embodiment is described below. is a diagram illustrating an example configuration of the information processing system according to the first embodiment. Referring to an information processing system includes an image search system A and the terminal apparatus connected to each other over a network. The image search system A corresponds to the image search system described above.

In this example the image search system A includes multiple image search servers which are image search servers A B and C each of which includes one or more information processing apparatuses. Each of the image search servers A B and C includes one or more computers. Each of the image search servers A B and C can include one or more databases each corresponding to the DB . In the example illustrated in the image search server A includes three databases denoted by A A and Aeach corresponding to the DB the image search server B includes one database denoted by Bcorresponding to the DB the image search server C includes two databases denoted by Cand Ceach corresponding to the DB .

The terminal apparatus can transmit the captured image and designating information designating the image search server and the DB to the image search system A. The image search system A selects one of the image search servers and one of the DBs for use in image search based on the captured image according to the designating information transmitted from the terminal apparatus .

In the image search system A server names are assigned to the image search servers A B and C. In this example the server names of the image search servers A B and C are IMAGE SEARCH SERVER IMAGE SEARCH SERVER and IMAGE SEARCH SERVER . Similarly in the image search system A DB names are assigned to the DBs A A and A the DB B and the DBs Cand C. In this example the DB names of the DBs A A and Aare DB DB and DB . The DB name of the DB Bis DB . The DB names of the DBs Cand Care DB and DB .

The terminal apparatus transmits the captured image to which a server name and a DB name are appended to the image search system A. The image search system A determines an image search server which is one of the image search servers A B and C and a DB which is one of the DBs A A and A the DB B and the DBs Cand C for use in image search according to the server name and the DB name appended to the received captured image .

Hereinafter any one of the image search servers A B and C is referred to as the image search server in a situation where differentiating between them is not required. Similarly any one of the DBs A A and A the DB B and the DBs Cand Cis referred to as the DB in a situation where differentiating between them is not required.

The terminal apparatus includes an image search application described above and one or more specific applications. The specific applications each utilize the function provided by the image search application . In the example illustrated in three applications denoted by A B and C are the specific applications. In the first embodiment the image search application is launched by being called by the specific application and used thereby. As a matter of course the terminal apparatus may include only a single specific application which calls the image search application or may include multiple different specific applications as in where the terminal apparatus includes the specific applications A B and C. The terminal apparatus can be launched and used independently.

In the description below unless otherwise specified the specific application is described as the representative of the multiple applications A B and C.

The specific application can pass a parameter to the image search application when the specific application calls the image search application . The parameter contains information indicating the calling source and can include other value s . Such a parameter can be described using a URL scheme structure. The URL scheme includes a scheme name and predetermined information described in a form determined on a per scheme basis. The scheme name and the predetermined information are separated by a colon . For example information indicating a calling source e.g. application name may be described in a scheme name part which is followed by a colon. Following the colon other values a variable a command and the like may be described.

The image search application can change behavior thereof according to the parameter passed from the specific application. For example the image search application can change displayed appearance referred to as skin and UI of the terminal apparatus where the image search application runs according to the parameter passed from the specific application.

For another example the specific application can configure the parameter so as to contain the server name and the DB name described above and pass the parameter to the image search application . In this case the image search application appends the server name and the DB name contained in the parameter passed from the specific application to the captured image and transmits the captured image to the image search system A. Accordingly the image search system A can perform image searches based on the same captured image using a different combination of the image search server and the DB and return different associated information to the terminal apparatus as results of the searches performed based on the same captured image .

For example assume a situation in which the image search application is called by the specific application with a parameter A containing the server name IMAGE SEARCH SERVER and the DB name DB passed from the specific application. In this case the image search application transmits the captured image to which the server name IMAGE SEARCH SERVER and the DB name DB are appended to the image search system A. The image search system A causes the image search server A to perform image search using the DB Aaccording to the server name and the DB name appended to the captured image and transmits associated information obtained as a search result to the terminal apparatus . The associated information may indicate for example a URL of a content distribution web site A.

For another example assume a situation in which the image search application is called by the application B with a parameter B containing the server name IMAGE SEARCH SERVER and the DB name DB passed from the application B. In this case the image search application transmits the captured image to which the server name IMAGE SEARCH SERVER and the DB name DB are appended to the image search system A. The image search system A causes the image search server B to perform image search using the DB Baccording to the server name and the DB name appended to the captured image and transmits associated information obtained as a search result to the terminal apparatus . The associated information may indicate for example a URL of a content distribution web site B.

The CPU provides overall control of operations of the terminal apparatus according to programs stored in the ROM and the storage by using the RAM as a working memory. The display control unit converts a display control signal generated by the CPU into a signal displayable by a display device and outputs the converted signal.

The storage stores the programs to be executed by the CPU and various types of data. The data I F allows external data inputs. As the data I F an interface such as a universal serial bus USB interface or an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE 1394 interface can be used.

The input unit includes an input device which receives user s input and outputs a predetermined control signal. A user can issue a command to the terminal apparatus by operating the input device in accordance with a display on the display device for example. It is preferable to configure the input device for receiving user s input in one piece with the display device as a touchscreen which outputs a control signal depending on a touched position and makes it possible to see an image displayed on the display device through the touchscreen.

The communication I F carries out data communications with the network using a predetermined protocol. The image capturing unit includes an optical system an imaging device and a control drive circuit for the optical system and the imaging device and outputs image data which is obtained by performing predetermined processing on a signal output from the imaging device. The image capturing unit performs a function such as image capturing or zooming in accordance with a command caused to be issued by a user by operating the input unit . The captured image acquired by the image capturing unit by image capture is transmitted to the communication I F via the bus and transmitted to the image search server over the network in accordance with a command from the CPU for example.

The first execution unit corresponds to the image search application . The second execution unit corresponds to the specific application. Accordingly the first execution unit is launched by being called by the second execution unit . Furthermore when the first execution unit launched by being called by the second execution unit completes processing the first execution unit gives processing execution priority back to the second execution unit .

The control unit provides overall control of operations of the terminal apparatus . The storage corresponds to the storage described above and stores programs to be executed on the terminal apparatus and various types of data. The communication unit controls for example the communication I F to carry out external data communications over a network.

The UI unit includes an input unit and a display unit . The input unit receives the control signal output from the input unit illustrated in by user s manipulation. The display unit generates display information for displaying an execution screen on the display device illustrated in . The UI unit associates a position on the execution screen displayed on the display unit with a control signal which is received by the input unit depending on a touched position where the input unit is touched.

The control unit the communication unit and the UT unit and the first execution unit and the second execution unit described above are implemented by multiple programs which run on the CPU . Hereinafter these multiple programs are collectively referred to as the terminal program . The terminal program may be configured to be stored in a computer connected to the network and provided by downloading over a network not shown . The terminal program may be configured to be provided or distributed over the network. A part or the entire terminal program may be provided as being stored in the ROM in advance.

The terminal program may alternatively be provided as being recorded in a non transitory tangible computer readable recording medium such as a CD ROM or a DVD as a file in an installable format or an executable format. In this case the terminal program recorded in the recording medium may be supplied to the terminal apparatus via an external drive device connected to the data I F for example. Alternatively the terminal program recorded in the recording medium may be temporarily stored in another information processing apparatus such as a personal computer and supplied from the information processing apparatus to the terminal apparatus through communication via the communication I F or the data I F .

The terminal program is configured in modules including the units described above the control unit the communication unit and the UI unit and the first execution unit and the second execution unit for example. From the viewpoint of actual hardware the CPU reads out the terminal program from for example the storage and executes the terminal program to load the units into a main storage device e.g. the RAM thereby generating the units on the main storage device.

The API layer includes application programming interface API and intermediates between the application layer and the OS layer which is described later. The OS layer includes an OS and provides overall control of operations of the terminal program . The OS includes various services which are common among and usable by the applications in the application layer . For example the control unit the communication unit and the UI unit are included in the OS layer . The hardware I F HW I F layer intermediates between the OS layer and hardware such as the storage and the communication I F .

Some applications among the applications included in the application layer providing basic functions are pre installed as standard applications in the terminal apparatus in many cases. Examples of such a standard application include a browser application suitable for viewing various data on a network such as the Internet and an e mail service application for transmitting and receiving e mails.

The applications included in the application layer exchange data and commands with the OS layer via the API layer . The applications utilize hardware facilities provided by the terminal apparatus and exchange data and commands between the applications in this manner.

The first execution unit according to the first embodiment can be configured to be loaded into the main storage device by being called by the second execution unit . A program for implementing the first execution unit is not necessarily initially included in the terminal apparatus the program may be configured to be provided over a network or the like when the program is called by the second execution unit .

A procedure according to the first embodiment for calling by the second execution unit the first execution unit is schematically described below with reference to . Description below is based on an assumption that the second execution unit is launched and loaded into the main storage device but the first execution unit is not launched yet. In other words the application layer includes the second execution unit but does not include the first execution unit . In this state the second execution unit calls the first execution unit .

As illustrated in when a command to call the first execution unit is issued by user s manipulation for example the second execution unit requests the OS to launch the first execution unit Step S . In response to this request the OS determines whether or not a program referred to as the first execution unit program for executing the first execution unit has been installed in the terminal apparatus . In this example the OS makes this determination based on whether or not the first execution unit program is stored in the storage Step S . Alternatively the OS may make this determination based on a list which is pre stored in the RAM or the like of applications already installed into the terminal apparatus .

If the OS determines that the first execution unit program has been installed as illustrated in the OS reads out the first execution unit program from for example the storage and loads it into the RAM which is the main storage device Step S and launches the first execution unit . The OS takes application execution priority from the second execution unit and gives it to the first execution unit for example.

On the other hand if the OS determines that the first execution unit program has not been installed into the terminal apparatus yet as illustrated in the OS controls the communication I F to externally acquire the first execution unit program over the network Step S . The acquired first execution unit program is temporarily stored in the storage and installed according to a predetermined procedure. When the first execution unit program has been installed the OS launches the first execution unit program by performing the operation in Step S described above.

The captured image acquisition unit acquires a captured image by controlling image capture performed by the image capturing unit . The transmitting unit transmits information over the network. For example the transmitting unit is provided with information about a network address of the image search system A in advance and transmits data to the image search system A over the network. The transmitting unit transmits the captured image acquired by the captured image acquisition unit to the image search system A. The receiving unit receives information transmitted over the network. For example the receiving unit receives associated information presented by the presenting unit of the image search server belonging to the image search system A.

The setting unit configures behavior of the first execution unit at runtime according to an externally fed parameter. For example the setting unit can configure displayed appearance skin of the launched first execution unit depending on the parameter. More specifically for example the setting unit may select one of several different skins which are provided in advance according to the parameter.

The skin is a set of data including image data a rendering command and layout data for example. The first execution unit can be provided with multiple skin data sets in advance. Alternatively the first execution unit can externally acquire skin data over the network or acquire skin data from the second execution unit calling the first execution unit .

The setting unit can configure UI of the first execution unit depending on the parameter. For example the setting unit may configure components such as a button to be displayed on the UI or layout of the components according to the parameter. The first execution unit may be provided with multiple pieces of information for configuring the UI in advance. Each of the pieces of information can include information about which component is to be displayed on the UI and layout of the component. Alternatively the first execution unit can externally acquire the information for configuring the UI over the network or acquire the information from the second execution unit calling the first execution unit .

The setting unit can configure the image search server and the DB for use in image search based on a designated parameter. For example if the designated parameter contains a server name and a DB name the setting unit passes the server name and the DB name to the transmitting unit . When transmitting the captured image to the image search system A the transmitting unit appends the server name and the DB name to the captured image .

The accepting unit accepts a parameter passed from the second execution unit for example. The accepting unit passes the accepted parameter to the setting unit for example. The calling unit calls the calling source of the first execution unit . For example at completion of the first execution unit launched by being called by the second execution unit the calling unit calls the second execution unit .

The saving unit saves content data acquired based on a result of image search performed by the image search system A. When saving the content data the saving unit can save and associate the content data with information indicating the calling source contained in the parameter passed from the second execution unit . In addition or alternatively the saving unit may save and associate the content data with information e.g. URL indicating a source from which the content data is acquired. Saving content data associated with a calling source and or an acquisition source in this manner makes it possible to discriminate one content data set from another content data set and accordingly forming a collection of content data sets.

The presenting unit generates presenting information based on the associated information received by the receiving unit and passes the presenting information to the display unit . This is described below by way of the following example. Assume that multiple pieces of associated information are acquired by image search performed based on the single captured image transmitted from the terminal apparatus to the image search system A. Meanwhile multiple pieces of associated information can be assigned to a single object as indicated by the parts and in .

The presenting unit is capable of extracting certain piece of associated information by applying as a filter a parameter accepted by the accepting unit to multiple pieces of associated information. More specifically the parameter may be configured to contain a part of or the entire of a single piece of associated information for example. The presenting unit compares the acquired multiple pieces of associated information against the parameter thereby extracting associated information conforming to the parameter.

When the presenting unit has extracted the single piece of associated information from the multiple pieces of associated information the presenting unit can generate and configure presenting information so as to highlight the extracted single piece of associated information. The display unit generates based on the presenting information display information configured so as to highlight the extracted single piece of associated information compared to the other multiple pieces of associated information. Any method including boldfacing and color inversion for highlighting the displayed information can be used. Alternatively when the presenting unit has extracted a single piece of associated information from multiple pieces of associated information the presenting unit may generate and configure presenting information so as to display only the extracted single piece of associated information.

The processing unit performs a process specific to the second execution unit . In an example scenario where the second execution unit is an application for carrying out promotional campaign of a singer the processing unit may process displaying the singer s personal profile reproducing a music video of the singer displaying event announcement concert ticket selling and or the like. In another example scenario where the second execution unit is an application for advertising a shop the processing unit may process displaying navigation to the location of the shop and information about goods sold at the shop online selling and or the like.

The calling unit calls the first execution unit . For example the calling unit launches the first execution unit by performing operations in Steps S to S of in response to user s manipulation or the like. The calling unit is provided in advance with a parameter which is to be passed to the first execution unit to be launched. The calling unit passes the parameter to the first execution unit when launching the first execution unit . The parameter may be passed from the second execution unit to the first execution unit via the OS for example.

A first example application of the first embodiment is described below. The first example application is configured as described below so that specific content can be acquired by performing by the first execution unit called by the second execution unit image search based on an image designated by the second execution unit as the captured image .

It is assumed that at this point in time the image search application which is the first execution unit is not launched yet on the terminal apparatus . Hereinafter the button images are simply referred to as the buttons touching a position of a button image is referred to as operating the button .

When a predetermined button on the top screen is operated the specific application changes the display on the display device to an announcement screen Step S . In this example the specific application is configured such that when a user performs image search based on the captured image acquired by image capture of a designated subject e.g. a poster using the image search system A the user can obtain a URL of a web site providing a privilege video for example. In this example it is assumed that the content distribution web site A illustrated in distributes the privilege video.

A button for adding the image search function is arranged on the announcement screen . When this button is operated the specific application calls the image search application . At this time the terminal apparatus determines whether or not the image search application is installed. More specifically for example the specific application requests the OS to launch the image search application as illustrated in Step S of . In response to this request the OS determines whether or not the image search application is installed in Step S.

If the terminal apparatus determines that the image search application is installed the specific application calls and launches the image search application Step S . At this time the specific application passes a predetermined parameter to the image search application being launched. This parameter contains information such as a name of the specific application indicating the specific application and information indicating the server name of the image search server and the DB name of the DB for use in image search to be performed based on the captured image acquired by image capture of the poster . The server name and the DB name contained in the parameter are a predetermined server name and a predetermined DB name which depend on the specific application.

This parameter may further contain information for configuring skin of an execution screen e.g. an image search application screen which appears when the image search application is launched and information for configuring UI of the image search application .

On the other hand if the terminal apparatus determines that the image search application is not installed yet as in the case of initial use of the image search application it is necessary for the terminal apparatus to externally acquire a program for installing the image search application over the network or the like. Accordingly in Step S the specific application changes the display on the display device of the terminal apparatus to a download DL screen for downloading the program over the network.

The terminal apparatus starts downloading and installation of the program in response to predetermined user s manipulation of the DL screen Step S . More specifically as illustrated in the OS may control the communication I F to externally acquire the program over the network Step S and install the program into the terminal apparatus .

When the program has been installed the installed program is automatically run to launch the image search application . When launched the image search application changes the display on the display device to the image search application screen .

When in the terminal apparatus where the image search application is launched a predetermined button arranged on the image search application screen is operated to capture an image of a subject which is the designated poster an image of the poster is acquired as the captured image Step S . The image search application transmits the captured image acquired by image capture of the poster to the image search system A. More specifically the image search application transmits the captured image to which the server name and the DB name contained in the parameter passed from the specific application are appended to the image search system A.

The image search system A selects one of the image search servers and one of the DBs in accordance with the server name and the DB name appended to the captured image and performs image search based on the captured image . The image search system A acquires a single piece of associated information indicating a web site for the privilege video for example as a search result and transmits the search result to the terminal apparatus Step S . The associated information is received by the image search application of the terminal apparatus .

The image search application accesses the content distribution web site A in accordance with the received associated information and acquires the privilege video as content. The image search application changes the display on the display device to a content display screen and causes the acquired privilege video to be displayed. At this time it is preferable that the image search application causes information indicating the calling source specific application to be displayed on the content display screen .

The image search application can save the content privilege image acquired in Step S using the saving unit Step S . The saving unit may associate the content with information indicating the calling source or information indicating the content distribution web site A from which the privilege video is acquired and save the content associated with the information in the storage for example.

The image search application changes the display on the display device to a content save screen when a predetermined operation requesting to save the content is performed on the content display screen or on the image search application screen after acquisition of the captured image . When a predetermination operation is performed on the content save screen to confirm the content saving the image search application saves the acquired content using the saving unit . The saved content is displayed in a collection display area in the form of for example a list.

The user can return to the specific application which is the calling source by operating a BACK button on the content display screen . More specifically when the BACK button is operated the calling unit calls the specific application which is the calling source Step S . Calling operations performed at this time to call the specific application are substantially the same as the above described operations performed in Steps S to S of .

As indicated in the first example application the image search application according to the first embodiment is capable of acquiring specific content which depends on a parameter passed from a specific application at launch of the image search application by performing image search based on the captured image . This facilitates for a provider of the specific application extending function of the specific application or more specifically adding the function provided by the image search application to the specific application.

A second example application of the first embodiment is described below. In the second example application the first execution unit called by the second execution unit selects associated information from pieces of associated information acquired by image search performed based on the captured image according to a parameter passed from the second execution unit .

It is assumed that at this point in time the image search application which is the first execution unit is not launched on the terminal apparatus yet.

When the button on the top screen is operated the specific application calls the image search application . At this time the terminal apparatus determines whether or not the image search application is installed. If the terminal apparatus determines that the image search application is installed the specific application calls and launches the image search application Step S . When launched the image search application changes the display on the display device to an image search application screen .

When calling the image search application the specific application passes a predetermined parameter to the image search application . This parameter contains information such as a name of the specific application indicating the specific application and information indicating the server name of the image search server and the DB name of the DB for use in image search to be performed based on the captured image acquired by image capture. The server name and the DB name contained in the parameter are a default server name and a default DB name of the image search system A.

This parameter may further contain information for configuring skin of an execution screen e.g. the image search application screen which appears when the image search application is launched and information for configuring UI of the image search application .

If the terminal apparatus determines that the image search application is not installed in Step S the specific application changes the display on the display device to a DL screen for downloading the program for installing the image search application over the network.

The specific application starts downloading and installation of the program in response to predetermined user s manipulation of the DL screen Step S . When the program has been installed the installed program is automatically run to launch the image search application Step S . When launched the image search application changes the display on the display device to the image search application screen .

In the second example application a subject the image of which is captured for image search by the terminal apparatus where the image search application is launched is an advertising medium of a good sold by the retailer which is the provider of the specific application. Producer of the advertising medium pre registers objects including an image of the good contained in the advertising medium in the image search system A Step S .

In the case of the second example application it is highly possible that the producer of the advertising medium is manufacturer of the good advertised by the advertising medium and not directly related to the retailer or in other words the provider of the specific application. Put another way it is highly possible that goods of the same model are sold by multiple retailers and the same advertising medium advertising the good of the model is used by the multiple retailers.

The following situation can occur during registration of the object contained in the advertising medium in the image search system A. That is multiple pieces of associated information which indicate the respective multiple retailers selling the goods of the model advertised by the advertising medium can be associated with the object. For example multiple pieces of associated information which indicate respective retailers A B and C selling goods of a single the same model can be registered associated with an object which is an image of the good in the image search system A.

Each of the retailers A B and C can register the object which is the image of the good of the single model associated with multiple pieces of associated information. A possible scenario is that the object which is the image of the good of the single model is registered associated with a piece of associated information for displaying details of the good and with a piece of associated information for allowing purchase of the good online.

When in the terminal apparatus a predetermined button arranged on the image search application screen is operated to capture an image of the subject the advertising medium the image of the advertising medium is acquired as the captured image Step S . The image search application transmits the captured image acquired by image capture of the advertising medium to the image search system A. More specifically the image search application transmits the captured image to which the server name and the DB name contained in the parameter passed from the specific application are appended to the image search system A.

In the second example application appending a DB name and a server name to the captured image in this manner can be omitted. In the case where a DB name and a server name are not appended to the captured image transmitted from the terminal apparatus the image search system A performs image search using the system default image search server and the system default DB .

The image search system A selects one of the image search servers and one of the DBs in accordance with the server name and the DB name appended to the captured image and performs image search based on the captured image . In this scenario because the server name and the DB name are their default values the image search system A selects the system default image search server and the system default DB . Meanwhile the image search system A selects the system default image search server and the system default DB also in the case where appending the server name and the DB name to the captured image is omitted.

The image search system A performs image search based on the captured image acquired by image capture of the advertising medium . The image search system A then acquires associated information associated with the object contained in the advertising medium . In this scenario as described above the three pieces of associated information which indicate the respective retailers A B and C are associated with the object. The image search system A acquires the three pieces of associated information as a result of the image search.

The image search system A transmits the three pieces of associated information acquired as the search result to the terminal apparatus Step S . The three pieces of associated information are received by the image search application of the terminal apparatus .

Upon receiving the pieces of associated information the image search application extracts associated information related to the specific application which is the calling source of the image search application from the pieces of received associated information.

This will be described more specifically below. Information indicating the specific application is contained in the parameter to be passed from the specific application to the image search application . This information is configured in advance so as to contain a part of the associated information related to the specific application. More specifically for example in a case where the associated information is a URL the parameter may contain domain name of the URL as the information indicating the specific application. In this case the image search application compares each of the pieces of received associated information URLs against the information which is contained in the parameter and indicates the specific application thereby extracting associated information which contains a domain name matching the domain name of the information which is contained in the parameter and indicates the specific application as the associated information related to the specific application. If the received associated information contains multiple pieces of associated information which are identical in domain name but differ from each other in path name these multiple pieces of associated information can be extracted.

Applying filtering to multiple pieces of associated information using a parameter in this manner allows extracting associated information related to the specific application which is the calling source of the image search application .

The image search application generates a related information display screen based on the associated information extracted filtered using the parameter and causes the display device to display the related information display screen . The related information display screen contains an area where buttons for choosing from pieces of related information related to the object contained in the advertising medium are arranged. A user can operate one button with which desired related information is chosen of the buttons arranged in the area to thereby change the display on the display device to a screen displaying the chosen related information.

For instance assume that multiple buttons are arranged in the area . A first button of the multiple buttons is to designate a URL where detailed information about the good indicated by the object contained in the advertising medium is presented for example. When the first button is operated the image search application accesses the URL and changes the display on the display device to a content display screen which displays the detailed information about the good at the URL Step S .

In the example illustrated in the image search application accesses the URL by launching the browser application which is default installed in the terminal apparatus and passing the URL to the browser application as a parameter. In this case the screen provided by the browser application corresponds to the content display screen . Alternatively the image search application may display the content display screen by using an internal function of the image search application .

A second button is to designate for example a URL where the good can be purchased online. When the second button is operated the image search application accesses the URL and changes the display on the display device to a purchase screen at the URL Step S . In this example the purchase screen is configured to allow moving from the purchase screen to the specific application top screen Step S .

When a third button is operated related information is saved in the terminal apparatus for example Step S . The image search application can designate for example a URL associated information displayed on the related information display screen and save the designated URL using the saving unit . At this time the image search application can acquire a page at the designated URL as an image for example and display the acquired image associated with the URL in a collection display area in a form of a thumbnail image. Images and URLs hitherto been saved by the image search application are displayed in the collection display area in a list form.

A user can access a URL associated with a desired one of the thumbnail images by choosing and operating the one thumbnail image in the collection display area . If the chosen thumbnail image is associated with the URL where for example the detailed information about the good is provided the image search application changes the display on the display device to the content display screen Step S . Similarly if the chosen thumbnail image is associated with the URL where the good can be purchased the image search application changes the display on the display device to the purchase screen Step S .

When a BACK button on the related information display screen is operated the specific application is called by the image search application and execution priority is taken from the image search application and given to the specific application. The display on the display device is changed to the specific application top screen Step S .

As indicated in the second example application the image search application according to the first embodiment can extract associated information which depends on a parameter passed from a specific application at launch of the image search application from multiple pieces of associated information acquired as a result of image search based on the captured image . Because the specific application operates only to pass the parameter from the specific application to the image search application extending functionality for implementing the second example application can be attained easily.

A second embodiment of the present invention is described below. illustrates an example configuration of an information processing system according to the second embodiment. Repeat use of reference characters in is intended to represent the same or analogous features or elements and repeated detailed description is omitted.

As illustrated in an information processing system according to the second embodiment includes on a network a specific web site hereinafter the specific site capable of implementing functions equivalent to those provided by the specific application of the first embodiment. In the information processing system the terminal apparatus accesses the specific site . The specific site calls the image search application on the terminal apparatus and passes a parameter to the launched image search application . The parameter includes at least a URL of the specific site as information indicating the calling source specific site .

The image search application to which the parameter is passed operates as in the first embodiment described above and repeated detailed description is omitted.

Operations for launching the first execution unit the image search application through the browser application are schematically described below with reference to . schematically illustrates an example configuration of a terminal program running on the terminal apparatus according to the second embodiment. Repeat use of reference characters in is intended to represent the same or analogous features or elements and repeated detailed description is omitted.

Referring to a terminal program includes the application layer the API layer the OS layer and the hardware I F layer . The application layer includes the browser application and the first execution unit .

The browser application accesses the specific site at a given URL via the communication I F . Through this access data provided on the page at the URL is transmitted to the communication I F over the network Step S . This data is passed from the communication I F to the OS via the hardware I F layer Step S . The data is then passed from the OS to the browser application via the API layer Step S .

When the data provided at the specific site is loaded into the browser application a screen of the page of the specific site is displayed on the browser application . This screen contains a button or a hyperlink for calling the first execution unit and passing a parameter to the same.

As illustrated in when the button or the hyperlink is operated to issue a command to call the first execution unit the browser application requests the OS to launch the first execution unit Step S . In response to this request the OS accesses the storage for example Step S . As illustrated in the OS reads out the first execution unit program from the storage and loads it into the RAM which is the main storage device Step S and launches the first execution unit . The OS then takes application execution priority from the browser application and gives it to the first execution unit for example.

If the OS determines that as a result of the access to the storage in Step S the first execution unit program has not been installed into the terminal apparatus yet the OS controls the communication I F to externally acquire the first execution unit program over the network Step S . The acquired first execution unit program is temporarily stored in the storage and installed according to a predetermined procedure. When the first execution unit program has been installed the OS launches the first execution unit program by performing the operation of Step S described above.

More specifically when launching the first execution unit through the browser application the browser application passes a parameter to the first execution unit based on the data loaded from the specific site . The parameter can include the URL of the specific site for example as information indicating the calling source of the first execution unit . Using the URL of the specific site as the information indicating the calling source causes the browser application to access the specific site at the time of return from the first execution unit . The parameter may include a server name and a DB name for use in image search.

When transmitting the captured image to the image search system A the first execution unit which is the image search application appends information contained in the parameter passed from the browser application to the captured image as in the first embodiment. The information allows the image search application to acquire associated information related to the specific site as a result of the image search. Furthermore the associated information acquired by the image search application can be passed to the browser application so that the browser application can access the content distribution web site A or the content distribution web site B related to the specific site .

As described above according to the second embodiment it is possible to launch the image search application from a web site on the network using the terminal apparatus and acquire associated information related to the web site by causing the image search system A to perform image search based on the captured image . In recent years a web site dedicated to an event is often created on the Web and proportion of event participants who obtain entry to the event through the web site is increasing. Applying the second embodiment allows even when entry to the event is obtained through the web site easy access to associated information related to the event.

In the examples described above the parameter passed to the image search application is the specific application or the specific site on the network. However the parameter is not limited to such examples. Alternatively for example the parameter may include position information. In this case the terminal apparatus may be configured to further include a GPS unit which provides location information by receiving a global positioning system GPS signal and acquire information indicating an image captured position of the captured image using the GPS unit. The terminal apparatus may pass the parameter to which the position information is added to the image search application . When the image search application accesses a URL indicated by associated information acquired as a result of image search performed by the image search system A based on the captured image the image search application transmits the position information as a parameter of the URL. The position information allows a web site at the URL indicated by the associated information to transmit content which depends on the position information to the terminal apparatus .

In the above description the parameter passed from the specific application to the image search application is used in choosing one of the image search servers and one of the DBs for use in image search selecting associated information from the pieces of associated information acquired as a result of the image search and configuring the skin and the UI of the image search application . However it is not limited to these examples.

For example a startup screen of the image search application may be configured depending on the parameter. For example which one the image search application screen illustrated in and a camera capture image screen which directly displays an image captured with a camera is to be displayed at launch of the image search application may be determined depending on the parameter. In a case where the camera capture image screen is directly displayed the screen may return to the specific application top screen immediately when image capture is completed for example.

An image captured medium which is the subject to be image captured to acquire the captured image is not limited to a printed paper medium. The image captured medium may be a medium such as electronic paper or digital signage for displaying an electronic image.

The parameter may place restriction on pieces of associated information to be acquired by image search. For example the image search application may limit the type of the associated information to be acquired by image search depending on the parameter. The parameter may further determine a language mode to be applied to the image search application . More specifically although the language mode is typically determined by the OS the parameter may forcibly change the language mode.

An embodiment provides an advantageous effect that it is made possible to easily configure a function which is provided by an application and utilized from a further application depending on the purpose of the further application.
