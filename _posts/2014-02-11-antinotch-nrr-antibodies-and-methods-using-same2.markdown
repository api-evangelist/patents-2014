The present invention relates generally to the field of molecular biology. More specifically the invention concerns anti Notch1 negative regulatory region NRR antibodies and uses of same.

The Notch receptor family is a class of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptors that transmit signals affecting development in organisms as diverse as sea urchins and humans. Both Notch receptors and its family of ligands Delta and Serrate known as Jagged in mammals are transmembrane proteins with large extracellular domains that contain epidermal growth factor EGF like repeats. The number of Notch paralogues differs between species. For example there are four Notch receptors in mammals Notch1 Notch4 two in LIN 12 and GLP 1 and one in Notch . Notch receptors are proteolytically processed during transport to the cell surface by a furin like protease at a site S1 external to the transmembrane domain producing an extracellular Notch ECN subunit and a Notch transmembrane subunit NTM . These two subunits remain non covalently associated and constitute the mature heterodimeric cell surface receptor. Notch1 ECN subunits contains 36 N terminal EGF like repeats followed by three tandemly repeated Lin 12 Notch Repeat LNR modules that precede the S1 site. Each LNR module contains three disulfide bonds and a group of conserved acidic and polar residues predicted to coordinate a calcium ion. Within the EGF repeat region lie binding sites for the activating ligands. The LNR modules which comprise a unique domain of Notch receptors participate in maintaining Notch in a resting conformation before ligand induced activation. The Notch1 NTM comprises an extracellular region which harbors the S2 cleavage site a transmembrane segment which harbors the S3 cleavage site and a large intracellular part that includes a RAM domain ankyrin repeats a transactivation domain and a carboxy terminal PEST sequence. Stable association of the ECN and NTM subunits is dependent on a heterodimerization domain HD comprising the carboxy terminal end of the ECN termed HD C and the extracellular amino terminal end of NTM termed HD N . Binding of a Notch ligand to the ECN subunit initiates two successive proteolytic cleavages that occur through regulated intramembrane proteolysis. The first cleavage by a metalloprotease at site S2 renders the Notch transmembrane subunit susceptible to the second cleavage at site S3 close to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Site S3 cleavage which is catalyzed by a multiprotein complex containing presenilin and nicastrin liberates the intracellular portion of the Notch transmembrane subunit allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes.

Five Notch ligands of the Jagged and Delta like classes have been identified in humans Jagged1 also termed Serrate1 Jagged2 also termed Serrate2 Delta like1 also termed DLL1 Delta like3 also termed DLL3 and Delta like4 also termed DLL4 . Each of the ligands is a single pass transmembrane protein with a conserved N terminal Delta Serrate LAG 2 DSL motif essential for binding Notch. A series of EGF like modules C terminal to the DSL motif precede the membrane spanning segment. Unlike the Notch receptors the ligands have short cytoplasmic tails of 70 215 amino acids at the C terminus. In addition other types of ligands have been reported e.g. DNER NB3 and F3 Contactin .

The Notch pathway functions during diverse developmental and physiological processes including those affecting neurogenesis in flies and vertebrates. In general Notch signaling is involved in lateral inhibition lineage decisions and the establishment of boundaries between groups of cells see e.g. Bray Molecular Cell Biology 7 678 679 2006 . A variety of human diseases including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders have been shown to result from mutations in genes encoding Notch receptors or their ligands see e.g. Nam et al. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 6 501 509 2002 . The connection between unrestrained Notch signaling and malignancy was first recognized when a recurrent t 7 9 q34 q34.3 chromosomal translocation which creates a truncated constitutively active variant of human Notch1 was identified in a subset of human acute lymphoblastic leukemias T ALL . In mouse models Notch1 signaling has been shown to be essential for T cell development and that Notch1 mediated signals promote T cell development at the expense of B cell development. Also in mouse models excess Notch signaling during development leads to T cell neoplasia.

Moreover Notch receptors are expressed in a wide range of human cancers and tumor derived cell lines and promote neural fates in human embryonic stem cells. For instance Notch is highly expressed in neoplastic lesions in the human cervix and in human renal cell carcinoma cells. Given the involvement of Notch signaling in a wide variety of human disease it is clear that there continues to be a need for agents that regulate Notch signaling that have clinical attributes that are optimal for development as therapeutic agents. The invention described herein meets this need and provides other benefits.

An isolated antibody is one which has been identified and separated and or recovered from a component of its natural environment. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody and may include enzymes hormones and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes. In preferred embodiments the antibody will be purified 1 to greater than 95 by weight of antibody as determined by the Lowry method and most preferably more than 99 by weight 2 to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a spinning cup sequenator or 3 to homogeneity by SDS PAGE sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing or nonreducing conditions using Coomassie blue or preferably silver stain. Isolated antibody includes the antibody in situ within recombinant cells since at least one component of the antibody s natural environment will not be present. Ordinarily however isolated antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

An isolated nucleic acid molecule is a nucleic acid molecule that is identified and separated from at least one contaminant nucleic acid molecule with which it is ordinarily associated in the natural source of the nucleic acid. An isolated nucleic acid molecule is other than in the form or setting in which it is found in nature. Isolated nucleic acid molecules therefore are distinguished from the nucleic acid molecule as it exists in natural cells. However an isolated nucleic acid molecule includes a nucleic acid molecule contained in cells that ordinarily express the nucleic acid for example an antibody encoding nucleic acid where for example the nucleic acid molecule is in a chromosomal location different from that of natural cells.

The term variable domain residue numbering as in Kabat or amino acid position numbering as in Kabat and variations thereof refers to the numbering system used for heavy chain variable domains or light chain variable domains of the compilation of antibodies in Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Using this numbering system the actual linear amino acid sequence may contain fewer or additional amino acids corresponding to a shortening of or insertion into a FR or CDR of the variable domain. For example a heavy chain variable domain may include a single amino acid insert residue 52a according to Kabat after residue 52 of H2 and inserted residues e.g. residues 82a 82b and 82c etc according to Kabat after heavy chain FR residue 82. The Kabat numbering of residues may be determined for a given antibody by alignment at regions of homology of the sequence of the antibody with a standard Kabat numbered sequence.

The difference between said two values is preferably less than about 50 preferably less than about 40 preferably less than about 30 preferably less than about 20 preferably less than about 10 as a function of the value for the reference comparator antibody.

 Binding affinity generally refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule e.g. an antibody and its binding partner e.g. an antigen . Unless indicated otherwise as used herein binding affinity refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 1 interaction between members of a binding pair e.g. antibody and antigen . The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant Kd . Desirably the Kd is 1 10 1 10 5 10 1 10 3 10 5 10 or even 1 10or stronger. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art including those described herein. Low affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily whereas high affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art any of which can be used for purposes of the present invention. Specific illustrative embodiments are described in the following.

In one embodiment the Kd or Kd value according to this invention is measured by a radiolabeled antigen binding assay RIA performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen as described by the following assay that measures solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of I labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen then capturing bound antigen with an anti Fab antibody coated plate Chen et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881 . To establish conditions for the assay microtiter plates Dynex are coated overnight with 5 g ml of a capturing anti Fab antibody Cappel Labs in 50 mM sodium carbonate pH 9.6 and subsequently blocked with 2 w v bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature approximately 23 C. . In a non adsorbant plate Nunc 269620 100 pM or 26 pM I antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest e.g. consistent with assessment of an anti VEGF antibody Fab 12 in Presta et al. 1997 Cancer Res. 57 4593 4599 . The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight however the incubation may continue for a longer period e.g. 65 hours to insure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature e.g. for one hour . The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1 Tween 20 in PBS. When the plates have dried 150 l well of scintillant MicroScint 20 Packard is added and the plates are counted on a Topcount gamma counter Packard for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20 of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays. According to another embodiment the Kd or Kd value is measured by using surface plasmon resonance assays using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 g ml 0.2 M before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881. If the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophotometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stir red cuvette.

An on rate or rate of association or association rate or k according to this invention can also be determined with the same surface plasmon resonance technique described above using a BIAcore 2000 or a BIAcore 3000 BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. at 25 C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at 10 response units RU . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. are activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 5 g ml 0.2 uM before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 10 response units RU of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen 1M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of Fab 0.78 nM to 500 nM are injected in PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 PBST at 25 C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k are calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 by simultaneous fitting the association and dissociation sensorgram. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated as the ratio k k. See e.g. Chen Y. et al. 1999 J. Mol. Biol. 293 865 881. However if the on rate exceeds 10MSby the surface plasmon resonance assay above then the on rate is preferably determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity excitation 295 nm emission 340 nm 16 nm band pass at 25 C. of a 20 nM anti antigen antibody Fab form in PBS pH 7.2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer such as a stop flow equipped spectrophotometer Aviv Instruments or a 8000 series SLM Aminco spectrophotometer ThermoSpectronic with a stirred cuvette.

The term vector as used herein is intended to refer to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. One type of vector is a plasmid which refers to a circular double stranded DNA loop into which additional DNA segments may be ligated. Another type of vector is a phage vector. Another type of vector is a viral vector wherein additional DNA segments may be ligated into the viral genome. Certain vectors are capable of autonomous replication in a host cell into which they are introduced e.g. bacterial vectors having a bacterial origin of replication and episomal mammalian vectors . Other vectors e.g. non episomal mammalian vectors can be integrated into the genome of a host cell upon introduction into the host cell and thereby are replicated along with the host genome. Moreover certain vectors are capable of directing the expression of genes to which they are operatively linked. Such vectors are referred to herein as recombinant expression vectors or simply recombinant vectors . In general expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of plasmids. In the present specification plasmid and vector may be used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector.

If present modification to the nucleotide structure may be imparted before or after assembly of the polymer. The sequence of nucleotides may be interrupted by non nucleotide components. A polynucleotide may be further modified after synthesis such as by conjugation with a label. Other types of modifications include for example caps substitution of one or more of the naturally occurring nucleotides with an analog internucleotide modifications such as for example those with uncharged linkages e.g. methyl phosphonates phosphotriesters phosphoamidates carbamates etc. and with charged linkages e.g. phosphorothioates phosphorodithioates etc. those containing pendant moieties such as for example proteins e.g. nucleases toxins antibodies signal peptides ply L lysine etc. those with intercalators e.g. acridine psoralen etc. those containing chelators e.g. metals radioactive metals boron oxidative metals etc. those containing alkylators those with modified linkages e.g. alpha anomeric nucleic acids etc. as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide s . Further any of the hydroxyl groups ordinarily present in the sugars may be replaced for example by phosphonate groups phosphate groups protected by standard protecting groups or activated to prepare additional linkages to additional nucleotides or may be conjugated to solid or semi solid supports. The 5 and 3 terminal OH can be phosphorylated or substituted with amines or organic capping group moieties of from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Other hydroxyls may also be derivatized to standard protecting groups. Polynucleotides can also contain analogous forms of ribose or deoxyribose sugars that are generally known in the art including for example 2 O methyl 2 O allyl 2 fluoro or 2 azido ribose carbocyclic sugar analogs alpha anomeric sugars epimeric sugars such as arabinose xyloses or lyxoses pyranose sugars furanose sugars sedoheptuloses acyclic analogs and a basic nucleoside analogs such as methyl riboside.

 Percent amino acid sequence identity with respect to a peptide or polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the specific peptide or polypeptide sequence after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps if necessary to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art for instance using publicly available computer software such as BLAST BLAST 2 ALIGN or Megalign DNASTAR software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. For purposes herein however amino acid sequence identity values are generated using the sequence comparison computer program ALIGN 2 wherein the complete source code for the ALIGN 2 program is provided in Table A below. The ALIGN 2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech Inc. and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office Washington D.C. 20559 where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087. The ALIGN 2 program is publicly available through Genentech Inc. South San Francisco Calif. or may be compiled from the source code provided in e.g. WO2007 001851. The ALIGN 2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system preferably digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN 2 program and do not vary.

In situations where ALIGN 2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons the amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to with or against a given amino acid sequence B which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain amino acid sequence identity to with or against a given amino acid sequence B is calculated as follows 100 times the fraction where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN 2 in that program s alignment of A and B and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B. It will be appreciated that where the length of amino acid sequence A is not equal to the length of amino acid sequence B the amino acid sequence identity of A to B will not equal the amino acid sequence identity of B to A.

Desirably two or more amino acid sequences are at least 50 60 70 80 or 90 identical. More desirably two or more amino acid sequences are at least 95 97 98 99 or even 100 identical. Unless specifically stated otherwise all amino acid sequence identity values used herein are obtained as described in the immediately preceding paragraph using the ALIGN 2 computer program.

The terms antibody and immunoglobulin are used interchangeably in the broadest sense and include monoclonal antibodies e.g. full length or intact monoclonal antibodies polyclonal antibodies multivalent antibodies multispecific antibodies e.g. bispecific antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity and may also include certain antibody fragments as described in greater detail herein . An antibody can be human humanized and or affinity matured.

The term variable refers to the fact that certain portions of the variable domains differ extensively in sequence among antibodies and are used in the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the variable domains of antibodies. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions CDRs or hypervariable regions both in the light chain and the heavy chain variable domains. The more highly conserved portions of variable domains are called the framework FR . The variable domains of native heavy and light chains each comprise four FR regions largely adopting a sheet configuration connected by three CDRs which form loops connecting and in some cases forming part of the sheet structure. The CDRs in each chain are held together in close proximity by the FR regions and with the CDRs from the other chain contribute to the formation of the antigen binding site of antibodies see Kabat et al. Fifth Edition National Institute of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . The constant domains are not involved directly in binding an antibody to an antigen but exhibit various effector functions such as participation of the antibody in antibody dependent cellular toxicity.

Papain digestion of antibodies produces two identical antigen binding fragments called Fab fragments each with a single antigen binding site and a residual Fc fragment whose name reflects its ability to crystallize readily. Pepsin treatment yields an F ab fragment that has two antigen combining sites and is still capable of cross linking antigen.

 Fv is the minimum antibody fragment which contains a complete antigen recognition and binding site. In a two chain Fv species this region consists of a dimer of one heavy and one light chain variable domain in tight non covalent association. In a single chain Fv species one heavy and one light chain variable domain can be covalently linked by a flexible peptide linker such that the light and heavy chains can associate in a dimeric structure analogous to that in a two chain Fv species. It is in this configuration that the three CDRs of each variable domain interact to define an antigen binding site on the surface of the VH VL dimer. Collectively the six CDRs confer antigen binding specificity to the antibody. However even a single variable domain or half of an Fv comprising only three CDRs specific for an antigen has the ability to recognize and bind antigen although at a lower affinity than the entire binding site.

The Fab fragment also contains the constant domain of the light chain and the first constant domain CH1 of the heavy chain. Fab fragments differ from Fab fragments by the addition of a few residues at the carboxy terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain including one or more cysteines from the antibody hinge region. Fab SH is the designation herein for Fab in which the cysteine residue s of the constant domains bear a free thiol group. F ab antibody fragments originally were produced as pairs of Fab fragments which have hinge cysteines between them. Other chemical couplings of antibody fragments are also known.

The light chains of antibodies immunoglobulins from any vertebrate species can be assigned to one of two clearly distinct types called kappa and lambda based on the amino acid sequences of their constant domains.

Depending on the amino acid sequence of the constant domain of their heavy chains immunoglobulins can be assigned to different classes. There are five major classes of immunoglobulins IgA IgD IgE IgG and IgM and several of these can be further divided into subclasses isotypes e.g. IgG IgG IgG IgG IgA and IgA. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called and respectively. The subunit structures and three dimensional configurations of different classes of immunoglobulins are well known. Antibody fragments comprise only a portion of an intact antibody wherein the portion preferably retains at least one preferably most or all of the functions normally associated with that portion when present in an intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In one embodiment an antibody fragment comprises an antigen binding site of the intact antibody and thus retains the ability to bind antigen. In another embodiment an antibody fragment for example one that comprises the Fc region retains at least one of the biological functions normally associated with the Fc region when present in an intact antibody such as FcRn binding antibody half life modulation ADCC function and complement binding. In one embodiment an antibody fragment is a monovalent antibody that has an in vivo half life substantially similar to an intact antibody. For e.g. such an antibody fragment may comprise on antigen binding arm linked to an Fc sequence capable of conferring in vivo stability to the fragment.

The term hypervariable region HVR or HV when used herein refers to the regions of an antibody variable domain which are hypervariable in sequence and or form structurally defined loops. Generally antibodies comprise six hypervariable regions three in the VH H1 H2 H3 and three in the VL L1 L2 L3 . A number of hypervariable region delineations are in use and are encompassed herein. The Kabat Complementarity Determining Regions CDRs are based on sequence variability and are the most commonly used Kabat et al. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest 5th Ed. Public Health Service National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1991 . Chothia refers instead to the location of the structural loops Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196 901 917 1987 . The AbM hypervariable regions represent a compromise between the Kabat CDRs and Chothia structural loops and are used by Oxford Molecular s AbM antibody modeling software. The contact hypervariable regions are based on an analysis of the available complex crystal structures. The residues from each of these hypervariable regions are noted below.

 Framework or FR residues are those variable domain residues other than the hypervariable region residues as herein defined.

 Humanized forms of non human e.g. murine antibodies are chimeric antibodies that contain minimal sequence derived from non human immunoglobulin. For the most part humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins recipient antibody in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non human species donor antibody such as mouse rat rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity affinity and capacity. In some instances framework region FR residues of the human immunoglobulin are replaced by corresponding non human residues. Furthermore humanized antibodies may comprise residues that are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one and typically two variable domains in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FRs are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally will also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region Fc typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details see Jones et al. Nature 321 522 525 1986 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 329 1988 and Presta Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2 593 596 1992 .

 Chimeric antibodies immunoglobulins have a portion of the heavy and or light chain identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species or belonging to a particular antibody class or subclass while the remainder of the chain s is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species or belonging to another antibody class or subclass as well as fragments of such antibodies so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 and Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . Humanized antibody as used herein is a subset of chimeric antibodies.

 Single chain Fv or scFv antibody fragments comprise the VH and VL domains of antibody wherein these domains are present in a single polypeptide chain. Generally the scFv polypeptide further comprises a polypeptide linker between the VH and VL domains which enables the scFv to form the desired structure for antigen binding. For a review of scFv see Pluckthun in vol. 113 Rosenburg and Moore eds. Springer Verlag New York pp. 269 315 1994 .

An antigen is a predetermined antigen to which an antibody can selectively bind. The target antigen may be polypeptide carbohydrate nucleic acid lipid hapten or other naturally occurring or synthetic compound. Preferably the target antigen is a polypeptide.

The term diabodies refers to small antibody fragments with two antigen binding sites which fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL in the same polypeptide chain VH VL . By using a linker that is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain the domains are forced to pair with the complementary domains of another chain and create two antigen binding sites. Diabodies are described more fully in for example EP 404 097 WO 93 11161 and Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 .

A human antibody is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human and or has been made using any of the techniques for making human antibodies as disclosed herein. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non human antigen binding residues.

An affinity matured antibody is one with one or more alterations in one or more CDRs thereof which result in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen compared to a parent antibody which does not possess those alteration s . Preferred affinity matured antibodies will have nanomolar or even picomolar affinities for the target antigen. Affinity matured antibodies are produced by procedures known in the art. Marks et al. Bio Technology 10 779 783 1992 describes affinity maturation by VH and VL domain shuffling. Random mutagenesis of CDR and or framework residues is described by Barbas et al. Proc Nat. Acad. Sci USA 91 3809 3813 1994 Schier et al. Gene 169 147 155 1995 Yelton et al. J. Immunol. 155 1994 2004 1995 Jackson et al. J. Immunol. 154 7 3310 9 1995 and Hawkins et al. J. Mol. Biol. 226 889 896 1992 .

Antibody effector functions refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region a native sequence Fc region or amino acid sequence variant Fc region of an antibody and vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity Fc receptor binding antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ADCC phagocytosis down regulation of cell surface receptors e.g. B cell receptor and B cell activation.

 Antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity or ADCC refers to a form of cytotoxicity in which secreted Ig bound onto Fc receptors FcRs present on certain cytotoxic cells e.g. Natural Killer NK cells neutrophils and macrophages enable these cytotoxic effector cells to bind specifically to an antigen bearing target cell and subsequently kill the target cell with cytotoxins. The antibodies arm the cytotoxic cells and are absolutely required for such killing. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 . To assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest an in vitro ADCC assay such as that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337 or Presta U.S. Pat. No. 6 737 056 may be performed. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. 95 652 656 1998 .

 Human effector cells are leukocytes which express one or more FcRs and perform effector functions. Preferably the cells express at least Fc RIII and perform ADCC effector function. Examples of human leukocytes which mediate ADCC include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC natural killer NK cells monocytes cytotoxic T cells and neutrophils with PBMCs and NK cells being preferred. The effector cells may be isolated from a native source e.g. from blood.

 Fc receptor or FcR describes a receptor that binds to the Fc region of an antibody. The preferred FcR is a native sequence human FcR. Moreover a preferred FcR is one which binds an IgG antibody a gamma receptor and includes receptors of the Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII subclasses including allelic variants and alternatively spliced forms of these receptors. Fc RII receptors include Fc RIIA an activating receptor and Fc RIIB an inhibiting receptor which have similar amino acid sequences that differ primarily in the cytoplasmic domains thereof. Activating receptor Fc RIIA contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain Inhibiting receptor Fc RIIB contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibition motif ITIM in its cytoplasmic domain. see review M. in Da ron 15 203 234 1997 . FcRs are reviewed in Ravetch and Kinet 9 457 92 1991 Capel et al. 4 25 34 1994 and de Haas et al. 126 330 41 1995 . Other FcRs including those to be identified in the future are encompassed by the term FcR herein. The term also includes the neonatal receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. 24 249 1994 and regulates homeostasis of immunoglobulins. WO 00 42072 Presta describes antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of that patent publication is specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 .

Methods of measuring binding to FcRn are known see e.g. Ghetie 1997 Hinton 2004 . Binding to human FcRn in vivo and serum half life of human FcRn high affinity binding polypeptides can be assayed e.g. in transgenic mice or transfected human cell lines expressing human FcRn or in primates administered with the Fc variant polypeptides.

 Complement dependent cytotoxicity or CDC refers to the lysis of a target cell in the presence of complement. Activation of the classical complement pathway is initiated by the binding of the first component of the complement system C1q to antibodies of the appropriate subclass which are bound to their cognate antigen. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. 202 163 1996 may be performed.

Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 and WO 99 51642. The contents of those patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Idusogie et al. 164 4178 4184 2000 .

The term Fc region comprising polypeptide refers to a polypeptide such as an antibody or immunoadhesin which comprises an Fc region. The C terminal lysine residue 447 according to the EU numbering system of the Fc region may be removed for example during purification of the polypeptide or by recombinant engineering the nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide. Accordingly a composition comprising a polypeptide having an Fc region according to this invention can comprise polypeptides with K447 with all K447 removed or a mixture of polypeptides with and without the K447 residue.

A blocking antibody or an antagonist antibody is one which inhibits or reduces biological activity of the antigen it binds. Preferred blocking antibodies or antagonist antibodies substantially or completely inhibit the biological activity of the antigen. Desirably the biological activity is reduced by 10 20 30 50 70 80 90 95 or even 100 .

An agonist antibody as used herein is an antibody which mimics at least one of the functional activities of a polypeptide of interest.

An acceptor human framework for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a VL or VH framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or from a human consensus framework. An acceptor human framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof or may contain pre existing amino acid sequence changes. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present preferably no more than 5 and preferably 4 or less or 3 or less pre existing amino acid changes are present. Where pre existing amino acid changes are present in a VH preferably those changes are only at three two or one of positions 71H 73H and 78H for instance the amino acid residues at those positions may be 71A 73T and or 78A. In one embodiment the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.

A human consensus framework is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residue in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VL the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al. In one embodiment for the VH the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al.

The terms neurodegenerative disease and neurodegenerative disorder are used in the broadest sense to include all disorders the pathology of which involves neuronal degeneration and or dysfunction including without limitation peripheral neuropathies motorneuron disorders such as amylotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS Lou Gehrig s disease Bell s palsy and various conditions involving spinal muscular atrophy or paralysis and other human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease epilepsy multiple sclerosis Huntington s chorea Down s Syndrome nerve deafness and Meniere s disease.

 Peripheral neuropathy is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the peripheral nerves most often manifested as one or a combination of motor sensory sensorimotor or autonomic dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathies may for example be genetically acquired can result from a systemic disease or can be induced by a toxic agent such as a neurotoxic drug e.g. antineoplastic agent or industrial or environmental pollutant.

 Peripheral sensory neuropathy is characterized by the degeneration of peripheral sensory neurons which may be idiopathic may occur for example as a consequence of diabetes diabetic neuropathy cytostatic drug therapy in cancer e.g. treatment with chemotherapeutic agents such as vincristine cisplatin methotrexate 3 azido 3 deoxythymidine or taxanes e.g. paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb Oncology Princeton N.J. and doxetaxel TAXOTERE Rh ne Poulenc Rorer Antony France alcoholism acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS or genetic predisposition. Genetically acquired peripheral neuropathies include for example Refsum s disease Krabbe s disease Metachromatic leukodystrophy Fabry s disease Dejerine Sottas syndrome Abetalipoproteinemia and Charcot Marie Tooth CMT Disease also known as Proneal Muscular Atrophy or Hereditary Motor Sensory Neuropathy HMSN . Most types of peripheral neuropathy develop slowly over the course of several months or years. In clinical practice such neuropathies are called chronic. Sometimes a peripheral neuropathy develops rapidly over the course of a few days and is referred to as acute. Peripheral neuropathy usually affects sensory and motor nerves together so as to cause a mixed sensory and motor neuropathy but pure sensory and pure motor neuropathy are also known.

An effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.

A therapeutically effective amount of a substance molecule of the invention agonist or antagonist may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the individual and the ability of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist to elicit a desired response in the individual. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the substance molecule agonist or antagonist are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects. A prophylactically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired prophylactic result. Typically but not necessarily since a prophylactic dose is used in individuals prior to or at an earlier stage of disease the prophylactically effective amount will be less than the therapeutically effective amount.

A growth inhibitory agent when used herein refers to a compound or composition which inhibits growth of a cell such as a cell expressing Notch1 either in vitro or in vivo. Thus the growth inhibitory agent may be one which significantly reduces the percentage of cells such as a cell expressing Notch1 in S phase. Examples of growth inhibitory agents include agents that block cell cycle progression at a place other than S phase such as agents that induce G1 arrest and M phase arrest. Classical M phase blockers include the vincas vincristine and vinblastine taxanes and topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin epirubicin daunorubicin etoposide and bleomycin. Those agents that arrest G1 also spill over into S phase arrest for example DNA alkylating agents such as tamoxifen prednisone dacarbazine mechlorethamine cisplatin methotrexate 5 fluorouracil and ara C. Further information can be found in The Molecular Basis of Cancer Mendelsohn and Israel eds. Chapter 1 entitled Cell cycle regulation oncogenes and antineoplastic drugs by Murakami et al. WB Saunders Philadelphia 1995 especially p. 13. The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are anticancer drugs both derived from the yew tree. Docetaxel TAXOTERE Rhone Poulenc Rorer derived from the European yew is a semisynthetic analogue of paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb . Paclitaxel and docetaxel promote the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilize microtubules by preventing depolymerization which results in the inhibition of mitosis in cells.

A biological sample interchangeably termed sample or tissue or cell sample encompasses a variety of sample types obtained from an individual and can be used in a diagnostic or monitoring assay. The definition encompasses blood and other liquid samples of biological origin solid tissue samples such as a biopsy specimen or tissue cultures or cells derived therefrom and the progeny thereof. The definition also includes samples that have been manipulated in any way after their procurement such as by treatment with reagents solubilization or enrichment for certain components such as proteins or polynucleotides or embedding in a semi solid or solid matrix for sectioning purposes. The term biological sample encompasses a clinical sample and also includes cells in culture cell supernatants cell lysates serum plasma biological fluid and tissue samples. The source of the biological sample may be solid tissue as from a fresh frozen and or preserved organ or tissue sample or biopsy or aspirate blood or any blood constituents bodily fluids such as cerebral spinal fluid amniotic fluid peritoneal fluid or interstitial fluid cells from any time in gestation or development of the individual. In some embodiments the biological sample is obtained from a primary or metastatic tumor. The biological sample may contain compounds which are not naturally intermixed with the tissue in nature such as preservatives anticoagulants buffers fixatives nutrients antibiotics or the like.

For the purposes herein a section of a tissue sample is meant a single part or piece of a tissue sample e.g. a thin slice of tissue or cells cut from a tissue sample. It is understood that multiple sections of tissue samples may be taken and subjected to analysis according to the present invention. In some embodiments the same section of tissue sample is analyzed at both morphological and molecular levels or is analyzed with respect to both protein and nucleic acid.

The word label when used herein refers to a compound or composition which is conjugated or fused directly or indirectly to a reagent such as a nucleic acid probe or an antibody and facilitates detection of the reagent to which it is conjugated or fused. The label may itself be detectable e.g. radioisotope labels or fluorescent labels or in the case of an enzymatic label may catalyze chemical alteration of a substrate compound or composition which is detectable.

Notch receptors are proteolytically processed during transport to the cell surface by a furin like protease at a site S1 about 70 amino acids external to the transmembrane domain producing an extracellular Notch ECN subunit and a Notch transmembrane subunit NTM . These two subunits remain non covalently associated and constitute the mature heterodimeric cell surface receptor. The Notch1 ECN subunit contains 36 N terminal EGF like repeats followed by three tandemly repeated LNR modules LNR A LNR B and LNR C . Each LNR module contains three disulfide bonds and a group of conserved acidic and polar residues predicted to coordinate a calcium ion. Within the EGF repeat region lie binding sites for the activating ligands. The LNR modules participate in maintaining Notch in a resting conformation before ligand induced activation. The Notch1 NTM comprises an extracellular region a transmembrane segment and a large intracellular part that includes a RAM RBP J associated molecule domain ankyrin repeats a transactivation domain and a carboxy terminal PEST sequence. Stable association of the ECN and NTM subunits is dependent on a heterodimerization domain HD including the carboxy terminal end of the ECN termed HD C and the extracellular amino terminal end of NTM termed HD N . Binding of a Notch ligand to the ECN subunit initiates two successive proteolytic cleavages that occur through regulated intramembrane proteolysis. The first cleavage by a metalloprotease at cleavage site S2 located in the NTM renders the Notch transmembrane subunit susceptible to the second cleavage at cleavage site S3 close to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Site S3 cleavage which is catalyzed by a multiprotein complex containing presenilin and nicastrin liberates the intracellular portion of the Notch transmembrane subunit also termed intracellular Notch ICN allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes.

Several types of Notch1 mutations that affect Notch1 signaling have been identified and characterized. Notch1 mutations that activate Notch1 signaling fall into two general classes namely ligand independent and ligand dependent activating mutations. Moreover some ligand independent activating mutations nevertheless are still ligand responsive. Mutations that activate Notch1 signaling have been associated with T ALL Weng et al. Science 306 269 271 2004 Malecki et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 26 4642 4651 2006 . In particular Notch1 activating mutations associated with T ALL have been identified in the HD region and in the PEST domain. In addition translocations can result in aberrant Notch1 signaling. For example Notch1 was discovered as a partner gene in a 7 9 q34 q34.3 chromosomal translocation. This translocation is found in a rare subset of T ALL and fuses the 3 end of the Notch1 gene to the T cell receptor promoter enhancer Weng et al. Science 306 269 271 2004 .

Exemplary ligand independent mutations that signal in the absence of ligand binding but retain the ability to respond to ligand binding are mutations in the HD region of Notch1. Activating mutations in the HD N region of human Notch1 include for example L1575P V1577E F1593S L1594P L1597H R1599P L1601P and I1617T N. Exemplary activating mutations in the HD C region of human Notch1 include V1677D L1679P I1681N A1702P I1719T and an insertion ARLGSLNIPYKIEA SEQ ID NO 52 at the S2 cleavage site the P12 insertion . The L1575P V1577E F1593S L1594P L1597H R1599P L1601P I1617T N V1677D L1679P I1681N A1702P and I1719T mutations and the P12 insertion cause increased S2 and S3 cleavage and Notch1 signaling is greater than signaling of the wild type Notch1 receptor.

A subset of Notch1 activating mutations reduces heterodimer stability they weaken the interaction of the ECN region and the NTM. Exemplary mutations that reduce heterodimer stability in human Notch1 include L1575P V1577E F1593S L1594P L1597H R1599P I1617T I1617N I1681N A1702P and I1719T. The P12 insertion stems from a direct duplication which is predicted to reposition the endogenous HD C domain away from the site of S2 cleavage and may enhance access of the S2 site to metalloproteases Malecki et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 26 4642 4651 2006 .

Exemplary Notch1 activating mutations that are ligand dependent include mutations in the PEST domain such as insertions or deletions that induce a shift in the reading frame or point mutations that create premature stop codons. Removal of the inhibitory PEST domain is thought to increase the half life of ICN. An exemplary mutation in the PEST domain is DelPEST which is a carboxy terminal deletion beginning at amino acid 2473 of the human Notch1 amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO 57 . Other mutations in the PEST domain are known in the art and are described for example in Weng et al. Science 306 269 271 2004 .

This invention encompasses compositions including pharmaceutical compositions comprising an anti Notch1 NRR antibody and polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding an anti Notch1 NRR antibody. As used herein compositions comprise one or more antibodies that bind to Notch1 NRR and or one or more polynucleotides comprising sequences encoding one or more antibodies that bind to Notch1 NRR. These compositions may further comprise suitable carriers such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including buffers which are well known in the art.

The invention also encompasses isolated antibody and polynucleotide embodiments. The invention also encompasses substantially pure antibody and polynucleotide embodiments.

The anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention are preferably monoclonal. Also encompassed within the scope of the invention are Fab Fab Fab SH and F ab fragments of the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies provided herein. These antibody fragments can be created by traditional means such as enzymatic digestion or may be generated by recombinant techniques. Such antibody fragments may be chimeric or humanized. These fragments are useful for the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes set forth below.

Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies i.e. the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Thus the modifier monoclonal indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.

The anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibodies of the invention can be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. 256 495 1975 or may be made by recombinant DNA methods U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 .

In the hybridoma method a mouse or other appropriate host animal such as a hamster is immunized to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Antibodies to Notch1 NRR generally are raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous sc or intraperitoneal ip injections of Notch1 NRR and an adjuvant. Notch1 NRR may be prepared using methods well known in the art some of which are further described herein. For example recombinant production of human and mouse Notch1 NRR is described below. In one embodiment animals are immunized with a Notch1 NRR fused to the Fc portion of an immunoglobulin heavy chain. In a preferred embodiment animals are immunized with a Notch1 NRR IgG1 fusion protein. Animals ordinarily are immunized against immunogenic conjugates or derivatives of Notch1 NRR with monophosphoryl lipid A MPL trehalose dicrynomycolate TDM Ribi Immunochem. Research Inc. Hamilton Mont. and the solution is injected intradermally at multiple sites. Two weeks later the animals are boosted. 7 to 14 days later animals are bled and the serum is assayed for anti Notch1 NRR titer. Animals are boosted until titer plateaus.

Alternatively lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro. Lymphocytes then are fused with myeloma cells using a suitable fusing agent such as polyethylene glycol to form a hybridoma cell Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 .

The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused parental myeloma cells. For example if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase HGPRT or HPRT the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine aminopterin and thymidine HAT medium which substances prevent the growth of HGPRT deficient cells.

Preferred myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently support stable high level production of antibody by the selected antibody producing cells and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these preferred myeloma cell lines are murine myeloma lines such as those derived from MOPC 21 and MPC 11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center San Diego Calif. USA and SP 2 or X63 Ag8 653 cells available from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville Md. USA. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 .

Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against Notch1 NRR. Preferably the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay such as radioimmunoassay RIA or enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay ELISA .

The binding affinity of the monoclonal antibody can for example be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson et al. 107 220 1980 .

After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity affinity and or activity the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods Goding pp. 59 103 Academic Press 1986 . Suitable culture media for this purpose include for example D MEM or RPMI 1640 medium. In addition the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as ascites tumors in an animal.

The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium ascites fluid or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as for example protein A Sepharose hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis or affinity chromatography.

The anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention can be made by using combinatorial libraries to screen for synthetic antibody clones with the desired activity or activities. In principle synthetic antibody clones are selected by screening phage libraries containing phage that display various fragments of antibody variable region Fv fused to phage coat protein. Such phage libraries are panned by affinity chromatography against the desired antigen. Clones expressing Fv fragments capable of binding to the desired antigen are adsorbed to the antigen and thus separated from the non binding clones in the library. The binding clones are then eluted from the antigen and can be further enriched by additional cycles of antigen adsorption elution. Any of the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention can be obtained by designing a suitable antigen screening procedure to select for the phage clone of interest followed by construction of a full length anti Notch1 NRR antibody clone using the Fv sequences from the phage clone of interest and suitable constant region Fc sequences described in Kabat et al. Fifth Edition NIH Publication 91 3242 Bethesda Md. 1991 vols. 1 3.

The antigen binding domain of an antibody is formed from two variable V regions of about 110 amino acids one each from the light VL and heavy VH chains that both present three hypervariable loops or complementarity determining regions CDRs . Variable domains can be displayed functionally on phage either as single chain Fv scFv fragments in which VH and VL are covalently linked through a short flexible peptide or as Fab fragments in which they are each fused to a constant domain and interact non covalently as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . As used herein scFv encoding phage clones and Fab encoding phage clones are collectively referred to as Fv phage clones or Fv clones .

Repertoires of VH and VL genes can be separately cloned by polymerase chain reaction PCR and recombined randomly in phage libraries which can then be searched for antigen binding clones as described in Winter et al. 12 433 455 1994 . Libraries from immunized sources provide high affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively the naive repertoire can be cloned to provide a single source of human antibodies to a wide range of non self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al. 12 725 734 1993 . Finally naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning the unrearranged V gene segments from stem cells and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro as described by Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Filamentous phage is used to display antibody fragments by fusion to the minor coat protein pIII. The antibody fragments can be displayed as single chain Fv fragments in which VH and VL domains are connected on the same polypeptide chain by a flexible polypeptide spacer e.g. as described by Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or as Fab fragments in which one chain is fused to pIII and the other is secreted into the bacterial host cell periplasm where assembly of a Fab coat protein structure which becomes displayed on the phage surface by displacing some of the wild type coat proteins e.g. as described in Hoogenboom et al. 19 4133 4137 1991 .

In general nucleic acids encoding antibody gene fragments are obtained from immune cells harvested from humans or animals. If a library biased in favor of anti Notch1 NRR clones is desired the individual is immunized with Notch1 NRR to generate an antibody response and spleen cells and or circulating B cells other peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are recovered for library construction. In a preferred embodiment a human antibody gene fragment library biased in favor of anti Notch1 NRR clones is obtained by generating an anti Notch1 NRR antibody response in transgenic mice carrying a functional human immunoglobulin gene array and lacking a functional endogenous antibody production system such that Notch1 NRR immunization gives rise to B cells producing human antibodies against Notch1 NRR. The generation of human antibody producing transgenic mice is described below.

Additional enrichment for anti Notch1 NRR reactive cell populations can be obtained by using a suitable screening procedure to isolate B cells expressing Notch1 NRR specific membrane bound antibody e.g. by cell separation with Notch1 NRR affinity chromatography or adsorption of cells to fluorochrome labeled Notch1 NRR followed by flow activated cell sorting FACS .

Alternatively the use of spleen cells and or B cells or other PBLs from an unimmunized donor provides a better representation of the possible antibody repertoire and also permits the construction of an antibody library using any animal human or non human species in which Notch1 NRR is not antigenic. For libraries incorporating in vitro antibody gene construction stem cells are harvested from the individual to provide nucleic acids encoding unrearranged antibody gene segments. The immune cells of interest can be obtained from a variety of animal species such as human mouse rat lagomorpha luprine canine feline porcine bovine equine and avian species etc.

Nucleic acid encoding antibody variable gene segments including VH and VL segments are recovered from the cells of interest and amplified. In the case of rearranged VH and VL gene libraries the desired DNA can be obtained by isolating genomic DNA or mRNA from lymphocytes followed by polymerase chain reaction PCR with primers matching the 5 and 3 ends of rearranged VH and VL genes as described in Orlandi et al. . 86 3833 3837 1989 thereby making diverse V gene repertoires for expression. The V genes can be amplified from cDNA and genomic DNA with back primers at the 5 end of the exon encoding the mature V domain and forward primers based within the J segment as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 and in Ward et al. 341 544 546 1989 . However for amplifying from cDNA back primers can also be based in the leader exon as described in Jones et al. 9 88 89 1991 and forward primers within the constant region as described in Sastry et al. . 86 5728 5732 1989 . To maximize complementarity degeneracy can be incorporated in the primers as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or Sastry et al. 1989 . Preferably the library diversity is maximized by using PCR primers targeted to each V gene family in order to amplify all available VH and VL arrangements present in the immune cell nucleic acid sample e.g. as described in the method of Marks et al. . 222 581 597 1991 or as described in the method of Orum et al. . 21 4491 4498 1993 . For cloning of the amplified DNA into expression vectors rare restriction sites can be introduced within the PCR primer as a tag at one end as described in Orlandi et al. 1989 or by further PCR amplification with a tagged primer as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 .

Repertoires of synthetically rearranged V genes can be derived in vitro from V gene segments. Most of the human VH gene segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Tomlinson et al. 227 776 798 1992 and mapped reported in Matsuda et al. 3 88 94 1993 these cloned segments including all the major conformations of the H1 and H2 loop can be used to generate diverse VH gene repertoires with PCR primers encoding H3 loops of diverse sequence and length as described in Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 . VH repertoires can also be made with all the sequence diversity focused in a long H3 loop of a single length as described in Barbas et al. 89 4457 4461 1992 . Human V and V segments have been cloned and sequenced reported in Williams and Winter 23 1456 1461 1993 and can be used to make synthetic light chain repertoires. Synthetic V gene repertoires based on a range of VH and VL folds and L3 and H3 lengths will encode antibodies of considerable structural diversity. Following amplification of V gene encoding DNAs germline V gene segments can be rearranged in vitro according to the methods of Hoogenboom and Winter 227 381 388 1992 .

Repertoires of antibody fragments can be constructed by combining VH and VL gene repertoires together in several ways. Each repertoire can be created in different vectors and the vectors recombined in vitro e.g. as described in Hogrefe et al. 128 119 126 1993 or in vivo by combinatorial infection e.g. the loxP system described in Waterhouse et al. 21 2265 2266 1993 . The in vivo recombination approach exploits the two chain nature of Fab fragments to overcome the limit on library size imposed by transformation efficiency. Naive VH and VL repertoires are cloned separately one into a phagemid and the other into a phage vector. The two libraries are then combined by phage infection of phagemid containing bacteria so that each cell contains a different combination and the library size is limited only by the number of cells present about 10clones . Both vectors contain in vivo recombination signals so that the VH and VL genes are recombined onto a single replicon and are co packaged into phage virions. These huge libraries provide large numbers of diverse antibodies of good affinity Kof about 10M .

Alternatively the repertoires may be cloned sequentially into the same vector e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or assembled together by PCR and then cloned e.g. as described in Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . PCR assembly can also be used to join VH and VL DNAs with DNA encoding a flexible peptide spacer to form single chain Fv scFv repertoires. In yet another technique in cell PCR assembly is used to combine VH and VL genes within lymphocytes by PCR and then clone repertoires of linked genes as described in Embleton et al. 20 3831 3837 1992 .

The antibodies produced by naive libraries either natural or synthetic can be of moderate affinity Kof about 10to 10M but affinity maturation can also be mimicked in vitro by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries as described in Winter et al. 1994 supra. For example mutations can be introduced at random in vitro by using error prone polymerase reported in Leung et al. 1 11 15 1989 in the method of Hawkins et al. 226 889 896 1992 or in the method of Gram et al. 89 3576 3580 1992 . Additionally affinity maturation can be performed by randomly mutating one or more CDRs e.g. using PCR with primers carrying random sequence spanning the CDR of interest in selected individual Fv clones and screening for higher affinity clones. WO 96 07754 published Mar. 14 1996 described a method for inducing mutagenesis in a complementarity determining region of an immunoglobulin light chain to create a library of light chain genes. Another effective approach is to recombine the VH or VL domains selected by phage display with repertoires of naturally occurring V domain variants obtained from unimmunized donors and screen for higher affinity in several rounds of chain reshuffling as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 . This technique allows the production of antibodies and antibody fragments with affinities in the 10M range.

Notch1 NRR nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are known in the art. Nucleic acid sequence encoding the Notch1 NRR can be designed using the amino acid sequence of the desired region of Notch1 NRR. The sequences may include the sequence of SEQ ID NOS 55 13 or 14. Alternatively the cDNA sequence or fragments thereof of GenBank Accession No. NM 017617 can be used. Nucleic acids encoding Notch1 NRR can be prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to chemical synthesis by any of the methods described in Engels et al. 28 716 734 1989 such as the triester phosphite phosphoramidite and H phosphonate methods. In one embodiment codons preferred by the expression host cell are used in the design of the Notch1 NRR encoding DNA. Alternatively DNA encoding the Notch1 NRR can be isolated from a genomic or cDNA library.

Following construction of the DNA molecule encoding the Notch1 NRR the DNA molecule is operably linked to an expression control sequence in an expression vector such as a plasmid wherein the control sequence is recognized by a host cell transformed with the vector. In general plasmid vectors contain replication and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as sequences which encode proteins that are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. Suitable vectors for expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic host cells are known in the art and some are further described herein. Eukaryotic organisms such as yeasts or cells derived from multicellular organisms such as mammals may be used.

Optionally the DNA encoding the Notch1 NRR is operably linked to a secretory leader sequence resulting in secretion of the expression product by the host cell into the culture medium. Examples of secretory leader sequences include stII ecotin lamB herpes GD lpp alkaline phosphatase invertase and alpha factor. Also suitable for use herein is the 36 amino acid leader sequence of protein A Abrahmsen et al. 4 3901 1985 .

Host cells are transfected and preferably transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors of this invention and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transfection refers to the taking up of an expression vector by a host cell whether or not any coding sequences are in fact expressed. Numerous methods of transfection are known to the ordinarily skilled artisan for example CaPOprecipitation and electroporation. Successful transfection is generally recognized when any indication of the operation of this vector occurs within the host cell. Methods for transfection are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Transformation means introducing DNA into an organism so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. Methods for transformation are well known in the art and some are further described herein.

Prokaryotic host cells used to produce the Notch1 NRR can be cultured as described generally in Sambrook et al. supra.

The mammalian host cells used to produce the Notch1 NRR can be cultured in a variety of media which is well known in the art and some of which is described herein.

The host cells referred to in this disclosure encompass cells in in vitro culture as well as cells that are within a host animal.

Purification of Notch1 NRR may be accomplished using art recognized methods some of which are described herein.

The purified Notch1 NRR can be attached to a suitable matrix such as agarose beads acrylamide beads glass beads cellulose various acrylic copolymers hydroxyl methacrylate gels polyacrylic and polymethacrylic copolymers nylon neutral and ionic carriers and the like for use in the affinity chromatographic separation of phage display clones. Attachment of the Notch1 NRR protein to the matrix can be accomplished by the methods described in 44 1976 . A commonly employed technique for attaching protein ligands to polysaccharide matrices e.g. agarose dextran or cellulose involves activation of the carrier with cyanogen halides and subsequent coupling of the peptide ligand s primary aliphatic or aromatic amines to the activated matrix.

Alternatively Notch1 NRR can be used to coat the wells of adsorption plates expressed on host cells affixed to adsorption plates or used in cell sorting or conjugated to biotin for capture with streptavidin coated beads or used in any other art known method for panning phage display libraries.

The phage library samples are contacted with immobilized Notch1 NRR under conditions suitable for binding of at least a portion of the phage particles with the adsorbent. Normally the conditions including pH ionic strength temperature and the like are selected to mimic physiological conditions. The phages bound to the solid phase are washed and then eluted by acid e.g. as described in Barbas et al. 88 7978 7982 1991 or by alkali e.g. as described in Marks et al. 222 581 597 1991 or by Notch1 NRR antigen competition e.g. in a procedure similar to the antigen competition method of Clackson et al. 352 624 628 1991 . Phages can be enriched 20 1 000 fold in a single round of selection. Moreover the enriched phages can be grown in bacterial culture and subjected to further rounds of selection.

The efficiency of selection depends on many factors including the kinetics of dissociation during washing and whether multiple antibody fragments on a single phage can simultaneously engage with antigen. Antibodies with fast dissociation kinetics and weak binding affinities can be retained by use of short washes multivalent phage display and high coating density of antigen in solid phase. The high density not only stabilizes the phage through multivalent interactions but favors rebinding of phage that has dissociated. The selection of antibodies with slow dissociation kinetics and good binding affinities can be promoted by use of long washes and monovalent phage display as described in Bass et al. 8 309 314 1990 and in WO 92 09690 and a low coating density of antigen as described in Marks et al. 10 779 783 1992 .

It is possible to select between phage antibodies of different affinities even with affinities that differ slightly for Notch1 NRR. However random mutation of a selected antibody e.g. as performed in some of the affinity maturation techniques described above is likely to give rise to many mutants most binding to antigen and a few with higher affinity. With limiting Notch1 NRR rare high affinity phage could be competed out. To retain all the higher affinity mutants phages can be incubated with excess biotinylated Notch1 NRR but with the biotinylated Notch1 NRR at a concentration of lower molarity than the target molar affinity constant for Notch1 NRR. The high affinity binding phages can then be captured by streptavidin coated paramagnetic beads. Such equilibrium capture allows the antibodies to be selected according to their affinities of binding with sensitivity that permits isolation of mutant clones with as little as two fold higher affinity from a great excess of phages with lower affinity. Conditions used in washing phages bound to a solid phase can also be manipulated to discriminate on the basis of dissociation kinetics.

Anti Notch1 NRR clones may be activity selected. In one embodiment the invention provides anti Notch1 NRR antibodies that block the binding between a Notch1 receptor and its ligand such as Jagged1 Jagged2 Delta like1 Delta like3 and Delta like4 or proteolytic cleavage of Notch1 induced upon ligand binding. Fv clones corresponding to such anti Notch1 NRR antibodies can be selected by 1 isolating anti Notch1 NRR clones from a phage library as described above and optionally amplifying the isolated population of phage clones by growing up the population in a suitable bacterial host 2 selecting Notch1 NRR and a second protein against which blocking and non blocking activity respectively is desired 3 adsorbing the anti Notch1 NRR phage clones to immobilized Notch1 NRR 4 using an excess of the second protein to elute any undesired clones that recognize Notch1 NRR binding determinants which overlap or are shared with the binding determinants of the second protein and 5 eluting the clones which remain adsorbed following step 4 . Optionally clones with the desired blocking non blocking properties can be further enriched by repeating the selection procedures described herein one or more times.

DNA encoding the hybridoma derived monoclonal antibodies or phage display Fv clones of the invention is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide primers designed to specifically amplify the heavy and light chain coding regions of interest from hybridoma or phage DNA template . Once isolated the DNA can be placed into expression vectors which are then transfected into host cells such as cells simian COS cells Chinese hamster ovary CHO cells or myeloma cells that do not otherwise produce immunoglobulin protein to obtain the synthesis of the desired monoclonal antibodies in the recombinant host cells. Review articles on recombinant expression in bacteria of antibody encoding DNA include Skerra et al. 5 256 1993 and Pluckthun 130 151 1992 .

DNA encoding the Fv clones of the invention can be combined with known DNA sequences encoding heavy chain and or light chain constant regions e.g. the appropriate DNA sequences can be obtained from Kabat et al. supra to form clones encoding full or partial length heavy and or light chains. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species. A Fv clone derived from the variable domain DNA of one animal such as human species and then fused to constant region DNA of another animal species to form coding sequence s for hybrid full length heavy chain and or light chain is included in the definition of chimeric and hybrid antibody as used herein. In a preferred embodiment a Fv clone derived from human variable DNA is fused to human constant region DNA to form coding sequence s for all human full or partial length heavy and or light chains.

DNA encoding anti Notch1 NRR antibody derived from a hybridoma of the invention can also be modified for example by substituting the coding sequence for human heavy and light chain constant domains in place of homologous murine sequences derived from the hybridoma clone e.g. as in the method of Morrison et al. 81 6851 6855 1984 . DNA encoding a hybridoma or Fv clone derived antibody or fragment can be further modified by covalently joining to the immunoglobulin coding sequence all or part of the coding sequence for a non immunoglobulin polypeptide. In this manner chimeric or hybrid antibodies are prepared that have the binding specificity of the Fv clone or hybridoma clone derived antibodies of the invention.

The present invention encompasses antibody fragments. In certain circumstances there are advantages of using antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies. The smaller size of the fragments allows for rapid clearance and may lead to improved access to solid tumors.

Various techniques have been developed for the production of antibody fragments. Traditionally these fragments were derived via proteolytic digestion of intact antibodies see e.g. Morimoto et al. Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods 24 107 117 1992 and Brennan et al. Science 229 81 1985 . However these fragments can now be produced directly by recombinant host cells. Fab Fv and ScFv antibody fragments can all be expressed in and secreted from thus allowing the facile production of large amounts of these fragments. Antibody fragments can be isolated from the antibody phage libraries discussed above. Alternatively Fab SH fragments can be directly recovered from and chemically coupled to form F ab fragments Carter et al. Bio Technology 10 163 167 1992 . According to another approach F ab fragments can be isolated directly from recombinant host cell culture. Fab and F ab fragment with increased in vivo half life comprising a salvage receptor binding epitope residues are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 869 046. Other techniques for the production of antibody fragments will be apparent to the skilled practitioner. In other embodiments the antibody of choice is a single chain Fv fragment scFv see e.g. WO 93 16185 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 571 894 and 5 587 458 . Fv and sFv are the only species with intact combining sites that are devoid of constant regions thus they are suitable for reduced nonspecific binding during in vivo use. sFv fusion proteins may be constructed to yield fusion of an effector protein at either the amino or the carboxy terminus of an sFv. See Antibody Engineering ed. Borrebaeck supra. The antibody fragment may also be a linear antibody e.g. as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 870. Such linear antibody fragments may be monospecific or bispecific.

The present invention encompasses humanized antibodies. Various methods for humanizing non human antibodies are known in the art. For example a humanized antibody can have one or more amino acid residues introduced into it from a source which is non human. These non human amino acid residues are often referred to as import residues which are typically taken from an import variable domain. Humanization can be essentially performed following the method of Winter and co workers Jones et al. 1986 321 522 525 Riechmann et al. 1988 332 323 327 Verhoeyen et al. 1988 239 1534 1536 by substituting hypervariable region sequences for the corresponding sequences of a human antibody. Accordingly such humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 816 567 wherein substantially less than an intact human variable domain has been substituted by the corresponding sequence from a non human species. In practice humanized antibodies are typically human antibodies in which some hypervariable region residues and possibly some FR residues are substituted by residues from analogous sites in rodent antibodies.

The choice of human variable domains both light and heavy to be used in making the humanized antibodies is very important to reduce antigenicity. According to the so called best fit method the sequence of the variable domain of a rodent antibody is screened against the entire library of known human variable domain sequences. The human sequence which is closest to that of the rodent is then accepted as the human framework for the humanized antibody Sims et al. 1993 151 2296 Chothia et al. 1987 196 901. Another method uses a particular framework derived from the consensus sequence of all human antibodies of a particular subgroup of light or heavy chains. The same framework may be used for several different humanized antibodies Carter et al. 1992 89 4285 Presta et al. 1993 151 2623.

It is further important that antibodies be humanized with retention of high affinity for the antigen and other favorable biological properties. To achieve this goal according to one method humanized antibodies are prepared by a process of analysis of the parental sequences and various conceptual humanized products using three dimensional models of the parental and humanized sequences. Three dimensional immunoglobulin models are commonly available and are familiar to those skilled in the art. Computer programs are available which illustrate and display probable three dimensional conformational structures of selected candidate immunoglobulin sequences. Inspection of these displays permits analysis of the likely role of the residues in the functioning of the candidate immunoglobulin sequence i.e. the analysis of residues that influence the ability of the candidate immunoglobulin to bind its antigen. In this way FR residues can be selected and combined from the recipient and import sequences so that the desired antibody characteristic such as increased affinity for the target antigen s is achieved. In general the hypervariable region residues are directly and most substantially involved in influencing antigen binding.

Human anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention can be constructed by combining Fv clone variable domain sequence s selected from human derived phage display libraries with known human constant domain sequences s as described above. Alternatively human monoclonal anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention can be made by the hybridoma method. Human myeloma and mouse human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described for example by Kozbor 133 3001 1984 Brodeur et al. pp. 51 63 Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1987 and Boerner et al. 147 86 1991 .

It is now possible to produce transgenic animals e.g. mice that are capable upon immunization of producing a full repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of endogenous immunoglobulin production. For example it has been described that the homozygous deletion of the antibody heavy chain joining region JH gene in chimeric and germ line mutant mice results in complete inhibition of endogenous antibody production. Transfer of the human germ line immunoglobulin gene array in such germ line mutant mice will result in the production of human antibodies upon antigen challenge. See e.g. Jakobovits et al. 90 2551 1993 Jakobovits et al. 362 255 1993 Bruggermann et al. 7 33 1993 .

Gene shuffling can also be used to derive human antibodies from non human e.g. rodent antibodies where the human antibody has similar affinities and specificities to the starting non human antibody. According to this method which is also called epitope imprinting either the heavy or light chain variable region of a non human antibody fragment obtained by phage display techniques as described above is replaced with a repertoire of human V domain genes creating a population of non human chain human chain scFv or Fab chimeras. Selection with antigen results in isolation of a non human chain human chain chimeric scFv or Fab wherein the human chain restores the antigen binding site destroyed upon removal of the corresponding non human chain in the primary phage display clone i.e. the epitope governs imprints the choice of the human chain partner. When the process is repeated in order to replace the remaining non human chain a human antibody is obtained see PCT WO 93 06213 published Apr. 1 1993 . Unlike traditional humanization of non human antibodies by CDR grafting this technique provides completely human antibodies which have no FR or CDR residues of non human origin.

Bispecific antibodies are monoclonal preferably human or humanized antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different antigens. In the present case one of the binding specificities is for Notch1 NRR and the other is for any other antigen. Exemplary bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of the Notch1 NRR. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express Notch1 NRR. These antibodies possess an Notch1 NRR binding arm and an arm which binds the cytotoxic agent e.g. saporin anti interferon vinca alkaloid ricin A chain methotrexate or radioactive isotope hapten . Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments e.g. F ab bispecific antibodies .

Methods for making bispecific antibodies are known in the art. Traditionally the recombinant production of bispecific antibodies is based on the co expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pairs where the two heavy chains have different specificities Milstein and Cuello 305 537 1983 . Because of the random assortment of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains these hybridomas quadromas produce a potential mixture of 10 different antibody molecules of which only one has the correct bispecific structure. The purification of the correct molecule which is usually done by affinity chromatography steps is rather cumbersome and the product yields are low. Similar procedures are disclosed in WO 93 08829 published May 13 1993 and in Traunecker et al. 10 3655 1991 .

According to a different and more preferred approach antibody variable domains with the desired binding specificities antibody antigen combining sites are fused to immunoglobulin constant domain sequences. The fusion preferably is with an immunoglobulin heavy chain constant domain comprising at least part of the hinge CH2 and CH3 regions. It is preferred to have the first heavy chain constant region CH1 containing the site necessary for light chain binding present in at least one of the fusions. DNAs encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain fusions and if desired the immunoglobulin light chain are inserted into separate expression vectors and are co transfected into a suitable host organism. This provides for great flexibility in adjusting the mutual proportions of the three polypeptide fragments in embodiments when unequal ratios of the three polypeptide chains used in the construction provide the optimum yields. It is however possible to insert the coding sequences for two or all three polypeptide chains in one expression vector when the expression of at least two polypeptide chains in equal ratios results in high yields or when the ratios are of no particular significance.

In a preferred embodiment of this approach the bispecific antibodies are composed of a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain with a first binding specificity in one arm and a hybrid immunoglobulin heavy chain light chain pair providing a second binding specificity in the other arm. It was found that this asymmetric structure facilitates the separation of the desired bispecific compound from unwanted immunoglobulin chain combinations as the presence of an immunoglobulin light chain in only one half of the bispecific molecule provides for a facile way of separation. This approach is disclosed in WO 94 04690. For further details of generating bispecific antibodies see for example Suresh et al. 121 210 1986 .

According to another approach the interface between a pair of antibody molecules can be engineered to maximize the percentage of heterodimers which are recovered from recombinant cell culture. The preferred interface comprises at least a part of the C3 domain of an antibody constant domain. In this method one or more small amino acid side chains from the interface of the first antibody molecule are replaced with larger side chains e.g. tyrosine or tryptophan . Compensatory cavities of identical or similar size to the large side chain s are created on the interface of the second antibody molecule by replacing large amino acid side chains with smaller ones e.g. alanine or threonine . This provides a mechanism for increasing the yield of the heterodimer over other unwanted end products such as homodimers.

Bispecific antibodies include cross linked or heteroconjugate antibodies. For example one of the antibodies in the heteroconjugate can be coupled to avidin the other to biotin. Such antibodies have for example been proposed to target immune system cells to unwanted cells U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 and for treatment of HIV infection WO 91 00360 WO 92 00373 and EP 03089 . Heteroconjugate antibodies may be made using any convenient cross linking methods. Suitable cross linking agents are well known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 676 980 along with a number of cross linking techniques.

Techniques for generating bispecific antibodies from antibody fragments have also been described in the literature. For example bispecific antibodies can be prepared using chemical linkage. Brennan et al. 229 81 1985 describe a procedure wherein intact antibodies are proteolytically cleaved to generate F ab fragments. These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide formation. The Fab fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate TNB derivatives. One of the Fab TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the Fab thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is mixed with an equimolar amount of the other Fab TNB derivative to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibodies produced can be used as agents for the selective immobilization of enzymes.

Recent progress has facilitated the direct recovery of Fab SH fragments from which can be chemically coupled to form bispecific antibodies. Shalaby et al. 175 217 225 1992 describe the production of a fully humanized bispecific antibody F ab molecule. Each Fab fragment was separately secreted from and subjected to directed chemical coupling in vitro to form the bispecific antibody. The bispecific antibody thus formed was able to bind to cells overexpressing the HER2 receptor and normal human T cells as well as trigger the lytic activity of human cytotoxic lymphocytes against human breast tumor targets.

Various techniques for making and isolating bispecific antibody fragments directly from recombinant cell culture have also been described. For example bispecific antibodies have been produced using leucine zippers. Kostelny et al. 148 5 1547 1553 1992 . The leucine zipper peptides from the Fos and Jun proteins were linked to the Fab portions of two different antibodies by gene fusion. The antibody homodimers were reduced at the hinge region to form monomers and then re oxidized to form the antibody heterodimers. This method can also be utilized for the production of antibody homodimers. The diabody technology described by Hollinger et al. 90 6444 6448 1993 has provided an alternative mechanism for making bispecific antibody fragments. The fragments comprise a heavy chain variable domain VH connected to a light chain variable domain VL by a linker which is too short to allow pairing between the two domains on the same chain. Accordingly the VH and VL domains of one fragment are forced to pair with the complementary VL and VH domains of another fragment thereby forming two antigen binding sites. Another strategy for making bispecific antibody fragments by the use of single chain Fv sFv dimers has also been reported. See Gruber et al. 152 5368 1994 .

Antibodies with more than two valencies are contemplated. For example trispecific antibodies can be prepared. Tutt et al. 147 60 1991 .

A multivalent antibody may be internalized and or catabolized faster than a bivalent antibody by a cell expressing an antigen to which the antibodies bind. The antibodies of the present invention can be multivalent antibodies which are other than of the IgM class with three or more antigen binding sites e.g. tetravalent antibodies which can be readily produced by recombinant expression of nucleic acid encoding the polypeptide chains of the antibody. The multivalent antibody can comprise a dimerization domain and three or more antigen binding sites. The preferred dimerization domain comprises or consists of an Fc region or a hinge region. In this scenario the antibody will comprise an Fc region and three or more antigen binding sites amino terminal to the Fe region. The preferred multivalent antibody herein comprises or consists of three to about eight but preferably four antigen binding sites. The multivalent antibody comprises at least one polypeptide chain and preferably two polypeptide chains wherein the polypeptide chain s comprise two or more variable domains. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VD1 X1 n VD2 X2 n Fc wherein VD1 is a first variable domain VD2 is a second variable domain Fc is one polypeptide chain of an Fc region X1 and X2 represent an amino acid or polypeptide and n is 0 or 1. For instance the polypeptide chain s may comprise VH CH1 flexible linker VH CH1 Fc region chain or VH CH1 VH CH1 Fc region chain. The multivalent antibody herein preferably further comprises at least two and preferably four light chain variable domain polypeptides. The multivalent antibody herein may for instance comprise from about two to about eight light chain variable domain polypeptides. The light chain variable domain polypeptides contemplated here comprise a light chain variable domain and optionally further comprise a CL domain.

In some embodiments amino acid sequence modification s of the antibodies described herein are contemplated. For example it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by introducing appropriate nucleotide changes into the antibody nucleic acid or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include for example deletions from and or insertions into and or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion insertion and substitution is made to arrive at the final construct provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics. The amino acid alterations may be introduced in the subject antibody amino acid sequence at the time that sequence is made.

A useful method for identification of certain residues or regions of the antibody that are preferred locations for mutagenesis is called alanine scanning mutagenesis as described by Cunningham and Wells 1989 244 1081 1085. Here a residue or group of target residues are identified e.g. charged residues such as arg asp his lys and glu and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid most preferably alanine or polyalanine to affect the interaction of the amino acids with antigen. Those amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the substitutions then are refined by introducing further or other variants at or for the sites of substitution. Thus while the site for introducing an amino acid sequence variation is predetermined the nature of the mutation per se need not be predetermined. For example to analyze the performance of a mutation at a given site ala scanning or random mutagenesis is conducted at the target codon or region and the expressed immunoglobulins are screened for the desired activity.

Amino acid sequence insertions include amino and or carboxyl terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N terminal methionyl residue or the antibody fused to a cytotoxic polypeptide. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion to the N or C terminus of the antibody to an enzyme e.g. for ADEPT or a polypeptide which increases the serum half life of the antibody.

Glycosylation of polypeptides is typically either N linked or O linked. N linked refers to the attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the side chain of an asparagine residue. The tripeptide sequences asparagine X serine and asparagine X threonine where X is any amino acid except proline are the recognition sequences for enzymatic attachment of the carbohydrate moiety to the asparagine side chain. Thus the presence of either of these tripeptide sequences in a polypeptide creates a potential glycosylation site. O linked glycosylation refers to the attachment of one of the sugars N aceylgalactosamine galactose or xylose to a hydroxyamino acid most commonly serine or threonine although 5 hydroxyproline or 5 hydroxylysine may also be used.

Addition of glycosylation sites to the antibody is conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that it contains one or more of the above described tripeptide sequences for N linked glycosylation sites . The alteration may also be made by the addition of or substitution by one or more serine or threonine residues to the sequence of the original antibody for O linked glycosylation sites .

Where the antibody comprises an Fc region the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. For example antibodies with a mature carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached to an Fc region of the antibody are described in US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 Presta L. . See also US 2004 0093621 Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd. . Antibodies with a bisecting N acetylglucosamine GlcNAc in the carbohydrate attached to an Fc region of the antibody are referenced in WO 2003 011878 Jean Mairet et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6 602 684 Umana et al. Antibodies with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to an Fc region of the antibody are reported in WO 1997 30087 Patel et al. See also WO 1998 58964 Raju S. and WO 1999 22764 Raju S. concerning antibodies with altered carbohydrate attached to the Fc region thereof. See also US 2005 0123546 Umana et al. on antigen binding molecules with modified glycosylation.

The preferred glycosylation variant herein comprises an Fc region wherein a carbohydrate structure attached to the Fc region lacks fucose. Such variants have improved ADCC function. Optionally the Fc region further comprises one or more amino acid substitutions therein which further improve ADCC for example substitutions at positions 298 333 and or 334 of the Fc region Eu numbering of residues . Examples of publications related to defucosylated or fucose deficient antibodies include US 2003 0157108 WO 2000 61739 WO 2001 29246 US 2003 0115614 US 2002 0164328 US 2004 0093621 US 2004 0132140 US 2004 0110704 US 2004 0110282 US 2004 0109865 WO 2003 085119 WO 2003 084570 WO 2005 035586 WO 2005 035778 WO2005 053742 Okazaki et al. 336 1239 1249 2004 Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 . Examples of cell lines producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation Ripka et al. 249 533 545 1986 US Pat Appl No US 2003 0157108 A1 Presta L and WO 2004 056312 A1 Adams et al. especially at Example 11 and knockout cell lines such as alpha 1 6 fucosyltransferase gene FUT8 knockout CHO cells Yamane Ohnuki et al. 87 614 2004 .

Another type of variant is an amino acid substitution variant. These variants have at least one amino acid residue in the antibody molecule replaced by a different residue. The sites of greatest interest for substitutional mutagenesis include the hypervariable regions but FR alterations are also contemplated. Conservative substitutions are shown in Table 1 under the heading of preferred substitutions. If such substitutions result in a change in biological activity then more substantial changes denominated exemplary substitutions in Table 1 or as further described below in reference to amino acid classes may be introduced and the products screened.

Substantial modifications in the biological properties of the antibody are accomplished by selecting substitutions that differ significantly in their effect on maintaining a the structure of the polypeptide backbone in the area of the substitution for example as a sheet or helical conformation b the charge or hydrophobicity of the molecule at the target site or c the bulk of the side chain. Naturally occurring residues are divided into groups based on common side chain properties 

Non conservative substitutions will entail exchanging a member of one of these classes for another class.

One type of substitutional variant involves substituting one or more hypervariable region residues of a parent antibody e.g. a humanized or human antibody . Generally the resulting variant s selected for further development will have improved biological properties relative to the parent antibody from which they are generated. A convenient way for generating such substitutional variants involves affinity maturation using phage display. Briefly several hypervariable region sites e.g. 6 7 sites are mutated to generate all possible amino acid substitutions at each site. The antibodies thus generated are displayed from filamentous phage particles as fusions to the gene III product of M13 packaged within each particle. The phage displayed variants are then screened for their biological activity e.g. binding affinity as herein disclosed. In order to identify candidate hypervariable region sites for modification alanine scanning mutagenesis can be performed to identify hypervariable region residues contributing significantly to antigen binding. Alternatively or additionally it may be beneficial to analyze a crystal structure of the antigen antibody complex to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues are candidates for substitution according to the techniques elaborated herein. Once such variants are generated the panel of variants is subjected to screening as described herein and antibodies with superior properties in one or more relevant assays may be selected for further development.

Nucleic acid molecules encoding amino acid sequence variants of the antibody are prepared by a variety of methods known in the art. These methods include but are not limited to isolation from a natural source in the case of naturally occurring amino acid sequence variants or preparation by oligonucleotide mediated or site directed mutagenesis PCR mutagenesis and cassette mutagenesis of an earlier prepared variant or a non variant version of the antibody.

It may be desirable to introduce one or more amino acid modifications in an Fc region of the immunoglobulin polypeptides of the invention thereby generating a Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence e.g. a human IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region comprising an amino acid modification e.g. a substitution at one or more amino acid positions including that of a hinge cysteine.

In accordance with this description and the teachings of the art it is contemplated that in some embodiments an antibody used in methods of the invention may comprise one or more alterations as compared to the wild type counterpart antibody e.g. in the Fc region. These antibodies would nonetheless retain substantially the same characteristics required for therapeutic utility as compared to their wild type counterpart. For example it is thought that certain alterations can be made in the Fc region that would result in altered i.e. either improved or diminished C1q binding and or Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity CDC e.g. as described in WO99 51642. See also Duncan Winter 322 738 40 1988 U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 260 U.S. Pat. No. 5 624 821 and WO94 29351 concerning other examples of Fc region variants. WO00 42072 Presta and WO 2004 056312 Lowman describe antibody variants with improved or diminished binding to FcRs. The content of these patent publications are specifically incorporated herein by reference. See also Shields et al. 9 2 6591 6604 2001 . Antibodies with increased half lives and improved binding to the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn which is responsible for the transfer of maternal IgGs to the fetus Guyer et al. J. Immunol. 117 587 1976 and Kim et al. J. Immunol. 24 249 1994 are described in US2005 0014934A1 Hinton et al. . These antibodies comprise an Fc region with one or more substitutions therein which improve binding of the Fc region to FcRn. Polypeptide variants with altered Fc region amino acid sequences and increased or decreased C1q binding capability are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 194 551B1 WO99 51642.

The antibodies of the present invention can be further modified to contain additional nonproteinaceous moieties that are known in the art and readily available. Preferably the moieties suitable for derivatization of the antibody are water soluble polymers. Non limiting examples of water soluble polymers include but are not limited to polyethylene glycol PEG copolymers of ethylene glycol propylene glycol carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol polyvinyl pyrrolidone poly 1 3 dioxolane poly 1 3 6 trioxane ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer polyaminoacids either homopolymers or random copolymers and dextran or poly n vinyl pyrrolidone polyethylene glycol propropylene glycol homopolymers prolypropylene oxide ethylene oxide co polymers polyoxyethylated polyols e.g. glycerol polyvinyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde may have advantages in manufacturing due to its stability in water. The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. The number of polymers attached to the antibody may vary and if more than one polymers are attached they can be the same or different molecules. In general the number and or type of polymers used for derivatization can be determined based on considerations including but not limited to the particular properties or functions of the antibody to be improved whether the antibody derivative will be used in a therapy under defined conditions etc.

The antibodies of the present invention can be characterized for their physical chemical properties and biological functions by various assays known in the art. In some embodiments antibodies are characterized for any one or more of reduction or blocking of Notch1 activation reduction or blocking of Notch1 downstream molecular signaling disruption or blocking of Notch1 binding to a ligand e.g. Jagged1 Jagged2 Delta like1 Delta like3 or Delta like4 and or treatment and or prevention of a tumor cell proliferative disorder or a cancer and or treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with Notch1 expression and or activity such as increased Notch1 expression and or activity . In other embodiments the antibodies are characterized for any one or more of inducing or increasing Notch1 activation inducing or increasing Notch1 downstream molecular signaling and or treatment or prevention of a disorder associated with Notch1 expression and or activity.

The purified antibodies can be further characterized by a series of assays including but not limited to N terminal sequencing amino acid analysis non denaturing size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC mass spectrometry ion exchange chromatography and papain digestion.

In certain embodiments of the invention the antibodies produced herein are analyzed for their biological activity. In some embodiments the antibodies of the present invention are tested for their antigen binding activity. The antigen binding assays that are known in the art and can be used herein include without limitation any direct or competitive binding assays using techniques such as western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays fluorescent immunoassays and protein A immunoassays. Illustrative antigen binding assay are provided below in the Examples section.

In still another embodiment the invention provides anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibodies that compete with Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and or Antibody A 3 for binding to Notch1 NRR. Such competitor antibodies include antibodies that recognize a Notch1 NRR epitope that is the same as or overlaps with the Notch1 NRR epitope recognized by Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and or Antibody A 3. Such competitor antibodies can be obtained by screening anti Notch1 NRR hybridoma supernatants for binding to immobilized Notch1 NRR in competition with labeled Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and or Antibody A 3. A hybridoma supernatant containing competitor antibody will reduce the amount of bound labeled antibody detected in the subject competition binding mixture as compared to the amount of bound labeled antibody detected in a control binding mixture containing irrelevant or no antibody. Any of the competition binding assays described herein are suitable for use in the foregoing procedure.

In another aspect the invention provides an anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibody that comprises one or more such as 2 3 4 5 and or 6 HVRs of Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 or Antibody A 3. An anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibody that comprises one or more HVR s of Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and or Antibody A 3 can be constructed by grafting one or more HVR s of Antibody A Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and or Antibody A 3 onto a template antibody sequence e.g. a human antibody sequence which is closest to the corresponding murine sequence of the parental antibody or a consensus sequence of all human antibodies in the particular subgroup of the parental antibody light or heavy chain and expressing the resulting chimeric light and or heavy chain variable region sequence s with or without accompanying constant region sequence s in recombinant host cells as described herein.

Anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention possessing the unique properties described herein can be obtained by screening anti Notch1 NRR hybridoma clones for the desired properties by any convenient method. For example if an anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibody that blocks or does not block the binding of Notch1 ligand to Notch1 is desired the candidate antibody can be tested in a binding competition assay such as a competitive binding ELISA wherein plate wells are coated with Notch1 and a solution of antibody in an excess of Notch1 is layered onto the coated plates and bound antibody is detected enzymatically e.g. contacting the bound antibody with HRP conjugated anti Ig antibody or biotinylated anti Ig antibody and developing the HRP color reaction e.g. by developing plates with streptavidin HRP and or hydrogen peroxide and detecting the HRP color reaction by spectrophotometry at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader.

If an anti Notch1 NRR antibody that inhibits cell growth is desired the candidate antibody can be tested in in vitro and or in vivo assays that measure inhibition of cell growth. Such assays are known in the art and are further described and exemplified herein.

In one embodiment the present invention contemplates an altered antibody that possesses some but not all effector functions which make it a desired candidate for many applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions such as complement and ADCC are unnecessary or deleterious. In certain embodiments the Fc activities of the produced immunoglobulin are measured to ensure that only the desired properties are maintained. In vitro and or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction depletion of CDC and or ADCC activities. For example Fc receptor FcR binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc R binding hence likely lacking ADCC activity but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC NK cells express Fc RIII only whereas monocytes express Fc RI Fc RII and Fc RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet Annu Rev. Immunol 9 457 92 1991 . An example of an in vitro assay to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 500 362 or 5 821 337. Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and Natural Killer NK cells. Alternatively or additionally ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo e.g. in a animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. PNAS USA 95 652 656 1998 . C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. To assess complement activation a CDC assay e.g. as described in Gazzano Santoro et al. J. Immunol. Methods 202 163 1996 may be performed. FcRn binding and in vivo clearance half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art e.g. those described in the Examples section.

For recombinant production of an antibody of the invention the nucleic acid encoding it is isolated and inserted into a replicable vector for further cloning amplification of the DNA or for expression. DNA encoding the antibody is readily isolated and sequenced using conventional procedures e.g. by using oligonucleotide probes that are capable of binding specifically to genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody . Many vectors are available. The choice of vector depends in part on the host cell to be used. Generally preferred host cells are of either prokaryotic or eukaryotic generally mammalian origin. It will be appreciated that constant regions of any isotype can be used for this purpose including IgG IgM IgA IgD and IgE constant regions and that such constant regions can be obtained from any human or animal species.

Polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptide components of the antibody of the invention can be obtained using standard recombinant techniques. Desired polynucleotide sequences may be isolated and sequenced from antibody producing cells such as hybridoma cells. Alternatively polynucleotides can be synthesized using nucleotide synthesizer or PCR techniques. Once obtained sequences encoding the polypeptides are inserted into a recombinant vector capable of replicating and expressing heterologous polynucleotides in prokaryotic hosts. Many vectors that are available and known in the art can be used for the purpose of the present invention. Selection of an appropriate vector will depend mainly on the size of the nucleic acids to be inserted into the vector and the particular host cell to be transformed with the vector. Each vector contains various components depending on its function amplification or expression of heterologous polynucleotide or both and its compatibility with the particular host cell in which it resides. The vector components generally include but are not limited to an origin of replication a selection marker gene a promoter a ribosome binding site RBS a signal sequence the heterologous nucleic acid insert and a transcription termination sequence.

In general plasmid vectors containing replicon and control sequences which are derived from species compatible with the host cell are used in connection with these hosts. The vector ordinarily carries a replication site as well as marking sequences which are capable of providing phenotypic selection in transformed cells. For example is typically transformed using pBR322 a plasmid derived from an species. pBR322 contains genes encoding ampicillin Amp and tetracycline Tet resistance and thus provides easy means for identifying transformed cells. pBR322 its derivatives or other microbial plasmids or bacteriophage may also contain or be modified to contain promoters which can be used by the microbial organism for expression of endogenous proteins. Examples of pBR322 derivatives used for expression of particular antibodies are described in detail in Carter et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 648 237.

In addition phage vectors containing replicon and control sequences that are compatible with the host microorganism can be used as transforming vectors in connection with these hosts. For example bacteriophage such as GEM.TM. 11 may be utilized in making a recombinant vector which can be used to transform susceptible host cells such as LE392.

The expression vector of the invention may comprise two or more promoter cistron pairs encoding each of the polypeptide components. A promoter is an untranslated regulatory sequence located upstream 5 to a cistron that modulates its expression. Prokaryotic promoters typically fall into two classes inducible and constitutive. Inducible promoter is a promoter that initiates increased levels of transcription of the cistron under its control in response to changes in the culture condition e.g. the presence or absence of a nutrient or a change in temperature.

A large number of promoters recognized by a variety of potential host cells are well known. The selected promoter can be operably linked to cistron DNA encoding the light or heavy chain by removing the promoter from the source DNA via restriction enzyme digestion and inserting the isolated promoter sequence into the vector of the invention. Both the native promoter sequence and many heterologous promoters may be used to direct amplification and or expression of the target genes. In some embodiments heterologous promoters are utilized as they generally permit greater transcription and higher yields of expressed target gene as compared to the native target polypeptide promoter.

Promoters suitable for use with prokaryotic hosts include the PhoA promoter the galactamase and lactose promoter systems a tryptophan trp promoter system and hybrid promoters such as the tac or the trc promoter. However other promoters that are functional in bacteria such as other known bacterial or phage promoters are suitable as well. Their nucleotide sequences have been published thereby enabling a skilled worker operably to ligate them to cistrons encoding the target light and heavy chains Siebenlist et al. 1980 Cell 20 269 using linkers or adaptors to supply any required restriction sites.

In one aspect of the invention each cistron within the recombinant vector comprises a secretion signal sequence component that directs translocation of the expressed polypeptides across a membrane. In general the signal sequence may be a component of the vector or it may be a part of the target polypeptide DNA that is inserted into the vector. The signal sequence selected for the purpose of this invention should be one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. For prokaryotic host cells that do not recognize and process the signal sequences native to the heterologous polypeptides the signal sequence is substituted by a prokaryotic signal sequence selected for example from the group consisting of the alkaline phosphatase penicillinase Ipp or heat stable enterotoxin II STII leaders LamB PhoE PelB OmpA and MBP. In one embodiment of the invention the signal sequences used in both cistrons of the expression system are STII signal sequences or variants thereof.

In another aspect the production of the immunoglobulins according to the invention can occur in the cytoplasm of the host cell and therefore does not require the presence of secretion signal sequences within each cistron. In that regard immunoglobulin light and heavy chains are expressed folded and assembled to form functional immunoglobulins within the cytoplasm. Certain host strains e.g. the trxB strains provide cytoplasm conditions that are favorable for disulfide bond formation thereby permitting proper folding and assembly of expressed protein subunits. Proba and Pluckthun Gene 159 203 1995 .

Prokaryotic host cells suitable for expressing antibodies of the invention include Archaebacteria and Eubacteria such as Gram negative or Gram positive organisms. Examples of useful bacteria include e.g. Bacilli e.g. Enterobacteria species e.g. or . In one embodiment gram negative cells are used. In one embodiment cells are used as hosts for the invention. Examples of strains include strain W3110 Bachmann Cellular and Molecular Biology vol. 2 Washington D.C. American Society for Microbiology 1987 pp. 1190 1219 ATCC Deposit No. 27 325 and derivatives thereof including strain 33D3 having genotype W3110 fhuA tonA ptr3 lac Iq lacL8 ompT nmpc fepE degP41 kanR U.S. Pat. No. 5 639 635 . Other strains and derivatives thereof such as 294 ATCC 31 446 B 1776 ATCC 31 537 and RV308 ATCC 31 608 are also suitable. These examples are illustrative rather than limiting. Methods for constructing derivatives of any of the above mentioned bacteria having defined genotypes are known in the art and described in for example Bass et al. Proteins 8 309 314 1990 . It is generally necessary to select the appropriate bacteria taking into consideration replicability of the replicon in the cells of a bacterium. For example or species can be suitably used as the host when well known plasmids such as pBR322 pBR325 pACYC177 or pKN410 are used to supply the replicon. Typically the host cell should secrete minimal amounts of proteolytic enzymes and additional protease inhibitors may desirably be incorporated in the cell culture.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression vectors and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

Transformation means introducing DNA into the prokaryotic host so that the DNA is replicable either as an extrachromosomal element or by chromosomal integrant. Depending on the host cell used transformation is done using standard techniques appropriate to such cells. The calcium treatment employing calcium chloride is generally used for bacterial cells that contain substantial cell wall barriers. Another method for transformation employs polyethylene glycol DMSO. Yet another technique used is electroporation.

Prokaryotic cells used to produce the polypeptides of the invention are grown in media known in the art and suitable for culture of the selected host cells. Examples of suitable media include Luria broth LB plus necessary nutrient supplements. In some embodiments the media also contains a selection agent chosen based on the construction of the expression vector to selectively permit growth of prokaryotic cells containing the expression vector. For example ampicillin is added to media for growth of cells expressing ampicillin resistant gene.

Any necessary supplements besides carbon nitrogen and inorganic phosphate sources may also be included at appropriate concentrations introduced alone or as a mixture with another supplement or medium such as a complex nitrogen source. Optionally the culture medium may contain one or more reducing agents selected from the group consisting of glutathione cysteine cystamine thioglycollate dithioerythritol and dithiothreitol.

The prokaryotic host cells are cultured at suitable temperatures. For growth for example the preferred temperature ranges from about 20 C. to about 39 C. more preferably from about 25 C. to about 37 C. even more preferably at about 30 C. The pH of the medium may be any pH ranging from about 5 to about 9 depending mainly on the host organism. For the pH is preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.4 and more preferably about 7.0.

If an inducible promoter is used in the expression vector of the invention protein expression is induced under conditions suitable for the activation of the promoter. In one aspect of the invention PhoA promoters are used for controlling transcription of the polypeptides. Accordingly the transformed host cells are cultured in a phosphate limiting medium for induction. Preferably the phosphate limiting medium is the C.R.A.P medium see e.g. Simmons et al. J. Immunol. Methods 2002 263 133 147 . A variety of other inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art.

In one embodiment the expressed polypeptides of the present invention are secreted into and recovered from the periplasm of the host cells. Protein recovery typically involves disrupting the microorganism generally by such means as osmotic shock sonication or lysis. Once cells are disrupted cell debris or whole cells may be removed by centrifugation or filtration. The proteins may be further purified for example by affinity resin chromatography. Alternatively proteins can be transported into the culture media and isolated therein. Cells may be removed from the culture and the culture supernatant being filtered and concentrated for further purification of the proteins produced. The expressed polypeptides can be further isolated and identified using commonly known methods such as polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE and Western blot assay.

In one aspect of the invention antibody production is conducted in large quantity by a fermentation process. Various large scale fed batch fermentation procedures are available for production of recombinant proteins. Large scale fermentations have at least 1000 liters of capacity preferably about 1 000 to 100 000 liters of capacity. These fermentors use agitator impellers to distribute oxygen and nutrients especially glucose the preferred carbon energy source . Small scale fermentation refers generally to fermentation in a fermentor that is no more than approximately 100 liters in volumetric capacity and can range from about 1 liter to about 100 liters.

In a fermentation process induction of protein expression is typically initiated after the cells have been grown under suitable conditions to a desired density e.g. an OD550 of about 180 220 at which stage the cells are in the early stationary phase. A variety of inducers may be used according to the vector construct employed as is known in the art and described above. Cells may be grown for shorter periods prior to induction. Cells are usually induced for about 12 50 hours although longer or shorter induction time may be used.

To improve the production yield and quality of the polypeptides of the invention various fermentation conditions can be modified. For example to improve the proper assembly and folding of the secreted antibody polypeptides additional vectors overexpressing chaperone proteins such as Dsb proteins DsbA DsbB DsbC DsbD and or DsbG or FkpA a peptidylprolyl cis trans isomerase with chaperone activity can be used to co transform the host prokaryotic cells. The chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to facilitate the proper folding and solubility of heterologous proteins produced in bacterial host cells. Chen et al. 1999 J. Biol. Chem. 274 19601 19605 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 083 715 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6 027 888 Bothmann and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17100 17105 Ramm and Pluckthun 2000 J. Biol. Chem. 275 17106 17113 Arie et al. 2001 Mol. Microbiol. 39 199 210.

To minimize proteolysis of expressed heterologous proteins especially those that are proteolytically sensitive certain host strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes can be used for the present invention. For example host cell strains may be modified to effect genetic mutation s in the genes encoding known bacterial proteases such as Protease III OmpT DegP Tsp Protease I Protease Mi Protease V Protease VI and combinations thereof. Some protease deficient strains are available and described in for example Joly et al. 1998 supra Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 264 365 Georgiou et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 508 192 Hara et al. Microbial Drug Resistance 2 63 72 1996 .

In one embodiment strains deficient for proteolytic enzymes and transformed with plasmids overexpressing one or more chaperone proteins are used as host cells in the expression system of the invention.

Standard protein purification methods known in the art can be employed. The following procedures are exemplary of suitable purification procedures fractionation on immunoaffinity or ion exchange columns ethanol precipitation reverse phase HPLC chromatography on silica or on a cation exchange resin such as DEAE chromatofocusing SDS PAGE ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration using for example Sephadex G 75.

In one aspect Protein A immobilized on a solid phase is used for immunoaffinity purification of the full length antibody products of the invention. Protein A is a 41kD cell wall protein from which binds with a high affinity to the Fc region of antibodies. Lindmark et al. 1983 J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13. The solid phase to which Protein A is immobilized is preferably a column comprising a glass or silica surface more preferably a controlled pore glass column or a silicic acid column. In some applications the column has been coated with a reagent such as glycerol in an attempt to prevent nonspecific adherence of contaminants.

As the first step of purification the preparation derived from the cell culture as described above is applied onto the Protein A immobilized solid phase to allow specific binding of the antibody of interest to Protein A. The solid phase is then washed to remove contaminants non specifically bound to the solid phase. Finally the antibody of interest is recovered from the solid phase by elution.

The vector components generally include but are not limited to one or more of the following a signal sequence an origin of replication one or more marker genes an enhancer element a promoter and a transcription termination sequence.

A vector for use in a eukaryotic host cell may also contain a signal sequence or other polypeptide having a specific cleavage site at the N terminus of the mature protein or polypeptide of interest. The heterologous signal sequence selected preferably is one that is recognized and processed i.e. cleaved by a signal peptidase by the host cell. In mammalian cell expression mammalian signal sequences as well as viral secretory leaders for example the herpes simplex gD signal are available.

Generally an origin of replication component is not needed for mammalian expression vectors. For example the SV40 origin may typically be used only because it contains the early promoter.

Expression and cloning vectors may contain a selection gene also termed a selectable marker. Typical selection genes encode proteins that a confer resistance to antibiotics or other toxins e.g. ampicillin neomycin methotrexate or tetracycline b complement auxotrophic deficiencies where relevant or c supply critical nutrients not available from complex media.

One example of a selection scheme utilizes a drug to arrest growth of a host cell. Those cells that are successfully transformed with a heterologous gene produce a protein conferring drug resistance and thus survive the selection regimen. Examples of such dominant selection use the drugs neomycin mycophenolic acid and hygromycin.

Another example of suitable selectable markers for mammalian cells are those that enable the identification of cells competent to take up the antibody nucleic acid such as DHFR thymidine kinase metallothionein I and II preferably primate metallothionein genes adenosine deaminase ornithine decarboxylase etc.

For example cells transformed with the DHFR selection gene are first identified by culturing all of the transformants in a culture medium that contains methotrexate Mtx a competitive antagonist of DHFR. An appropriate host cell when wild type DHFR is employed is the Chinese hamster ovary CHO cell line deficient in DHFR activity e.g. ATCC CRL 9096 .

Alternatively host cells particularly wild type hosts that contain endogenous DHFR transformed or co transformed with DNA sequences encoding an antibody wild type DHFR protein and another selectable marker such as aminoglycoside 3 phosphotransferase APH can be selected by cell growth in medium containing a selection agent for the selectable marker such as an aminoglycosidic antibiotic e.g. kanamycin neomycin or G418. See U.S. Pat. No. 4 965 199.

Expression and cloning vectors usually contain a promoter that is recognized by the host organism and is operably linked to the antibody polypeptide nucleic acid. Promoter sequences are known for eukaryotes. Virtually alleukaryotic genes have an AT rich region located approximately 25 to 30 bases upstream from the site where transcription is initiated. Another sequence found 70 to 80 bases upstream from the start of transcription of many genes is a CNCAAT region where N may be any nucleotide. At the 3 end of most eukaryotic genes is an AATAAA sequence that may be the signal for addition of the poly A tail to the 3 end of the coding sequence. All of these sequences are suitably inserted into eukaryotic expression vectors.

Antibody polypeptide transcription from vectors in mammalian host cells is controlled for example by promoters obtained from the genomes of viruses such as polyoma virus fowlpox virus adenovirus such as Adenovirus 2 bovine papilloma virus avian sarcoma virus cytomegalovirus a retrovirus hepatitis B virus and Simian Virus 40 SV40 from heterologous mammalian promoters e.g. the actin promoter or an immunoglobulin promoter from heat shock promoters provided such promoters are compatible with the host cell systems.

The early and late promoters of the SV40 virus are conveniently obtained as an SV40 restriction fragment that also contains the SV40 viral origin of replication. The immediate early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus is conveniently obtained as a HindIII E restriction fragment. A system for expressing DNA in mammalian hosts using the bovine papilloma virus as a vector is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 419 446. A modification of this system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 601 978. Alternatively the Rous Sarcoma Virus long terminal repeat can be used as the promoter.

Transcription of DNA encoding the antibody polypeptide of this invention by higher eukaryotes is often increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Many enhancer sequences are now known from mammalian genes globin elastase albumin fetoprotein and insulin . Typically however one will use an enhancer from a eukaryotic cell virus. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 270 the cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer the polyoma enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers. See also Yaniv Nature 297 17 18 1982 on enhancing elements for activation of eukaryotic promoters. The enhancer may be spliced into the vector at a position 5 or 3 to the antibody polypeptide encoding sequence but is preferably located at a site 5 from the promoter.

Expression vectors used in eukaryotic host cells will typically also contain sequences necessary for the termination of transcription and for stabilizing the mRNA. Such sequences are commonly available from the 5 and occasionally 3 untranslated regions of eukaryotic or viral DNAs or cDNAs. These regions contain nucleotide segments transcribed as polyadenylated fragments in the untranslated portion of the mRNA encoding an antibody. One useful transcription termination component is the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation region. See WO94 11026 and the expression vector disclosed therein.

Suitable host cells for cloning or expressing the DNA in the vectors herein include higher eukaryote cells described herein including vertebrate host cells. Propagation of vertebrate cells in culture tissue culture has become a routine procedure. Examples of useful mammalian host cell lines are monkey kidney CV1 line transformed by SV40 COS 7 ATCC CRL 1651 human embryonic kidney line 293 or 293 cells subcloned for growth in suspension culture Graham et al.

Host cells are transformed with the above described expression or cloning vectors for antibody production and cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for inducing promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the genes encoding the desired sequences.

The host cells used to produce an antibody of this invention may be cultured in a variety of media. Commercially available media such as Ham s F10 Sigma Minimal Essential Medium MEM Sigma RPMI 1640 Sigma and Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium DMEM Sigma are suitable for culturing the host cells. In addition any of the media described in Ham et al. Meth. Enz. 58 44 1979 Barnes et al. Anal. Biochem. 102 255 1980 U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 767 704 4 657 866 4 927 762 4 560 655 or 5 122 469 WO 90 03430 WO 87 00195 or U.S. Pat. No. 30 985 may be used as culture media for the host cells. Any of these media may be supplemented as necessary with hormones and or other growth factors such as insulin transferrin or epidermal growth factor salts such as sodium chloride calcium magnesium and phosphate buffers such as HEPES nucleotides such as adenosine and thymidine antibiotics such as GENTAMYCIN drug trace elements defined as inorganic compounds usually present at final concentrations in the micromolar range and glucose or an equivalent energy source. Any other necessary supplements may also be included at appropriate concentrations that would be known to those skilled in the art. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

When using recombinant techniques the antibody can be produced intracellularly or directly secreted into the medium. If the antibody is produced intracellularly as a first step the particulate debris either host cells or lysed fragments are removed for example by centrifugation or ultrafiltration. Where the antibody is secreted into the medium supernatants from such expression systems are generally first concentrated using a commercially available protein concentration filter for example an Amicon or Millipore Pellicon ultrafiltration unit. A protease inhibitor such as PMSF may be included in any of the foregoing steps to inhibit proteolysis and antibiotics may be included to prevent the growth of adventitious contaminants.

The antibody composition prepared from the cells can be purified using for example hydroxylapatite chromatography gel electrophoresis dialysis and affinity chromatography with affinity chromatography being the preferred purification technique. The suitability of protein A as an affinity ligand depends on the species and isotype of any immunoglobulin Fc domain that is present in the antibody. Protein A can be used to purify antibodies that are based on human 1 2 or 4 heavy chains Lindmark et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 62 1 13 1983 . Protein G is recommended for all mouse isotypes and for human 3 Guss et al. EMBO J. 5 15671575 1986 . The matrix to which the affinity ligand is attached is most often agarose but other matrices are available. Mechanically stable matrices such as controlled pore glass or poly styrenedivinyl benzene allow for faster flow rates and shorter processing times than can be achieved with agarose. Where the antibody comprises a CH3 domain the Bakerbond ABX resin J. T. Baker Phillipsburg N.J. is useful for purification. Other techniques for protein purification such as fractionation on an ion exchange column ethanol precipitation Reverse Phase HPLC chromatography on silica chromatography on heparin SEPHAROSE chromatography on an anion or cation exchange resin such as a polyaspartic acid column chromatofocusing SDS PAGE and ammonium sulfate precipitation are also available depending on the antibody to be recovered.

Following any preliminary purification step s the mixture comprising the antibody of interest and contaminants may be subjected to low pH hydrophobic interaction chromatography using an elution buffer at a pH between about 2.5 4.5 preferably performed at low salt concentrations e.g. from about 0 0.25M salt .

The invention also provides immunoconjugates interchangeably termed antibody drug conjugates or ADC comprising any of the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies described herein conjugated to a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent a drug a growth inhibitory agent a toxin e.g. an enzymatically active toxin of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof or a radioactive isotope i.e. a radioconjugate .

No. 4 975 278 allows targeted delivery of the drug moiety to tumors and intracellular accumulation therein where systemic administration of these unconjugated drug agents may result in unacceptable levels of toxicity to normal cells as well as the tumor cells sought to be eliminated Baldwin et al. 1986 Lancet pp. Mar. 15 1986 603 05 Thorpe 1985 Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy A Review in Monoclonal Antibodies 84 Biological And Clinical Applications A. Pinchera et al. ed.s pp. 475 506 . Maximal efficacy with minimal toxicity is sought thereby. Both polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies have been reported as useful in these strategies Rowland et al. 1986 Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 21 183 87 . Drugs used in these methods include daunomycin doxorubicin methotrexate and vindesine Rowland et al. 1986 supra . Toxins used in antibody toxin conjugates include bacterial toxins such as diphtheria toxin plant toxins such as ricin small molecule toxins such as geldanamycin Mandler et al 2000 Jour. of the Nat. Cancer Inst. 92 19 1573 1581 Mandler et al. 2000 Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letters 10 1025 1028 Mandler et al. 2002 Bioconjugate Chem. 13 786 791 maytansinoids EP 1391213 Liu et al. 1996 Proc. Natl.

The toxins may effect their cytotoxic and cytostatic effects by mechanisms including tubulin binding DNA binding or topoisomerase inhibition. Some cytotoxic drugs tend to be inactive or less active when conjugated to large antibodies or protein receptor ligands.

Chemotherapeutic agents useful in the generation of immunoconjugates are described herein e.g. above . Enzymatically active toxins and fragments thereof that can be used include diphtheria A chain nonbinding active fragments of diphtheria toxin exotoxin A chain from ricin A chain abrin A chain modeccin A chain alpha sarcin proteins dianthin proteins proteins PAPI PAPII and PAP S inhibitor curcin crotin inhibitor gelonin mitogellin restrictocin phenomycin enomycin and the tricothecenes. See e.g. WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993. A variety of radionuclides are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include Bi I In Y and Re. Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent are made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithiol propionate SPDP iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026.

Conjugates of an antibody and one or more small molecule toxins such as a calicheamicin maytansinoids dolastatins aurostatins a trichothecene and CC 1065 and the derivatives of these toxins that have toxin activity are also contemplated herein.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody full length or fragments of the invention conjugated to one or more maytansinoid molecules.

Maytansinoids are mitototic inhibitors which act by inhibiting tubulin polymerization. Maytansine was first isolated from the east African shrub U.S. Pat. No. 3 896 111 . Subsequently it was discovered that certain microbes also produce maytansinoids such as maytansinol and C 3 maytansinol esters U.S. Pat. No. 4 151 042 . Synthetic maytansinol and derivatives and analogues thereof are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 137 230 4 248 870 4 256 746 4 260 608 4 265 814 4 294 757 4 307 016 4 308 268 4 308 269 4 309 428 4 313 946 4 315 929 4 317 821 4 322 348 4 331 598 4 361 650 4 364 866 4 424 219 4 450 254 4 362 663 and 4 371 533.

Maytansinoid drug moieties are attractive drug moieties in antibody drug conjugates because they are i relatively accessible to prepare by fermentation or chemical modification derivatization of fermentation products ii amenable to derivatization with functional groups suitable for conjugation through the non disulfide linkers to antibodies iii stable in plasma and iv effective against a variety of tumor cell lines.

Immunoconjugates containing maytansinoids methods of making same and their therapeutic use are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 208 020 5 416 064 and European Patent EP 0 425 235 B1 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Liu et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93 8618 8623 1996 described immunoconjugates comprising a maytansinoid designated DM1 linked to the monoclonal antibody C242 directed against human colorectal cancer. The conjugate was found to be highly cytotoxic towards cultured colon cancer cells and showed antitumor activity in an in vivo tumor growth assay. Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 describe immunoconjugates in which a maytansinoid was conjugated via a disulfide linker to the murine antibody A7 binding to an antigen on human colon cancer cell lines or to another murine monoclonal antibody TA.1 that binds the HER 2 neu oncogene. The cytotoxicity of the TA.1 maytansinoid conjugate was tested in vitro on the human breast cancer cell line SK BR 3 which expresses 3 10HER 2 surface antigens per cell. The drug conjugate achieved a degree of cytotoxicity similar to the free maytansinoid drug which could be increased by increasing the number of maytansinoid molecules per antibody molecule. The A7 maytansinoid conjugate showed low systemic cytotoxicity in mice.

Antibody maytansinoid conjugates are prepared by chemically linking an antibody to a maytansinoid molecule without significantly diminishing the biological activity of either the antibody or the maytansinoid molecule. See e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference . An average of 3 4 maytansinoid molecules conjugated per antibody molecule has shown efficacy in enhancing cytotoxicity of target cells without negatively affecting the function or solubility of the antibody although even one molecule of toxin antibody would be expected to enhance cytotoxicity over the use of naked antibody. Maytansinoids are well known in the art and can be synthesized by known techniques or isolated from natural sources. Suitable maytansinoids are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 and in the other patents and nonpatent publications referred to hereinabove. Preferred maytansinoids are maytansinol and maytansinol analogues modified in the aromatic ring or at other positions of the maytansinol molecule such as various maytansinol esters.

There are many linking groups known in the art for making antibody maytansinoid conjugates including for example those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 or EP Patent 0 425 235 B1 Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004 the disclosures of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Antibody maytansinoid conjugates comprising the linker component SMCC may be prepared as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 960 602 filed Oct. 8 2004. The linking groups include disulfide groups thioether groups acid labile groups photolabile groups peptidase labile groups or esterase labile groups as disclosed in the above identified patents disulfide and thioether groups being preferred. Additional linking groups are described and exemplified herein.

Conjugates of the antibody and maytansinoid may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . Particularly preferred coupling agents include N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP Carlsson et al. Biochem. J. 173 723 737 1978 and N succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP to provide for a disulfide linkage.

The linker may be attached to the maytansinoid molecule at various positions depending on the type of the link. For example an ester linkage may be formed by reaction with a hydroxyl group using conventional coupling techniques. The reaction may occur at the C 3 position having a hydroxyl group the C 14 position modified with hydroxymethyl the C 15 position modified with a hydroxyl group and the C 20 position having a hydroxyl group. In a preferred embodiment the linkage is formed at the C 3 position of maytansinol or a maytansinol analogue.

In some embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to dolastatins or dolastatin peptidic analogs and derivatives the auristatins U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 and 5 780 588 . Dolastatins and auristatins have been shown to interfere with microtubule dynamics GTP hydrolysis and nuclear and cellular division Woyke et al 2001 Antimicrob. Agents and Chemother. 45 12 3580 3584 and have anticancer U.S. Pat. No. 5 663 149 and antifungal activity Pettit et al. 1998 Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 42 2961 2965 . The dolastatin or auristatin drug moiety may be attached to the antibody through the N amino terminus or the C carboxyl terminus of the peptidic drug moiety WO 02 088172 .

Exemplary auristatin embodiments include the N terminus linked monomethylauristatin drug moieties DE and DF disclosed in Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Typically peptide based drug moieties can be prepared by forming a peptide bond between two or more amino acids and or peptide fragments. Such peptide bonds can be prepared for example according to the liquid phase synthesis method see E. Schr der and K. L bke The Peptides volume 1 pp. 76 136 1965 Academic Press that is well known in the field of peptide chemistry. The auristatin dolastatin drug moieties may be prepared according to the methods of U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 635 483 and 5 780 588 Pettit et al. 1989 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 111 5463 5465 Pettit et al. 1998 Anti Cancer Drug Design 13 243 277 Pettit G. R. et al. Synthesis 1996 719 725 and Pettit et al. 1996 J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1 5 859 863. See also Doronina 2003 Nat. Biotechnol. 21 7 778 784 Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety disclosing e.g. linkers and methods of preparing monomethylvaline compounds such as MMAE and MMAF conjugated to linkers .

In other embodiments the immunoconjugate comprises an antibody of the invention conjugated to one or more calicheamicin molecules. The calicheamicin family of antibiotics are capable of producing double stranded DNA breaks at sub picomolar concentrations. For the preparation of conjugates of the calicheamicin family see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 712 374 5 714 586 5 739 116 5 767 285 5 770 701 5 770 710 5 773 001 and 5 877 296 all to American Cyanamid Company . Structural analogues of calicheamicin which may be used include but are not limited to N acetyl PSAG and Hinman et al. Cancer Research 53 3336 3342 1993 Lode et al. Cancer Research 58 2925 2928 1998 and the aforementioned U.S. patents to American Cyanamid . Another anti tumor drug that the antibody can be conjugated is QFA which is an antifolate. Both calicheamicin and QFA have intracellular sites of action and do not readily cross the plasma membrane. Therefore cellular uptake of these agents through antibody mediated internalization greatly enhances their cytotoxic effects.

Other antitumor agents that can be conjugated to the antibodies of the invention include BCNU streptozoicin vincristine and 5 fluorouracil the family of agents known collectively LL E33288 complex described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 053 394 and 5 770 710 as well as esperamicins U.S. Pat. No. 5 877 296 .

See for example WO 93 21232 published Oct. 28 1993.

The present invention further contemplates an immunoconjugate formed between an antibody and a compound with nucleolytic activity e.g. a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease such as a deoxyribonuclease DNase .

For selective destruction of the tumor the antibody may comprise a highly radioactive atom. A variety of radioactive isotopes are available for the production of radioconjugated antibodies. Examples include At I I Y Re Re Sm Bi P Pband radioactive isotopes of Lu. When the conjugate is used for detection it may comprise a radioactive atom for scintigraphic studies for example tcor I or a spin label for nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging also known as magnetic resonance imaging MRI such as iodine 123 again iodine 131 indium 111 fluorine 19 carbon 13 nitrogen 15 oxygen 17 gadolinium manganese or iron.

The radio or other labels may be incorporated in the conjugate in known ways. For example the peptide may be biosynthesized or may be synthesized by chemical amino acid synthesis using suitable amino acid precursors involving for example fluorine 19 in place of hydrogen. Labels such as tcor I Re Reand Incan be attached via a cysteine residue in the peptide. Yttrium 90 can be attached via a lysine residue. The IODOGEN method Fraker et al 1978 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80 49 57 can be used to incorporate iodine 123. Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunoscintigraphy Chatal CRC Press 1989 describes other methods in detail.

Conjugates of the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made using a variety of bifunctional protein coupling agents such as N succinimidyl 3 2 pyridyldithio propionate SPDP succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC iminothiolane IT bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl active esters such as disuccinimidyl suberate aldehydes such as glutaraldehyde bis azido compounds such as bis p azidobenzoyl hexanediamine bis diazonium derivatives such as bis p diazoniumbenzoyl ethylenediamine diisocyanates such as toluene 2 6 diisocyanate and bis active fluorine compounds such as 1 5 difluoro 2 4 dinitrobenzene . For example a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al. Science 238 1098 1987 . Carbon 14 labeled 1 isothiocyanatobenzyl 3 methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid MX DTPA is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the antibody. See WO94 11026. The linker may be a cleavable linker facilitating release of the cytotoxic drug in the cell. For example an acid labile linker peptidase sensitive linker photolabile linker dimethyl linker or disulfide containing linker Chari et al. Cancer Research 52 127 131 1992 U.S. Pat. No. 5 208 020 may be used.

The compounds of the invention expressly contemplate but are not limited to ADC prepared with cross linker reagents BMPS EMCS GMBS HBVS LC SMCC MBS MPBH SBAP SIA SIAB SMCC SMPB SMPH sulfo EMCS sulfo GMBS sulfo KMUS sulfo MBS sulfo SIAB sulfo SMCC and sulfo SMPB and SVSB succinimidyl 4 vinylsulfone benzoate which are commercially available e.g. from Pierce Biotechnology Inc. Rockford Ill. U.S.A . See pages 467 498 2003 2004 Applications Handbook and Catalog.

In the antibody drug conjugates ADC of the invention an antibody Ab is conjugated to one or more drug moieties D e.g. about 1 to about 20 drug moieties per antibody through a linker L . The ADC of Formula I may be prepared by several routes employing organic chemistry reactions conditions and reagents known to those skilled in the art including 1 reaction of a nucleophilic group of an antibody with a bivalent linker reagent to form Ab L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with a drug moiety D and 2 reaction of a nucleophilic group of a drug moiety with a bivalent linker reagent to form D L via a covalent bond followed by reaction with the nucleophilic group of an antibody. Additional methods for preparing ADC are described herein. Ab L D I

The linker may be composed of one or more linker components. Exemplary linker components include 6 maleimidocaproyl MC maleimidopropanoyl MP valine citrulline val cit alanine phenylalanine ala phe p aminobenzyloxycarbonyl PAB N Succinimidyl 4 2 pyridylthio pentanoate SPP N Succinimidyl 4 N maleimidomethyl cyclohexane 1 carboxylate SMCC and N Succinimidyl 4 iodo acetyl aminobenzoate SIAB . Additional linker components are known in the art and some are described herein. See also Monomethylvaline Compounds Capable of Conjugation to Ligands U.S. Ser. No. 10 983 340 filed Nov. 5 2004 the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

In some embodiments the linker may comprise amino acid residues. Exemplary amino acid linker components include a dipeptide a tripeptide a tetrapeptide or a pentapeptide. Exemplary dipeptides include valine citrulline vc or val cit alanine phenylalanine af or ala phe . Exemplary tripeptides include glycine valine citrulline gly val cit and glycine glycine glycine gly gly gly . Amino acid residues which comprise an amino acid linker component include those occurring naturally as well as minor amino acids and non naturally occurring amino acid analogs such as citrulline. Amino acid linker components can be designed and optimized in their selectivity for enzymatic cleavage by a particular enzymes for example a tumor associated protease cathepsin B C and D or a plasmin protease.

Nucleophilic groups on antibodies include but are not limited to i N terminal amine groups ii side chain amine groups e.g. lysine iii side chain thiol groups e.g. cysteine and iv sugar hydroxyl or amino groups where the antibody is glycosylated. Amine thiol and hydroxyl groups are nucleophilic and capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups. Certain antibodies have reducible interchain disulfides i.e. cysteine bridges. Antibodies may be made reactive for conjugation with linker reagents by treatment with a reducing agent such as DTT dithiothreitol . Each cysteine bridge will thus form theoretically two reactive thiol nucleophiles. Additional nucleophilic groups can be introduced into antibodies through the reaction of lysines with 2 iminothiolane Traut s reagent resulting in conversion of an amine into a thiol. Reactive thiol groups may be introduced into the antibody or fragment thereof by introducing one two three four or more cysteine residues e.g. preparing mutant antibodies comprising one or more non native cysteine amino acid residues .

Antibody drug conjugates of the invention may also be produced by modification of the antibody to introduce electrophilic moieties which can react with nucleophilic substituents on the linker reagent or drug. The sugars of glycosylated antibodies may be oxidized e.g. with periodate oxidizing reagents to form aldehyde or ketone groups which may react with the amine group of linker reagents or drug moieties. The resulting imine Schiff base groups may form a stable linkage or may be reduced e.g. by borohydride reagents to form stable amine linkages. In one embodiment reaction of the carbohydrate portion of a glycosylated antibody with either galactose oxidase or sodium meta periodate may yield carbonyl aldehyde and ketone groups in the protein that can react with appropriate groups on the drug Hermanson Bioconjugate Techniques . In another embodiment proteins containing N terminal serine or threonine residues can react with sodium meta periodate resulting in production of an aldehyde in place of the first amino acid Geoghegan Stroh 1992 Bioconjugate Chem. 3 138 146 U.S. Pat. No. 5 362 852 . Such aldehyde can be reacted with a drug moiety or linker nucleophile.

Likewise nucleophilic groups on a drug moiety include but are not limited to amine thiol hydroxyl hydrazide oxime hydrazine thiosemicarbazone hydrazine carboxylate and arylhydrazide groups capable of reacting to form covalent bonds with electrophilic groups on linker moieties and linker reagents including i active esters such as NHS esters HOBt esters haloformates and acid halides ii alkyl and benzyl halides such as haloacetamides iii aldehydes ketones carboxyl and maleimide groups.

Alternatively a fusion protein comprising the antibody and cytotoxic agent may be made e.g. by recombinant techniques or peptide synthesis. The length of DNA may comprise respective regions encoding the two portions of the conjugate either adjacent one another or separated by a region encoding a linker peptide which does not destroy the desired properties of the conjugate.

In yet another embodiment the antibody may be conjugated to a receptor such streptavidin for utilization in tumor pre targeting wherein the antibody receptor conjugate is administered to the individual followed by removal of unbound conjugate from the circulation using a clearing agent and then administration of a ligand e.g. avidin which is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent e.g. a radionucleotide .

Therapeutic formulations comprising an antibody of the invention are prepared for storage by mixing the antibody having the desired degree of purity with optional physiologically acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers 20th edition 2000 in the form of aqueous solutions lyophilized or other dried formulations. Acceptable carriers excipients or stabilizers are nontoxic to recipients at the dosages and concentrations employed and include buffers such as phosphate citrate histidine and other organic acids antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine preservatives such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride hexamethonium chloride benzalkonium chloride benzethonium chloride phenol butyl or benzyl alcohol alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben catechol resorcinol cyclohexanol 3 pentanol and m cresol low molecular weight less than about 10 residues polypeptides proteins such as serum albumin gelatin or immunoglobulins hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone amino acids such as glycine glutamine asparagine histidine arginine or lysine monosaccharides disaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose mannose or dextrins chelating agents such as EDTA sugars such as sucrose mannitol trehalose or sorbitol salt forming counter ions such as sodium metal complexes e.g. Zn protein complexes and or non ionic surfactants such as TWEEN PLURONICS or polyethylene glycol PEG .

The formulation herein may also contain more than one active compound as necessary for the particular indication being treated preferably those with complementary activities that do not adversely affect each other. Such molecules are suitably present in combination in amounts that are effective for the purpose intended.

The active ingredients may also be entrapped in microcapsule prepared for example by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization for example hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin microcapsule and poly methylmethacylate microcapsule respectively in colloidal drug delivery systems for example liposomes albumin microspheres microemulsions nano particles and nanocapsules or in macroemulsions. Such techniques are disclosed in 20th edition 2000 .

The formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile. This is readily accomplished by filtration through sterile filtration membranes.

Sustained release preparations may be prepared. Suitable examples of sustained release preparations include semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the immunoglobulin of the invention which matrices are in the form of shaped articles e.g. films or microcapsule. Examples of sustained release matrices include polyesters hydrogels for example poly 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or poly vinylalcohol polylactides U.S. Pat. No. 3 773 919 copolymers of L glutamic acid and ethyl L glutamate non degradable ethylene vinyl acetate degradable lactic acid glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate and poly D 3 hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate and lactic acid glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated immunoglobulins remain in the body for a long time they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37 C. resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S S bond formation through thio disulfide interchange stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues lyophilizing from acidic solutions controlling moisture content using appropriate additives and developing specific polymer matrix compositions.

An antibody of the present invention may be used in for example in vitro ex vivo and in vivo therapeutic methods.

In one aspect the invention provides methods for treating or preventing a tumor a cancer and or a cell proliferative disorder associated with increased expression and or activity signaling of Notch1 the methods comprising administering an effective amount of an anti Notch1 NRR antibody to an individual in need of such treatment.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for reducing inhibiting or preventing growth of a tumor or cancer the methods comprising administering an effective amount of an anti Notch1 NRR antibody to an individual in need of such treatment.

Moreover at least some of the antibodies of the invention can bind antigen from other species. Desirably a Notch1 NRR antibody binds to both human and mouse Notch1 NRR desirably with a Kd of 1 10or stronger. Accordingly the antibodies of the invention can be used to bind specific antigen activity e.g. in a cell culture containing the antigen in human individuals or in other mammalian subjects having the antigen with which an antibody of the invention cross reacts e.g. chimpanzee baboon marmoset cynomolgus and rhesus pig or mouse . In one embodiment the antibody of the invention can be used for inhibiting antigen activities by contacting the antibody with the antigen such that antigen activity is inhibited. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule.

In one embodiment an antibody of the invention can be used in a method for binding an antigen in an individual suffering from a disorder associated with increased antigen expression and or activity signaling comprising administering to the individual an antibody of the invention such that the antigen in the individual is bound. It is understood that increased Notch1 activity signaling encompasses increased Notch1 activity due to Notch activating mutations increased Notch1 activity due to increased expression and or activity of Notch ligands as well as increased Notch1 activity due to other mechanisms. Preferably the antigen is a human protein molecule and the individual is a human. Alternatively the individual can be a mammal expressing the antigen with which an antibody of the invention binds. Still further the individual can be a mammal into which the antigen has been introduced e.g. by administration of the antigen or by expression of an antigen transgene . An antibody of the invention can be administered to a human individual for therapeutic purposes. Moreover an antibody of the invention can be administered to a non human mammal expressing an antigen with which the immunoglobulin cross reacts e.g. a primate pig or mouse for veterinary purposes or as an animal model of human disease. Regarding the latter such animal models may be useful for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antibodies of the invention e.g. testing of dosages and time courses of administration .

Such neurodegenerative disorders include without limitation peripheral neuropathies motorneuron disorders such as amylotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS Lou Gehrig s disease Bell s palsy and various conditions involving spinal muscular atrophy or paralysis and other human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s disease Parkinson s disease epilepsy multiple sclerosis Huntington s chorea Down s Syndrome nerve deafness and Meniere s disease and acute nerve cell injuries for example due to trauma or spinal cord injury.

Notch1 activity has been implicated in the development of various stem and early progenitor cell systems both in developmental and adult phases. See e.g. Chirba S. 2006 Stem Cells 24 2437 2447. Accordingly in another aspect the invention provides methods for the expansion of non terminally differentiated cells precursor cells by modulating the Notch pathway in a precursor cell such that the differentiation of the precursor cell is inhibited. As used herein precursor cells shall mean any non terminally differentiated cells. The precursor cell is preferably a stem or progenitor cell. In some embodiments the invention provides methods for the expansion of precursor cells in precursor cell containing populations by activating the Notch pathway in the cells such that the differentiation of the stem cell is inhibited. Further the precursor cells can be isolated from a cell population if desired before or after Notch pathway activation. Activation of Notch pathway is preferably achieved by contacting the cell with an anti Notch1 NRR agonist antibody.

An embodiment of the present invention is to treat the desired cell population with agonists of the Notch pathway and then either allow these cells to proliferate in culture before transplanting them back into the appropriate region or directly transplanting them without necessarily allowing them to proliferate in vitro. Antagonists can be used to reverse or neutralize the action of the Notch function agonist.

The expanded stem cell populations of the present invention can be transplanted into an individual for the treatment of disease or injury or for gene therapy by any method known in the art which is appropriate for the type of stem cells being transplanted and the transplant site. Hematopoietic stem cells can be transplanted intravenously as can liver stem cells which will locate to the liver. Neural stem cells can be transplanted directly into the brain at the site of injury or disease.

In addition to the uses of anti Notch1 NRR antagonist antibodies described herein anti Notch1 NRR agonist antibodies are also useful for treatments or compositions for modulating disease states associated with Notch1 expression and or activity and or a disruption of any biologically relevant Notch1 and or Notch1 ligand biological pathway.

In some embodiments the pathological condition associated with angiogenesis is a tumor a cancer and or a cell proliferative disorder. In some embodiments the pathological condition associated with angiogenesis is an intraocular neovascular disease.

In certain embodiments an immunoconjugate comprising an antibody conjugated with one or more cytotoxic agent s is administered to the individual. In some embodiments the immunoconjugate and or antigen to which it is bound is are internalized by the cell resulting in increased therapeutic efficacy of the immunoconjugate in killing the target cell to which it binds. In one embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with nucleic acid in the target cell. In one embodiment the cytotoxic agent targets or interferes with microtubule polymerization. Examples of such cytotoxic agents include any of the chemotherapeutic agents noted herein such as a maytansinoid auristatin dolastatin or a calicheamicin a radioactive isotope or a ribonuclease or a DNA endonuclease.

Antibodies of the invention can be used either alone or in combination with other compositions in a therapy. For instance an antibody of the invention may be co administered with another antibody chemotherapeutic agent s including cocktails of chemotherapeutic agents other cytotoxic agent s anti angiogenic agent s cytokines and or growth inhibitory agent s . Where an antibody of the invention inhibits tumor growth it may be particularly desirable to combine it with one or more other therapeutic agent s which also inhibits tumor growth. Alternatively or additionally the individual may receive combined radiation therapy e.g. external beam irradiation or therapy with a radioactive labeled agent such as an antibody . Such combined therapies noted above include combined administration where the two or more agents are included in the same or separate formulations and separate administration in which case administration of the antibody of the invention can occur prior to and or following administration of the adjunct therapy or therapies.

As indicated above the invention provides combined therapies in which an anti Notch1 NRR antibody is administered with another therapy. For example anti Notch1 NRR antibodies are used in combinations with anti cancer therapeutics or an anti neovascularization therapeutics to treat various neoplastic or non neoplastic conditions. In one embodiment the neoplastic or non neoplastic condition is characterized by pathological disorder associated with aberrant or undesired angiogenesis. The anti Notch1 NRR antibody can be administered serially or in combination with another agent that is effective for those purposes either in the same composition or as separate compositions. Alternatively or additionally multiple inhibitors of Notch1 can be administered.

The administration of the anti Notch1 NRR antibody can be done simultaneously e.g. as a single composition or as two or more distinct compositions using the same or different administration routes. Alternatively or additionally the administration can be done sequentially in any order. In certain embodiments intervals ranging from minutes to days to weeks to months can be present between the administrations of the two or more compositions. For example the anti cancer agent may be administered first followed by the Notch1 inhibitor. However simultaneous administration or administration of the anti Notch1 NRR antibody first is also contemplated.

The effective amounts of therapeutic agents administered in combination with an anti Notch1 NRR antibody will be at the physician s or veterinarian s discretion. Dosage administration and adjustment is done to achieve maximal management of the conditions to be treated. The dose will additionally depend on such factors as the type of therapeutic agent to be used and the specific individual being treated. Suitable dosages for the anti cancer agent are those presently used and can be lowered due to the combined action synergy of the anti cancer agent and the anti Notch1 NRR antibody. In certain embodiments the combination of the inhibitors potentiates the efficacy of a single inhibitor. The term potentiate refers to an improvement in the efficacy of a therapeutic agent at its common or approved dose.

Typically the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies and anti cancer agents are suitable for the same or similar diseases to block or reduce a pathological disorder such as tumor growth or growth of a cancer cell. In one embodiment the anti cancer agent is an anti angiogenesis agent.

Exemplary anti cancer agents include an alkylating agent a folate antagonist a pyrimidine antagonist a cytotoxic antibiotic a platinum compound or platinum based compound a taxane a vinca alkaloid a c Kit inhibitor a topoisomerase inhibitor an anti angiogenesis inhibitor such as an anti VEGF inhibitor a HER 2 inhibitor an EGFR inhibitor or dual EGFR HER 2 kinase inhibitor an anti estrogen such as fulvestrant and a hormonal therapy agent such as carboplatin cisplatin gemcitabine capecitabine epirubicin tamoxifen an aromatase inhibitor and prednisone. In some embodiments the cancer is colorectal cancer and the second medicament is an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib an anti VEGF inhibitor such as bevacizumab or is cetuximab irinotecan irinotecan or FOLFOX or the cancer is breast cancer an the second medicament is an anti estrogen modulator such as fulvestrant tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor such as letrozole exemestane or anastrozole or is a VEGF inhibitor such as bevacizumab or is a chemotherapeutic agent such as doxorubicin and or a taxane such as paclitaxel or is an anti HER 2 inhibitor such as trastuzumab or a dual EGFR HER 2 kinase inhibitor such as lapatinib or a HER 2 downregulator such as 17AAG geldanamycin derivative that is a heat shock protein Hsp 90 poison for example for breast cancers that have progressed on trastuzumab . In other embodiments the cancer is lung cancer such as small cell lung cancer and the second medicament is a VEGF inhibitor such as bevacizumab or an EGFR inhibitor such as e.g. erlotinib or a c Kit inhibitor such as e.g. imatinib.

Anti angiogenic therapy in relationship to cancer is a cancer treatment strategy aimed at inhibiting the development of tumor blood vessels required for providing nutrients to support tumor growth. Because angiogenesis is involved in both primary tumor growth and metastasis the anti angiogenic treatment provided by the invention is capable of inhibiting the neoplastic growth of tumor at the primary site as well as preventing metastasis of tumors at the secondary sites therefore allowing attack of the tumors by other therapeutics.

Many anti angiogenic agents have been identified and are known in the arts including those listed herein e.g. listed under Definitions and by e.g. Carmeliet and Jain Nature 407 249 257 2000 Ferrara et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 3 391 400 2004 and Sato Int. J. Clin. Oncol. 8 200 206 2003 . See also U.S. Patent Application US20030055006. In one embodiment an anti Notch1 NRR antibody is used in combination with an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment and or another VEGF antagonist or a VEGF receptor antagonist including but not limited to for example soluble VEGF receptor e.g. VEGFR 1 VEGFR 2 VEGFR 3 neuropillins e.g. NRP1 NRP2 fragments aptamers capable of blocking VEGF or VEGFR neutralizing anti VEGFR antibodies low molecule weight inhibitors of VEGFR tyrosine kinases RTK antisense strategies for VEGF ribozymes against VEGF or VEGF receptors antagonist variants of VEGF and any combinations thereof. Alternatively or additionally two or more angiogenesis inhibitors may optionally be co administered to the individual in addition to VEGF antagonist and other agent. In certain embodiment one or more additional therapeutic agents e.g. anti cancer agents can be administered in combination with anti Notch1 NRR antibody the VEGF antagonist and an anti angiogenesis agent.

In certain aspects of the invention other therapeutic agents useful for combination tumor therapy with a anti Notch1 NRR antibody include other cancer therapies e.g. surgery radiological treatments e.g. involving irradiation or administration of radioactive substances chemotherapy treatment with anti cancer agents listed herein and known in the art or combinations thereof . Alternatively or additionally two or more antibodies binding the same or two or more different antigens disclosed herein can be co administered to the individual. Sometimes it may be beneficial to also administer one or more cytokines to the individual.

In certain aspects the invention provides a method of blocking or reducing tumor growth or growth of a cancer cell by administering effective amounts of an antagonist of Notch1 and or an angiogenesis inhibitor s and one or more chemotherapeutic agents to an individual susceptible to or diagnosed with cancer. A variety of chemotherapeutic agents may be used in the combined treatment methods of the invention. An exemplary and non limiting list of chemotherapeutic agents contemplated is provided herein under Definitions and some are described above.

As will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art the appropriate doses of chemotherapeutic agents will be generally around those already employed in clinical therapies wherein the chemotherapeutics are administered alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics. Variation in dosage will likely occur depending on the condition being treated. The physician administering treatment will be able to determine the appropriate dose for the individual.

The invention also provides methods and compositions for inhibiting or preventing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth. Relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth is used to describe a condition in which individuals undergoing or treated with one or more currently available therapies e.g. cancer therapies such as chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery hormonal therapy and or biological therapy immunotherapy anti VEGF antibody therapy particularly a standard therapeutic regimen for the particular cancer is not clinically adequate to treat the individuals or the individuals are no longer receiving any beneficial effect from the therapy such that these individuals need additional effective therapy. As used herein the phrase can also refer to a condition of the non responsive refractory individual e.g. which describe individuals who respond to therapy yet suffer from side effects develop resistance do not respond to the therapy do not respond satisfactorily to the therapy etc. In various embodiments a cancer is relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth where the number of cancer cells has not been significantly reduced or has increased or tumor size has not been significantly reduced or has increased or fails any further reduction in size or in number of cancer cells. The determination of whether the cancer cells are relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth can be made either in vivo or in vitro by any method known in the art for assaying the effectiveness of treatment on cancer cells using the art accepted meanings of relapse or refractory or non responsive in such a context. A tumor resistant to anti VEGF treatment is an example of a relapse tumor growth.

The invention provides methods of blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in an individual by administering one or more anti Notch1 NRR antibodies to block or reduce the relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth in an individual. In certain embodiments the antagonist can be administered subsequent to the cancer therapeutic. In other embodiments the anti Notch1 NRR antibody is administered simultaneously with cancer therapy. Alternatively or additionally the anti Notch1 NRR antibody therapy alternates with another cancer therapy which can be performed in any order. The invention also encompasses methods for administering one or more inhibitory antibodies to prevent the onset or recurrence of cancer in individuals predisposed to having cancer. Generally the individual was or is concurrently undergoing cancer therapy. In one embodiment the cancer therapy is treatment with an anti angiogenesis agent e.g. a VEGF antagonist. The anti angiogenesis agent includes those known in the art and those found under the Definitions herein. In one embodiment the anti angiogenesis agent is an anti VEGF neutralizing antibody or fragment e.g. humanized A4.6.1 AVASTIN Genentech South San Francisco Calif. Y0317 M4 G6 B20 2C3 etc. . See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 582 959 6 884 879 6 703 020 WO98 45332 WO 96 30046 WO94 10202 EP 0666868B1 US Patent Applications 20030206899 20030190317 20030203409 and 20050112126 Popkov et al. Journal of Immunological Methods 288 149 164 2004 and WO2005012359. Additional agents can be administered in combination with VEGF antagonist and an anti Notch1 NRR antibody for blocking or reducing relapse tumor growth or relapse cancer cell growth e.g. see section entitled Combination Therapies herein.

The compounds of the invention e.g. anti Notch1 NRR antibodies are administered to an individual e.g. a human patient in accord with known methods such as intravenous administration as a bolus or by continuous infusion over a period of time by for example oral topical or inhalation routes parenteral subcutaneous intraperitoneal intrapulmonary and intranasal and if desired for local treatment intralesional administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular intravenous intra arterial intraperitoneal intracerobrospinal intrasynovial intrathecal or subcutaneous administration. Local administration is particularly desired if extensive side effects or toxicity is associated with inhibition of Notch1 signaling. An ex vivo strategy can also be used for therapeutic applications. Ex vivo strategies involve for example transfecting or transducing cells obtained from the individual with a polynucleotide encoding an anti Notch1 NRR antibody. The transfected or transduced cells are then returned to the individual. The cells can be any of a wide range of types including without limitation hemopoietic cells e.g. bone marrow cells macrophages monocytes dendritic cells T cells or B cells fibroblasts epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes or muscle cells.

In addition the antibody may be suitably administered by pulse infusion particularly with declining doses of the antibody. Preferably the dosing is given by injections most preferably intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic.

In another example the anti Notch1 NRR antibody is administered locally e.g. by direct injections when the disorder or location of the tumor permits and the injections can be repeated periodically. The anti Notch1 NRR antibody can also be delivered systemically to the individual or directly to the tumor cells e.g. to a tumor or a tumor bed following surgical excision of the tumor in order to prevent or reduce local recurrence or metastasis.

Alternatively an inhibitory nucleic acid molecule or polynucleotide containing a nucleic acid sequence encoding an anti Notch1 NRR antibody can be delivered to the appropriate cells in the individual. In certain embodiments the nucleic acid can be directed to the tumor itself.

The nucleic acid can be introduced into the cells by any means appropriate for the vector employed. Many such methods are well known in the art Sambrook et al. supra and Watson et al. Recombinant DNA Chapter 12 2d edition Scientific American Books 1992 . Examples of methods of gene delivery include liposome mediated transfection electroporation calcium phosphate DEAE dextran methods gene gun and microinjection.

Dosing can be by any suitable route e.g. by injections such as intravenous or subcutaneous injections depending in part on whether the administration is brief or chronic. The antibody composition of the invention will be formulated dosed and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated the particular mammal being treated the clinical condition of the individual the cause of the disorder the site of delivery of the agent the method of administration the scheduling of administration and other factors known to medical practitioners. The antibody need not be but is optionally formulated with one or more agents currently used to prevent or treat the disorder in question. The effective amount of such other agents depends on the amount of antibodies of the invention present in the formulation the type of disorder or treatment and other factors discussed above. These are generally used in the same dosages and with administration routes as used hereinbefore or about from 1 to 99 of the heretofore employed dosages.

For the prevention or treatment of disease the appropriate dosage of an antibody of the invention when used alone or in combination with other agents such as chemotherapeutic agents will depend on the type of disease to be treated the type of antibody the severity and course of the disease whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes previous therapy the individual s clinical history and response to the antibody and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the individual at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease about 1 g kg to 15 mg kg e.g. 0.1 mg kg 10 mg kg of antibody is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the individual whether for example by one or more separate administrations or by continuous infusion. One typical daily dosage might range from about 1 g kg to 100 mg kg or more depending on the factors mentioned above. For repeated administrations over several days or longer depending on the condition the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. One exemplary dosage of the antibody would be in the range from about 0.05 mg kg to about 10 mg kg. Thus one or more doses of about 0.5 mg kg 2.0 mg kg 4.0 mg kg or 10 mg kg or any combination thereof may be administered to the individual. Such doses may be administered intermittently e.g. every week or every three weeks e.g. such that the individual receives from about two to about twenty e.g. about six doses of the antibody . An initial higher loading dose followed by one or more lower doses may be administered. An exemplary dosing regimen comprises administering an initial loading dose of about 4 mg kg followed by a weekly maintenance dose of about 2 mg kg of the antibody. However other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays.

The anti Notch1 NRR antibodies of the invention are also useful in assays detecting Notch1 expression such as diagnostic or prognostic assays in specific cells or tissues wherein the antibodies are labeled as described below and or are immobilized on an insoluble matrix.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for detection of Notch1 the methods comprising detecting Notch1 anti Notch1 NRR antibody complex in the sample. The term detection as used herein includes qualitative and or quantitative detection measuring levels with or without reference to a control.

In another aspect the invention provides methods for diagnosing a disorder associated with Notch1 expression and or activity the methods comprising detecting Notch1 anti Notch1 NRR antibody complex in a biological sample from an individual having or suspected of having the disorder. In some embodiments the Notch1 expression is increased expression or abnormal undesired expression. In some embodiments the disorder is a tumor cancer and or a cell proliferative disorder. Alternatively or in addition to detecting Notch1 expression in the methods of diagnosis or treatment described herein expression of Notch1 ligands in a biological sample may be determined. Notch1 ligand expression may be determined using methods standard in the art.

In another aspect the invention provides any of the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies described herein wherein the anti Notch1 NRR antibody comprises a detectable label.

In another aspect the invention provides a complex of any of the anti Notch1 NRR antibodies described herein and Notch1. In some embodiments the complex is in vivo or in vitro. In some embodiments the complex comprises a cancer cell. In some embodiments the anti Notch1 NRR antibody is detectably labeled.

Anti Notch1 NRR antibodies can be used for the detection of Notch1 in any one of a number of well known detection assay methods. For example a biological sample may be assayed for Notch1 by obtaining the sample from a desired source admixing the sample with anti Notch1 NRR antibody to allow the antibody to form antibody Notch1 complex with any Notch1 present in the mixture and detecting any antibody Notch1 complex present in the mixture. The biological sample may be prepared for assay by methods known in the art which are suitable for the particular sample. The methods of admixing the sample with antibodies and the methods of detecting antibody Notch1 complex are chosen according to the type of assay used. Such assays include immunohistochemistry competitive and sandwich assays and steric inhibition assays.

Analytical methods for Notch1 all use one or more of the following reagents labeled Notch1 analogue immobilized Notch1 analogue labeled anti Notch1 NRR antibody immobilized anti Notch1 NRR antibody and steric conjugates. The labeled reagents also are known as tracers. 

The label used is any detectable functionality that does not interfere with the binding of Notch1 and anti Notch1 NRR antibody. Numerous labels are known for use in immunoassay examples including moieties that may be detected directly such as fluorochrome chemiluminescent and radioactive labels as well as moieties such as enzymes that must be reacted or derivatized to be detected. Examples of such labels include the radioisotopes P C I H and I fluorophores such as rare earth chelates or fluorescein and its derivatives rhodamine and its derivatives dansyl umbelliferone luceriferases e.g. firefly luciferase and bacterial luciferase U.S. Pat. No. 4 737 456 luciferin 2 3 dihydrophthalazinediones horseradish peroxidase HRP alkaline phosphatase galactosidase glucoamylase lysozyme saccharide oxidases e.g. glucose oxidase galactose oxidase and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase heterocyclic oxidases such as uricase and xanthine oxidase coupled with an enzyme that employs hydrogen peroxide to oxidize a dye precursor such as HRP lactoperoxidase or microperoxidase biotin avidin spin labels bacteriophage labels stable free radicals and the like.

Conventional methods are available to bind these labels covalently to proteins or polypeptides. For instance coupling agents such as dialdehydes carbodiimides dimaleimides bis imidates bis diazotized benzidine and the like may be used to tag the antibodies with the above described fluorescent chemiluminescent and enzyme labels. See for example U.S. Pat. No. 3 940 475 fluorimetry and U.S. Pat. No. 3 645 090 enzymes Hunter et al. 144 945 1962 David et al. 13 1014 1021 1974 Pain et al. 40 219 230 1981 and Nygren 30 407 412 1982 . Preferred labels herein are enzymes such as horseradish peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase. The conjugation of such label including the enzymes to the antibody is a standard manipulative procedure for one of ordinary skill in immunoassay techniques. See for example O Sullivan et al. Methods for the Preparation of Enzyme antibody Conjugates for Use in Enzyme Immunoassay in ed. J. J. Langone and H. Van Vunakis Vol. 73 Academic Press New York N.Y. 1981 pp. 147 166.

Immobilization of reagents is required for certain assay methods. Immobilization entails separating the anti Notch1 NRR antibody from any Notch1 or Notch1 NRR that remains free in solution. This conventionally is accomplished by either insolubilizing the anti Notch1 NRR antibody or Notch1 NRR analogue before the assay procedure as by adsorption to a water insoluble matrix or surface Bennich et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3 720 760 by covalent coupling for example using glutaraldehyde cross linking or by insolubilizing the anti Notch1 NRR antibody or Notch1 NRR analogue afterward e.g. by immunoprecipitation.

The expression of proteins in a sample may be examined using immunohistochemistry and staining protocols. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections has been shown to be a reliable method of assessing or detecting presence of proteins in a sample. Immunohistochemistry IHC techniques utilize an antibody to probe and visualize cellular antigens in situ generally by chromogenic or fluorescent methods. For sample preparation a tissue or cell sample from a mammal typically a human may be used. Examples of samples include but are not limited to cancer cells such as colon breast prostate ovary lung stomach pancreas lymphoma and leukemia cancer cells. The sample can be obtained by a variety of procedures known in the art including but not limited to surgical excision aspiration or biopsy. The tissue may be fresh or frozen. In one embodiment the sample is fixed and embedded in paraffin or the like. The tissue sample may be fixed i.e. preserved by conventional methodology. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the choice of a fixative is determined by the purpose for which the sample is to be histologically stained or otherwise analyzed. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the length of fixation depends upon the size of the tissue sample and the fixative used.

IHC may be performed in combination with additional techniques such as morphological staining and or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two general methods of IHC are available direct and indirect assays. According to the first assay binding of antibody to the target antigen e.g. Notch1 NRR is determined directly. This direct assay uses a labeled reagent such as a fluorescent tag or an enzyme labeled primary antibody which can be visualized without further antibody interaction. In a typical indirect assay unconjugated primary antibody binds to the antigen and then a labeled secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. Where the secondary antibody is conjugated to an enzymatic label a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate is added to provide visualization of the antigen. Signal amplification occurs because several secondary antibodies may react with different epitopes on the primary antibody.

The primary and or secondary antibody used for immunohistochemistry typically will be labeled with a detectable moiety. Numerous labels are available which can be generally grouped into the following categories 

Aside from the sample preparation procedures discussed above further treatment of the tissue section prior to during or following IHC may be desired For example epitope retrieval methods such as heating the tissue sample in citrate buffer may be carried out see e.g. Leong et al. 4 3 201 1996 .

Following an optional blocking step the tissue section is exposed to primary antibody for a sufficient period of time and under suitable conditions such that the primary antibody binds to the target protein antigen in the tissue sample. Appropriate conditions for achieving this can be determined by routine experimentation. The extent of binding of antibody to the sample is determined by using any one of the detectable labels discussed above. Preferably the label is an enzymatic label e.g. HRPO which catalyzes a chemical alteration of the chromogenic substrate such as 3 3 diaminobenzidine chromogen. Preferably the enzymatic label is conjugated to antibody which binds specifically to the primary antibody e.g. the primary antibody is rabbit polyclonal antibody and secondary antibody is goat anti rabbit antibody .

Specimens thus prepared may be mounted and coverslipped. Slide evaluation is then determined e.g. using a microscope and staining intensity criteria routinely used in the art may be employed. Staining intensity criteria may be evaluated as follows 

Typically a staining pattern score of about 2 or higher in an IHC assay is diagnostic and or prognostic. In some embodiments a staining pattern score of about 1 or higher is diagnostic and or prognostic. In other embodiments a staining pattern score of about 3 of higher is diagnostic and or prognostic. It is understood that when cells and or tissue from a tumor or colon adenoma are examined using IHC staining is generally determined or assessed in tumor cell and or tissue as opposed to stromal or surrounding tissue that may be present in the sample .

Other assay methods known as competitive or sandwich assays are well established and widely used in the commercial diagnostics industry.

Competitive assays rely on the ability of a tracer Notch1 NRR analogue to compete with the test sample Notch1 NRR for a limited number of anti Notch1 NRR antibody antigen binding sites. The anti Notch1 NRR antibody generally is insolubilized before or after the competition and then the tracer and Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR bound to the anti Notch1 NRR antibody are separated from the unbound tracer and Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR. This separation is accomplished by decanting where the binding partner was preinsolubilized or by centrifuging where the binding partner was precipitated after the competitive reaction . The amount of test sample Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR is inversely proportional to the amount of bound tracer as measured by the amount of marker substance. Dose response curves with known amounts of Notch1 NRR are prepared and compared with the test results to quantitatively determine the amount of Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR present in the test sample. These assays are called ELISA systems when enzymes are used as the detectable markers.

Another species of competitive assay called a homogeneous assay does not require a phase separation. Here a conjugate of an enzyme with the Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR is prepared and used such that when anti Notch1 NRR antibody binds to the Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR the presence of the anti Notch1 NRR antibody modifies the enzyme activity. In this case the Notch or Notch1 NRR or its immunologically active fragments are conjugated with a bifunctional organic bridge to an enzyme such as peroxidase. Conjugates are selected for use with anti Notch1 NRR antibody so that binding of the anti Notch1 NRR antibody inhibits or potentiates the enzyme activity of the label. This method per se is widely practiced under the name of EMIT.

Steric conjugates are used in steric hindrance methods for homogeneous assay. These conjugates are synthesized by covalently linking a low molecular weight hapten to a small Notch1 NRR fragment so that antibody to hapten is substantially unable to bind the conjugate at the same time as anti Notch1 NRR antibody. Under this assay procedure the Notch1 NRR present in the test sample will bind anti Notch1 NRR antibody thereby allowing anti hapten to bind the conjugate resulting in a change in the character of the conjugate hapten e.g. a change in fluorescence when the hapten is a fluorophore.

Sandwich assays particularly are useful for the determination of Notch 1 Notch1 NRR or anti Notch1 NRR antibodies. In sequential sandwich assays an immobilized anti Notch1 NRR antibody is used to adsorb test sample Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR the test sample is removed as by washing the bound Notch 1 or Notch1 NRR is used to adsorb a second labeled anti Notch1 NRR antibody and bound material is then separated from residual tracer. The amount of bound tracer is directly proportional to test sample Notch1 or Notch1 NRR. In simultaneous sandwich assays the test sample is not separated before adding the labeled anti Notch1 NRR. A sequential sandwich assay using an anti Notch1 NRR monoclonal antibody as one antibody and a polyclonal anti Notch1 NRR antibody as the other is useful in testing samples for Notch1 or Notch1 NRR.

The foregoing are merely exemplary detection assays for Notch1 of Notch1 NRR. Other methods now or hereafter developed that use anti Notch1 NRR antibody for the determination of Notch1 or Notch1 NRR are included within the scope hereof including the bioassays described herein.

In one aspect the invention provides methods to detect e.g. presence or absence of or amount a polynucleotide s e.g. Notch1 polynucleotides in a biological sample from an individual such as a human individual. A variety of methods for detecting polynucleotides can be employed and include for example RT PCR Taqman gene expression assay amplification methods polynucleotide microarray and the like.

Methods for the detection of polynucleotides such as mRNA are well known and include for example hybridization assays using complementary DNA probes such as in situ hybridization using labeled Notch1 riboprobes Northern blot and related techniques and various nucleic acid amplification assays such as RT PCR using complementary primers specific for Notch1 and other amplification type detection methods such as for example branched DNA SPIA single primer isothermal amplification Ribo SPIA SISBA NASBA nucleic acid sequence based amplification TMA transcription mediated amplification and the like .

Biological samples from mammals can be conveniently assayed for e.g. Notch1 mRNAs using Northern blot dot blot or PCR analysis. For example RT PCR assays such as quantitative PCR assays are well known in the art. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention a method for detecting Notch1 mRNA in a biological sample comprises producing cDNA from the sample by reverse transcription using at least one primer amplifying the cDNA so produced using an Notch1 polynucleotide as sense and antisense primers to amplify Notch1 cDNAs therein and detecting the presence or absence of the amplified Notch1 cDNA. In addition such methods can include one or more steps that allow one to determine the amount levels of Notch1 mRNA in a biological sample e.g. by simultaneously examining the levels a comparative control mRNA sequence of a housekeeping gene such as an actin family member . Optionally the sequence of the amplified Notch1 cDNA can be determined.

Probes and or primers may be labeled with a detectable marker such as for example a radioisotope fluorescent compound bioluminescent compound a chemiluminescent compound metal chelator or enzyme. Such probes and primers can be used to detect the presence of Notch1 polynucleotides in a sample and as a means for detecting a cell expressing Notch1 proteins. As will be understood by the skilled artisan a great many different primers and probes may be prepared e.g. based on the sequences provided in herein and used effectively to amplify clone and or determine the presence or absence of and or amount of Notch1 mRNAs.

Optional methods of the invention include protocols comprising detection of polynucleotides such as Notch1 polynucleotide in a tissue or cell sample using microarray technologies. For example using nucleic acid microarrays test and control mRNA samples from test and control tissue samples are reverse transcribed and labeled to generate cDNA probes. The probes are then hybridized to an array of nucleic acids immobilized on a solid support. The array is configured such that the sequence and position of each member of the array is known. For example a selection of genes that have potential to be expressed in certain disease states may be arrayed on a solid support. Hybridization of a labeled probe with a particular array member indicates that the sample from which the probe was derived expresses that gene. Differential gene expression analysis of disease tissue can provide valuable information. Microarray technology utilizes nucleic acid hybridization techniques and computing technology to evaluate the mRNA expression profile of thousands of genes within a single experiment see e.g. WO 01 75166 published Oct. 11 2001 . See for example U.S. Pat. No. 5 700 637 U.S. Pat. No. 5 445 934 U.S. Pat. No. 5 807 522 Lockart Nature Biotechnology 14 1675 1680 1996 and Cheung V. G. et al. Nature Genetics 21 Suppl 15 19 1999 for a discussion of array fabrication. DNA microarrays are miniature arrays containing gene fragments that are either synthesized directly onto or spotted onto glass or other substrates. Thousands of genes are usually represented in a single array. A typical microarray experiment involves the following steps 1 preparation of fluorescently labeled target from RNA isolated from the sample 2 hybridization of the labeled target to the microarray 3 washing staining and scanning of the array 4 analysis of the scanned image and 5 generation of gene expression profiles. Currently two main types of DNA microarrays are being used oligonucleotide usually 25 to 70 mers arrays and gene expression arrays containing PCR products prepared from cDNAs. In forming an array oligonucleotides can be either prefabricated and spotted to the surface or directly synthesized on to the surface in situ .

The Affymetrix GeneChip system is a commercially available microarray system which comprises arrays fabricated by direct synthesis of oligonucleotides on a glass surface. Probe Gene Arrays Oligonucleotides oligos usually 25 mers are directly synthesized onto a glass wafer by a combination of semiconductor based photolithography and solid phase chemical synthesis technologies. Each array contains up to 400 000 different oligonucleotides and each oligonucleotide is present in millions of copies. As oligonucleotide probes are synthesized in known locations on the array the hybridization patterns and signal intensities can be interpreted in terms of gene identity and relative expression levels by the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software. Each gene is represented on the array by a series of different oligonucleotide probes. Each probe pair consists of a perfect match oligonucleotide and a mismatch oligonucleotide. The perfect match probe has a sequence exactly complimentary to the particular gene and thus measures the expression of the gene. The mismatch probe differs from the perfect match probe by a single base substitution at the center base position disturbing the binding of the target gene transcript. This helps to determine the background and nonspecific hybridization that contributes to the signal measured for the perfect match oligonucleotide. The Microarray Suite software subtracts the hybridization intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect match probes to determine the absolute or specific intensity value for each probe set. Probes are chosen based on current information from GenBank and other nucleotide repositories. The sequences are believed to recognize unique regions of the 3 end of the gene. A GeneChip Hybridization Oven rotisserie oven is used to carry out the hybridization of up to 64 arrays at one time. The fluidics station performs washing and staining of the probe arrays. It is completely automated and contains four modules with each module holding one probe array. Each module is controlled independently through Microarray Suite software using preprogrammed fluidics protocols. The scanner is a confocal laser fluorescence scanner which measures fluorescence intensity emitted by the labeled cRNA bound to the probe arrays. The computer workstation with Microarray Suite software controls the fluidics station and the scanner. Microarray Suite software can control up to eight fluidics stations using preprogrammed hybridization wash and stain protocols for the probe array. The software also acquires and converts hybridization intensity data into a presence absence call for each gene using appropriate algorithms. Finally the software detects changes in gene expression between experiments by comparison analysis and formats the output into .txt files which can be used with other software programs for further data analysis.

In some embodiments Notch1 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification is detected. Gene deletion gene mutation or amplification may be measured by any one of a wide variety of protocols known in the art for example by conventional Southern blotting Northern blotting to quantitate the transcription of mRNA Thomas Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 5201 5205 1980 dot blotting DNA analysis or in situ hybridization e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridization FISH using an appropriately labeled probe cytogenetic methods or comparative genomic hybridization CGH using an appropriately labeled probe. In addition these methods may be employed to detect Notch1 ligand gene deletion ligand mutation or gene amplification. As used herein detecting Notch1 expression encompasses detection of Notch1 gene deletion gene mutation or gene amplification.

Additionally one can examine the methylation status of the Notch1 gene in a tissue or cell sample. Aberrant demethylation and or hypermethylation of CpG islands in gene 5 regulatory regions frequently occurs in immortalized and transformed cells and can result in altered expression of various genes. A variety of assays for examining methylation status of a gene are well known in the art. For example one can utilize in Southern hybridization approaches methylation sensitive restriction enzymes which cannot cleave sequences that contain methylated CpG sites to assess the methylation status of CpG islands. In addition MSP methylation specific PCR can rapidly profile the methylation status of all the CpG sites present in a CpG island of a given gene. This procedure involves initial modification of DNA by sodium bisulfite which will convert all unmethylated cytosines to uracil followed by amplification using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA. Protocols involving methylation interference can also be found for example in Current Protocols In Molecular Biology Unit 12 Frederick M. Ausubel et al. eds. 1995 De Marzo et al. Am. J. Pathol. 155 6 1985 1992 1999 Brooks et al. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 7 531 536 1998 and Lethe et al. Int. J. Cancer 76 6 903 908 1998 . As used herein detecting Notch1 expression encompasses detection of Notch1 gene methylation.

The following are examples of the methods and compositions of the invention. It is understood that various other embodiments may be practiced given the general description provided above.

Using a full length clone of human Notch1 GenBank Accession No. NM 017617 as the reference sequence and template a set of 4 PCR primers was designed to amplify a region of Notch1 spanning amino acid V1307 through Q1733 of SEQ ID NO 56. This region includes EGF repeats 34 36 and ends shortly before the transmembrane domain. The 5 primers were designed to add an N terminal Flag Tag immediately upstream of the gene specific sequence. The PCR product corresponding to this domain was cloned into the vector B9.1 for secreted expression from Sf 9 insect cells using the Restriction Independent Cloning RIC procedure. Briefly the primers contained 5 extensions needed to add portions of the restriction sites BamHI and EcoRI to two independent PCR products generated using Pfu polymerase Stratagene . Denaturation and reannealing of these PCR products produced a population of DNA in which 25 of the products contained the appropriate nucleotides to represent BamHI and EcoRI overhangs at their 5 and 3 ends respectively. This DNA mixture was then ligated into B9.1 vector prepared by restriction digestion with BamHI and EcoRI. The resulting construct was verified with regard to DNA sequence and given the name 696.G40.V2.Notch1.V1307 Q1733 N Flag .B9. Vector B9.1 is a modified version of the pACGP67 baculovirus DNA transfer vector BD Pharmingen that contains a Gp 67 secretion signal before the BamHI cloning site a C terminal thrombin cleavage site and His tag.

The construct encoding amino acids V1307 Q1733 of human Notch1 was expressed in Sf 9 cells. Baculovirus stocks were produced using the DNA transfer vectors 101V 1 696.G40.V2.Notch1.V1307 Q1733 N Flag .B9.1 see expression subcloning section . The transfer vector DNA was co transfected into adherent Sf 9 insect cells cultured in ESF921 protein free medium Expression Systems LLC Woodland Calif. at 27 C. with BacPak6 linearized viral DNA BD Clontech Palo Alto Calif. and Bacfectin BD Clontech according to manufacturer s recommendations. The resulting P1 viral stock was amplified twice to produce the P3 viral stock used for large scale protein production. Sf 9 cells cultured in suspension in ESF921 medium were infected at a cell density of 1 to 2 10cells ml using an estimated multiplicity of infection MOI of 0.3 viral particles per cell and were harvested 3 5 days post infection. Sf 9 cells were removed by centrifugation the resulting viral stock was filtered to ensure sterility and 3 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum FBS was added for viral stability. All viral stocks were stored at 4 C. The viral stock containing the 101V 1 696.G40.V2.Notch1.V1307 Q1733 N Flag .B9.1 construct was shown to infect Sf 9 cells efficiently and express the recombinant protein.

The 101V 1 696.G40.V2.Notch1.V1307 Q1733 N Flag .B9.1 construct was expressed in 2 fermentation runs at 11 and 16 liter scales. Sf 9 cells adapted to suspension growth in protein free medium were used for the fermentation runs. Cells were inoculated at a density of 2 10cells ml from a seed bioreactor with similar operating conditions to the production vessel. Fermentations were performed at 27 C. in ESF 921 medium and the dissolved oxygen level was controlled at 50 of air saturation using sparged oxygen on demand and continuous headspace aeration. The bioreactors were operated at 100 rpm agitation using 2 pitched blade impellers or one flat bladed paddle depending on the vessel used. The cells grew to the infection point a density of 2.0 to 2.7 10cells ml over a period of 24 to 48 hours and were then infected at an MOI of 0.5 virus particles cell with the Notch1 polypeptide encoding viral stock. Cells were monitored for signs of infection cessation of growth increase in cell diameter and were grown for a further 65 to 72 hours. The resultant media was chilled harvested by centrifugation and subjected to immediate protein purification.

Supernatant medium from SF9 cells expressing polypeptide encoded by construct 696.G40.V2.Notch1.V1307 Q1733 N Flag .B9.1 was diluted v v 1 4 with ice cold buffer A 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and batch bound for 15 20 minutes to pre equilibrated Ni NTA superflow resin Qiagen Product No. 30450 at a ratio of 2 ml resin per liter of medium. The Ni NTA affinity resin was collected by filtration through a 0.8 m filter Nalgene Product No. 450 0080 and subsequently packed into an appropriate gravity drip column d h 1 10 . The column was washed with 10 column volumes CV of ice cold buffer B 50 mM Hepes pH 7.5 1000 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl and 10 mM imidazole followed by 10 CV of buffer A without PMSF. The column was then eluted with 5 CV of buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole without PMSF . The eluted protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra concentrator 3 000 MWCO and buffer exchanged into storage buffer 10 mM Hepes pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM CaCl using PD 10 columns GE Healthcare according to the manufacturer s recommendations. Protein purity was estimated to be 90 by SDS PAGE with Coomassie staining. The concentration of the purified protein was estimated by Bradford assay Coomassie Plus kit Pierce Cat. No. 23236 using BSA as a standard. Peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry of a tryptic digest of the protein was used to confirm identity.

The sequence spanning amino acids V1307 to Q1723 of mouse Notch1 SEQ ID NO 57 was subcloned and expressed generally as described above for human Notch1 immunogen. This region of mouse Notch1 includes EGF repeats 34 36 and ends shortly before the transmembrane domain. The construct expressing the immunogen is referred to as 64794.G1.Notch1.V1307 Q1723 N Flag C His .pRK5 GNE. The amino acid sequence of the expressed protein for the immunogen used to generate antibodies against the mouse Notch1 NRR is as follows and contains an N terminal FLAG tag and a C terminal His tag 

The construct encoding amino acids V1307 Q1723 of mouse Notch1 was expressed transiently in Freestyle 293 F cells that have been adapted to serum free suspension culture FreeStyle 293 F Cells Invitrogen catalog R790 07 .

Cells were cultured in GIBCO FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium Invitrogen catalog 12338 018 . Cells were maintained at density of 0.3 to 3 10viable cells ml in a shake flask incubated at 37 C. in humidified atmosphere of 8 COon an orbital shaker platform rotating at 125 rpm. The day before transfection the cells were seeded at a density of 5 10viable cells ml. On the day of transfection the cells were checked for viability and density 90 and 1 10cells ml . For each transfection a lipid DNA complex was prepared as follow For 500 ml of cells at 1 10cells ml 500 g of plasmid DNA was slowly added to 40 ml of Opti MEM I Invitrogen catalog 51985 034 500 l of polyethylenimine 1.5 g ml solution PEI Polyethylenimine Linear MW 25 000 Polysciences catalog 9002 98 6 . The mixture was gently mixed and incubated for 20 to 30 minutes at room temperature to allow the DNA lipid complex to form. The DNA lipid complex was then slowly added to the cells and incubated for 3 days before media harvest.

The mNotch1 construct was expressed in two 1 liter runs. The cells were transfected at a density of 0.9 to 1 10cells ml the media was harvested 65 to 75 hours later when cells were at a density of 2.2 to 2.5 10 ml and 75 to 78 viable.

The resultant media was chilled harvested by centrifugation and immediately used for purification of the mouse Notch1 polypeptide containing the NRR.

The immunogen was purified from HEK 293 secreted media by batch mode using anti FLAG M2 agarose Sigma Aldrich product No. A2220 . Anti FLAG M2 agarose in buffer B 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl was added to secreted media containing Complete without EDTA protease inhibitors 20 tablets per liter of media Roche at a ratio of 5 ml agarose per liter of media. The media was then incubated at 4 C. with constant rotation for 3 hours. The anti FLAG agarose was collected by filtration through a 0.8 m filter Nalgene product No. 450 0080 and packed in a gravity flow column BioRad product No. 731 0003 . The agarose was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B and the protein was subsequently eluted with 4 column volumes of 0.1 mg ml FLAG peptide Sigma Aldrich product No. F3290 in buffer B. The eluted mouse Notch1 polypeptide was concentrated in an Amicon Ultra concentrator 10 000 MWCO Millipore product No. UFC 901096 and buffer exchanged into storage buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 5 mM CaCl 5 glycerol using PD 10 columns GE Healthsciences product No. 17 0851 01 . Purity was estimated to be 92 by reversed phase HPLC. Concentration was determined by Bradford assay Coomassie Plus kit Pierce product No. 23236 using BSA as a standard. Protein identification was confirmed by peptide sequencing of a protein tryptic digest by mass spectrometry.

Human Notch1 NRR protein immunogen as described above was used as an antigen. Nunc 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4 C. with target antigen 10 g ml and were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with phage blocking buffer PBST phosphate buffered saline PBS and 1 w v bovine serum albumin BSA and 0.05 v v tween 20 . Antibody phage libraries displaying Fab fragments see e.g. Lee et al. J. Immunol. Meth. 284 119 132 2004 were added to antigen plates and incubated overnight at room temperature. The following day antigen coated plates were washed ten times with PBT PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 and bound phage were eluted with 50 mM HCl and 500 mM NaCl for 30 minutes and neutralized with an equal volume of 1 M Tris base pH7.5 . Recovered phage were amplified in XL 1 Blue cells. During the subsequent selection rounds incubation of antibody phage with the antigen coated plates was reduced to 2 3 hours and the stringency of plate washing was gradually increased.

After 4 rounds of panning significant enrichment was observed. 190 clones were picked to determine whether they specifically bound to human Notch1 NRR and the variable regions of all 190 clones were PCR sequenced to identify unique sequence clones.

To identify the phage antibodies that bound to both human and murine Notch1 NRR all unique clones were tested for binding to human and murine Notch1 by ELISA. The affinities of phage antibodies were ranked using single spot competition ELISA as described below in this Example. The phage antibody IC50 values were further determined using competitive phage binding ELISA essentially described in Lee C. V. et al. 2004 340 1073 93. Briefly NUNC 96 well Maxisorp immunoplates were coated overnight at 4 C. with 1 g ml human NRR1 or murine NRR1 and were blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with blocking buffer PBST PBS and 1 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 . Phage was mixed with serial dilution of human or murine NRR1 at room temperature for 1 hour before the mixture was added to human and murine NRR1 coated plate. Bound phage were detected with anti M13 HRP conjugates developed with TMB substrate for approximately 5 minutes quenched with 1M HPO and read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm. Competition curves were fit with a four parameter non linear regression curve fitting program Kaleidagraph Synergy Software to determine the IC50 values which were calculated as the concentration of antigen in solution binding stage that inhibited 50 of the phage displayed antibody from binding to immobilized antigen.

Antibodies A B and C were reformatted into IgGs by cloning Vand Vregions of individual clones into the LPG3 and LPG4 vector respectively transiently expressing in mammalian CHO cells and purifying with a protein A column. These clones were tested for cross reactivity to one or more of human and murine Notch2 NRR Notch3 NRR and Notch4NRR and for blocking activity using the coculture assay described in Example 5. The results of this characterization are shown in Table 3.

Antibody A was selected for affinity improvement. Phagemid pW0703 derived from phagemid pV0350 2b Lee et al. 340 1073 1093 2004 containing stop codon TAA in all CDR L3 positions and displaying monovalent Fab on the surface of M13 bacteriophage served as the library template for grafting heavy chain variable domains V of clones of interest from the Vlibrary for affinity maturation. Both hard and soft randomization strategies were used for affinity maturation. For hard randomization one light chain library with selected positions of the three light chain CDRs was randomized using amino acids designed to mimic natural human antibodies and the designed DNA degeneracy was as described in Lee et al. 340 1073 1093 2004 . For soft randomization residues at positions 91 94 and 96 of CDR L3 28 31 and 34 35 of CDR H1 50 52 and 53 58 of CDR H2 95 99 and 100A of CDR H3 were targeted and two different combinations of CDR loops L3 H1 H2 and L3 H3 were selected for randomization. To achieve the soft randomization conditions which introduced the mutation rate of approximately 50 at the selected positions the mutagenic DNA was synthesized with 70 10 10 10 mixtures of bases favoring the wild type nucleotides Gallop et al. 37 1233 1251 1994 .

For affinity improvement selection phage libraries were subjected to plate sorting for the first round followed by three rounds of solution sorting. At the first round of plate sorting three libraries were sorted against target human Notch1 NRR ECD coated plate NUNC Maxisorp plate separately with phage input about 3 O.D. ml in 1 BSA and 0.05 Tween 20 for 2 hours at 37 C. After the first round of plate sorting three to four rounds of solution sorting were performed to increase the stringency of selection. For solution sorting 1 O.D. ml phage propagated from the first round of plate sorting were incubated with 20 nM of biotinylated target protein the concentration here is based on parental clone phage IC50 value in 100 l buffer containing 1 Superblock Pierce Biotechnology and 0.05 Tween20 for 30 minutes at room temperature. The mixture was further diluted 10 with 1 Superblock and 100 l well was applied to neutravidin coated wells 5 g ml for 15 minutes at room temperature with gentle shaking such that biotinylated target bound phage. The wells were washed with PBS 0.05 Tween 20 ten times. To determine background binding control wells containing phage with targets that were not biotinylated were captured on neutravidin coated plates. Bound phage was eluted with 0.1N HCl for 20 minutes neutralized by 1 10 volume of 1M Tris pH11 titered and propagated for the next round. Next two or three more rounds of solution sorting were carried out together with two methods of increasing selection stringency. The first of which is for on rate selection by decreasing biotinylated target protein concentration from 2 nM to 0.1 nM and the second of which is for off rate selection by adding excess amounts of non biotinylated target protein 100 1000 fold more to compete off weaker binders. Also the phage input was decreased 0.1 0.5 O.D ml to lower background phage binding.

Colonies were picked from the third and fourth round screens and grown overnight at 37 C. in 150 l well of 2YT media with 50 g ml carbenicillin and 1E10 ml KO7 in 96 well plate Falcon . From the same plate a colony of XL 1 infected parental phage was picked as control. 96 well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 100 l well of target protein 2 g ml in PBS at 4 C. overnight or room temperature for 2 hours. The plates were blocked with 65 l of 1 BSA for 30 min and 40 l of 1 Tween 20 for another 30 minutes.

The phage supernatant was diluted 1 10 in ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay buffer PBS with 0.5 BSA 0.05 Tween20 with or without 10 nM target protein in 100 l total volume and incubated at least 1 hour at room temperature in an F plate NUNC . 75 l of mixture with or without target protein was transferred side by side to the target protein coated plates. The plate was gently shaken for 15 min to allow the capture of unbound phage to the target protein coated plate. The plate was washed at least five times with PBS 0.05 Tween 20. The binding was quantified by adding horseradish peroxidase HRP conjugated anti M13 antibody in ELISA buffer 1 5000 and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The plates were washed with PBS 0.05 Tween 20 at least five times. Next 100 l well of a 1 1 ratio of 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine TMB Peroxidase substrate and Peroxidase Solution B HO Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories Gaithersburg Md. was added to the well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 l 1M Phosphoric Acid HPO to each well and allowed to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature. The OD optical density of the yellow color in each well was determined using a standard ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. The OD reduction was calculated by the following equation. ODreduction ODof wells with competitor ODof well with no competitor 100

In comparison to the ODreduction of the well of parental phage 100 clones that had the ODreduction lower than 50 were picked for sequence analysis. Unique clones were selected for phage preparation to determine binding affinity phage IC50 by comparison with parental clones Table 4 .

To further characterize the binding affinity and binding kinetics of the anti Notch1 NRR Mabs surface plasmon resonance SRP measurement with a BIAcore 3000 was used BIAcore Inc. Piscataway N.J. . Briefly carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips CM5 BIAcore Inc. were activated with N ethyl N 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS according to the supplier s instructions. Rabbit anti human antibody Pierce was diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8 into 20 g ml before injection at a flow rate of 5 l minute to achieve approximately 3000 response units RU of coupled antibody. Next 1M ethanolamine was injected to block unreacted groups. Anti NRR1 mab formatted as a full length IgG was captured by rabbit anti human IgG coated on the chips to achieve approximately 200 response units RU . For kinetics measurements two fold serial dilutions of human NRR1 ECD or murine NRR1 ECD proteins 3.9 nM to 500 nM were injected in PBT buffer PBS with 0.05 Tween 20 at 25 C. with a flow rate of 30 l min. Association rates k and dissociation rates k were calculated using a simple one to one Langmuir binding model BIAcore Evaluation Software version 3.2 . The equilibrium dissociation constant K was calculated as the ratio k k.

The results of this experiment are shown in Table 5. NA signifies that the measurement was not performed.

To examine the binding determinant of Antibodies A A 1 and A 2 binding experiments were conducting using human and mouse Notch1 fragments.

 2 hFLAG NRR His6 102V contains amino acids E1447 Q1733 of human Notch1 a FLAG tag a HIS tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The Notch1 portion includes sequences from LNR A LNR B LNR C HD N HD C. This protein does not include any EGF like repeat sequences.

 3 hFLAG HD His6 103V contains amino acids R1568 to Q1733 of human Notch1 a FLAG tag a thrombin cleavage site and a HIS tag. The Notch1 portion contains sequences from HD N and HD C. This protein does not contain any EGF like repeat sequences and does not contain the three LNR regions.

 5 mEGF34 NRR L1597H FLAG TEV Fc contains amino acids V1307 to Q1723 of mouse Notch1 with a L1597H mutation a Flag tag an Fc tag and a TEV protease site. The L1597H mutation results in activation of Notch1 and is described in e.g. Weng et al. Science 306 269 271 2004.

1 g ml of proteins in PBS pH 7.4 were coated on ELISA plates Nunc Maxisorp at 4 C. overnight. Plates were blocked with Casein blocker in PBS phosphate buffered saline Pierce for one hour at room temperature. Serial 3 fold dilutions of anti Notch1 NRR IgGs or irrelevant IgG in PBST buffer PBT buffer PBS 0.05 v v Tween 20 with 0.5 w v BSA were added to the plates and incubated for one hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed with PBST and bound antibodies were detected with peroxidase conjugated goat anti human Fab specific IgG Sigma . TMB substrate 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine was used and absorbance at 650 nM was read using a standard ELISA plate reader. Absorbance was plotted against concentrations of IgGs using Kaleidagraph Synergy Software .

The result of this experiment is shown in Antibody A hIgG1 12B Antibody A 1 hIgG1 and 12C Antibody A 2 hIgG1 . Antibodies A A 1 and A 2 bound polypeptides hFLAG EGF34 NRR His6 101V hFLAG NRR His6 102V hFLAG HD His6 103V mFLAG EGF34 NRR His6 and did not bind control polypeptides lacking Notch1 sequences. These results demonstrate that the Notch1 NRR domain is sufficient for binding of Antibody A Antibody A 1 and Antibody A 2. Antibodies A A 1 and A 2 also bound protein mEGF34 NRR L1597H FLAG TEV Fc which contains Notch1 activating mutation L1597H. This result demonstrates that the antibodies are capable of binding to a mutant Notch1 receptor.

A Notch1 reporter assay also termed the co culture assay herein was performed to measure the ability of an anti Notch1 NRR antibody to inhibit Notch signaling. Briefly the assay involved the following steps 

 1 NIH 3T3 cells expressing human Notch1 were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid that responds to Notch signaling 

 4 The level of Notch signaling was assessed by measuring luciferase activity expressed from the reporter plasmid.

 1 NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing human Notch1 N1 were plated in a black walled clear welled 96 well plate at 5000 cells per well in DMEM high glucose medium containing 10 FBS and no antibiotics. The cells were incubated at 37 C. for 16 hours with 5 CO. The medium was then changed to DMEM with no serum and cells were transfected with 100 ng well of a TP 1 CSL promoter responsive to Notch activation luciferase plasmid see e.g. Minoguchi et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 17 2679 2687 1997 and 5 ng ml of the pRL CMV luciferase reporter Promega . The transfection was continued for 6 hours at 37 C. 5 COwith serum added back at the beginning of hour 4.

 2 At the end of hour six the medium containing the transfection reagents was removed by aspiration and 50 A of DMEM FBS was added with the following A. Fresh Medium later to receive the control NIH 3T3 parental cells for a mock stimulation B. Fresh Medium DMEM with 10 FBS C. Human IgG Isotype control antibody at 400 ng ml anti Notch1 NRR Antibody A at four different concentrations D. 16 ng ml E. 80 ng ml F. 400 ng ml G. 2000 ng ml H. Anti Notch1 NRR Antibody A at 400 ng ml pre incubated with purified Notch1 NRR protein 5 g per well for 30 minutes I. Human IgG Isotype control antibody at 400 ng ml with Notch1 NRR protein treated as in H J. anti Notch1 NRR Antibody A at 400 ng ml pre incubated for 30 minutes with BSA protein added back 6.5 g well K. Compound E a gamma secretase inhibitor CHFNO Seiffert et al. J. Biol. Chem. 275 34086 2000 at 1 M and L. DMSO control Compound E solvent only . The reagents listed above were incubated with the transfected NIH 3T3 Notch1 cells for 1 hour at 37 C. 5 CO.

5000 NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing human Jagged1 ligand were added to each well except for J in which the cells were the NIH 3T3 parental line. The plate was then incubated at 37 C. 5 COfor 23 hours.

Firefly TP1 and pRL CMV luciferase activities were measured with the Dual Glo Luciferase kit Promega . The levels of Notch signaling were calculated by dividing the Firefly reading by the reading and averaging 8 replicates of each condition. The results are shown in where the error bars represent the standard deviation of the replicates.

As shown in Antibody A is a potent Notch 1 inhibitor. Antibody A inhibits Notch signaling as measured using the TP1 Luc reporter. A titration of the antibody is shown at 400 ng ml of antibody Notch signaling was inhibited to 18 of the control on level the level of signaling observed using the isotype control at 400 ng ml . Further addition of soluble NRR protein but not the BSA control relieved the antibody induced block to signaling demonstrating that antibody inhibition of signaling was due to an antibody Notch1 NRR interaction. Compound E a gamma secretase inhibitor was used as a control to demonstrate inhibition. As another control replacing the Jagged1 expressing cells with parental cells NIH 3T3 alone no Jagged1 failed to induce complete signaling demonstrating that signaling requires Jagged1.

The co culture assay method used above was used to compare Antibody A to its affinity matured counterparts Antibody A 1 Antibody A 2 and Antibody A 3 with treatment at several concentrations. As revealed at 80 ng ml of antibody Antibody A 2 and Antibody A 3 showed more potent blocking of Notch signaling than did Antibody A .

Mouse C2C12 myoblasts differentiate into myotubes when treated with differentiation medium. Co culture with Jagged1 ligand expressing cells inhibits differentiation by stimulating Notch signaling. As detailed below consistent with the ability of Antibody A to inhibit Notch1 signaling addition of Antibody A restored differentiation. As a control a gamma secretase inhibitor also restored differentiation.

In particular mouse C2C12 myoblast cells were plated in a 24 well tissue culture dish with a sterile round 10 mm cover slip in the bottom at 2.5 10cells per ml using 1 ml per well. Cells were allowed to attach and grow for 22 hours in growth medium DMEM with 10 FBS at 37 C. 5 CO. The growth medium was then aspirated and differentiation medium DM was added DMEM with 6 Horse Serum . Cells were treated with A. DM alone B. DM with 3T3 J1 cells C. DM with NIH 3T3 Jagged1 and Human IgG Isotype control antibody D. DM with 3T3 J1 cells and Antibody A at 200 ng ml E. DM with NIH 3T3 Jagged1 cells and DMSO vehicle F. DM with 3T3 J1 cells and Compound E gamma secretase inhibitor at 1 uM. Cells were incubated at 37 C. 5 COunder these conditions for four days. Cover slips were retrieved and cells were fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde and permeablized with 0.2 Triton X 100 in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10 FBS in PBS. An antibody recognizing Myosin Heavy Chain Millipore Anti Myosin HC clone A4.1025 ascites and a goat anti mouse IgG H L secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 Molecular Probes was used to stain the differentiated myotubes. DAPI was used to counter stain the nuclei. Images of three different fields were taken for each condition. A subset of the images is shown in . Metamorph software Molecular Devices was used to count the number of nuclei and the area of Alexa 488 stain. The area of Alexa 488 stain was divided by the number of nuclei averaged and graphed. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the triplicate images. These results are shown in .

A luciferase reporter co culture assay was performed using NIH 3T3 cells transiently transfected with TP 1 and pRL CMV plasmids encoding the L1594P mutant Notch1 receptor DelPEST mutant Notch1 receptor and wild type wt Notch1 receptor using Lipofectamine and Lipofectamine Plus Reagent Invitrogen and NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing human Jagged 1 essentially as described above. The L1594P mutation denotes a leucine to proline mutation at amino acid aa 1594 in the HD N domain see e.g. Weng et al. Science 306 269 271 2004 . DelPEST denotes a carboxyl terminal deletion of the PEST domain starting at aa 2473 see e.g. Malecki et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 26 4642 4651 2006 . Consistent with published results the results shown in confirm that both the L1594P and DelPEST mutations activate Notch1 signaling. Relative to the negative control using an irrelevant phage derived monoclonal antibody of the same isotype Antibody A inhibited signaling through each of the three receptors in a dose dependent manner. The gamma secretase inhibitor Compound E CmpE dissolved in DMSO was used as a positive control for inhibition of Notch signaling. The solid black bars show results obtained using a control antibody at 2000 ng ml the coarsely dotted bars show results obtained using Antibody A at 80 ng ml the finely striped bars show results obtained using Antibody A at 400 ng ml the coarsely striped bars show results obtained using antibody Antibody A at 2000 ng ml the cross hatched bars show results obtained using Compound E at 10 M and the finely dotted bars show results obtained using DMSO the vehicle for Compound E . The results for each condition were measured in eight replicates and then expressed as the mean value with error bars indicating the standard deviation.

The effect of anti Notch1 NRR antibodies on vascularization and angiogenesis was investigated using a HUVEC cell sprouting assay. This assay is similar to that described by Nakatsu et al. 66 2 102 112 2003 . HUVEC cells were coated onto Cytodex 3 beads Amersham Biosciences Piscataway N.J. which were then implanted in a fibrin gel. Human skin fibroblasts were plated over the fibrin gel layer which was then covered by tissue culture medium. Vessel sprouting from the HUVEC cells was examined 4 to 9 days later. Similar to results observed for anti D114 treatment anti Notch1 NRR treatment caused a notable increase in vessel sprouting and length as shown in . Results are shown for cells treated with PBS as a control or with Antibody A or A 2 as indicated. Anti Notch1 NRR disrupts vascularization and angiogenesis by increasing vessel sprouting and vasculature network density.

The effect of anti Notch1 NRR antibodies on vascularization and angiogenesis was also investigated using a corneal pocket assay of angiogenesis. As indicated by the protocol summarized in rodent corneas which are normally avascular were implanted with a VEGF pellet 63 132 390 to induce angiogenesis or left untreated as a negative control 381 . Two corneas were subsequently treated with anti D114 as a positive control for increases in vascular network density 132 or with Antibody A 2 390 . Vessels were visualized with an anti CD31 based immunofluorescent staining technique red . As shown in anti Notch1 NRR treatment significantly increased vascular network density. Vessels in corneas treated as described above for were also perfused with FITC dextran green to assess flow through the vessels. Perfusion through both the anti D114 and anti Notch1 NRR treated vessels was restricted as shown in .

The effect of anti Notch1 NRR antibodies in a mouse retinal model of angiogenesis was also investigated. As indicated by the protocol summarized in mouse retinas from P1 postnatal day 1 or P3 postnatal day 3 mice were treated with the indicated concentrations of anti ragweed antibody as a negative control or Antibody A 2. Retinas were harvested at P5 postnatal day 5 . Isolectin B4 was used to visualize the vasculature. Consistent with the results shown in anti Notch1 NRR treatment increased vasculature density and generated a hypersprouting phenotype. Mouse retinas treated as described above for were stained with DAPI to visualize nuclear DNA. As shown in anti Notch1 NRR treatment caused an increase in the number of nuclei suggesting a possible increase in proliferation.

The effect of anti Notch1 NRR antibodies on tumor growth was investigated using an in vivo mouse model. Immunodeficient mice Balb C Nu Nu were used in a xenograft study with the HM7 cell line colon adenocarcinoma . Five million cells were implanted in 0.1 ml of Matrigel BD Biosciences San Jose Calif. which was used to inoculate mice subcutaneously. Tumors were allowed to grow to approximately 250 300 cubic millimeters before the mice were randomly grouped into each of the three treatment classes to begin dosing as indicated. Treatment with Antibody A 2 arrested tumor growth as shown in . Anti ragweed and anti VEGF serve as negative and positive controls respectively. In an experiment similar to that described above for various doses of Antibody A 2 were tested for the ability to arrest or slow tumor growth. The results are shown in . In an experiment similar to that described above for except that the CALU6 cell line non small cell lung cancer cell line was used instead of the HM7 cell line Antibody A 2 was found to decrease tumor volume as shown in . Taken together the results shown in indicate that anti Notch1 NRR antibodies inhibit tumor growth.

In an experiment similar to that described above for treatment with Antibody A 2 was found to cause weight loss in a dose dependent manner as shown in . In an experiment similar to that described above for the clearance of Antibody A 2 was examined by measuring the concentration of human Fc in the sera of treated mice at the indicated time points. The results are shown in .

The effect of anti Notch1 NRR antibodies on the cells in the mouse intestinal tract was investigated. Intestines were isolated from control vehicle and treated mice after approximately 10 days of dosing with Antibody A 2 every three to four days. The samples were stained with haematoxylin and eosin plus either Alcian Blue for mucin blue as a marker for secretory cells or anti Ki 67 brown antibody based immunohistochemical staining procedure for the commonly used proliferative marker protein Ki 67. show examples of crypts and villi from the small intestines or large intestines respectively of mice treated with a control antibody vehicle or with Antibody A 2 at the indicated concentration. The results show that anti Notch1 NRR arrests proliferation of transit amplifying cells and increases the number of secretory cells including goblet and Paneth cells.

The effects of anti Notch1 NRR and the gamma secretase inhibitors DAPT and Compound E CmpE on a panel of cancer cell lines were examined. The cell lines indicated in x axis were grown in the presence or absence of Antibody A 2 DAPT CpmE or DMSO control vehicle for gamma secretase inhibitors as indicated and viability of the cells was assessed using the CellTiter Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Promega Madison Wis. . This assay determines the number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of ATP present which is an indication of metabolically active cells. Luminescence is quantified as relative luminescent units in y axis . As shown in MT 3 reported to be a breast carcinoma line and OVCAR 3 an ovarian cancer cell line displayed reduced ATP levels indicating reduced proliferation and or increased cell death following incubation in the presence of DAPT CmpE or anti Notch1 NRR.
