This application is related to and claims priority benefits from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 835 666 the 666 application filed on Jun. 17 2013 entitled FOLDABLE ARMREST PRINCIPALLY FOR AIRCRAFT PASSENGER SEAT. The 666 application is hereby incorporated in its entirety by this reference.

The field of the invention relates to passenger seat assemblies. More specifically it relates to armrests of passenger seat assemblies.

Many passenger seat assemblies such as those on passenger aircrafts buses trains and the like are arranged so that each passenger seat contains one or more armrests. On many business class seats the armrest comprises a telescopic assembly. In these arrangements the armrest deploys and moves vertically from a stowed position adjacent the seat. This telescopic armrest is composed of many moving parts and can be difficult to assemble. Furthermore the armrest and any needed mechanisms for deployment take up significant space that can be otherwise used as additional stowage.

Thus there may exist a need for an improved armrest assembly having a design that may be stowed in a manner that is out of the view and useable area of passengers and may be deployed through a series of minimal moving parts that are easy to assemble and require minimal space.

According to certain embodiments of the present invention a pivotable armrest comprises a first pivot assembly comprising a housing and a pivot plate pivotally coupled to the housing a second pivot assembly comprising a coupling projection extending from a circumferential surface of the pivot plate an armpad pivotally coupled to the coupling projection and the housing comprising a receptacle.

In some embodiments the receptacle partially surrounds the circumferential surface of the pivot plate and is shaped to limit a rotational path of the pivot plate by engaging at least one location on the circumferential surface of the pivot plate. The circumferential surface of the pivot plate may comprise a straight region having a first end and a second end. The receptacle may comprise a projection that is configured to engage the first end of the straight region when the pivotable armrest is rotated into a stowed position. The projection may also be configured to engage the second end of the straight region when the pivotable armrest is rotated into a deployed or semi deployed position. In certain embodiments the pivot plate has an overall shape of a circle segment.

In some embodiments the armpad comprises a longitudinal axis arranged in an elongated direction of the armpad and a lateral axis arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal axis and extending in a plane parallel to at least one of an upper surface and a lower surface of the armpad. In these embodiments the coupling projection and the longitudinal axis of the armpad are substantially vertically oriented and the lateral axis of the armpad is substantially parallel with a receptacle surface of the housing when the pivotable armrest is in a stowed position.

In certain embodiments the coupling projection and the longitudinal axis of the armpad are substantially horizontally oriented and the lateral axis of the armpad is substantially parallel to a horizontal plane when the pivotable armrest is in a deployed position.

In additional embodiments the coupling projection and the longitudinal axis of the armpad are substantially horizontally oriented and the lateral axis of the armpad is substantially parallel with the receptacle surface of the housing when the pivotable armrest is in a semi deployed position.

In some embodiments the housing is coupled to an interior surface of a privacy shell positioned proximate a passenger seat.

The subject matter of embodiments of the present invention is described here with specificity to meet statutory requirements but this description is not necessarily intended to limit the scope of the claims. The claimed subject matter may be embodied in other ways may include different elements or steps and may be used in conjunction with other existing or future technologies. This description should not be interpreted as implying any particular order or arrangement among or between various steps or elements except when the order of individual steps or arrangement of elements is explicitly described.

The described embodiments of the invention provide pivotable armrests for passenger seats. While the pivotable armrests are discussed for use with aircraft seats they are by no means so limited. Rather embodiments of the pivotable armrests may be used in passenger seats or other seats of any type or otherwise as desired.

According to certain embodiments of the present invention as shown in a pivotable armrest comprises a first pivot assembly also known as a longitudinal pivot and a second pivot assembly also known as a transverse pivot . The first pivot assembly and or the second pivot assembly may be formed of materials including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel aramid fibers polycarbonate polypropylene other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials as needed or desired.

In certain embodiments the first pivot assembly comprises a stationary housing and a pivot plate . The housing may further comprise a base and a lip . The base may be formed from a substantially flat layer of material having a mounting surface and a receptacle surface . The lip may be formed from another layer of material that is connected to the receptacle surface of the base . The lip is shaped so that it covers a first portion of the base while leaving a second portion of the base exposed. As a result the exposed area of the base forms a receptacle having a bounded section formed by an edge of the lip and an unbounded section that is located between ends of the edge . In certain embodiments the lip may be a separate material that is adhered to the receptacle surface . In other embodiments the base and the lip may be integrally formed from a single piece of material by removing a portion of the base to form the receptacle .

The pivot plate comprises a substantially flat pivot surface and an outer surface . The pivot surface of the pivot plate is pivotally coupled to the housing proximate the receptacle surface of the base via a pivot shaft or other similar fastener so that the pivot plate rotates within a longitudinal plane that is substantially parallel to the receptacle surface . The degree of rotation of the pivot plate may be controlled by the circumferential shape of the pivot plate and the shape of the edge that forms the bounded section of the receptacle . For example in certain embodiments the pivot plate may have an outer circumferential surface comprising a circular region and a straight region . In geometric terms the pivot plate may have an overall shape of a major or minor circle segment that is enclosed by the circumferential shape of the circular region and the line or chord formed by the straight region . The length of the arc formed by the circular region which is controlled at least in part by the placement of the straight region relative to the diameter of the pivot plate controls the rotational distance between a first end and a second end of the straight region .

The edge of the lip may include at least one projection that is configured to contact the first end and or the second end of the straight region at the respective ends of the rotational path of the pivot plate . For example as best shown in a single projection is positioned at an upper end of the edge . An upper side of the projection is configured to contact the first end of the straight region when the rotation of the pivot plate reaches a first end of the rotational path which coincides with a stowed position as shown in of the pivotable armrest explained in more detail below. In these embodiments a lower side of the projection is configured to contact the second end of the straight region when the rotation of the pivot plate reaches a second end of the rotational path which coincides with a semi deployed as shown in and deployed as shown in positions of the pivotable armrest also explained in more detail below.

In other embodiments among other possibilities the length of the rotational path of the pivot plate may be adjusted through the addition of a second projection below the location of the first projection widening or narrowing the size of the single projection and or moving the location of the straight region closer to or farther from the diameter of the pivot plate .

In certain embodiments as best shown in a coupling projection may be incorporated into the circumferential surface of the pivot plate . For example the coupling projection may be positioned along the circumferential surface between the circular region and the first end of the straight region so that the coupling projection is always positioned within the unbounded section of the receptacle .

An additional housing may be included proximate the outer surface of the pivot plate to enclose the pivot plate as a way to avoid potential pinch points that may be created by the rotation of the pivot plate . The housing may include an open slot through which the coupling projection may extend and the slot may be sized to mate with the unbounded section of the receptacle so as to not impede with the rotational movement of the coupling projection and or the pivot plate .

The coupling projection may comprise a pivot shaft or other pivotable coupling device so that the combination forms the second pivot assembly . In certain embodiments as shown in an armpad is pivotally coupled to the pivot shaft so that the armpad may laterally rotate relative to the coupling projection . The armpad may have a generally rectilinear shape with a longitudinal axis X arranged in the elongated direction of the armpad and a lateral axis Y arranged perpendicular to the longitudinal axis X and extending in a plane parallel to at least one of an lower surface and an upper surface of the armpad .

The armpad may be formed of materials including but not limited to aluminum stainless steel aramid fibers polycarbonate polypropylene other metallic materials composite materials or other similar materials as needed or desired. In certain embodiments a cushion may be attached to one or more surfaces of the armpad to provide additional passenger comfort during use.

The coupling projection may further comprise one or more stops that limit the lateral rotation of the armpad between a first end of a rotation path that coincides with the stowed as shown in and semi deployed as shown in positions of the pivotable armrest explained in more detail below and a second end of the rotational path that coincides with the deployed position as shown in of the pivotable armrest also explained in more detail below.

In certain embodiments the pivotable armrest is attached to an interior surface of a monument or privacy shell positioned proximate a passenger seat . In particular the mounting surface of the base may be coupled to the interior surface via double brackets and fasteners. However a person of ordinary skill in the relevant art will understand that any suitable connection means may be used including but not limited to screws bolts rivets or other mechanical or chemical fasteners. Furthermore the pivotable armrest may be used with any passenger seat design including those where the pivotable armrest may attach directly to a seat frame instead of a monument or privacy shell .

In use the pivotable armrest is configured to rotate between the stowed position as shown in the semi deployed position as shown in and the deployed position as shown in .

To reach the stowed position the pivot plate is rotated until the first end of the straight region contacts the upper side of the projection . In this position the coupling projection is substantially vertically oriented which causes the longitudinal axis X of the armpad to also be substantially vertically oriented.

In the stowed position the armpad is laterally rotated into the first position of the rotation path of the second pivot assembly wherein the lateral axis Y of the armpad is also oriented substantially parallel to the receptacle surface of the housing . In this orientation a lower surface of the armpad faces toward the interior surface of the monument or privacy shell and an upper surface of the armpad faces away from the interior surface . In other embodiments the converse orientation of the armpad may be employed wherein the lower surface of the armpad faces away the interior surface and the upper surface of the armpad faces toward the interior surface . By orienting the armpad in this manner in the stowed position the amount of stowage space required for the pivotable armrest is minimized to accommodate the thickness of the armpad and any combined thicknesses of the stationary housing pivot plate and or additional housing that may have that exceed the thickness of the armpad rather than the width of the lower and upper surfaces of the armpad .

To transition the pivotable armrest into the semi deployed position the pivot plate is rotated so that the first end of the straight region is no longer in contact with the upper side of the projection and rotation continues until the second end of the straight region contacts the lower side of the projection . At this point the coupling projection is substantially horizontally oriented which causes the longitudinal axis X of the armpad to also be substantially horizontally oriented as best illustrated in .

In the semi deployed position the armpad remains laterally rotated into the first position of the rotation path of the second pivot assembly as described above with respect to the stowed position. The only difference is that the lower surface or upper surface in a converse arrangement has rotated away from the stowed position proximate the interior surface so that the lower surface or upper surface in a converse arrangement is no longer facing the interior surface .

To transition the pivotable armrest into the deployed position the armpad is laterally rotated into the second position of the rotation path of the second pivot assembly wherein the lateral axis Y of the armpad is oriented substantially parallel to a horizontal plane. In this orientation the lower surface of the armpad faces downward and the upper surface of the armpad faces upward. In other embodiments the converse orientation of the armpad may be employed wherein the lower surface of the armpad faces upward and the upper surface of the armpad faces downward. In any event the armpad is oriented in the deployed position so that the surface that is intended to contact a passenger s arm is oriented upward whether that be the upper surface or the lower surface .

Different arrangements of the components depicted in the drawings or described above as well as components and steps not shown or described are possible. Similarly some features and sub combinations are useful and may be employed without reference to other features and sub combinations. Embodiments of the invention have been described for illustrative and not restrictive purposes and alternative embodiments will become apparent to readers of this patent. Accordingly the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above or depicted in the drawings and various embodiments and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the claims below.
