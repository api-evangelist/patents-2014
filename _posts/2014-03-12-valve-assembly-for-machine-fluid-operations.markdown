Machines such as large capacity diesel engine systems used in connection with construction equipment earth moving equipment transportation equipment e.g. locomotives and the like are often implemented in adverse operating conditions. Typical operating conditions for such equipment can require extensive maintenance repair and overhaul work to sustain the equipment and its components including the engine systems. As a consequence of adverse equipment operating conditions certain equipment components may be exhausted long before the expected end of their useful lives. This component exhaustion can occur despite efforts to ensure proper component installation and maintenance including periodic maintenance of equipment oil supply and lubrication systems for example. Extensive and premature wear of large capacity diesel engines for example can be caused by a combination of factors including inadequate lubrication of components prior to engine ignition failure to adhere to prescribed maintenance schedules failure to collect and analyze data associated with equipment operation system malfunction general misuse of the equipment and other factors.

Methods and systems for data collection and analysis are therefore needed that can extend the useful life of equipment components. Component movement and interaction during various periods of equipment operation can impact the continued effective operation and useful life expectancy of the engine system. In connection with operation and or maintenance of the engine system during such periods important data such as for example temperature oil pressure time to evacuate an oil sump and historical data regarding previous engine ignition cycles can be collected and analyzed. Conventional equipment methods and systems however typically do not collect and analyze data during various stages of machine operation to assist in operation or maintenance of the machine and its components.

In addition in the context of performing machine maintenance there is often a need for performing multiple evacuations and or refills of fluid receptacles. Such fluid receptacles may include for example and without limitation oil sumps transmission fluid reservoirs fuel tanks waste receiving receptacles hydraulic fluid reservoirs and other like receptacles associated with machine operation and maintenance. In many situations such fluid evacuation and fluid refill processes may not be timed and or sequenced to maximize performance of maintenance on a machine. Furthermore data crucial to scheduling maintenance and monitoring performance issues with machines are often neither collected nor analyzed during fluid evacuations fluid refills or other fluid processing activities.

Many industrial machines and equipment have requirements for fluid exchanges. Examples of these fluid exchanges include changing the oil in motors and engines or hydraulic fluid in presses and lifting equipment. Countless other examples exist but what is generally common to these machines or equipment is the fact that the outlet port is inconveniently located. Typically this is the result of having to remove the fluid from a sump or drainage point that is located at the bottom of the machine to utilize gravity flow.

The tasks of removing and refilling machine fluids may be difficult or time consuming because of the usually inconvenient location of the fittings required to perform these fluid operations. Some machines however may include fluid circulation pumps that are installed and applied in locations that are external to the machine. Also some equipment may be provided with one or more internally or externally located pre lubrication devices that permit oil or fluid to commence circulation prior to the activation of the primary equipment or engine on which the pre lubrication device is installed. Illustrative of such devices is the pre lubrication device shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4 502 431 which is incorporated herein by reference and which is typically fitted to a diesel engine used in power equipment trucks and or heavy equipment.

Furthermore in certain off road heavy equipment reservoirs containing fluids may contain scores of gallons of fluid which can consume unacceptably long periods of time to drain and refill. For example in some equipment an engine oil sump or reservoir may contain up to 150 gallons of oil a transmission sump may contain up to 100 gallons of transmission fluid and a separate reservoir of hydraulic fluid to power hydraulic functions may contain up to 500 gallons of hydraulic fluid. Downtime costs for relatively large machines and other pieces of equipment can be substantial. Accordingly if downtime for maintenance in such machines can be minimized then substantial economic benefits often result. In addition there are numerous comparatively smaller devices and motors for which access to fluid discharge ports is difficult to reach or in which the fluid must be assisted for removal. Examples include marine engines and the like. In some small sized pieces of equipment the engine must be inverted to remove oil for example or other fluids. For example see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 526 782 5 257 678 and 4 977 978.

Thus what are needed are improved methods and systems for performing fluid maintenance functions such as fluid evacuation and refill processes for example in connection with machine operation and maintenance. What are also needed are enhanced methods and systems for sequencing and timing fluid operations while collecting storing and or analyzing data pertinent to the performance and results of such fluid transfer operations.

The term machine as applied herein may include any equipment suitable for use in accordance with the present methods and systems. Examples of machines as applied herein can include without limitation a lubrication system engines diesel engines large scale diesel engines motors rotating equipment generators aircraft engines emergency machines emergency generators compressors equipment that includes a machine e.g. such as mining equipment construction equipment marine equipment aircraft and the like and other like machines. In various portions of the disclosure herein the example of an engine is employed for convenience of disclosure in describing various embodiments and aspects of the present systems and methods. It can be appreciated by those skilled in the art however that such use of engine as one example of a type of machine is intended merely for said convenience of disclosure and is not intended to limit the scope of application of the present systems and methods.

The term evacuation as applied to the systems and methods disclosed herein may include evacuation of any portion of a fluid of a machine a receptacle a reservoir or other like fluid retaining system or apparatus. Similarly the term refill as applied to the systems and methods disclosed herein may include refill of any portion of the fluid capacity of a machine receptacle reservoir or other like fluid retaining system or apparatus.

The term valve system as applied to the systems and methods disclosed herein may include any combination of valves pipes disconnects adapters and other like structural components configured for performing one or more fluid refill and or fluid evacuation processes. Examples of valves included within a valve system may include without limitation single position valves multi position valves e.g. such as junction block assemblies or five way control valves and other types of valves with or without electronic control for actuating the various possible open closed positions of such valves. The multi position valve expression as applied herein can include a unitary valve mechanism e.g. a single junction block assembly or a reasonable combination of a unitary valve mechanism and other valve components.

Where suitable and applicable to the various embodiments of the present systems and methods discussed herein it can be appreciated that various components structures elements and other configurations may be applied or installed in a location considered external or internal to the operation of a particular machine. In applicable portions herein where the use of pumps and or supplemental pumps is disclosed for example such pumps may be positioned installed or operated as internal components of a machine and or as externally positioned components that assist or otherwise operate in conjunction with the functions of the machine.

As used herein the term subsequent or variations thereof e.g. subsequently as used with respect to performance of process or method steps is not intended to exclude other potential process or method steps from occurring or being performed between steps that are considered subsequent with respect to each other. For example as applied herein if step Y occurs subsequent to step X then the intended meaning of subsequent to is that step Y occurs at some point in time after step X occurs but other steps may occur in the time period that elapses between the occurrence of step X and step Y. In like fashion the term prior or variations thereof e.g. prior to as used with respect to performance of process or method steps described herein is not intended to exclude other potential process or method steps from occurring or being performed between steps that are considered prior to with respect to each other.

As employed herein the term type or kind used with regard to various fluids discussed herein is intended to distinguish different types or kinds of fluids between among each other. For example oil is considered one type of fluid transmission fluid is considered another different type of fluid and hydraulic fluid is considered another different type of fluid. It should be noted for example that a used amount of a type of fluid is not considered different with respect to a clean or fresh fluid of the same type e.g. clean oil used in a fluid refill or replacement process for a machine is not considered a different type of fluid with respect to the used oil drained from the machine during a fluid evacuation process .

Referring now to a portable fluid transfer conduit is shown having an inlet port and outlet port . Flexibly extending between inlet and outlet ports and is flexible tubing . In various embodiments of the present systems and methods the tubing may be made from a natural or synthetic rubber material braided stainless steel or polymeric extruded material such as polyethylene or styrene.

A coupling is attached to the inlet . As shown the coupling is the male mateable end of a quick disconnect coupling more clearly shown in . Alternatively coupling can be any type of fitting such as a screw in or a bayonet type coupling. In one embodiment a fitting is adapted to the outlet of the fluid source. On devices such as a pre lubrication pump similar to that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4 502 431 for example a bypass or connector means can be inserted on the pressure side of the pump to divert the oil from the engine to the fluid transfer conduit . An example is disclosed in the discussion of presented herein.

Positioned adjacent outlet port is flow control means . Flow control means comprises in one embodiment an electric or mechanical valve for controlling the flow of fluid through the conduit activated by switch . This embodiment is useful where the fluid source does not incorporate a pump means and or the fluid is gravity transferred. On the other hand in the case where means such as a pre lubrication device is used flow control means is preferably a pass through conduit having switch sealably mounted thereon. Switch is electrically connected by conductor to electrical connector which is adapted to connect with the pump circuit to activate the pump and control the flow of fluid. Where flow control means comprises an electric valve conductor and connector are typically connected to a source of electrical power such as a battery terminal a magnetic switch relay contacts or other electromechanical means for activating the pumping means.

To drain a fluid such as oil or hydraulic oil for example from a machine or other piece of equipment involves connecting coupling to the outlet of the pump and initiating the pump through activation of flow control switch or by use of gravity. It can be appreciated that in situations where a pre lubrication pump is used a valve is not usually required. The outlet port of fluid transfer conduit is positioned at a remote and convenient location to discharge the fluid into a waste receiving receptacle. Such waste receiving receptacles are generally known in the art and may commonly comprise barrels or service vehicles for example or other receptacles or reservoirs adapted to receive and transport waste oil or other contaminated vehicle fluids.

In one embodiment shown in fluid transfer conduit comprises a conduit having an inlet port and an outlet port . Inlet port includes a coupling preferably a mateable coupling as shown in . In this operational example flow control means comprises a small suction diaphragm piston or reciprocating pump and may include therein a battery pack. Flow control means includes an activator switch in the form of a trigger switch having a guard and grip means to facilitate holding the discharge end of the fluid transfer conduit . It can be appreciated that in applications where a relatively long transfer conduit is applied such as for example a transfer conduit of 20 to 30 feet in length the pump can be located adjacent to or in close proximity to the coupling means .

Many types of small portable pumps suitable for use as the pump are commercially available. A number of pumps are better suited for heavier or more viscous fluids but are not capable of operating with battery power. In such cases a power cable such as conductor and connector can be used in addition to the various embodiments described herein. Typically the electrical power required to operate the pump can be supplied by a vehicle storage battery or an AC pump can be connected to an AC outlet as a power source. In general smaller pump means are suitable and applicable in the consumer market and the comparatively larger pump means are applicable to the industrial market.

Referring now to examples of coupling means for use with various embodiments of the present systems and methods are shown. Coupling means are adaptable for example to fluid transfer conduit embodiments shown with respect to and . Coupling means connects to the engine oil port not shown whereas coupling means is attached to conduit . Such coupling means are well known in the art and comprise a male quick connector fitting and a female mateable quick connector fitting . Also shown is an electrical receptor for receiving electrical connector . In various embodiments it is also possible to include a sensing means on the coupling means to indicate that the sump is dry and to signal for shut down of the pump. A cap is shown for protecting receptor between periods of use. As shown in the embodiments of receptor and fitting are mounted on a bracket that is connected to a source of fluid such as a pre lubrication pump for example not shown . In this embodiment the fitting is connected on the output or high pressure side of the fluid source system. In application to a pre lubrication system for example the fitting is interposed in the high pressure pump discharge line between the pump and an engine or other machine.

Referring now to one embodiment of a sampling port is shown that can be used to sample oil in a pre lubrication system where the pre lubrication pumps flows through portion . It can be appreciated that this embodiment has the advantage of being able to provide a live sample of oil or other fluid used in this embodiment without requiring the engine or other machine to be in a fully operational state.

As shown in the illustrative embodiment of an additional fitting is attached to an external air supply . In one aspect the fitting is a female fitting adapted to couple to an air supply not shown . By attaching an air source to the fitting prior to or during the removal of oil from the engine oil resident in the channels can be removed to the sump and the oil in the filter system can be at least partially or substantially removed to facilitate removal of the filter. In many embodiments that employ such an air supply it may be desirable to have the source of air at a pressure from about 90 to 150 pounds per square inch for example.

It has been discovered that a vehicle or other equipment having for example an engine reservoir hydraulic fluid reservoir and a transmission fluid reservoir may be more efficiently serviced and risks of environmental contamination may be reduced if the various service locations for such reservoirs are in relatively close proximity. For example and without limitation if the service locations for such reservoirs are within about 3 to 10 feet from each other service can usually be accomplished by relatively few technicians and within an acceptable amount of time. Also the risks from environmental contamination caused for example by spillage when several lines and fluid containers are disconnected and connected can be reduced if such close proximity of service locations is provided.

In one example embodiment the control valve is a three position four port directional valve which controls the connection of the pump with each of the conduits and leading to the reservoirs and respectively. In one aspect the control valve has one default position which is the engine sump position. The control valve and the pump may be operated from a remote bracket by an electrical evacuator switch attached to a connector and a toggle selector switch respectively.

As will be appreciated in the operation of the system of the control valve determines which of the reservoirs or will be in fluid communication with the pump through the conduit network . Specifically the selector switch determines the position of the control valve . The switch connected at the connector serves as the on off switch for the pump and may be mounted on the bracket or may be mounted on a tethered switch connected to connector . In operation the selector switch controls the position of the control valve to determine which reservoir or is evacuated. When the switch connected to connector is energized the pump is energized thereby providing negative pressure on line and in turn to the control valve . The fluid in the reservoir or fluidly coupled to the control valve is drawn into line through pump through line and to coupling for discharge into a suitable receptacle and or into a fluid line for further processing.

Although three reservoirs are shown in the embodiment illustrated in the number of reservoirs is not limited to three. For embodiments with N reservoirs for example there are N reservoir conduits connecting each reservoir with the control valve such as the conduits and of . A pump conduit such as conduit for example connects the control valve to the pump and an outlet conduit such as conduit for example connects the pump to the outlet port . It can be appreciated that for N reservoirs the control valve has one default position and N 1 selector activated positions.

The control valve may also be operated from a centralized location such as a service panel. An embodiment of a remote single service panel for a single pump which includes switches for the actuation of the pump and the control valve in addition to switches for ignition and ports for sampling engine transmission and hydraulic fluids is shown in . A selector switch on the service panel is connected to the control valve to enable an operator to select the reservoir to be evacuated. A switch for controlling evacuation an emergency evacuation stop switch and an evacuation connect port coupled for example to the line for connecting disconnecting the pump may also be mounted on the service panel . Additionally a transmission oil sampling port an engine oil sampling port and a hydraulic oil sampling port may be mounted on the service panel for with the transmission engine and hydraulic reservoirs respectively. The service panel may also include an oil filter having an oil inlet line transmission oil filter a fuel filter a fuel separator hydraulic oil filter a remote ignition selector and an ignition switch . Thus service locations such as control panel may be provided for virtually all machine vehicle and or engine fluid service needs.

An embodiment of the electrical diagram for the service panel of is shown in . A motor relay is connected to the pump motor connected to pump to start and stop the pump motor when the start and emergency stop switches respectively are operated. The relay switch stops the motor when a low flow condition is detected by sensor during evacuation. The evacuation selector switch which is electrically connected to the start switch and to the emergency stop switch enables the selective evacuation of the hydraulic reservoir or transmission reservoir through the operation of a hydraulic reservoir solenoid valve coil and a transmission reservoir solenoid valve coil respectively. The default position in is the evacuation of the engine reservoir but it will be appreciated that any of the reservoirs may be chosen as the default position and that the number of reservoirs may not be limited to three.

As shown in each of the lines and may also be coupled to a corresponding check valve or respectively to allow flow in one direction only as well as a check valve around pump . Optionally a line shown in dotted lines may be provided with appropriate valving around the pump which is connected to a quick disconnect coupling . In this embodiment the truck pump of a lubrication evacuation truck may be used to evacuate fluids. The truck pump evacuates through permanent line or quick disconnect line to a truck waste tank . If pump is used and the truck pump is not used a conduit may be connected by application of appropriate valving through the permanent line or the quick disconnect to the lubrication truck waste tank .

It will be appreciated that the number of conduits connected to the first and second pumps need not be limited to a total of three. For example the first pump may be connected to Nreservoirs and the second pump may be connected to Nreservoirs for a total number of N N N. illustrates a first example of an embodiment where Nis equal to 1 and Nis equal to 2. In a second example of the same embodiment Nis still equal to 1 but Nis a number greater that 2. In the second example the control valve is connected to Nreservoir conduits such as conduits and . In both examples the second pump is connected to the control valve with pump conduit and to the second outlet with outlet conduit .

An embodiment for a remote service panel including controls for a dual pump multiple reservoir evacuation system is shown in . It includes start and stop switches a selector switch and evacuation disconnect ports for the first pump and second pump . A line connected to the unfiltered side of the engine oil filter head may also be connected to a pressure regulated air supply to purge the engine of used oil before adding replacement oil through the same port. On the same service panel sample ports for the transmission engine and hydraulic fluid reservoirs respectively may be mounted as well as a remote ignition selector and a remote ignition switch .

An embodiment of an electrical diagram for the panel of is shown in . The pump motors and for the pumps and respectively are connected to corresponding relay switches and respectively and each relay switch is powered for example by a source of 12V or 24V DC current. The first and second motor relay switches are connected to the selector switch and a normally closed emergency stop switch . Between each relay and the emergency stop switch low flow sensors and respectively intervene to stop the respective motor when a low flow condition is detected. The selector switch is connected to a valve coil and a normally open start switch . In electrical wiring for the transmission reservoir is depicted in the selector switch corresponding to contact points including the letter T designation. For clarity of disclosure some wiring for the hydraulic and engine reservoirs corresponding to contact points H and E of the selector switch has been omitted.

Either single pump multiple reservoir system as described in connection with or the dual pump multiple reservoir systems as described in connection with may be used to remove fluid from any of the reservoirs on a machine or vehicle by attaching evacuation conduits to the reservoirs as shown in the respective figures operating the control valve to select a reservoir and actuating the pump to pump fluid from the selected reservoir to an outlet port for discharge. Additionally after draining a selected reservoir replacement fluid may be admitted into the appropriate cavity as shown schematically in by attaching to a conduit connected to the unfiltered side of the fluid system e.g. to the cavity s filter head and a replacement fluid conduit by means of a coupling . The coupling is connected to a replacement fluid source . For example engine oil can be input into line in the embodiment in or into line in the embodiment in in each case before the oil filter head. It can be appreciated that the fluid cavities corresponding to the other reservoirs discussed herein can also be refilled by inputting replacement fluid on the unfiltered side of the respective filters of such fluid cavities.

Referring now to one embodiment of a fluid system including a machine wherein the machine in this example embodiment is an engine connected to a pump is shown. In one aspect of this embodiment the pump may be a supplemental pump or engine pre lubrication pump for example and or may be installed and operated at a local location or a remote location with respect to the position and operation of the engine . The pump is configured for fluid communication and operation in association with an evacuation bracket . Based on the mode of operation of the engine a fluid circuit may be completed or interrupted by a quick disconnect . During a fluid evacuation procedure for example the evacuation bracket can be used in association with the operation of the pump to evacuate various fluids from the engine . In addition in the embodiment of and in various embodiments of the present systems and methods described herein a control module can be operatively associated with various components of the fluid system . Also an internal data module can be operatively associated with the engine for receiving storing and or processing data related to functions performed within the fluid system . In another aspect a supplemental filter system may be operatively installed in association with the evacuation bracket and the quick disconnect for example. In various aspects of the present systems and methods the supplemental filter system may be for example a fine filtration system as that term is understood in the art.

Referring now to in one illustrative embodiment the control module includes various components for controlling and monitoring a fluid system as well as for monitoring collecting and analyzing data associated with various fluid system and method embodiments described herein. The control module includes a processor for executing various commands within and directing the function of the various components of the control module . One or more sensor inputs can be provided in the control module for receiving and processing data communicated from one or more sensors installed within a fluid system. Sensors applicable to operation of a machine can include without limitation sensors to detect temperature sensors to detect pressure sensors to detect voltage sensors to detect current sensors to detect contaminants sensors to detect cycle time flow sensors and or other sensors suitable for detecting various conditions experienced by the machine during the various stages of operation of the machine. In addition one or more indicators can be provided within the control module for providing alerts or notifications of conditions detected and communicated to the control module . Such indicators can be conventional audio visual or audiovisual indications of a condition detected within a fluid system. The control module may also include one or more data storage media for storing retrieving and or reporting data communicated to the control module . Data stored within the data storage media may include a variety of data collected from the condition of the fluid system including for example and without limitation oil condition particle count of contaminants cycle time data for time to evacuate or time to refill a given reservoir fluid receptacle or other fluid storage retention medium.

The control module further includes one or more controls for permitting manipulation of various elements of a fluid system and or for receiving and processing data communicated from a fluid system. Machine controls A can be provided for controlling various aspects of an engine for example such as ignition pre lubrication operations initiating a fluid evacuation process initiating a fluid refill process and various other machine operations. Pump controls B can be provided for controlling the action of a pump or supplemental pump operatively associated with a fluid system such as the fluid system of a machine for example. One or more valve controls C can be provided to actuate the position e.g. open closed or other position of one or more valves included within a fluid system. In addition one or more multi position valve controls D can be provided to operate a multi way valve e.g. a five way valve or another multi position valve apparatus or system such as a junction block assembly for example described hereinafter . In addition evacuation bracket controls E can be provided for the particular function of one or more evacuation brackets included within or introduced into a fluid system.

It can be appreciated that any portion of the above described controls may be manually actuated by a machine operator for example or automatically actuated as part of execution of instructions stored on a computer readable medium for example. In one illustrative example the pump controls B may be operatively associated automatically with manual actuation of the machine controls A such as in the event of a pre lubrication process initiated during ignition of an engine for example.

In addition in various embodiments described herein it can be appreciated that the controls need not be located within the same location such as included within the same service panel for example or other like centralized location. It can be further appreciated that the controls may be operatively associated with a machine a fluid system a valve system or other component of the present embodiments by one or more wireline and or wireless communication methods or systems. Thus in various embodiments described herein it can be seen that the controls may be considered clustered for a particular application of the present embodiments while not necessarily being physically located in a single centralized location such as installed on a service panel for example.

Data can be communicated to the control module to and or from a fluid system through a variety of methods and systems. In various embodiments disclosed herein data may be communicated for example by a wireline connection communicated by satellite communications cellular communications infrared and or communicated in accordance with a protocol such as IEEE 802.11 for example or other wireless or radio frequency communication protocol among other similar types of communication methods and systems. As shown in one or more data devices can be employed in operative association with the control module for the purpose of receiving processing inputting and or storing data and or for cooperating with the control module to control monitor or otherwise manipulate one or more components included within a fluid system. Examples of data devices include for example and without limitation personal computers A laptops B and personal digital assistants PDA s C and other data devices suitable for executing instructions on one or more computer readable media.

Various types of sensors can be employed in various embodiments of the present systems and methods to detect one or more conditions of a fluid system. For example the sensors can detect one or more of the following conditions within a fluid system engine oil pressure oil temperature in the engine amount of current drawn by a pre lubrication circuit presence of contaminants such as oil contaminants for example in the engine amount of time that has elapsed for performance of one or more cycles of various engine operations i.e. cycle time such as pre lubrication operations fluid evacuation operations fluid refill operations fluid flow rates and others. One example of a sensor that may be used in accordance with various embodiments of the present systems and methods is a contamination sensor marketed under the LUBRIGARD trade designation Lubrigard Limited United Kingdom North America Europe . A contamination sensor can provide information regarding oxidation products water glycol metallic wear particles and or other contaminants that may be present in the engine oil hydraulic oil gearbox oil transmission oil compressor oil and or other fluids used in various machines. In various aspects of the present methods and systems the contamination sensor may be employed during one or more fluid processes for example such as a fluid evacuation process or a fluid refill process.

It can be appreciated that the control module can receive and store data associated with activation and deactivation of various components of a fluid system and operation of a machine such as an engine for example included within the fluid system. Cycle time for example can be calculated from analysis of collected data to provide an indication of elapsed time for completing evacuation and or refill operations. For a given oil temperature or temperature range e.g. as can be detected and communicated by a temperature sensor an average cycle time for example can be calculated through analysis of two or more collected cycle times. In one aspect the present methods and systems can determine whether the most recently elapsed cycle time deviates from a nominal average cycle time or range of cycle times for a given oil temperature or temperature range. In addition factors may be known such as the type and viscosity of fluids e.g. such as oil used in connection with operation of the machine. An unacceptable deviation from a nominal cycle time or range of times can result in recording a fault in a data storage medium of the control module . It can be appreciated that many other types of fault conditions may detected analyzed and recorded in connection with practice of the present systems and methods. In other illustrative examples conditions associated with battery voltage current and or the presence of contaminants in the machine for example may be detected analyzed and one or more fault conditions recorded by the control module .

Referring now to in various embodiments of the present methods and systems data collected from fluid system operation can be stored on an internal data module installed on or near a machine. The internal data module can include a processor with an operatively associated memory . In one aspect the internal data module can be a one shot circuit as that term is understood by those skilled in the art. The internal data module can be configured to receive and store data related to various conditions of a fluid system a machine a valve a pump or other components of a fluid system. In one embodiment the internal data module can store data in the memory prior to engine ignition and then transfer the stored data to the control module for example or another computer system once engine ignition is initiated. In another embodiment the internal data module can store condition data for subsequent download to the control module or another suitable computer system. In various embodiments the internal data module can be configured for use in performing data collection and storage functions when the control module is not otherwise active e.g. during various machine service operations . In this manner the internal data module can be employed to store data corresponding to the electrical events associated with an oil change for example or another type of fluid evacuation or refill procedure and can transmit data related to the procedure to the control module . In various embodiments the internal data module can be a stand alone discrete module or can be configured for full or partial integration into the operation of the control module .

Collected and analyzed data as well as recorded fault events can be stored in association with the control module the internal data module and or at a remote location. In various embodiments of the present methods and systems the control module and or the internal data module can be configured for operation as integral components of a machine or as remote components not installed locally on the machine. The collected and analyzed information can be stored in one or more of the data storage media of the control module or on another conventional storage suitable for use in connection with the control module . The information can also be stored externally with respect to a machine and its components. As shown in data can be transmitted wirelessly by a radio frequency communication or by a wireline connection from the control module to one or more data devices . The personal digital assistant C for example may be configured and employed as a computer system for receiving and processing data collected from the control module during fluid evacuation and fluid refill processes.

In one illustrative example information related to an oil change event such as the time duration of the oil change for example and other engine conditions can be recorded and processed in connection with operation of the control module and or the internal data module and or their operatively associated storage medium or media. The date and time of the oil change event for example can also be recorded for one or more such oil changes. Analysis of the data may assume that a substantially constant volume of oil at a given temperature evacuates from or refills into the engine lubrication system in a consistent and repeatable amount of time. A calculation can be made that considers the amount of time needed for an oil change at a given temperature as detected by an oil temperature sensor for example and other factors such as the type and viscosity of the oil. Using this calculation the amount of oil evacuated from or refilled into the engine can be calculated. While the example of an engine is employed herein it can be appreciated that the principles of the present methods and systems described herein can be readily applied for example to hydraulic fluid reservoirs transmission fluid reservoirs and a variety of other types of fluid reservoirs. The calculated evacuated refilled oil amount can be compared against a nominal value for the sump capacity. If the calculated amount is greater than or less than the nominal value or tolerance range for such calculations this information can be recorded as a fault for further investigation and or maintenance. In one embodiment the fault recorded can be recorded electronically such as in association with operation of the control module . One or more notifications can be generated for an operator of the engine by use of the indicators for example to advise the operator that a fault has been recorded by the system. In application to various embodiments described herein the notification can take the form of an audible signal a visual or text signal or some reasonable combination of such signals.

Referring now to one embodiment of a method for performing multiple fluid evacuation and refill processes is shown. In step a need for a fluid change is identified such as a fluid change in the fluid reservoir of a machine for example. Identification of fluid change needs desires and subsequent functions performed in the fluid system can be controlled in connection with a control module in accordance with the above discussion . In step the configuration of a valve system included within a fluid system can be adjusted to permit a fluid evacuation process to be performed in operative association with the identified fluid reservoir. It can be appreciated that adjustments to configuration of the valve system performed in step can be facilitated in an automated manner such as by operative association of the fluid system with the control module for example by a manual operator adjustment or some reasonable combination of automated and manual processes. The identified fluid reservoir is evacuated in step . In optional step which can be performed prior to the evacuation process of step a conventional purge procedure can be performed on a fluid system associated with the reservoir to remove waste fluids to resist spillage of fluids to resist environmental contamination potentially caused by waste fluids and or to promote safety of an operator for example or other personnel by resisting contact between waste fluids and potentially harmful components of waste fluids and the operator. In one aspect the purge procedure of step can be performed prior to performance of a subsequent fluid refill process for example for the reservoir. In one illustrative embodiment the purge procedure can include an air purge procedure for example. In step the valve system can be configured to permit a fluid refill process to be performed in connection with the identified fluid reservoir. In step a fluid replacement source is accessed and the identified fluid reservoir is refilled in step . In one aspect of the present methods and systems it can be appreciated that the refill procedure of step can be performed by delivering the refill fluid pre filter with respect to the identified fluid reservoir.

In step a determination is made as to whether an additional fluid change process is required or desired. If it is determined that an additional reservoir does require a fluid change then the valve system is configured in step to permit a fluid evacuation process to occur for the additionally identified reservoir which additionally identified reservoir can include a fluid which is similar or dissimilar with respect to the fluid of the first identified reservoir. It can be appreciated that adjustments to the valve system performed in step can be facilitated in an automated manner such as by operative association of the fluid system with the control module for example by a manual operator adjustment or some reasonable combination of automated and manual processes. In step fluid within the additional reservoir is evacuated. In optional step also described above which can be performed prior to the evacuation process of step a conventional purge procedure can be performed on a fluid system associated with the reservoir to remove waste fluids to resist spillage of fluids to resist environmental contamination potentially caused by waste fluids and or to promote safety of an operator for example or other personnel by resisting contact between waste fluids and potentially harmful components of waste fluids and the operator. In one aspect the purge procedure of step can be performed prior to performance of a subsequent fluid refill process for example for the reservoir. In step the valve system can be configured to permit a fluid refill process for the additional reservoir. In step a fluid replacement source is accessed and the additional reservoir is refilled with fluid in step to the unfiltered side of the fluid system. In one aspect of the present methods and systems it can be appreciated that the refill procedure of step can be performed by delivering the refill fluid pre filter with respect to the additional reservoir. The process can then return to step to identify additional reservoirs for which fluid changes may be needed or desired. It can be seen that the method shown in permits multiple fluids to be evacuated and or refilled for multiple reservoirs associated with a machine from potentially multiple fluid replacement sources or reservoirs in an automated or substantially automated manner.

In various embodiments of the present methods and systems data can be collected stored and or analyzed for multiple reservoirs connected with or operatively associated with a machine. Referring again to a control module or other data device as described hereinabove for example can be employed in step to collect data A store data B and or analyze data C in accordance with one or more of the process steps shown in as well as other steps performed in connection with operation and or maintenance functions of a machine. In one example aspect it can be seen that the control module can be applied in step to collect and analyze time stamp information associated with an event such as an evacuation refill process performed in connection with an oil reservoir for example. In other aspects of the present methods and systems it can be appreciated that many types of data can be collected analyzed and or stored in connection with the function of multiple reservoirs. Data such as current valve position valve type and or reservoir type for example can be collected in connection with performance of an evacuation refill procedure for a first reservoir. A further evacuation refill procedure or another process step can then be initiated for the first reservoir or for an additionally identified reservoir. Likewise data such as current valve position valve type reservoir type for example can be collected in association with the evacuation refill procedure for the additionally identified reservoir for example or another process step.

Referring now to one embodiment of a system for performing multiple fluid evacuation and fluid refill processes is shown in schematic form. A first junction block assembly having a plurality of ports represented by positions A B C D E and F is connected through conventional piping or hydraulic hoses for example to the suction side of a pump . A second junction block assembly having a plurality of ports represented by positions G H I J K and L is also connected through conventional piping or hydraulic hoses for example to the pressure side of the pump . In one aspect the system may include a disconnect such as a quick disconnect and bracket assembly for example in the piping. In various aspects of the system a control module can be operatively associated with various control sensing and monitoring functions performed in association with operation of the system. It can be appreciated that the junction block assemblies are shown merely for purposes of illustration. One or both of the junction block assemblies could be replaced with other multi position valves for example or other suitable types of valves. It can be further appreciated that the system shown in can be configured to perform multiple fluid refill and or fluid evacuation processes in connection with one or more machine reservoirs one or more fluid replacement sources and or one or more waste receiving receptacles.

In one operational example of the valve system of which valve system includes the first and second junction block assemblies ports D and G can be connected through piping to a machine such as a machine engine for example. Port E can be configured to be a refill port that permits fluid to be introduced to the valve system such as from a fluid replacement source for example. Port K can be configured as an evacuation port that permits fluid to be evacuated through the second junction block assembly from the machine which evacuation may be facilitated by a quick disconnect and bracket assembly for example. Port A is in fluid communication with the pump on the suction side of the pump and Port J is in fluid communication with the pump on the pressure side of the pump .

In a first configuration of the illustrative valve system of all ports of the first junction block assembly are closed except for port A which is in communication with the suction side of the pump and port D which is in an open position and in communication with the machine . In addition all ports of the second junction block assembly are closed except for port J which is in communication with the pressure side of the pump and port K which is in an open position in this configuration. The pump can be activated to evacuate fluid from the machine as drawn through the piping and through port D through port A through the pump through port J and ultimately through port K. Once the fluid evacuation process is completed all ports of the first and second junction block assemblies can be closed except for the refill port E and ports A J and G. The pump can be activated to draw fluid from port E through the piping and through port A through the pump through port J and through port G into the machine . Based on this operational example it can be seen how opening and closing various ports in various configurations of the valve system permits multiple evacuation and refill processes to be performed from multiple fluid replacement sources to multiple machine reservoirs in a variety of sequences. It can also be seen that a common evacuation point e.g. port K can be provided for various fluid processes that are performed by use of the valve system. In addition it can be appreciated that different types of fluids e.g. without limitation engine oil transmission fluid hydraulic fluid coolants and other machine fluids can be alternately and or sequentially evacuated refilled in connection with the various embodiments of the present methods and systems.

Where applicable and operational in the context of various embodiments of valve assemblies and systems described herein one or more valves may be in a normally closed or normally open position prior to during or after performance of a particular fluid operation.

It can be appreciated that where applicable and operational in the context of various embodiments of valve assemblies and systems described herein performing a refill fluid operation to a pre filter portion of a fluid system improves filtration of the refill fluid. In various embodiments the refill fluid encounters at least one filter for example before the refill fluid encounters various other operative components of the fluid system.

Referring again to and in analogous structural functional and operational accordance with prior discussion hereinabove with reference to in particular one or more of the control modules may include various components for controlling and monitoring a fluid system as well as for monitoring collecting and analyzing data associated with the various fluid system and method embodiments described herein. For example the various sensors described in can include for example and without limitation sensors to detect temperature pressure voltage current contaminants cycle time flow sensors presence or absence of flow automatic off of one or more pumps in a fluid system and or other sensors suitable for detecting various conditions experienced by a machine and its components.

Data stored within these data storage media may include a variety of data collected from the condition of a fluid system including for example and without limitation oil condition particle count of contaminants cycle time data for time to evacuate or time to refill a given reservoir time stamp data on a reservoir by reservoir basis time stamp data on a system by system basis fluid receptacle or other fluid storage retention medium. In addition the control modules may include controls that actuate e.g. open or close their respectively associated electronic valves in accordance with pressure levels for example sensed at various inlets or outlets of the electronic valves.

Data can be communicated to the control modules to and or from a fluid system through a variety of methods and systems. In various embodiments disclosed herein data may be communicated for example by a wireline connection communicated by satellite communications cellular communications infrared and or communicated in accordance with a protocol such as IEEE 802.11 for example or other wireless or radio frequency communication protocol among other similar types of communication methods and systems.

In certain embodiments the various sensors described in can be configured to detect one or more of the following conditions within a fluid system engine oil pressure oil temperature in the engine amount of current drawn by a pre lubrication circuit presence of contaminants such as oil contaminants for example in the engine amount of time that has elapsed for performance of one or more cycles of various engine operations i.e. cycle time such as fluid purge operations pre lubrication operations fluid evacuation operations fluid refill operations fluid flow rates and others. One example of a sensor that may be used in accordance with various embodiments of the present systems and methods is a contamination sensor marketed under the LUBRIGARD trade designation Lubrigard Limited United Kingdom North America Europe . A contamination sensor can provide information regarding oxidation products water glycol metallic wear particles and or other contaminants that may be present in the engine oil hydraulic oil gearbox oil transmission oil compressor oil and or other fluids used in various machines. In various aspects of the present methods and systems the contamination sensor may be employed during one or more fluid processes for example such as a fluid evacuation operation or a fluid refill operation.

It can be appreciated that the control modules may receive and store data associated with activation and deactivation of various components of a fluid system and operation of a machine such as an engine for example included within the fluid system. Cycle time for example can be calculated from analysis of collected data to provide an indication of elapsed time for completing evacuation and or refill operations. For a given oil temperature or temperature range e.g. as can be detected and communicated by a temperature sensor an average cycle time for example can be calculated through analysis of two or more collected cycle times. In various aspects the present methods and systems can determine whether the most recently elapsed cycle time deviates from a nominal average cycle time or range of cycle times for a given oil temperature or temperature range. In addition factors may be known such as the type and viscosity of fluids e.g. such as oil used in connection with operation of the machine. An unacceptable deviation from a nominal cycle time or range of times can result in recording a fault in data storage media of the control modules . It can be appreciated that many other types of fault conditions may be detected analyzed and recorded in connection with practice of the present systems and methods.

Collected and analyzed data as well as recorded fault events can be stored in association with the control modules internal data modules associated with the control modules and or at a remote location. In various embodiments the control modules may be configured for operation as integral components of a machine or as remote components not installed locally on the machine. The collected and analyzed information can be stored in one or more data storage media of the control modules . The information can also be stored externally with respect to a machine and its components. Data may be transmitted wirelessly by a radio frequency communication or by a wireline connection from the control modules to one or more data devices such as a personal digital assistant for example configured and employed as a computer system for receiving and processing data collected from the control modules during fluid evacuation and fluid refill processes.

As shown in upon connection of the first coupling portion to the second coupling portion an operative association is established among the electrical contacts .

Furthermore it can be appreciated that the fluid components of either the on board or off board variety may have their own independent power sources in lieu of or in addition to external power sources such as the battery of the machine for example.

The benefits of the present systems and methods will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Systems and methods for selectively and or sequentially performing fluid evacuation and or refill processes can be useful in performing service and maintenance operations on machines. Such capabilities can ultimately improve the performance and useful life of machines for which such orchestrated fluid evacuation and or fluid refill procedures are performed. In addition the use of controls monitoring and data storage and analysis in connection with performing multiple fluid evacuation and or refill processes can further enhance the overall effectiveness of service and maintenance operations performed on a variety of machines.

Various aspects of the invention reflect that the inventor has developed enhanced fluid filtration methods system and techniques that can leverage the function of a supplemental pump in conjunction with the existing components of a machine such as the main pump of a machine with an engine for example. In various embodiments a supplemental filter apparatus may be operatively associated with the supplemental pump and or a main pump of the machine to provide filtration of fluid flowing through the machine. The filtered fluid can then be returned to one or more fluid reservoirs of the machine through an appropriate fluid communication path. In addition in certain embodiments a control module may be employed in operative association with the supplemental pump one or more components of the machine and or a valve system or valve arrangement. The control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump for example in association with detecting the existence of one or more kinds of filter triggering conditions. Such filter triggering conditions may be associated with a condition of the fluid e.g. viscosity or the presence of contaminants an operational state of one or more components the machine e.g. engine speed or main pump pressure occurrence of a predetermined event e.g. a fixed time and or a variety of other potential triggering conditions or events. One or more sensors may be operatively associated with the control module to detect and to provide signals indicative of machine conditions or fluid conditions in connection with operation of the machine or the supplemental pump for example. In various embodiments operation of the supplemental pump may provide the function or effect of a kidney loop arrangement as that term is understood by those skilled in the art of performing fluid processes or other maintenance on machines including heavy machinery. In certain embodiments a main pump of machine may operate independently and or in conjunction with the supplemental pump to perform various kidney loop or other filtering operations as described in more detail herein.

The inventor has realized that machines that require filtered fluids often cannot effectively filter smaller particle sizes due to the fact that fine filtration media require either substantially high pressure across the filter which can cause excessive parasitic power losses. Such fine filter media often require a substantial amount of installation space within the machine which can cause unacceptably high filter manufacturing and disposal costs and adds weight and size to the machine design. In addition filter media may not allow through flow sufficient to provide the fluid pressure needed to adequately lubricate the machine components. Therefore equipment designers have usually compromised by using a coarse filter media that delivers adequate flow but only removes relatively larger particles from fluid. Also certain equipment manufacturers have designed machines that direct a small amount of fluid flow through a fine filter media with the intent that most fluid in the machine will eventually pass through the fine filter. However fine particles are constantly being created or introduced into the fluid system and the particles are typically present in greater concentrations than desired. In certain situations to maximize the pressure drop across the fine filter media equipment designers have connected the outlet of the filter media to a low pressure zone e.g. an engine sump . But since this fluid flow is not being supplied to the system needing lubrication the main pump must be oversized to produce the excess flow. Various embodiments of the present invention can be structured to generate such excess flow only as needed to maintain a desired level of particle count for example or when the parasitic power required can be produced more efficiently. For example by sending fluid flow from a prelubrication or refill process through a fine filter media parasitic power required to filter the fluid can be reduced. In certain embodiments fluid can be passed through the fine filter media during periods when the system would otherwise be decelerated by braking activity for example and embodiments of the invention can be structured to minimize the parasitic power required to filter this fluid. In addition this additional load could be usefully applied to enhance the braking power of the machine.

In various embodiments the machine may be structured with one or more fluid components . The fluid component may include one or more of the following fluidic structures for example and without limitation a pump that is off board with respect to the machine a pump that is on board with respect to the machine a flow control means such as a hand held device for example a bracket or evacuation bracket and or a quick disconnect structure. The fluid component may also be one or more other types of components devices or systems suitable for supplying positive and or negative fluid pressure to one or more fluid inlet ports or fluid outlet ports associated with the fluid component . For example the fluid component may be employed to perform one or more types of fluid evacuation processes and or fluid refill processes e.g. oil changes or other machine maintenance operations in association with different fluid reservoirs for example of the machine . It can be appreciated that the fluid component may be positioned in one or more other places within the fluid system or valve system of the machine .

In various embodiments a control module may be operatively associated with the machine to collect process and or communicate data indicative of operational states triggering conditions machine conditions component functions events or other like data. For example the control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump to receive transmit and or process data signals in communication with one or more components of the machine and or to process or analyze data communicated from one or more sensors A D that can be operatively associated with various parts of the machine . For example the sensor A may be configured to detect contaminants or other aspects of fluid composition associated with fluid flow passing through the supplemental filter apparatus . The control module may include one or more processors or computer systems programmed with software firmware or other computer executable instructions to perform the various functions of the control module . The control module may be operatively associated with one or more data transmission devices which may receive and or store data received or processed by the control module . In certain embodiments the control module may communicate signals to one or more indicators which reflect the activity or function of different aspects of the control module . For example one such indicator may include a warning light or an alert graphical display positioned on the console of a vehicle in which the machine is installed. In certain embodiments the control module may activate or deactivate a valve system or otherwise operate a valve or valve apparatus in connection with a filter triggering condition for example.

Referring again to in the example shown the machine includes a fluid filtration apparatus comprising the supplemental pump and the supplemental filter apparatus . The supplemental pump may be connected for fluid communication with the main pump of the engine . For example illustrates an arrangement in which the supplemental pump is operatively connected for communicating fluid with the main pump . In certain embodiments the supplemental pump may be a pre lubrication pump for example or an existing pump such as a component of a power steering system or a power braking system operatively associated with the machine . The supplemental pump may be structured for fluid communication with at least one component of the engine such as one or more of the fluid reservoirs . The supplemental filter apparatus may be positioned in fluidic series with the supplemental pump and structured with an inlet for receiving fluid flow from the supplemental pump . The supplemental filter apparatus may be structured with an outlet to direct the fluid flow to one or more of the fluid reservoirs or other components of the engine . From the outlet or discharge side of the supplemental filter apparatus fluid may be directed to flow to a primary oil filter of the engine for example. In various embodiments the supplemental filter apparatus may include at least one fine filtration medium. In certain embodiments one of the filters of the engine may be positioned between the outlet of the supplemental filter apparatus and one or more of the fluid reservoirs of the engine .

In various embodiments the control module may be programmed to perform one or more functions upon detecting the existence of various filter triggering conditions or other events. Likewise the control module may be programmed to perform one or more functions when a filter triggering condition is no longer detected is out of a predefined parameter range e.g. 10 above or 10 below a predefined engine speed or otherwise no longer exists as a triggering condition. For example the control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump in association with detecting the existence of a filter triggering condition. Examples of potential filter triggering conditions may include a combination of one or more of the following threshold fluid temperature threshold fluid pressure threshold engine speed threshold fluid contaminant level filter condition threshold time duration of operation an injection timing variable a fuel consumption value a predetermined day or time machine state of operation. For example supplemental filtration can be activated as a function of oil condition engine hours mileage fuel consumption and or engine component speed e.g. as measured in revolutions per minute RPM . In certain embodiments engine hours may mean total time of operation such as operation time between two or more defined points in time or time between fluid operations such as oil changes performed on the engine .

In another example fluid condition monitoring may be performed to detect a filter triggering condition such as particle count particle accumulation oxidation level and or fluid dilution level. In various embodiments a contaminant sensor may be configured to detect soot levels for example or the presence of other contaminants in a fluid flowing through the machine . For example a filter triggering condition may be employed that corresponds with a maximum soot level that is acceptable for desired or optimum engine operation which may be specified by an original equipment manufacturer or by other engineering specifications. The control module may be programmed to activate the supplemental filter apparatus upon reaching the predetermined soot level for the specifications of a given engine . In another example the supplemental filter apparatus may function to remove a dilutant such as water for example from oil or fuel employed by the machine .

In various embodiments a filter triggering condition may involve a deviation from a predetermined range for an engine idle speed a turbo boost pressure a fuel consumption rate a waste gate function or an injection rate for example. In addition calculated values such a fuel to air ratio can be considered at least part of a filter triggering condition. For example clogging an air filter in the engine can cause a change in the fuel to air ratio in addition to potentially causing the fuel to increase its soot level. Other factors related to combustion chemistry or other phenomena that impact quality of combustion may also form the basis for defining a filter triggering condition.

The inventor has recognized that arrangements such as the one illustrated in can provide more than a partial bypass for the machine . In one embodiment the fluid filtration apparatus may be employed to draw fluid flow from a reservoir or oil sump of the engine for example and divert more than 15 percent of the oil flow through the engine through a two to five micron supplemental filter apparatus using the main pump of the engine . In various embodiments the filter apparatus provides full flow from the engine through the supplemental filter apparatus by using the supplemental pump .

As shown the inlet of the supplemental filter apparatus may be connected to the outlet of the supplemental pump . A valve apparatus may be provided with an inlet connected at a common junction between an outlet of the supplemental pump and an inlet of the supplemental filter apparatus . The outlet of the valve apparatus may also be connected at a common junction of an outlet of the supplemental filter apparatus and one or more components of the engine such as one or more of the fluid reservoirs A D. In various embodiments the valve apparatus may include a normally open valve for example.

In various embodiments a control module may be programmed to actuate at least one of the normally open valve in the valve apparatus or to activate the supplemental pump in association with detecting a filter triggering condition including filter triggering conditions described in other places herein . Likewise the control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump as appropriate in accordance with various filter triggering conditions. For example the control module may be programmed to activate at least one of the normally open valve in the valve apparatus or to activate the supplemental pump at a predetermined time during operation of the machine . In certain embodiments the control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump to receive transmit and or process data signals in communication with one or more components of the machine and or to process or analyze data communicated from one or more sensors A E as operatively associated with various parts of the machine . For example the sensor A may be configured to detect contaminants or other aspects of fluid composition associated with fluid flow passing through the supplemental filter apparatus .

The control module may include one or more processors or computer systems programmed with software firmware or other computer executable instructions to perform the various functions of the control module . The control module may be operatively associated with one or more data transmission devices which can store and or process data received or processed by the control module . In certain embodiments the control module may communicate signals to one or more indicators which reflect the activity or function of different aspects of the control module . For example one such indicator may include a warning light or an alert graphical display positioned on the console of a vehicle in which the machine is installed. In certain embodiments the control module may activate or deactivate a filter system or otherwise operate a valve or valve apparatus in connection with a filter triggering condition. For example the control module may be programmed to actuate the normally open valve of the valve apparatus to employ or to bypass the supplemental filter apparatus under appropriate circumstances or in association with a detected filter triggering condition.

It can be seen that the arrangement illustrated in can be embodied as a filtration system as supplied in part by the supplemental filter apparatus in parallel with a prelubrication system as supplied in part by the supplemental pump . The normally open valve of the valve apparatus may represent a usual primary flow of fluid through the supplemental pump back to the engine . In one operating state the normally open valve of the valve apparatus can be closed to direct a primary fluid flow through the supplemental filter apparatus . In another operating state the normally open valve of the valve apparatus can be opened to direct the primary fluid flow away from the supplemental filter apparatus and back to the engine . It can be seen that the filtration system of can be useful in the event that a fine filter associated with the supplemental filter apparatus becomes too restrictive which might result from a clogged filter for example. In one example a filter triggering condition may result in opening the normally open valve of the valve apparatus when an oil temperature is below a threshold temperature and when a flow rate through the supplemental filter apparatus is below a threshold rate. In another example the filter triggering condition which results in actuating the valve apparatus may detect a threshold fluid pressure at various points within the machine . In another example supplemental filtration by the supplemental filter apparatus may be engaged based on condition monitoring of the fluid to regulate when and how long the supplemental pump is activated.

In certain embodiments a filter triggering condition can be logged by the control module as a fault condition such as when fluid pressure is too high at the supplemental filter apparatus perhaps indicating that the filter medium needs to be cleaned or changed. In addition a filter triggering condition may be accompanied by activating or deactivating an indicator in connection with the filter triggering condition. For example a high fluid pressure filter triggering condition may cause an indicator in the operator area of the machine to activate signaling to the operator that the filter medium of the supplemental filter apparatus needs to be changed.

The inventor has recognized that there are advantages in determining whether to use the supplemental pump to direct fluid flow through a filter of the engine or directly to an appropriate fluid reservoir . For example fluid that has passed through the supplemental filter apparatus may be sufficiently clean so as not to require further filtering through a filter of the engine . In another example directing fluid flow with the supplemental pump from the supplemental filter apparatus into a filter oil rifle and bearings of the engine can boost oil pressure. Such a boost in oil pressure may be useful at times when the engine is idling for example or during other states of machine operation when a boost in oil pressure or other fluid pressure is required. It can be seen that this arrangement can boost engine oil pressure while lowering the power required by the engine . In other words one of the problems identified by the inventor is that typically the oil pump on the engine has to be oversized in order to deliver sufficient lubrication during engine idle. Accordingly the oil pump is often oversized to deliver appropriate pressure at engine idle speed even though such an oil pump is larger than it has to be to deliver pressure at comparatively higher engine speeds achieved during machine operation. In various embodiments use of the filtration system including the supplemental pump can serve as a way to downsize the flow range of the engine pump .

In various embodiments the control module may be programmed to activate the supplemental pump and direct fluid flow back to the to the filter to allow for using a smaller engine primary oil pump and or reduce the duty cycle needed from certain engine components. This arrangement has the potential to provide supplemental fluid flow at low engine speeds in a way that can allow engine manufacturers to reduce the flow rate and thus reduce parasitic loading on the main pump . Likewise the control module may be programmed to decide when to deactivate the supplemental pump . For example deactivating the supplemental pump may be performed in response to analyzing a combination of one or more factors such as engine speed e.g. within a tolerance range at idle speed full speed or other operational speeds engine oil rifle pressure or fluid temperature. For example an oil regulator may be disabled if the oil is too thick i.e. viscosity and the engine may then run on the high pressure supplied by the supplemental pump to raise the rifle pressure.

In various embodiments the machine may be structured with one or more fluid components . The fluid component may include one or more of the following fluidic structures for example and without limitation a pump that is off board with respect to the machine a pump that is on board with respect to the machine a flow control means such as a hand held device for example a bracket or evacuation bracket and or a quick disconnect structure. The fluid component may also be one or more other types of components devices or systems suitable for supplying positive and or negative fluid pressure to one or more fluid inlet ports or fluid outlet ports associated with the fluid component . For example the fluid component may be employed to perform one or more types of fluid evacuation processes and or fluid refill processes e.g. oil changes or other machine maintenance operations in association with different fluid reservoirs for example of the machine . It can be appreciated that the fluid component may be positioned in one or more other places within the fluid system or valve system of the machine .

In certain embodiments a control module may be programmed for actuating at least one of the first valve A the second valve B or the supplemental pump in association with detecting the existence of a filter triggering condition. For example activating and or deactivating the supplemental pump may be performed in response to analyzing a combination of one or more factors such as engine speed e.g. within a tolerance range at idle speed full speed or other operational speeds engine oil rifle pressure or fluid temperature. For example an oil regulator may be disabled if the oil is too thick i.e. viscosity and the engine may then run on the high pressure supplied by the supplemental pump to raise the rifle pressure. Likewise the control module may be programmed to deactivate the supplemental pump as appropriate in accordance with various filter triggering conditions. The control module may include one or more processors or computer systems programmed with software firmware or other computer executable instructions to perform the various functions of the control module . The control module may be operatively associated with one or more data transmission devices which can store and or process data received or processed by the control module . The control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the supplemental pump to receive transmit and or process data signals in communication with one or more components of the machine and or to process or analyze data communicated from one or more sensors A E as operatively associated with various parts of the machine . In certain embodiments the control module may communicate signals to one or more indicators which reflect the activity or function of different aspects of the control module . For example one such indicator may include a warning light or an alert graphical display positioned on the console of a vehicle in which the machine is installed. In certain embodiments the control module may activate or deactivate a filter system or otherwise operate a valve or valve apparatus in connection with a filter triggering condition.

In the example of a fluid filtration apparatus shown in the second valve B may include a normally closed valve to resist fluid flow through the supplemental filter apparatus in a first operating mode. In this first operating mode fluid flows through the supplemental pump through the first valve A and then back to a component of the engine . In various embodiments the first valve A may include a check valve which is connected to a filter head of the engine for example. In certain embodiments the second valve B may be connected to a sump of the engine . In the first operating mode when the second valve B is closed then fluid may flow through the supplemental pump to the filter such as during a pre lubrication fluid process for example. In a second operating mode the second valve B may be opened to enable bypass filtration of the fluid flow through the supplemental filter apparatus and back to the sump C of the engine or another fluid reservoir . It can be seen that back pressure through the filter during engine operation can resist fluid from flowing through the first valve A. In the event that restriction of fluid flow by the supplemental filter apparatus restriction results in unacceptably high pressure then the first valve A can be actuated to allow fluid flow through the engine through the filter . In other words when the second valve B is open the part of the fluid path that leads to the engine through the first valve A and the filter head is also open. For example if the supplemental filter apparatus includes a two micron filter medium and the filter medium becomes clogged during use then a pressure greater than pressure at the filter would allow fluid to flow into the filter thus potentially limiting pressure at the supplemental filter apparatus to just slightly more than the engine fluid pressure at filter .

In various embodiments the machine may be structured with one or more fluid components . The fluid component may include one or more of the following fluidic structures for example and without limitation a pump that is off board with respect to the machine a pump that is on board with respect to the machine a flow control means such as a hand held device for example a bracket or evacuation bracket and or a quick disconnect structure. The fluid component may also be one or more other types of components devices or systems suitable for supplying positive and or negative fluid pressure to one or more fluid inlet ports or fluid outlet ports associated with the fluid component . For example the fluid component may be employed to perform one or more types of fluid evacuation processes and or fluid refill processes e.g. oil changes or other machine maintenance operations in association with different fluid reservoirs for example of the machine . It can be appreciated that the fluid component may be positioned in one or more other places within the fluid or valve system of the machine .

In certain embodiments the fluid reservoir pump may be a pre lubrication pump for example or an existing pump which is a component of a power steering system or a power braking system operatively associated with the machine . The supplemental pump may be structured for fluid communication with at least one component of the engine such as one or more of the fluid reservoirs . The supplemental filter apparatus may be positioned in fluidic series with the supplemental pump and structured with an inlet for receiving fluid flow from the supplemental pump . The supplemental filter apparatus may be structured with an outlet to direct the fluid flow to one or more of the fluid reservoirs of the engine . From the outlet or discharge side of the supplemental filter apparatus fluid may be directed to flow to a primary air filter of the engine for example. In various embodiments the supplemental filter apparatus may include at least one fine filtration medium. In certain embodiments one of the filters of the engine may be positioned between the outlet of the supplemental filter apparatus and one or more of the fluid reservoirs of the engine .

In various embodiments the supplemental filter apparatus may be connected to the fluid reservoir pump which may be a pump operatively associated with the oil sump C for example. In certain embodiments a relief valve may be connected for fluid communication between the supplemental filter apparatus and the fluid reservoir pump . The relief valve may be structured to direct fluid flow from the fluid reservoir pump to the supplemental filter apparatus in association with a filter triggering condition associated with the relief valve for example. In various embodiments the relief valve may be structured to resist diverting flow from an oil rifle and bearings of the engine for example until the engine experiences excess flow. In certain embodiments the relief valve may be regulated by pressure temperature fluid viscosity flow of fluid reservoir pump e.g. engine oil pump and or other conditions. In one embodiment the relief valve may be activated when excess flow exists beyond an amount flow that is necessary for the engine to perform at a predetermined level of operation. As shown in excess flow can be passed through the relief valve to the supplemental filter apparatus as a bypass for performing fine filtration.

In various embodiments it can be seen that operation of the engine can be optimized to use substantially the correct amount of fluid needed by the engine and excess flow can be directed to a bypass or filtration process. For example if oil rifle pressure in the engine is 23 psi and the engine speed is at 900 rpm then the engine may begin dumping at least part of its excess oil through an oil regulator. As the engine speed ramps up the rpm curve more flow than needed may be added to the system. At this stage the rifle pressure may be 32 psi for example when the engine begins to dump the excess oil. Next in this example suppose that the engine achieves a rated speed of 1800 to 2100 rpm while rifle pressure had risen from 32 psi to 35 psi while potentially dumping 23 gallons per minute through the oil regulator. In this example it can be seen that at least some portion of the dumped oil can be directed through the supplemental filter apparatus instead of being wasted. In certain embodiments the filter triggering condition associated with activation or deactivation of the relief valve may or may not be set at a level that results in a decrease in the rifle pressure within the engine .

In various embodiments the machine may be structured with one or more fluid components in operative association with the relief valve . The fluid component may include one or more of the following fluidic structures for example and without limitation a pump that is off board with respect to the machine a pump that is on board with respect to the machine a flow control means such as a hand held device for example a bracket or evacuation bracket and or a quick disconnect structure. The fluid component may also be one or more other types of components devices or systems suitable for supplying positive and or negative fluid pressure to one or more fluid inlet ports or fluid outlet ports associated with the fluid component. For example the fluid component may be employed to perform one or more types of fluid evacuation processes and or fluid refill processes e.g. oil changes or other machine maintenance operations in association with different fluid reservoirs for example of the machine . It can be appreciated that the fluid component may be positioned in one or more other places within the fluid or valve system of the machine .

In various embodiments a control module may be operatively associated with the machine to collect process and or communicate data indicative of operational states triggering conditions machine conditions component functions events or other like data. For example the control module may be programmed to activate or deactivate the fluid reservoir pump to receive transmit and or process data signals in communication with one or more components of the machine and or to process or analyze data communicated from one or more sensors A D that may be operatively associated with various parts of the machine . For example the sensor A may be configured to detect contaminants or other aspects of fluid composition associated with fluid flow passing through the supplemental filter apparatus . The control module may include one or more processors or computer systems programmed with software firmware or other computer executable instructions to perform the various functions of the control module . The control module may be operatively associated with one or more data transmission devices which can store and or process data received or processed by the control module . In certain embodiments the control module may communicate signals to one or more indicators which reflect the activity or function of different aspects of the control module . For example one such indicator may include a warning light or an alert graphical display positioned on the console of a vehicle in which the machine is installed. In certain embodiments the control module may activate or deactivate a valve system or otherwise operate a valve or valve apparatus in connection with a filter triggering condition for example.

In various embodiments the control module may be programmed to perform one or more functions upon detecting the existence of various filter triggering conditions or other events. Likewise the control module may be programmed to perform one or more functions when a filter triggering condition is no longer detected is out of a predefined parameter range e.g. 10 above or 10 below a predefined engine speed or otherwise no longer exists as a triggering condition. For example the control module may be programmed to activate the fluid reservoir pump in association with detecting the existence of a filter triggering condition. Examples of potential filter triggering conditions may include a combination of one or more of the following threshold fluid temperature threshold fluid pressure threshold engine speed threshold fluid contaminant level filter condition threshold time duration of operation an injection timing variable a fuel consumption value a predetermined day or time machine state of operation. For example supplemental filtration can be activated as a function of oil condition engine hours or engine component speed as measured in RPM or another suitable measurement. In certain embodiments engine hours may mean total time of operation such as operation time between two or more defined points in time or time between fluid operations such as oil changes performed on the engine .

In another example fluid condition monitoring may be performed to detect a filter triggering condition such as particle count particle accumulation and or fluid dilution level. In various embodiments a contaminant sensor may be configured to detect soot levels for example or the presence of other contaminants in a fluid flowing through the machine . For example a filter triggering condition may be employed that corresponds with a maximum soot level that is acceptable for desired or optimum engine operation which may be specified by an original equipment manufacturer or by other engineering specifications. The control module may be programmed to activate the supplemental filter apparatus upon reaching the predetermined soot level for the specifications of a given engine . In another example the supplemental filter apparatus may function to remove a dilutant such as water for example from oil or fuel employed by the machine .

In various embodiments a filter triggering condition may involve a deviation from a predetermined range for an engine idle speed a turbo boost pressure a fuel consumption rate a waste gate function or an injection rate for example. In addition calculated values such a fuel to air ratio can be considered at least part of a filter triggering condition. For example clogging an air filter in the engine can cause a change in the fuel to air ratio in addition to potentially causing the fuel to increase its soot level. Other factors related to combustion chemistry or other phenomena that impact quality of combustion may also form the basis for defining a filter triggering condition.

In various embodiments the control modules described herein may include various components for controlling and monitoring a fluid system as well as for monitoring collecting and analyzing data associated with various fluid system and method embodiments described herein. The control module may include a processor for executing various commands within and directing the function of the various components of the control module.

Such indicators can be conventional audio visual or audiovisual indications of a condition detected within a fluid system. The control module may also include one or more operatively associated data transmission devices or data storage media for storing retrieving and or reporting data communicated to the control module. Data stored within the data storage media may include a variety of data collected from the condition of the fluid system including for example and without limitation oil condition particle count of contaminants cycle time data for time to evacuate or time to refill a given reservoir and or fluid receptacle or fluid storage data.

The control module may include one or more controls for permitting manipulation of various elements of a fluid system and or for receiving and processing data communicated from a fluid system. Machine controls can be provided for controlling various aspects of an engine for example such as ignition pre lubrication operations initiating a fluid evacuation process initiating a fluid refill process initiating a kidney loop or filtration process and various other machine operations. Pump controls can be provided for controlling the action of a pump or supplemental pump operatively associated with a fluid system such as the fluid system of a machine for example. One or more valve controls can be provided to actuate the position e.g. open closed or other position of one or more valves included within a fluid system. In addition one or more multi position valve controls can be provided to operate a multi way valve or a multi position valve apparatus or system. In addition evacuation bracket controls can be provided for the particular function of one or more evacuation brackets included within or introduced into a fluid system as fluid components. In addition in various embodiments described herein it can be appreciated that the controls need not be located within the same location such as included within the same service panel for example or other like centralized location. It can be further appreciated that the controls may be operatively associated with a machine a fluid system a valve system or other component by one or more wireline and or wireless communication methods or systems.

Data can be communicated to the control module to and or from a fluid system through a variety of methods systems or techniques. In various embodiments data may be communicated for example by a wireline connection communicated by satellite communications cellular communications infrared and or communicated in accordance with a protocol such as IEEE 802.11 for example or other wireless or radio frequency communication protocol among other similar types of communication methods and systems. As shown in one or more data transmission devices can be employed in operative association with a control module for the purpose of receiving processing inputting and or storing data and or for cooperating with the control module to control monitor or otherwise manipulate one or more components included within a fluid system. Examples of data transmission devices include for example and without limitation computers A laptops B mobile phones C tablets D and personal digital assistants PDA s E and or other data devices suitable for executing instructions on one or more computer readable media. The control module may also include or may be operatively associated with a global positioning system GPS F that can be programmed to determine a position of a machine for example. In certain embodiments the data transmission device may include one or more types of data storage media G suitable for receiving data signals and or storing data. In one example a high fluid pressure filter triggering condition may generate a signal which represents the filter medium of the supplemental filter apparatus needing to be changed. Such a signal could be communicated wirelessly to a mobile device for example by use of the various media or devices described herein.

Various types of sensors can be employed in various embodiments to detect one or more conditions states or other characteristics of a fluid system different fluids or components employed in the fluid system. For example the sensors can detect one or more of the following conditions within a fluid system engine oil pressure oil temperature in the engine amount of current drawn by a pre lubrication circuit presence of contaminants such as oil contaminants for example in the engine amount of time that has elapsed for performance of one or more cycles of various engine operations i.e. cycle time such as pre lubrication operations fluid evacuation operations fluid refill operations fluid flow rates and others. One example of a sensor that may be used in accordance with various embodiments of the present systems and methods is a contamination sensor marketed under the LUBRIGARD trade designation Lubrigard Limited . A contamination sensor can provide information regarding oxidation products water glycol metallic wear particles and or other contaminants that may be present in the engine oil hydraulic oil gearbox oil transmission oil compressor oil and or other fluids used in various machines. In various aspects of the present methods and systems the contamination sensor may be employed during one or more fluid processes for example such as a fluid evacuation process or a fluid refill process.

It can be appreciated that the control module can receive and store data associated with activation and deactivation of various components of a fluid system and operation of a machine such as an engine for example included within the fluid system. Cycle time for example can be calculated from analysis of collected data to provide an indication of elapsed time for completing evacuation and or refill operations. For a given oil temperature or temperature range e.g. as can be detected and communicated by a temperature sensor an average cycle time for example can be calculated through analysis of two or more collected cycle times. In one aspect the present methods and systems can determine whether the most recently elapsed cycle time deviates from a nominal average cycle time or range of cycle times for a given oil temperature or temperature range. In addition factors may be known such as the type and viscosity of fluids e.g. such as oil used in connection with operation of the machine. An unacceptable deviation from a nominal cycle time or range of times can result in recording a fault in a data storage medium operatively associated with the control module. It can be appreciated that many other types of fault conditions may detected analyzed and recorded in connection with practice of the present systems and methods. In other illustrative examples conditions associated with battery voltage current and or the presence of contaminants in the machine for example may be detected analyzed and one or more fault conditions recorded by the control module.

In various embodiments data collected from fluid system operation can be stored on an internal data module installed on or near a machine for example. The internal data module can include a processor with an operatively associated memory. In one aspect the internal data module can be a one shot circuit as that term is understood by those skilled in the art. The internal data module can be configured to receive and store data related to various conditions of a fluid system a machine a valve a pump or other components of a fluid system. In one embodiment the internal data module can store data in the memory prior to engine ignition and then transfer the stored data to the control module for example or another computer system once engine ignition is initiated. In another embodiment the internal data module can store condition data for subsequent download to the control module or another suitable computer system. In various embodiments the internal data module can be configured for use in performing data collection and storage functions when the control module is not otherwise active e.g. during various machine service operations . In this manner the internal data module can be employed to store data corresponding to the electrical events associated with an oil change for example or another type of fluid evacuation or refill procedure and can transmit data related to the procedure to the control module. In various embodiments the internal data module can be a stand alone discrete module or can be configured for full or partial integration into the operation of the control module.

Collected and analyzed data as well as recorded fault events can be stored in association with the control module the internal data module and or at a remote location. In various embodiments the control module and or the internal data module can be configured for operation as integral components of a machine or as remote components not installed locally on the machine. The collected and analyzed information can be stored in one or more of the data transmission devices and or data storage media operatively associated with the control module or on another conventional storage suitable for use in connection with the control module. The information can also be stored externally with respect to a machine and its components. Data can be transmitted wirelessly by a radio frequency communication or by a wireline connection from the control module to one or more data devices as described herein . A mobile phone C for example may be configured and employed as a computer system for receiving and processing data collected from the control module during fluid evacuation and fluid refill processes.

In various embodiments data can be collected stored and or analyzed for multiple reservoirs connected with or operatively associated with a machine. A control module or other data device can be employed to collect store and or analyze data in accordance with one or more of the process steps shown in for example as well as in connection with other functions performed in connection with fluid operations and or maintenance for a machine. In one example the control module can be used to collect and analyze time stamp information associated with an event such as an evacuation refill process performed in connection with an oil reservoir for example. Data such as current valve position valve type and or reservoir type for example can be collected in connection with performance of an evacuation refill procedure for a fluid reservoir for example. Data stored within the data transmission devices and or data storage media may include a variety of data collected from the condition of a fluid system including for example and without limitation oil condition particle count of contaminants cycle time data for time to evacuate or time to refill a given reservoir time stamp data on a reservoir by reservoir basis time stamp data on a component by component basis time stamp data on a system by system basis and or data associated with a fluid receptacle or another fluid storage medium.

Referring now to for purposes of illustrating an operative environment for certain embodiments of the invention a diesel engine is shown having portions removed and or broken away for convenience of illustration of the lubrication system of the engine . It can be appreciated that the diesel engine is shown and described herein merely for purposes of convenience of disclosure and illustration and that many other machines as defined herein can be employed in accordance with the various embodiments of the present systems and methods. The lubrication system may include a main oil pump that is mechanically driven from the crankshaft of the engine . When actuated by rotation of crankshaft the main oil pump draws oil from a sump through a screening element and distributes it under pressure through a plurality of conduits . The pressurized oil is delivered to the crankshaft bearings of the engine to the turbocharger unit to the valve train assembly to the pistons through a filtering assembly and to other engine components that require lubrication. It can be appreciated that one or more valves and or passages not shown may be included within the lubrication system of the engine to control the flow of oil provided to various engine components.

Referring now to during operation of the engine the main oil pump is not actuated until the crankshaft begins to rotate due to the operation of an electromechanical starter assembly . The starter assembly can be conventional in configuration and can include a direct current motor assembly having an armature shaft extending therethrough. The armature shaft supports a starter gear adjacent to one end of the starter assembly . The starter gear engages a flywheel to rotatably drive crankshaft when actuated. A bendix drive mechanism controls the axial movement of the starter gear to engage and disengage the starter gear from the flywheel . Because a significant time period can elapse before the main oil pump is able to achieve normal operating oil pressure in the lubrication system vital components of the engine may move and interact through a number of cycles with little or no lubrication pressure. This can result in undesirably excessive wear and premature failure of engine components.

In various embodiments a pre lubrication electromechanical system can be activated prior to combustion in the engine and rotation of the crankshaft . The pre lubrication system can be employed to at least some lubricating oil pressure before initial movement and interaction of engine components. To provide lubrication to the engine components the pre lubrication system can include a supplemental oil pump operatively connected to the starter assembly . In one aspect the supplemental oil pump can include a mechanically driven gear type oil pump having an elongated drive shaft and gears . It can be seen that the supplemental oil pump communicates with the lubrication system of the engine through an oil inlet line an oil output line and a check valve . The drive shaft of the supplemental oil pump may be connected to the armature shaft of the starter motor opposite the starter gear in any convenient manner so that the two shafts can rotate together. The supplemental oil pump and the starter motor may be conveniently incorporated within a single housing to form an integral unit. In certain embodiments the supplemental oil pump can be installed as an on board component of the engine or as a remotely positioned external pump.

In certain embodiments the check valve can be mounted on the engine adjacent to the outlet line to resist oil backflow while the supplemental oil pump is inoperative. This check valve can also resist spinning of the starter assembly caused by oil flow during normal operation of the engine . It can be seen that failure of the supplemental oil pump would not render the engine inoperative thereby avoiding potentially expensive down time and maintenance for the engine and its associated equipment. Likewise because the supplemental oil pump pumps oil through the filtering assembly before the oil enters the engine failure of the supplemental oil pump would not likely introduce damaging particles into the engine .

Various aspects of the following disclosure include operational examples for the various system and method embodiments described herein. It can be appreciated that such operational examples are provided merely for convenience of disclosure and that no particular aspect or aspects of these operational examples are intended to limit the scope of application of the present systems and methods.

Where applicable and operational in the context of various embodiments of valve assemblies and systems described herein one or more valves may be in a normally closed or normally open position prior to during or after performance of a particular fluid operation. In addition one or more types of valves may be employed in certain embodiments of the present systems and methods e.g. a reasonable combination of check valves and or electronic valves may be employed .

It can be appreciated that where applicable and operational in the context of various embodiments of valve assemblies and systems described herein performing a refill fluid operation to a pre filter portion of a fluid system improves filtration of the refill fluid. In various embodiments the refill fluid encounters at least one filter for example before the refill fluid encounters various other operative components of the fluid system.

Data can be communicated with the control modules to and or from a fluid system through a variety of methods and systems. In various embodiments disclosed herein data may be communicated for example by a wireline connection communicated by satellite communications cellular communications infrared and or communicated in accordance with a wireless or radio frequency communication protocol among other similar types of communication methods and systems. One or more data devices can be employed in operative association with the control modules for the purpose of receiving processing inputting and or storing data and or for cooperating with the control modules to control monitor or otherwise manipulate one or more components included within a fluid system.

In one illustrative example information related to an oil filter purge operation such as the date and time of the filter purge or the cycle time of the filter purge for example and or other machine conditions can be recorded and processed in connection with operation of the control modules. In addition the condition e.g. open or closed of various valve inlets and outlets and the date time at which they are actuated may be detected recorded and or analyzed for various fluid operations. In accordance with the systems and methods disclosed herein data may be collected and recorded on a reservoir by reservoir basis and or on a fluid system by fluid system basis as service is performed on a machine for example.

In various embodiments an actuating mechanism may be positioned inside the valve assembly . The actuating mechanism which may be associated with a quick disconnect coupling can be structured to include a support A operatively associated with a spring B and a ball C. The ball C may be comprised of polypropylene for example or another suitable material. The actuating mechanism can be structured to react to pressure changes within the valve assembly . In response to such pressure changes the mechanism may alternate between a normally closed position as shown in and an open position in which the ball C moves toward the direction of the inlet outlet port to establish a fluid communication path from the machine fluid reservoir port to the inlet outlet port . In certain embodiments one or more types of couplings such as quick disconnect devices may be connected to one or more of the various ports .

In one example during a fluid evacuation operation negative pressure can be applied at the inlet outlet port such as by a pump e.g. onboard pump or off board pump connected to the valve assembly as a fluid component for example. Upon application of negative pressure the spring B is compressed and the ball C moves in a direction from the machine fluid reservoir port toward the inlet outlet port establishing fluid communication from the machine fluid reservoir to the fluid component and at the same time fluid flow through the valve assembly from the filter port is resisted possibly in conjunction with a check valve for example downstream from the coupling . A fluid evacuation operation may involve removing used or dirty oil from the sump of machine for example such as by evacuating the used oil from the sump through the valve assembly to an external pump .

In another example during a fluid refill operation positive pressure can be applied at the inlet outlet port such as by a pump e.g. onboard pump or off board pump connected to the valve assembly as a fluid component for example. Upon application of positive pressure the spring B is extended and the ball C moves in a direction away from the inlet outlet port toward the machine fluid reservoir port establishing a substantial fluid seal to resist fluid from flowing into the machine fluid reservoir . Instead fluid communication is established between the inlet outlet port and the filter port to establish fluid flow through one or more machine filters . A fluid refill operation may involve adding clean or new oil pumped from the pump for example and routing the new oil through one or more filters and perhaps ultimately to an appropriate fluid reservoir of the machine such as the sump.

The machine reservoir port may be structured for fluid communication with a machine fluid reservoir such as the sump of a machine for example. The filter port may be structured for fluid communication with one or more types of filters such as fluid filters supplemental filter apparatuses or fine filtration media see discussion of filters as described herein . In the example shown in the machine fluid system may include a pump operably connected to communicate fluid from the fluid reservoir through the filter and further onward to one or more other machine components e.g. engine components such as bearings . In certain embodiments a check valve may be operatively associated with the filter to regulate flow from the valve assembly through the filter such as during a fluid refill operation.

It can be seen that the valve assembly may be structured to be connected externally with respect to a normal fluid flow path of the machine fluid system . In other words the valve assembly can be structured to be readily retrofitted to the existing fluid system of a machine without significant disruption or interference with components of the machine.

The valve assembly may be structured for fluid communication through the inlet port in connection with one or more fluid components . The fluid component may include one or more of the following fluidic structures for example and without limitation a pump that is off board with respect to the machine a pump that is on board with respect to the machine a flow control means such as a hand held device for example a bracket or evacuation bracket and or a quick disconnect structure or other coupling. The fluid component may also be one or more other types of components devices or systems suitable for supplying positive and or negative fluid pressure to one or more fluid inlet ports or fluid outlet ports associated with a machine. For example the fluid component may be employed in connection with the valve assembly to perform one or more types of fluid refill processes e.g. oil changes or other machine maintenance operations in association with different fluid reservoirs for example of a machine.

In various embodiments an actuating mechanism may be positioned inside the valve assembly for actuating the valve assembly between a normally closed position as shown in and a fluid refill position as shown in . The actuating mechanism e.g. which may be part of a quick disconnect coupling may be structured to include a support A operatively associated with a spring B and a sealing cap C. The actuating mechanism can be structured to react to mechanical pressure applied at the inlet port . In the normally closed position the spring B of the actuating mechanism is in an extended state that provides a pressure seal at the inlet port . Mechanical pressure can be applied at the inlet port such as by introducing a fluid component e.g. an external pump to compress the spring B and cause the sealing cap C to close the fluid path normally flowing from the fluid reservoir port and at the same time establish a fluid path from the inlet port to the pump port . It can be appreciated that the valve assembly may be useful for performing refill fluid operations for one or more fluid reservoirs of a machine.

In various embodiments one or more sensors may be operatively associated with the actuation of the valve assembly or other conditions arising from use of the valve assembly in connection with fluid operations. Signals generated by the sensor in response to behavior or conditions associated with the valve assembly can be communicated to a control module for data collection data analysis or other processing. The sensor and or control module can be structured or programmed substantially in accordance with other embodiments of sensors and control modules described herein.

A repeater can be embodied as an electronic device that receives and retransmits a communicated signal at a boosted power level to allow the signal to cover a telecommunication distance with reduced degradation. A network bridge can be configured to connect multiple network segments at the data link layer of a computer network while learning which addresses can be reached through which specific ports of the network. In the network the bridge may associate a port with an address and then send traffic for that address only to that port. In various embodiments local bridges may be employed to directly connect local area networks LANs remote bridges can be used to create a wide area network WAN link between LANs and or wireless bridges can be used to connect LANs and or to connect remote stations to LANs.

In various embodiments a hub may be employed which contains multiple ports. For example when a data packet arrives at one port of a hub the packet can be copied unmodified to all ports of the hub for transmission. A network switch or other devices that forward and filter OSI layer 2 datagrams between ports based on MAC addresses in data packets can also be used. A switch can possess multiple ports such that most of the network is connected directly to the switch or another switch that is in turn connected to a switch. The term switch can also include routers and bridges as well as other devices that distribute data traffic by application content e.g. a Web URL identifier . Switches may operate at one or more OSI model layers including physical data link network or transport i.e. end to end . A device that operates simultaneously at more than one of these layers can be considered a multilayer switch. In certain embodiments routers or other like networking devices may be used to forward data packets between networks using headers and forwarding tables to determine an optimum path through which to transmit the packets.

As employed herein an application server may be a server that hosts an API to expose business logic and business processes for use by other applications. Examples of application servers include J2EE or Java EE 5 application servers including WebSphere Application Server. Other examples include WebSphere Application Server Community Edition IBM Sybase Enterprise Application Server Sybase Inc WebLogic Server BEA JBoss Red Hat JRun Adobe Systems Apache Geronimo Apache Software Foundation Oracle OC4J Oracle Corporation Sun Java System Application Server Sun Microsystems and SAP Netweaver AS ABAP Java . Also application servers may be provided in accordance with the .NET framework including the Windows Communication Foundation .NET Remoting ADO.NET and ASP.NET among several other components. For example a Java Server Page JSP is a servlet that executes in a web container which is functionally equivalent to CGI scripts. JSPs can be used to create HTML pages by embedding references to the server logic within the page. The application servers may mainly serve web based applications while other servers can perform as session initiation protocol servers for instance or work with telephony networks. Specifications for enterprise application integration and service oriented architecture can be designed to connect many different computer network elements. Such specifications include Business Application Programming Interface Web Services Interoperability and Java EE Connector Architecture.

In various embodiments computers and computer systems described herein may have the following main components arithmetic and logic unit ALU control unit memory and input and output devices I O devices . These components can be interconnected by busses often comprising groups of wires or cables. The control unit ALU registers and basic I O and often other hardware closely linked with these sections can be collectively considered a central processing unit CPU for the computer system. The CPU may be constructed on a single integrated circuit or microprocessor. The control unit control system or central controller directs the various components of a computer system. The control system decodes each instruction in a computer program and turns it into a series of control signals that operate other components of the computer system. To enhance performance or efficiency of operation the control system may alter the order of instructions. One component of the control unit is the program counter a memory register that tracks the location in memory from which the next instruction is to be read.

The ALU is capable of performing arithmetic and logic operations. The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to adding and subtracting or might include multiplying or dividing trigonometry functions sine cosine etc. and square roots. Some may be programmed to operate on whole numbers integers while others use floating point to represent real numbers for example. An ALU may also compare numbers and return Boolean truth values e.g. true or false . Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs to facilitate processing multiple instructions at the same time. For example graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often possess ALUs that can perform arithmetic operations on vectors and matrices. Certain computer systems may include one or more RAM cache memories configured to move more frequently needed data into the cache automatically.

Examples of peripherals that may be used in connection with certain embodiments of the invention include input output devices such as keyboards mice screen displays monitors printers hard disk drives floppy disk drives joysticks and image scanners.

Embodiments described herein may divide functions between separate CPUs creating a multiprocessing configuration. For example multiprocessor and multi core multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit computer systems with co processing capabilities may be employed. Also multitasking may be employed as a computer processing technique to handle simultaneous execution of multiple computer programs.

In various embodiments the computer systems data transmission devices data storage media or modules described herein may be configured and or programmed to include one or more of the above described electronic computer based elements and components or computer architecture. In addition these elements and components may be particularly configured to execute the various rules algorithms programs processes and method steps described herein.
