This application is a Continuation Patent Application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 596 208 filed on Aug. 28 2012 which claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 529 367 filed on Aug. 31 2011 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present inventions relate to small molecule inhibitors of site amyloid precursor protein APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 BACE 1 and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. This invention relates to inhibiting in mammals including humans the production of A beta peptides that can contribute to the formation of neurological deposits of amyloid protein. The present invention also relates to the treatment of Alzheimer s Disease AD and other neurodegenerative and or neurological disorders in mammals including humans. More particularly this invention relates to thioamidine compounds useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative and or neurological disorders such as AD and Down s Syndrome related to A beta peptide production.

Dementia results from a wide variety of distinctive pathological processes. The most common pathological processes causing dementia are AD cerebral amyloid angiopathy CM and prion mediated diseases see e.g. Haan et al. Clin. Neurol. Neurosurg. 1990 92 4 305 310 Glenner et al. J. Neurol. Sci. 1989 94 1 28 . AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction. AD affects nearly half of all people past the age of 85 the most rapidly growing portion of the United States population. As such the number of AD patients in the United States is expected to increase from about 4 million to about 14 million by 2050.

Aminodihydrothiazine or thioamidine compounds are described in WO 2010 038686 as useful inhibitors of the secretase enzyme. Described therein are also certain compounds that are intermediates to the aminodihydrothiazine compounds. Surprisingly Applicants determined that at least some of these intermediates are brain penetrable BACE inhibitors and as such would be expected to be BACE inhibitors and modulators for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases see Olsen et al. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 2007 42 27 47 . Accordingly the present invention is directed to the use of these compounds in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including AD. The invention is also directed to novel thioamidine compounds and their use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases including AD.

The invention is directed to compounds including the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having the structure of formula I

Preferably it is a lower alkynyl having 2 to 6 carbon atoms. For example as used herein the term Calkynyl is used herein to mean a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain alkynyl radical as defined above having 2 to 6 carbon atoms and one triple bond.

The term aryl refers to an aromatic substituent containing one ring or two or three fused rings. The aryl substituent may have six to eighteen carbon atoms. As an example the aryl substituent may have six to fourteen carbon atoms. The term aryl may refer to substituents such as phenyl naphthyl and anthracenyl. The term aryl also includes substituents such as phenyl naphthyl and anthracenyl that are fused to a C Ccarbocyclic ring such as a Cor a Ccarbocyclic ring or to a 4 to 10 membered heterocyclic ring wherein a group having such a fused aryl group as a substituent is bound to an aromatic carbon of the aryl group. When such a fused aryl group is substituted with one more substituents the one or more substituents unless otherwise specified are each bound to an aromatic carbon of the fused aryl group. The fused C Ccarbocyclic or 4 to 10 membered heterocyclic ring may be optionally substituted with halogen C Calkyl C Ccycloalkyl or O. Examples of aryl groups include phenyl naphthalenyl tetrahydronaphthalenyl indenyl isoindenyl indanyl anthracenyl phenanthrenyl benzonaphthenyl and fluorenyl.

The term cycloalkyl refers to a carbocyclic substituent obtained by removing a hydrogen from a saturated carbocyclic molecule and having three to fourteen carbon atoms. In one embodiment a cycloalkyl substituent has three to ten carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl.

The term cycloalkyl also includes substituents that are fused to a C Caromatic ring or to a 5 to 10 membered heteroaromatic ring wherein a group having such a fused cycloalkyl group as a substituent is bound to a carbon atom of the cycloalkyl group. When such a fused cycloalkyl group is substituted with one or more substituents the one or more substituents unless otherwise specified are each bound to a carbon atom of the cycloalkyl group. The fused C Caromatic ring or 5 to 10 membered heteroaromatic ring may be optionally substituted with halogen C Calkyl C Ccycloalkyl or O.

The term cycloalkyl includes mono bi and tricyclic saturated carbocycles as well as bridged and fused ring carbocycles as well as spiro fused ring systems. Examples of fused ring systems include bicyclodecanyl and decalinyl.

In some instances the number of carbon atoms in a hydrocarbyl substituent i.e. alkyl alkenyl cycloalkyl cycloalkenyl aryl etc. is indicated by the prefix C C or C wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Thus for example C C alkyl or Calkyl refers to an alkyl substituent containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Illustrating further C C cycloalkyl refers to saturated cycloalkyl containing from 3 to 6 carbon ring atoms.

In some instances the number of atoms in a cyclic substituent containing one or more heteroatoms i.e. heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl is indicated by the prefix x to y membered wherein x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of atoms forming the cyclic moiety of the substituent. Thus for example 5 to 8 membered heterocycloalkyl refers to a heterocycloalkyl containing from 5 to 8 atoms including one or more heteroatoms in the cyclic moiety of the heterocycloalkyl.

The term hydroxy or hydroxyl refers to OH.

A heterocycloalkyl alternatively may comprise 2 or 3 rings fused together wherein at least one such ring contains a heteroatom as a ring atom i.e. nitrogen oxygen or sulfur . In a group that has a heterocycloalkyl substituent the ring atom of the heterocycloalkyl substituent that is bound to the group may be the at least one heteroatom or it may be a ring carbon atom where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the at least one heteroatom or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the at least one heteroatom. Similarly if the heterocycloalkyl substituent is in turn substituted with a group or substituent the group or substituent may be bound to the at least one heteroatom or it may be bound to a ring carbon atom where the ring carbon atom may be in the same ring as the at least one heteroatom or where the ring carbon atom may be in a different ring from the at least one heteroatom.

The term heterocycloalkyl also includes substituents that are fused to a C Caromatic ring or to a 5 to 10 membered heteroaromatic ring wherein a group having such a fused heterocycloalkyl group as a substituent is bound to a heteroatom of the heterocycloalkyl group or to a carbon atom of the heterocycloalkyl group. When such a fused heterocycloalkyl group is substituted with one more substituents the one or more substituents unless otherwise specified are each bound to a heteroatom of the heterocycloalkyl group or to a carbon atom of the heterocycloalkyl group.

If substituents are described as being independently selected from a group each instance of a substituent is selected independent of the other. Each substituent therefore may be identical to or different from the other substituent s .

As used herein the term formula I and the compound of formula I I a through 1 e may be hereinafter referred to as a compound s of the invention. Such terms are also defined to include all forms of the compound of formula I the compound of formula I a through I e including hydrates solvates isomers crystalline and non crystalline forms isomorphs polymorphs and metabolites thereof. For example the compounds of the invention or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound the complex will have a well defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When however the solvent or water is weakly bound as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds the water solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases non stoichiometry will be the norm.

The compounds of the invention may exist as clathrates or other complexes. Included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates drug host inclusion complexes wherein in contrast to the aforementioned solvates the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the compounds of the invention containing two or more organic and or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized partially ionized or non ionized. For a review of such complexes see J. Pharm. Sci. 64 8 1269 1288 by Haleblian August 1975 .

The compounds of the invention have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line a solid wedge or a dotted wedge . The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers e.g. specific enantiomers racemic mixtures etc. at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of Formula I may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included. For example unless stated otherwise it is intended that the compounds of Formula I can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of Formula I and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.

Stereoisomers of Formula I include cis and trans isomers optical isomers such as R and S enantiomers diastereomers geometric isomers rotational isomers conformational isomers and tautomers of the compounds of the invention including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism and mixtures thereof such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs . Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active for example D lactate or L lysine or racemic for example DL tartrate or DL arginine.

When any racemate crystallizes crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound true racemate referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.

The present invention comprises the tautomeric forms of compounds of the invention Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier tautomeric isomerism tautomerism can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of the invention containing for example an imino keto or oxime group or so called valence tautomerism in compounds which contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism. The various ratios of the tautomers in solid and liquid form is dependent on the various substituents on the molecule as well as the particular crystallization technique used to isolate a compound.

The compounds of this invention may be used in the form of salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. Depending on the particular compound a salt of the compound may be advantageous due to one or more of the salt s physical properties such as enhanced pharmaceutical stability in differing temperatures and humidities or a desirable solubility in water or oil. In some instances a salt of a compound also may be used as an aid in the isolation purification and or resolution of the compound.

Where a salt is intended to be administered to a patient as opposed to for example being used in an in vitro context the salt preferably is pharmaceutically acceptable. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to a salt prepared by combining a compound of formula I with an acid whose anion or a base whose cation is generally considered suitable for human consumption. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly useful as products of the methods of the present invention because of their greater aqueous solubility relative to the parent compound. For use in medicine the salts of the compounds of this invention are non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Salts encompassed within the term pharmaceutically acceptable salts refer to non toxic salts of the compounds of this invention which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid.

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the present invention when possible include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric hydrobromic hydrofluoric boric fluoroboric phosphoric metaphosphoric nitric carbonic sulfonic and sulfuric acids and organic acids such as acetic benzenesulfonic benzoic citric ethanesulfonic fumaric gluconic glycolic isothionic lactic lactobionic maleic malic methanesulfonic trifluoromethanesulfonic succinic toluenesulfonic tartaric and trifluoroacetic acids. Suitable organic acids generally include for example aliphatic cycloaliphatic aromatic araliphatic heterocyclic carboxylic and sulfonic classes of organic acids.

Specific examples of suitable organic acids include acetate trifluoroacetate formate propionate succinate glycolate gluconate digluconate lactate malate tartaric acid citrate ascorbate glucuronate maleate fumarate pyruvate aspartate glutamate benzoate anthranilic acid stearate salicylate p hydroxybenzoate phenylacetate mandelate embonate pamoate methanesulfonate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate pantothenate toluenesulfonate 2 hydroxyethanesulfonate sufanilate cyclohexylaminosulfonate algenic acid hydroxybutyric acid galactarate galacturonate adipate alginate butyrate camphorate camphorsulfonate cyclopentanepropionate dodecylsulfate glycoheptanoate glycerophosphate heptanoate hexanoate nicotinate 2 naphthalesulfonate oxalate palmoate pectinate 3 phenylpropionate picrate pivalate thiocyanate and undecanoate.

Furthermore where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts i.e. sodium or potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts e.g. calcium or magnesium salts and salts formed with suitable organic ligands e.g. quaternary ammonium salts. In another embodiment base salts are formed from bases which form non toxic salts including aluminum arginine benzathine choline diethylamine diolamine glycine lysine meglumine olamine tromethamine and zinc salts.

Organic salts may be made from secondary tertiary or quaternary amine salts such as tromethamine diethylamine N N dibenzylethylenediamine chloroprocaine choline diethanolamine ethylenediamine meglumine N methylglucamine and procaine. Basic nitrogen containing groups may be quaternized with agents such as lower alkyl C C halides e.g. methyl ethyl propyl and butyl chlorides bromides and iodides dialkyl sulfates i.e. dimethyl diethyl dibuytl and diamyl sulfates long chain halides e.g. decyl lauryl myristyl and stearyl chlorides bromides and iodides arylalkyl halides e.g. benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others.

In one embodiment hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed for example hemisulfate and hemicalcium salts.

Also within the scope of the present invention are so called prodrugs of the compound of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of the compound of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can when administered into or onto the body be converted into the compound of the invention having the desired activity for example by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as prodrugs. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 ACS Symposium Series T. Higuchi and W. Stella and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design Pergamon Press 1987 ed. E. B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association . Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can for example be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of any of formula I with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as pro moieties as described for example in Design of Prodrugs by H Bundgaard Elsevier 1985 .

The present invention also includes isotopically labeled compounds which are identical to those recited in formula I but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the present invention include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen sulfur fluorine and chlorine such as H H C C C N O O P S F and Cl respectively. Compounds of the present invention prodrugs thereof and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as H and C are incorporated are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of formula I of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and or in the Examples and Preparations below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent.

The compounds of formula I I a 1 b 1 c 1 d and 1 e all generically described as the compounds of Formula I may be prepared by the methods described below together with synthetic methods known in the art of organic chemistry or modifications and transformations that are familiar to those of ordinary skill in the art. The starting materials used herein are commercially available or may be prepared by routine methods known in the art such as those methods disclosed in standard reference books such as the Vol. I XII published by Wiley Interscience . Preferred methods include but are not limited to those described below.

During any of the following synthetic sequences it may be necessary and or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This can be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups such as those described in T. W. Greene Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry John Wiley Sons 1981 T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry John Wiley Sons 1991 and T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry John Wiley Sons 1999 which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Compounds of Formula I or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared according to the reaction Schemes discussed herein below. Unless otherwise indicated the substituents in the Schemes are defined as above. Isolation and purification of the products is accomplished by standard procedures which are known to a chemist of ordinary skill.

One skilled in the art will recognize that in many cases the compounds in Schemes 1 through 8 will be generated as a mixture of diastereomers and or enantiomers these may be separated at various stages of the synthetic schemes using conventional techniques or a combination of such techniques such as but not limited to crystallization normal phase chromatography reversed phase chromatography and chiral chromatography to afford the single enantiomers of the invention.

It will be understood by one skilled in the art that the various symbols superscripts and subscripts used in the schemes methods and examples are used for convenience of representation and or to reflect the order in which they are introduced in the schemes and are not intended to necessarily correspond to the symbols superscripts or subscripts in the appended claims. The schemes are representative of methods useful in synthesizing the compounds of the present invention. They are not to constrain the scope of the invention in any way.

Scheme 1 refers to the preparation of compounds of Formula I. Referring to Scheme 1 the compound of Formula I can be prepared from the compound of Formula II through a cyclization and removal of protecting group P. Pin this case refers to groups well known to those skilled in the art for amine protection. For example Pmay be a benzoyl group Bz which can be cleaved via acidic conditions or through treatment with 1 8 diazabicyclo 5.4.0 undec 7 ene DBU in methanol. Alternatively Pmay be 9 fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl Fmoc which can be cleaved under basic conditions. The cyclization of compounds of Formula II can be effected either under acidic conditions for instance by heating in methanolic hydrochloric acid or through the activation of the alcohol with a suitable activating group such as methanesulfonyl Ms .

Scheme 2 refers to the preparation of compounds II wherein Pis Bz or Fmoc. Isoxazolidine III is converted to aminoalcohol IV via reductive cleavage of the N O bond for instance by the action of zinc powder in acetic acid. The disubstituted thiourea II is then generated by the thioacylation of IV using a reagent such as Bz protected isothiocyanate or Fmoc protected isothiocyanate. Compound II can be converted into a compound of Formula I according to the methods of Scheme 1.

Scheme 3 refers to the preparation of compound III. Homoallylic alcohol V is alkylated with 2 bromo 1 1 dimethoxyethane under basic conditions such as treatment with potassium hydride to provide the corresponding ether VI. The acetal is cleaved under acidic conditions aqueous HCl as an example to give aldehyde VII. Condensation with a hydroxylamine salt such as hydroxylammonium bisulfate provides geometric mixtures of the corresponding oxime IX. Cycloaddition to form isoxazoline X may be carried out by treatment of oxime IX with an oxidizing agent such as sodium hypochlorite. Reaction of isoxazoline X with an appropriate arylmetallic reagent for instance an aryllithium such as 2 4 difluorophenyllithium or an aryl Grignard reagent at low temperature e.g. 78 C. yields compounds of Formula III. One of ordinary skilled in the art would recognize that the stereochemistry of addition of the arylmetallic reagent is determined by the stereochemistry of the adjacent methine center yielding a racemic mixture of cis fused diastereomers which can be converted into compounds of Formula I according to the methods of Schemes 1 and 2

Alternatively compounds of Formula III can be prepared as described in Scheme 4. Homoallylic alcohol V can be alkylated with tert butyl bromoacetate under basic conditions such as treatment with sodium hydride. The tert butyl ester XI can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions such as treatment with hydrochloric acid to the corresponding carboxylic acid XII. The carboxylic acid XII is then suitably activated for instance via generation of the acid chloride through treatment with thionyl chloride and subsequently treated with a preferred amine such as N O dimethylhydroxylamine to provide the corresponding amide XIII morpholine is another preferred amine . Reaction of amide XIII with the appropriate arylmetallic reagent for instance an aryllithium such as 2 4 difluorophenyllithium or an aryl Grignard reagent at low temperature e.g. 78 C. provides the corresponding ketone XIV. Condensation with a hydroxylamine salt such as hydroxylammonium bisulfate provides geometric mixtures of the corresponding oxime XV. Cycloaddition can then be directly effected by heating oxime XV in an appropriate solvent such as xylenes to yield isoxazolidine III. Isoxazolidine III can be converted to compounds of Formula I according to Schemes 1 and 2.

Compounds of Formula VII can also be prepared as depicted in Scheme 5. Activation of an appropriately substituted homoallylic alcohol V for instance via conversion of the alcohol to a bromide or Ms group indicated as LV provides compound Va. Homoallylic alcohols such as compound V may generally be prepared by an asymmetric allylation reaction S. E. Denmark and N. G. Almstead Otera J. Ed. Wiley VCH Weinheim 2000 pp 299 401 . Treatment of glycol XVI monosubstituted with a suitable protecting group such as tert butyldimethylsilyl TBDMS with an appropriate base such as sodium hydride followed by reaction with reagent Va provides protected alcohol XVII which can be deprotected using standard methods such as treatment with tetra butylammonium fluoride TBAF to afford alcohol XVIII. Subsequent oxidation for example through reaction with Dess Martin periodinane provides the corresponding aldehyde VII. If appropriate ethylene glycol can be used in place of monoprotected diol XVI this would remove the need for a deprotection step. Aldehyde VII can then be further converted to compounds of Formula I according to Schemes 1 2 and 3.

Scheme 6 refers to an alternative installation of an Rgroup. The amine of aminoalcohol IV wherein R H can be protected with an appropriate protecting group P such as tert butoxycarbonyl Boc to afford compounds of Formula XIX. The primary alcohol of XIX can be oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde XX under Swern or Dess Martin conditions addition of a Grignard reagent RMgX then affords the secondary alcohol XXI. Deprotection of the Boc group using a strong acid such as trifluoroacetic acid TFA provides amino alcohol IV wherein R H which can be converted to compounds of Formula I via Schemes 1 and 2.

Scheme 7 refers to an alternate preparation of compounds of Formula I. Treatment of beta ketoester XXII with an appropriate base such as lithium diisopropylamide followed by trifluoroacetic acid anhydride TFAA yields vinyl triflate XXIII. Reaction of vinyl triflate XXIII with the appropriate aryl boronic acid under standard Suzuki reaction conditions A. Suzuki 1999 576 147 168 N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki 1995 95 2457 2483 provides compounds of Formula XXIV. Reduction of the methyl ester using standard conditions such as reduction with diisobutylaluminum hydride provides the primary alcohol XXV. Activation to a suitable leaving group LV for instance via treatment with trifluoroacetic anhydride provides compounds of Formula XXVI. Subsequent displacement with thiourea provides the primary amidine XXVII which can be closed upon treatment with a suitable acid such as TFA to afford thioamidine XXVIII. One skilled in the art will recognize that the product of this transformation will be a mixture of diastereomers and enantiomers that may be separated using conventional techniques such as but not limited to crystallization normal phase chromatography reversed phase chromatography and chiral chromatography to afford compounds of Formula I wherein Ris H.

Scheme 8 shows an alternate preparation of compound XXVI. Subjecting vinyl triflate XXIX to standard Suzuki reaction conditions with the appropriate aryl boronic acid provides compounds of Formula XXVI which can be converted to compounds of Formula I via Scheme 7.

Data collection was performed on a Bruker APEX diffractometer at room temperature. Data collection consisted of 3 omega scans at low angle and three at high angle each with 0.5 step. In addition 2 phi scans were collected to improve the quality of the absorption correction.

The structure was solved by direct methods using SHELX software suite in the space group P2 1 . The structure was subsequently refined by the full matrix least squares method. All non hydrogen atoms were found and refined using anisotropic displacement parameters.

The hydrogen atoms located on nitrogen and oxygen were found from the Fourier difference map and refined freely in the case of H99a and H99b restrained in the case of H98a. The remaining hydrogen atoms were placed in calculated positions and were allowed to ride on their carrier atoms. The final refinement included isotropic displacement parameters for all hydrogen atoms.

The absolute configuration was established by examination of the Flack parameter. In this case the parameter 0.0867 with an ESD of 0.0507 within range for absolute configuration determination with the assumption of an enantiopure sample.

The final R index was 7.2 . A final difference Fourier revealed no missing or misplaced electron density. This is a higher than expected R value for a compound with this formula possible because of solvate.

Pertinent crystal data collection and refinement are summarized in Table 6. Atomic coordinates bond lengths bond angles torsion angles and displacement parameters are listed in tables 7 10.
