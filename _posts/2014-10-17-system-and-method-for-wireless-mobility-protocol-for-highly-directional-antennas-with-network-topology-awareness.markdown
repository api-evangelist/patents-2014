The foregoing and additional aspects and embodiments of the present disclosure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the detailed description of various embodiments and or aspects which is made with reference to the drawings a brief description of which is provided next.

While the present disclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms specific embodiments or implementations have been shown by way of example in the drawings and will be described in detail herein. It should be understood however that the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. Rather the disclosure is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of an invention as defined by the appended claims.

Although the invention will be described in connection with certain embodiments it is not limited to those particular embodiments. On the contrary the invention is intended to cover all alternatives modifications and equivalent arrangements as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.

Many wireless systems today for example those used in WiMAX and Long Term Evolution LTE provide nomadic and mobile radio connectivity. These wireless standards are designed for use in cases where the base stations BTS are stationary or fixed and they may use directional and omnidirectional antennas. In these systems subscriber stations SS or client devices are primarily designed for use with omnidirectional antennas.

In addition these wireless protocols are designed primarily for use in licensed frequency bands of operation where high Effective Radiated Power EIRP levels are allowed so longer communication ranges are feasible even when low gain omnidirectional antennas are used. These types of wireless protocols do not offer any special treatment of client devices that may use directional antenna systems neither provide any special ways how to address mobility of such devices.

In today s wireless landscape there are many different frequency bands allocated by national agencies around the world which are allowed for unlicensed operation but the allowed Effective Isotropic Radiated Power EIRP in those bands is significantly lower typically around 36 dBm. These bands can offer in many cases excellent performance for a number of wireless applications that require nomadic and mobile modes of operation but due to the reduced link communication range network performance suffers greatly and applications are limited.

For these systems one way to overcome these problems is by utilizing highly directive antennas to improve link radio frequency RF system gain hence leading to increased link communication range while allowing the system to stay within EIRP limits. A salient feature of the wireless communication systems that use highly directive antennas is better performance in interference congested environments which are typical for unlicensed bands of operation. This is because using directive antennas which are pointed to the desired source of the RF signal leads to reduction of crosstalk from undesired RF emissions belonging to other users sharing the same spectrum which leads to better signal to noise ratios SNR and better RF link performance.

Long range communications using high directivity RF antennas require accurate positioning and adjustment of the antenna azimuth and elevation. In nomadic and mobile applications use of highly directive fixed antennas is almost impossible since this would require continuous trained operator involvement to readjust and tune antenna alignment whenever the position of the network nodes changes.

Any attempt to enable this functionality in large points to multipoint networks using current systems requires continuous end user intervention. This is time consuming and obviously not feasible. There is a need for a solution that allows usage of highly directive antennas by a large number of network nodes in an automated and reliable fashion. This system must be able to create and maintain wireless links while stationary or mobile in a fast and reliable way by changing or pointing antenna beams in the direction of desired RF network nodes.

The Wireless Mobility Protocol for Highly Directional Antennas with Network Topology Awareness WMPHDA NTA protocol aims to provide such a solution. The WMPHDA NTA protocol allows optimum exchange of downlink and uplink control plane messages thereby minimizing communication overhead so and limiting impact on data plane throughput. In one embodiment it is implemented in the Media Access Control MAC layer.

While there are other products in the marketplace that implement automatic antenna pointing controller units and use a variety of the algorithms to optimize antenna position in order to maximize performance these systems have drawbacks.

One drawback is lack of scalability as these solutions are used in point to point systems. This makes it difficult for use in a point to multipoint system.

Another drawback is that these systems are often not part of an integrated radio design. Typically these solutions use external hardware controller units and software to control mostly motorized antenna positioners. The interaction of the radio unit used in the link and hardware controller is through separate physical link interfaces such as Serial Peripheral Interface SPI Universal Serial Bus USB or Ethernet connections. This is a drawback as it introduces added cost more cabling and less reliable solutions in real deployments.

A further drawback is that these systems suffer from latency in making decisions for optimum antenna position. This is because the only possible way for these systems to interact with generic radio links is by constantly polling for status information from the radio in order to obtain needed radio statistics information for example received signal strength indicator RSSI readings.

Another drawback is that these systems suffer from loss of throughput due to the overhead of sending extensive messages required to perform continuous antenna alignment. Messages sent over the air are really sent form one external controller to another external controller hence they contain application layer overhead such as for example IP header Ethernet headers and so on.

Furthermore these systems require additional hardware which introduces significant cost. Another drawback is that additional hardware occupies more real estate on the antenna tower and mast systems increases loading and requires more complicated deployment and installations.

The WMPHDA NTA protocol supports Sector Controller SC and Subscriber Station SS in a typical hub and spoke configuration. The WMPHDA NTA protocol is applicable to number of use case scenarios.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol is for use with fixed stationary sector controllers SC and fixed nomadic and roaming mobile SS.

The term nomadic mode refers to a mode where SC or SS are mostly stationary but from time to time they are moved to different locations. Connectivity during movement is not required but when the SC or SS arrives at a new location connectivity is restored without user intervention. Roaming mobile mode refers to a mode where either the SC or SS are moving and connectivity during movement is required.

In another embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol is for use with nomadic SC and fixed nomadic and roaming mobile SS.

In another embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol is a scheduled point to multipoint wireless protocol and comprises one master SC and one or more slave SSs.

An example embodiment is shown in . Three SCs are shown and with various areas of coverage. Areas to belong to SC . Area belongs to SC . Area belongs to SC . SC communicates with SS to since these are within its areas of coverage. For this particular case communications take place between master SC and any of the slave SSs. In one embodiment there is no direct communication between any two slaves but two slaves can exchange data via the master. A transmission performed by the SC is called a downlink DL and a transmission performed by an SS such as to is defined as an uplink UL . While in this embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol is based on traditional spoke and hub configuration it is extensible to different configurations as well.

As explained previously the WMPHDA NTA protocol supports different types of SC and SS units including fixed and roaming mobile units. Fixed SS units in most cases are equipped with highly directional antennas that are aligned for optimum link performance during installation with SC antenna. Roaming mobile SS units can use a variety of antenna solutions. Example solutions include omnidirectional antennas electrically steering phase array antennas or highly directive antennas mounted on motorized positioner units.

The WMPHDA NTA protocol is not limited to one specific frequency band of deployment or a specific type of directive antenna used or the method of antenna control. Antennas may be electrically steerable for example phased array antennas or mechanically steerable where antennas are installed on motorized positioner units.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol supports various channel bandwidths such as 20 10 5 2.5 1.25 14 7 3.5 1.75 and 0.875 MHz. The channel bandwidths are not limited to this range.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol supports Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM operation. In another embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol supports OFDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access multiplexing scheme.

The WMPHDA NTA protocol can be used in a variety of duplexing arrangements including time division duplexing TDD frequency division duplexing FDD and half frequency division duplexing HFDD access.

In one embodiment WMPHDA NTA supports multiple Modulation Coding Schemes MCS and Forward Error Coding FEC rates for transmission and reception of end user data. Examples of supported MCS are BPS QPSK 16QAM 64QAM and 256QAM. Examples of supported FEC rates are and .

In one embodiment WMPHDA NTA supports a Multiple Input Multiple Output MIMO mode of operation. In one embodiment this is primarily MIMO A space time coding STC for increased link robustness and range. In another embodiment this is MIMO B spatial multiplexing SM for increased link capacity.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol supports adaptive modulation control AMC . The SC MAC layer continuously adapts and controls which MCS FEC rate and MIMO mode shall be used during and per link operation based on actual link statistics RSSI SNR and packet error rate hence maximizing and adjusting throughput performance of the link dynamically in accordance with RF channel state and quality.

In one embodiment the current MCS chosen by WMPHDA NTA SC is treated as a de facto link quality indicator LQI and hence can be used as a trigger to perform SS initiated link hand over from one SC to another SC in the network.

The SC is a central hub in the wireless network. All traffic in the DL direction SC to SS as well in UL direction SS to SC flows through it. The WMPHDA NTA is a scheduled protocol. In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA is a MAC level protocol. As explained previously the SC may be fixed nomadic or roaming mobile.

In one embodiment as shown in the SC contains a radio subsystem wireless MAC control scheduler antenna system and Global Positioning Satellite GPS subsystem . In another embodiment the SC is mobile with a highly directive antenna and an antenna control system within antenna system . In another embodiment GPS subsystem is a GPS real time kinematic RTK subsystem.

The SC can be implemented in a variety of fashions. In one embodiment all of components are interconnected via for example various interconnection techniques known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment SC is implemented using one or more servers. In one embodiment SC is implemented in software. In another embodiment SC is implemented in hardware. In one embodiment SC is implemented using software and hardware.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA is implemented using at least one of the wireless MAC control and scheduler .

The one or more antennas within antenna system can be implemented in a variety of ways. In one embodiment the one or more antennas are electrically steerable for example phased array antennas. In another embodiment the one or more antennas are on mechanically steerable where antennas are installed on motorized positioner units.

In one embodiment the SCs in a large point to multipoint deployment are configured to operate on a different frequency channel according to a radio frequency RF plan. All SCs belonging to the same wireless network are initialized with Network Topology Awareness NTA data. In one embodiment NTA data is imported into the SC. Importing of NTA data into SC is done through various mechanisms. In one embodiment importing of NTA data is done via command line interface CLI . In another embodiment the importing of NTA data is performed a web interface. In yet another embodiment importing of NTA data is done remotely using Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP . The NTA data is stored in for example scheduler or wireless MAC control .

In one embodiment the NTA data set is transmitted from the SC to the SSs by for example wireless MAC control and scheduler using the DL control channel. This is performed during for example SS initialization or updates. In one embodiment the NTA data set contains a list of sector controller identification SCID corresponding to each SC in the geographic area a list of frequency channels used by each SC center frequency of operation for each channel the channel bandwidth 3D GPS location data for each SC RF antenna azimuth bandwidth for each SC RF antenna azimuthal beam width for example 60 90 120 360 degrees for each SC and RF antenna bearing for each SC. In one embodiment the network topology information varies depending on whether SCs and SSs are fixed or mobile. In one embodiment the NTA information changes dynamically such as in the case where some or all SCs are roaming mobile.

In a further embodiment the SC continually pushes NTA data to the SSes that is the data is transmitted without the SSes requesting the data. In another embodiment the SSes pull data from the SC that is the SC transmits NTA data only when the SSes submit a download request for the data. In yet another embodiment both pushing and pulling is performed that is the SC continually transmits data to the SSes but will also respond to requests for data downloads from the SSes. In a further embodiment if the SC is roaming mobile the SC transmits data to the SSes when its position changes. In yet another embodiment in the case of a mobile SS the updating is triggered whenever the SS crosses a geo fence that is if the SS travels a certain distance away from its current point.

As explained previously in one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol relies on DL and UL control plane message exchange to communicate internal radio status and statistics information. The WMPHDA NTA protocol allows optimum exchange of DL and UL control plane messages limiting impact on throughput. As explained previously in one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol is implemented in the wireless MAC layer by the wireless MAC control thereby eliminating the need for external hardware controllers hence reducing cost and size of the system.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol implements an automatic ranging procedure without the need for dedicated periodic ranging slots like WiMAX or LTE thus eliminating constant overhead and loss of throughput associated with this approach. Further information on how this is performed is given below.

An embodiment of an SS is shown in . In one embodiment SS comprises a radio transceiver antenna subsystem control subsystem and GPS subsystem . The SS can operate in fixed nomadic or roaming mobile modes.

Information can be passed between the radio transceiver antenna subsystem control subsystem and GPS subsystem . For example the control subsystem can receive information including but not limited to LQI and other information such as SC operating capacity and SC load utilization from either or both of the radio transceiver and the antenna subsystem . The control subsystem can process this information and commands either or both of the radio transceiver and antenna subsystem accordingly.

The radio transceiver performs several different functions including but not limited to for example transmitting UL information and receiving DL information on the available operating channels obtaining data to compute signal quality measures such as signal to noise ratio SNR and signal to interference and noise ratio SINR and computing these measures either by itself or together with the control subsystem . In one embodiment the operating channel to be used for transmitting and receiving is set by the control subsystem . The radio transceiver can transmit on more than one frequency channel. In a further embodiment the radio transceiver receives NTA data from an SC such as SC . In a further embodiment radio transceiver performs processing of NTA data received from the SC.

In one embodiment the antenna subsystem provides multiple beams for selection by the control subsystem . The multiple beams are produced by one or more independent antennas using beam steering or by beam forming. As explained previously these one or more antennas can be implemented electrically or mechanically. These techniques are well known to one having skill in the art. In a further embodiment antenna subsystem implements an antenna positioner driver layer. In a further embodiment the antenna positioner driver layer is implemented using both the antenna subsystem and control subsystem .

The control subsystem commands controls co ordinates and manages the operation of the antenna subsystem radio transceiver and GPS subsystem . As explained previously the control subsystem can receive information such as wireless link status from either or both of the radio transceiver and the antenna subsystem . When link status is active the control subsystem can collect information related to for example signal quality and other information such as base station operating capacity and base station load utilization from the radio transceiver or both the radio transceiver and antenna subsystem . The control subsystem can process this collected information and send commands and control instructions to either or both of the radio transceiver and antenna subsystem accordingly.

In a further embodiment control subsystem controls DL and UL transmission from and to an SC. In a further embodiment the control subsystem comprises wireless MAC control. In a further embodiment the wireless MAC control combined with antenna positioner driver layer handles the management of the antenna bearing during normal operation in accordance to configuration of the radio unit.

In a further embodiment the GPS subsystem collects GPS information. In one embodiment if SS is roaming mobile GPS subsystem are GPS RTK receivers hence 3D GPS position and heading data are continuously available. Then the wireless MAC control in for example control subsystem continuously calculates antenna position vector based on the NTA data set and internal GPS data. It then uses this information for example in conjunction with antenna subsystem so as to maintain best possible connectivity with an SC.

An SS such as SS connecting to the network for the first time performs network registration. In one embodiment an SS connecting to a wireless network for the first time performs a general space and frequency auto scan. The space and frequency scan is part of the network initialization procedure under the control of the MAC layer. Depending on the antenna types for example whether the antennas are motorized or beam steering the MAC layer uses an appropriate driver controls the antenna direction and keeps scanning all frequency channels in the frequency scan list. Then the SS chooses an SC to attach to and obtains network topology information through the DL control channel. An embodiment is shown in .

In one embodiment the SS scans all frequency channels and beams. In optional step A a subset of frequency channels and beams are selected. In step A either all frequency channels and beams are scanned or the subset selected in step A is scanned. In one embodiment an SS is configured during provisioning with a frequency range list. In one embodiment the SS does not have any knowledge of the center frequency of operation of the corresponding SC. In this case at startup and before link establishment the SS performs frequency and space auto scanning using this frequency range list to determine which SC initially to connect to.

In one embodiment in step A upon detection of an SC on a particular frequency channel and antenna beam bearing the SS initiates the registration procedure to establish the operating link.

In one embodiment in step B upon reception of the registration request message the SC processes the message and responds to the SS. In one embodiment the message comprises a Link Configuration Data set that contains Link ID Service Flow ID s maximum PIR peak information rate CIR committed information rate . In one embodiment all subsequent traffic between the SC and the SS is scheduled and addressed using this ID structure. In one embodiment the SS receives the response and acknowledges reception of this response with another message. With this a data RF link is established between the SC and the SS.

Returning to in step A the SS then obtains an NTA data set through an UL DL message exchange. In one embodiment a network topology list is obtained from the SC as part of the NTA data. In one embodiment the SC then transmits a control message that contains NTA data. This approach avoids sending unnecessary data to fixed SS and hence saves the system bandwidth for payload. At this point the SS is fully aware of the network topology. For example the SS is fully aware of the location of all SC in the area their antenna characteristic beam widths and bearings are now known. The SS based on its own GPS RTK data and the network topology data can calculate RF visibility and distance between every SC from the NTA list and its own antenna thereby creating a best candidate list.

In step A a determination is made about whether the established RF link meets certain threshold criteria. In one embodiment an SS is configured with minimum required RF link threshold criteria minimum MCS modulation coding scheme required for link to operate at.

If the RF link meets the threshold criteria then in step A the SS stays on the established frequency channel and beam with the current SC. Then antenna subsystem in conjunction with control subsystem performs positioning acquiring and tracking PAT . Different types of PAT algorithms are possible. In various embodiments PAT algorithms use conical linear or any other sweeping antenna tracking movement in order to optimize RSSI SNR and PER statistics of the radio link. In one embodiment the PAT algorithm is independently controlled and selected depending on the antenna type and physical characteristics of the antenna azimuth and elevation beam width. In one embodiment the network topology information in combination with subscriber RF link statistic Information such as RSSI SNR and PER available on a frame by frame basis to the SS wireless MAC layer internal GPS data position and heading if available allows the radio to continuously perform antenna PAT.

If no in step A the SS obtains GPS data from the GPS subsystem . In one embodiment in step A the SS analyzes the network topology list communicated as part of the NTA data. It calculates distance and RF visibility to every SC from the list. In step the best frequency channel beam and candidate SC is determined.

In step A an operating link with the best SC is established using the best frequency channel and beam using a similar process to that outlined in step A .

In one embodiment an SS is configured during provisioning with mode of operation set to fixed or roaming mobile antenna type that is electrically steering or motorized and antenna beam width characteristics.

Since the WMPHDA NTA is implemented in the MAC layer in an embodiment if the PAT algorithm is implemented in the MAC layer the algorithm is capable of taking GPS co ordinates from GPS subsystem and enhance antenna pointing and tracking solution by continuously calculating a pointing vector based on network topology information obtained from the NTA data set and position of the SS unit as calculated using GPS subsystem .

In one embodiment GPS subsystem obtains heading information of the SS for the MAC layer PAT algorithm to use. Heading information may be obtained through variety of the sensors and sources.

In one embodiment the control subsystem calculates heading information using successive positions obtained from GPS subsystem . This is also known as a soft GPS heading solution. Such a solution is valid if vehicle moves at speeds greater than a minimum threshold.

In another embodiment GPS subsystem is a GPS RTK solution which is capable of providing and measuring heading at stationary or slow moving speed.

In another embodiment SS may be equipped with magnetometer or any other non GPS based heading information sensor.

In another embodiment heading information is passed through a dedicated software application programming interface API to the MAC layer from an external source such as for example a ship navigation system.

In another embodiment the PAT algorithm is highly adaptable and flexible to mounting antenna itself on the tracking device and installation of tracking device on vehicle vessel itself.

As is known to one of skill in the art occasionally the need will arise for transition or handover of communication link from one SC to another SC. One embodiment of an SS initiated handover process is shown in .

In step the SS calculates the best candidate SC. In one embodiment this calculation is based on GPS RTK data and the available NTA data set. In one embodiment the SS first updates its NTA data set by for example downloading a NTA data set from the currently connected SC. In one embodiment in the case of a mobile SS the updating is triggered whenever the SS crosses a geo fence that is if the SS travels a certain distance away from its current point. In one embodiment SS handover is performed based on NTA information and internal GPS location. An SS executing a PAT algorithm continuously calculates proximity and visibility of SCs from NTA information using its own GPS co ordinates if available and heading information if available. This is so that the SS can pre emptively decide to switch the frequency and correct antenna pointing vector to connect to the closest RF visible SC.

In one embodiment in step the SS determines whether the current RF link is active and whether it meets certain threshold criteria. SS handover can be triggered by different trigger events. In one embodiment loss of communication link with existing SC or MCS effectively LQI threshold is used to trigger the handover process. In one embodiment this is performed by determining whether the current MCS is better than the threshold MCS. In one embodiment WMPHDA NTA protocol implementation allows MCS threshold selection on the SS. In the event when MCS drops below desired threshold SS shall initiate handover procedure. In another embodiment oversubscription ratio or loading factor of the SC is used as a trigger. In an additional embodiment an SS can initiate pre emptive handover procedure if the next best candidate can provide significantly higher MCS modulation coding scheme . For example based on the distance to different candidate SCs MCS are estimated for each SC. If higher than current MCS with serving SC could be established handover would be initiated.

If yes then in step the SS stays connected to the current SC. If not then the SS changes to connect to the best candidate SC. In one embodiment the SS based on NTA data set and current GPS coordinates sorts a list of SC in the area based on RF visibility and distance. Then the SS will select best candidate from the list based on the distance and RF visibility. Having NTA data the MAC layer is able to change frequency of the radio to match the frequency channel of the best candidate SC calculate the new antenna position vector and executes beam steering action

In one embodiment to achieve this in step the frequency channel is changed to the best candidate frequency channel so as to connect to the best candidate SC.

Then in step the beam is changed to the best available beam so as to connect to the best candidate SC as explained previously.

In step the operating link using the best frequency channel and beam is established with the new SC. In one embodiment the SS continues to calculate performance.

The approach outlined in minimizes significantly amount of time required to perform SS handover and makes handover process smooth.

In an embodiment an SC initiated handover procedure may be introduced by sending control messages from an SC to SSs.

In one embodiment as an SS continuously moves through the network the SS monitors internal RSSI SNR PER statistics continuously. In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol uses these statistics to execute one or more AMC adaptive modulation and coding algorithms and chooses the MCS for communication at the time. In one embodiment MCS selection is controlled by Upper MAC layer of the SC for all active links.

In one embodiment the MCS is essentially in itself LQI link quality indicator since in a comprehensive way the choice of MCS incorporates all relevant stats of the communication link.

While the above discussion concerns highly directive antennas it is important to note that even in the case when an omnidirectional antenna is used on the SS the WMPHDA NTA protocol still offers significant advantages related to handover performance. The ability to execute handover to best candidate SC will not require antenna position vector calculation since the omnidirectional antenna is used but RF visibility and distance are still calculated from NTA data.

In one embodiment the WMPHDA NTA protocol uses time division duplexing TDD to switch between UL and DL and time division multiplexing TDM to switch between slaves. A TDD cycle starting with DL transmission from master and ending with UL transmissions from slaves is called a frame.

In one embodiment the frames in the WMPHDA NTA protocol are fixed duration also known as non adaptive mode. In another embodiment the frames are variable duration also known as adaptive mode. The non adaptive mode is useful for multi sector and multi base station deployments in which it is very desirable to have all sectors synchronized that is all transmit at the same time and all receive at the same time. However the adaptive mode is more efficient in terms of delay and bandwidth usage.

In one embodiment the typical structure of a TDD cycle for non adaptive mode is shown in . As shown in in one embodiment if any slave attempts to register the wireless frame is composed of three major parts downlink DL sub frame registration sub frame and uplink UL sub frame . In another embodiment if no slave attempts to register then the wireless frame is comprised of DL sub frame and UL sub frame . In a further embodiment the SC continuously transmits at least the DLMgmt portion of the wireless frame containing system preamble and frame MAP structure. If the SC is configured to operate as roaming mobile SC there is a bit in the header of the MAP structure indicating that the SC is roaming mobile.

Registration subframe is comprised of round trip delay RTD RegBurst and differential . The RTD is the actual round trip delay for the SS attempting to register. As explained previously RegBurst is a registration burst corresponding to an SS. In one embodiment as explained previously each RegBurst comprises a registration request 51 message from that SS. In case more than one station attempts to register the registration subframe will contain more than one RegBursts. In one embodiment RegBurst is comprised of NsymReg symbols. If no SSs are attempting to register there are no RegBursts. Differential is given by the maximum RTD for all the SSs less the RTD for the slave attempting to register.

UL subframe is comprised of one or more pairs of uplink uplink guardbands ULULGap and uplink burst ULBurst . Referring to ULULGap and ULBurst corresponding to the kth SS. ULULGap is a time guard band before the start of the transmission of the corresponding ULBurst. ULULGap is used to stop transmissions from an SS overlapping with transmissions from the adjacent SS. For example in the case of n SSs as shown in ULULGap and ULBurst correspond to SS and ULULGap and ULBurst correspond to SS n. In one embodiment the SC determines the start time of each ULBurst and the size of the ULULGap. In a further embodiment the SC advertises the ULULGap within the frame MAP .

As explained previously this arrangement can also be used to perform automatic ranging. In one embodiment the initial registration slot in the UL portion is used for the initial ranging calculation of the user transmission. In one embodiment the size of registration slot is at least equal to the sum of

Upon reception of the initial registration request message the SC measures position of the SS by comparing time at which the message is received with respect to the beginning of the initial registration slot. In one embodiment this measurement is used to send a timing adjustment command back to SS as a part of a registration response message. The SS uses this value to adjust its UL transmission so that the UL transmission arrives within the SC timing slot. The adjustment could either be to advance or delay the start of a transmission by the SC.

For mobile SSes the distance to SC will change and hence there is a need to continuously adjust. In one embodiment for every SS the SC continuously measures the difference between the actual start time of a ULBurst transmission and the planned start time and continually sends timing advance or delay commands to the SS. Using this arrangement avoids the need for a special periodic ranging slot. In addition this arrangement allows for fast and reliable timing control by providing fast feedback information.

The WMPHDA NTA protocol also supports roaming mobile SC mode of operation. This is a unique feature of the WMPHDA NTA protocol that enables a new set of applications. An example of an application that would benefit is a fleet of ships. In such a situation there is a need to establish a communication network between the command ship and one or more of the other vessels. Then the command ship plays the role of the SC such as SC of and the one or more other vessels are SSes.

In one embodiment the SC on the command ship continuously advertises NTA data according to its own movement. In one embodiment a geo fencing trigger is set on the SC and whenever command ship moves by more than a set distance a new DL Control Channel broadcast message with updated NTA data shall be sent from the SC to all SS. This enables the SS to continuously maintain links with the command ship in a very much the same way as in the case of fixed SC.

As with explained before vessel heading information can be obtained using variety of sensor technologies. In one embodiment a GPS RTK internal heading solution is used. In this solution a dual GPS receiver module with two antennas installed at a minimum distance of 1.5 m apart continuously resolves 3D GPS position and heading.

In one embodiment multiple fleets are linked using separate WMPHDA NTA links in order to continuously update NTA data for a global fleet.

One of skill in the art would be aware that the embodiments described above can be used in a variety of applications. In one embodiment the protocol is optimized for use in small point to multipoint applications like small cell backhaul applications where rapid antenna steering RAS product implementations are used to steer antenna beam on SC per SS link in order.
