Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to a plurality of devices including intelligent multi sensing network connected devices that communicate with each other and or with a central server or a cloud computing system to provide any of a variety of home security smart home objectives.

Various aspects and possible implementations of providing home security smart home objectives are disclosed herein. Turning to the figures illustrates an example of a smart home environment within which one or more of the devices methods systems services and or computer program products described further herein can be applicable. The depicted smart home environment includes a structure which can include e.g. a house office building garage or mobile home. It should be appreciated that the smart home environment includes areas outside the home such as curtilage the yard and other nearby land. It will be appreciated that devices can also be integrated into a smart home environment that does not include an entire structure such as an apartment condominium or office space. Further the smart home environment can control and or be coupled to devices outside of the actual structure . Indeed several devices in the smart home environment need not physically be within the structure . For example a device controlling an outdoor lighting system or gated entry system can be located outside of the structure .

The depicted structure includes a plurality of rooms separated at least partly from each other via walls . The walls can include interior walls or exterior walls. Each room can further include a floor and a ceiling . Devices can be mounted on integrated with and or supported by a wall floor or ceiling .

According to embodiments the smart thermostat detects ambient climate characteristics e.g. temperature and or humidity and controls a HVAC system accordingly. The smart hazard detector may detect the presence of a hazardous substance or a substance indicative of a hazardous substance e.g. smoke fire or carbon monoxide . The smart doorbell may control doorbell functionality detect a person s approach to or departure from a location e.g. an outer door and announce a person s approach or departure via audio or visual means or control settings on a security system e.g. to activate or deactivate a security system when occupants go and come .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall switches herein after referred to as smart wall switches along with one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected wall plug interfaces herein after referred to as smart wall plugs . The smart wall switches may detect ambient lighting conditions detect room occupancy states and control a power and or dim state of one or more lights. In some instances smart wall switches may also control a power state or speed of a fan such as a ceiling fan. The smart wall plugs may detect occupancy of a room or enclosure and control supply of power to one or more wall plugs e.g. such that power is not supplied to the plug if nobody is at home . In the illustrated example one of the smart wall plugs controls supply of power to a lamp while another smart wall plug may control supply of power to a through wall air conditioning unit or any other suitable component of environment .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected entry detectors herein after referred to as smart entry detector . The illustrated smart entry detectors are located at windows doors and other entry points of the smart home environment for detecting when a window door or other entry point is opened broken or otherwise breached. According to embodiments the smart entry detectors may include first and second parts. The first part is attached to a fixed part of the house structure such as the windowsill door sill outer frame side jamb head jamb etc. A second part is attached to part of the window or door that moves when opening and closing such as the upper or lower sash top or bottom rail side stile latch handle etc. The first and second parts of the smart entry detectors are in close proximity when the window or door is closed and the first and second parts move apart from one another when the window or door opens. The smart entry detectors generate a corresponding signal when a window or door is opened or closed etc. It should be appreciated that according to some embodiments the smart entry detectors can be any type of window door entryway alarm sensor known in the art for detecting when a window door or other entry point is opened broken or otherwise breached and that the known alarm sensors become smart when connected to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the alarm system of the home will not arm unless all smart entry detectors of the home indicate that all doors windows and other entryways are closed and or that all smart entry detectors are armed .

Still further in some embodiments the smart home environment of includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected appliances herein after referred to as smart appliances such as refrigerators stoves and or ovens televisions washers dryers indoor or outdoor lighting stereos intercom systems gated entries garage door openers floor fans ceiling fans wall air conditioners pool heaters irrigation systems security systems safes and so forth. According to embodiments the network connected appliances are made compatible with the smart home environment by cooperating with the respective manufacturers of the appliances. For example the appliances can be space heaters window air conditioning units motorized duct vents etc. When plugged in an appliance can announce itself to the smart home network such as by indicating what type of appliance it is and it can automatically integrate with the controls of the smart home. Such communication by the appliance to the smart home can be facilitated by any wired or wireless communication protocols known by those having ordinary skill in the art. The smart home also can include one or more of a variety of non communicating legacy appliances such as old conventional washer dryers refrigerators and the like which can be controlled albeit coarsely ON OFF by virtue of the smart wall plugs . The smart home environment can further include one or more of a variety of at least partially communicating legacy appliances such as infrared IR controlled wall air conditioners or other IR controlled devices which can be controlled by IR signals provided by the smart hazard detectors or the smart wall switches .

In some embodiments the smart home environment of further includes one or more intelligent multi sensing network connected doorknobs herein after referred to as smart doorknob . The illustrated smart doorknobs are located on external doors of the smart home environment . However it should be appreciated that smart doorknobs can be provided on all doors of the smart home environment . As illustrated in the smart doorknob includes a remote controlled electronic lock that locks a spindle . This locks the door because it prevents the spindle from disengaging a latch of the doorknob from a strike plate of a door stop . Accordingly the smart doorknob is able to automatically unlock the door without the user having to touch the doorknob. For example the smart doorbell can recognize a registered occupant approaching the door and instruct the smart doorknob to automatically unlock. It should also be appreciated that occupants can use a registered mobile device to remotely unlock the door. For example if when inside the home the occupant receives notice from the smart doorbell that a trusted neighbor is approaching the door the occupant can use the mobile device to unlock the door so the neighbor can let himself or herself in. Alternatively the occupant can speak an audible command instructing the smart doorknob to unlock. According to some embodiments the smart doorknob includes a remote controlled electronic motor that turns the spindle to disengage the latch of the doorknob from the strike plate of the door stop . Accordingly the smart doorknob is able to automatically open the door without the user having to touch the doorknob.

According to embodiments the smart thermostats the smart hazard detectors the smart doorbells the smart wall switches the smart wall plugs the smart entry detectors the smart appliances the smart doorknobs the keypads and other devices collectively referred herein to as the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment are connected to each other and to the central server or cloud computing system to accomplish home security and or smart home objectives for the smart home environment. In addition to containing processing and sensing capabilities each of the network connected smart devices is capable of data communications and information sharing with any other of the network connected smart devices as well as to any central server or cloud computing system or any other device that is network connected anywhere in the world to accomplish home security and or smart home objectives. The required data communications can be carried out using any of a variety of custom or standard wireless protocols Wi Fi ZigBee 6LoWPAN 3G 4G etc. and or any of a variety of custom or standard wired protocols CAT6 Ethernet HomePlug etc. . In some cases backup means of wireless communication e.g. 3G 4G is provided in the event the primary means of communication e.g. Wi Fi becomes disabled such as due to power outage.

According to embodiments all or some of the network connected smart devices can serve as wireless or wired repeaters. For example a first one of the network connected smart devices can communicate with a second one of the network connected smart devices via a wireless router . The network connected smart devices can further communicate with each other via a connection to a network such as the Internet . Through the Internet the network connected smart devices can communicate with a central server or a cloud computing system . The central server or cloud computing system can be associated with a manufacturer support entity or service provider such as a home security provider associated with the network connected smart devices. For one embodiment a user may be able to contact local law enforcement and other emergency or security personnel as well as contact customer support using one of the network connected smart devices itself rather than needing to use other communication means such as a telephone or Internet connected computer. Further software updates and security alerts can be automatically sent from the central server or cloud computing system to the network connected smart devices e.g. when available when purchased at routine intervals when emergency news needs to be broadcasted throughout the home when the security system needs to be armed and when the smart home environment needs to be put on lock down . In some embodiments certain functionalities and capabilities of environment may be enabled without active access to the Internet or remote servers or data sources. Instead in some embodiments the various smart devices of environment

 e.g. devices may be enabled to communicate with one another without active communication with Internet and system and data of those devices may be analyzed for example in combination with rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence and or any suitable smart environment data and or any suitable rules or settings or inferences or modes that may be associated with environment locally at environment by any suitable computing system e.g. at a dedicated central processing unit device or computing system of environment or at one or more processors of the various smart devices of environment to dictate the functionality of environment .

According to embodiments the network connected smart devices combine to create a mesh network of spokesman and low power nodes in the smart home environment where some of the network connected smart devices are spokesman nodes and others are low powered nodes. Spokesman nodes are sometimes referred to herein as smart nodes. It should be appreciated that non smart devices may perform as lower powered nodes. The spokesman and low powered nodes are communicatively interconnected and operate to accomplish a common objective or to achieve a common goal in the smart home environment. In some embodiments some or all of the spokesman and low powered nodes perform one or more functions in a coordinated manner to accomplish the common objective. Example functions and objectives include but are not limited to triggering an alarm for the objective of securing the home adjusting a thermostat setting for the objective of making the home comfortable and turning on and off lights for the objective of securing the home or for use by occupants. Other example objectives and functions are provided throughout this document. Some of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment are battery powered while others have a regular and reliable power source such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V line voltage wires behind the walls of the smart home environment . The network connected smart devices that have a regular and reliable power source are referred to as spokesman nodes. These nodes are equipped with the capability of using any wireless protocol or manner to facilitate bidirectional communication with any of a variety of the other devices in the smart home environment as well as with the central server or cloud computing system . On the other hand the network connected smart devices that are battery powered are referred to as low power nodes. These nodes tend to be smaller than spokesman nodes and communicate using wireless protocol that requires very little power such as Zigbee 6LoWPAN etc. Further some but not all low power nodes are incapable of bidirectional communication. These low power nodes send messages but they are unable to listen . Thus other network connected smart devices in the smart home environment such as the spokesman nodes cannot send information to these low power nodes.

As described the network connected smart devices serve as low power and spokesman nodes to create a mesh network in the smart home environment . Individual low power nodes in the smart home environment regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing and the other low powered nodes in the smart home environment in addition to sending out their own messages repeat the messages thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device throughout the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes in the smart home environment are able to drop down to low powered communication protocols to receive these messages translate the messages to other communication protocols and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and or the central server or cloud computing system . Thus the low powered nodes using low power communication protocols are able to send messages across the entire smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the mesh network enables the central server or cloud computing system to regularly receive data from all of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment make inferences based on the data and send commands back to individual one s of the network connected smart devices to accomplish some of the home security objectives descried herein. For example in the event the home security system is armed and one of the nodes either low or high power detects movement then the node can send a corresponding message through the mesh network to the central server or cloud computing system which processes the message and determines the appropriate response such as contacting authorities and or the home owner as well as instructing the network connected smart devices to enter an alarm mode which may involve activating lights sounding audible alarms etc.

As described the spokesman nodes and some of the low powered nodes are capable of listening . Accordingly users other devices and the central server or cloud computing system can communicate controls to the low powered nodes. For example as discussed below a user can use the portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone to send commands over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system which then relays the commands to the spokesman nodes in the smart home environment . The spokesman nodes drop down to a low power protocol to communicate the commands to the low power nodes throughout the smart home environment as well as to other spokesman nodes that did not receive the commands directly from the central server or cloud computing system . In some embodiments the low powered nodes and the spokesman nodes are the same type of device e.g. hazard detector thermostat wall plug etc. . In some embodiments the low powered and spokesman nodes are identical. For example in some embodiments all of the low powered and spokesman nodes have the same stock keeping unit SKU and or are capable of performing any role such as performing the role of low powered and or spokesman node.

Examples of spokesman nodes include smart doorbells smart thermostats smart wall switches smart wall plugs keypads doorknobs etc. These devices and are often located near and connected to a reliable power source and therefore can include more power consuming components such as one or more communication chips capable of bidirectional communication in any variety of protocols.

An example of a low powered node is a battery operated version of the smart entry detector . These smart entry detectors are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable power such as in a window or door frame. According to embodiments the smart entry detector includes a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that sends instantaneous messages coincident with movement of the door or window or with detection of a nearby person animal or object. In some embodiments the low power wireless communication chip regularly sends messages regarding the position open closed partially open etc. of the relevant door or window. These messages may be sent wirelessly using the mesh network from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device within the smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system .

Another example of a low power node is a smart nightlight . According to embodiments the nightlight houses a light source having variable intensity. Further according to embodiments the color of the light emitted from the nightlight is changeable. In addition to housing a light source the smart nightlight houses an occupancy sensor such as an ultrasonic or passive IR sensor and an ambient light sensor such as a photoresistor or a single pixel sensor that measures light in the room. In some embodiments the smart nightlight is configured to activate the light source when its ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and or when its occupancy sensor detects a person s presence or movement. The smart nightlight according to embodiments is configured to adjust the color and intensity of the light source. For example the smart nightlight adjusts the intensity of the light source in a manner where intensity is inversely proportional to the amount of natural light detected in the environment. According to embodiments the smart nightlight includes a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that regularly sends out messages regarding the occupancy of the room and the amount of light in the room including instantaneous messages coincident with the occupancy sensor detecting the presence of a person in the room. As mentioned above these messages may be sent wirelessly using the mesh network from node to node i.e. network connected smart device to network connected smart device within the smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system .

Yet another example of a low powered node is a battery operated version of the smart hazard detector . These smart hazard detectors are often located in an area without access to constant and reliable power and as discussed in detail below may include any number and type of sensors such as smoke fire heat sensors carbon monoxide dioxide sensors occupancy motion sensors ambient light sensors temperature sensors humidity sensors and the like. Furthermore smart hazard detectors according to some embodiments include a low power wireless communication chip e.g. ZigBee chip that regularly sends messages that correspond to each of the respective sensors to the other network connected smart devices and the central server or cloud computing system such as by using the mesh network as described above.

According to embodiments the network connected devices a.k.a. the low and high power nodes of the smart home environment are capable of enhancing home security. For example as discussed all or some of the network connected smart devices are equipped with motion sensing heat sensing pressure sensing noise sensing or other types of sensing capabilities that combine with rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence of the central server or cloud computing system to detect the presence movement and or identity of people animals and objects and trigger various alarms in the event a person animal or object is in the wrong place at the wrong time anywhere inside or in the curtilage of the smart home environment .

By virtue of network connectivity a user can remotely interact with one or more of the network connected smart devices. For example a user can communicate with one or more of the network connected smart devices using a computer e.g. a desktop computer laptop computer or tablet or other portable electronic device e.g. a smartphone . A webpage or app can be configured to receive communications from the user and control the one or more of the network connected smart devices based on the communications and or to present information about the device s operation to the user. For example the user can view arm or disarm the security system of the home. The user can be in the structure during this remote communication or outside the structure.

As discussed users can control one or more of the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment using a network connected computer or portable electronic device . In some examples some or all of the occupants e.g. individuals who live in the home can register their mobile device with the smart home environment . Such registration can be made at a central server to authenticate the occupant and or the mobile device as being associated with the smart home environment and to give permission to the occupant to use the mobile device to control the network connected smart devices and the security system of the smart home environment . An occupant can use their registered mobile device to remotely control the network connected smart devices and security system of the smart home environment such as when the occupant is at work or on vacation. The occupant may also use their registered mobile device to control the network connected smart devices when the occupant is actually located inside the smart home environment such as when the occupant is sitting on a couch inside the home or in a bedroom preparing for sleep.

It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to registering mobile devices the smart home environment makes inferences about which individuals live in the home and are therefore occupants and which mobile devices are associated with those individuals. As such the smart home environment learns who is an occupant and permits the mobile devices associated with those individuals to control the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment . As described herein various types of notices and other information are provided to occupants via messages sent to the occupants mobile devices and other electronic devices. It should be appreciated that these messages can be sent via email short message service SMS multimedia messaging service MMS unstructured supplementary service data USSD as well as any other type of messaging services and or communication protocols known in the art including any type of push notification service.

In some instances guests desire to control the smart devices. For example the smart home environment may receive communication from an unregistered mobile device of an individual inside of the home where said individual is not recognized as an occupant of the home. Further for example smart home environment may receive communication from a mobile device of an individual who is known to be or who is registered as a guest.

According to embodiments a guest layer of controls can be provided to guests of the smart home environment . The guest layer of controls gives guests access to basic controls e.g. a judicially selected subset of features of the smart devices such as temperature adjustments but it locks out other functionalities. The guest layer of controls can be thought of as a safe sandbox in which guests have limited controls but they do not have access to more advanced controls that could fundamentally alter undermine damage or otherwise impair the occupant desired operation of the smart devices. For example the guest layer of controls won t permit the guest to adjust the heat pump lockout temperature.

A use case example of this is when a guest in a smart home the guest could walk up to the thermostat and turn the dial manually but the guest may not want to walk the house hunting for the thermostat especially at night while the home is dark and others are sleeping. Further the guest may not want to go through the hassle of downloading the necessary application to their device for remotely controlling the thermostat. In fact the guest may not have access to the home owner s login credentials etc. and therefore cannot remotely control the thermostat via such an application. Accordingly according to at least some embodiments the guest can open a mobile browser on their mobile device type a keyword such as NEST into the URL field and tap Go or Search etc. In response the device presents with guest with a user interface such as Thermozilla UI which allows the guest to move the target temperature between a limited range such as 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. As discussed the user interface provides a guest layer of controls that are limited to basic functions. The guest cannot change the target humidity modes or view energy history.

According to embodiments to enable guests to access the user interface that provides the guest layer of controls a local webserver is provided that is accessible in the local area network LAN . It does not require a password because physical presence inside the home is established reliably enough by the guest s presence on the LAN. In some embodiments during installation of the smart device such as the smart thermostat the home owner is asked if they want to enable a Local Web App LWA on the smart device. Business owners will likely say no home owners will likely say yes. When the LWA option is selected the smart device broadcasts to the LAN that the above referenced keyword such as NEST is now a host alias for its local web server. Thus no matter whose home a guest goes to that same keyword e.g. NEST is always the URL you use to access the LWA provided the smart device is purchased from the same manufacturer. Further according to embodiments if there is more than one smart device on the LAN the second and subsequent smart devices do not offer to set up another LWA. Instead they register themselves as target candidates with the master LWA. And in this case the LWA user would be asked which smart device they want to change the temperature on before getting the simplified user interface such as Thermozilla UI for the particular smart device they choose.

According to embodiments a guest layer of controls may also be provided to users by means other than a device . For example the smart device such as the smart thermostat may be equipped with walkup identification technology e.g. face recognition RFID ultrasonic sensors that fingerprints or creates a signature for the occupants of the home. The walkup identification technology can be the same as or similar to the fingerprinting and signature creating techniques descripted in other sections of this application. In operation when a person who does not live in the home or is otherwise not registered with or whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the smart home walks up to a smart device the smart devices provides the guest with the guest layer of controls rather than full controls.

As described below the smart thermostat and other smart devices learn by observing occupant behavior. For example the smart thermostat learns occupants preferred temperature set points for mornings and evenings and it learns when the occupants are asleep or awake as well as when the occupants are typically away or at home for example. According to embodiments when a guest controls the smart devices such as the smart thermostat the smart devices do not learn from the guest. This prevents the guest s adjustments and controls from affecting the learned preferences of the occupants.

According to some embodiments a smart television remote control is provided. The smart remote control recognizes occupants by thumbprint visual identification RFID etc. and it recognizes users as guests or as someone belonging to a particular class having limited control and access e.g. a child . Upon recognizing the user as a guest or someone belonging to a limited class the smart remote control only permits that user to view a subset of channels and to make limited adjustments to the settings of the television and other devices. For example a guest cannot adjust the digital video recorder DVR settings and a child is limited to viewing child appropriate programming.

According to some embodiments similar controls are provided for other instruments utilities and devices in the house. For example sinks bathtubs and showers can be controlled by smart spigots that recognize users as guests or as children and therefore prevents water from exceeding a designated temperature that is considered safe.

According to embodiments the network connected smart devices of the smart home environment are modular and can be incorporated into older and new houses. For example the devices are designed around a modular platform consisting of two basic components a head unit and a backplate which is also referred to as a docking station. Multiple configurations of the docking station are provided so as to be compatible with any home such as older and newer homes. However all of the docking stations include a standard head connection arrangement such that any head unit can be removably attached to any docking station. Thus in some embodiments the docking stations are interfaces that serve as physical connections to the structure and the voltage wiring of the homes and the interchangeable head units contain all of the sensors processors user interfaces the batteries and other functional components of the devices.

Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the old docking station. There are also many different versions for the head units such as low cost versions with few features and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit such as a hazard detector is replaced by a new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a backroom or basement etc. According to embodiments when first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can indicate living room kitchen and so forth.

According to embodiments some of these modular smart devices have security enhancing features that trigger a notification or an alarm in the event the head is removed from the docking station. For example as discussed some smart devices are capable of detecting motion and function as tripwires in the security system. Others provide live video feeds and function as security cameras. In the event an intruder attempts to disable a network connected smart device and therefore avert detection by removing the smart device s head unit from its docking station an alarm or alert notification is triggered. For example the smart device sends a message indicating head unit removal to the central server or cloud computing system . Responsive to receiving a message indicating head unit removal the central server or cloud computing system according to embodiments sends a message to the home owner s or other occupants mobile device s indicating the removal and asking whether the removal is authorized. If no response after a timeout period or if the response indicates that removal was not authorized then the central server or cloud computing system triggers the alarm. In other embodiments such as when the alarm is armed i.e. in security mode the alarm is triggered immediately upon removal of the head unit. The alarm may be local on the head unit itself and therefore an alert sound is broadcasted from the head unit or may be centralized and controlled by the central server or cloud computing system and the other network connected smart devices are instructed to broadcast an alert sound. In still other embodiments upon removal the head unit asks the person to verbally identify themselves and if the voice is not recognized then the alarm is triggered.

The smart home environment may also include communication with devices outside of the smart home environment but within a proximate geographical range of the home such as within the home s curtilage. For example the smart home environment may include an outdoor lighting system that communicates information through the mesh network or directly to the central server or cloud computing system regarding detected movement and or presence of people animals and any other objects and receives back commands for controlling the lighting accordingly. The central server or cloud computing system can control the outdoor lighting system based on information received from the other network connected smart devices in the smart home environment. For example in the event any of the network connected smart devices such as smart wall plugs located outdoors detect movement at night time the central server or cloud computing system can turn on the outdoor lighting system as well as other lights in the smart home environment . This is advantageous over known outdoor motion detecting lights because the motion detection capability is not limited to just the motion sensor attached to the light itself but extends across all the network connected smart devices in the smart home environment .

The smart home environment may include a gated entry that communicates information through the mesh network or directly to the central server or cloud computing system regarding detected movement and or presence of people animals and any other objects and receives back instructions for controlling the gated entry such an opening closing locking unlocking the gate. According to embodiments an algorithm is provided for considering the geographic location of the smart home environment such as based on the zone improvement plan ZIP code or geographic coordinates of the home. The geographic information is then used to obtain data helpful for determining optimal times for turning on off or otherwise adjusting lighting as well as opening closing locking unlocking gates or otherwise securing the smart home environment .

In some embodiments these low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. devices and can function as tripwires for an alarm system in the smart home environment. For example in the event a perpetrator circumvents detection by alarm sensors located at windows doors and other entry points of the smart home environment the alarm could be triggered upon receiving an occupancy motion heat sound etc. message from one or more of the low powered and spokesman nodes in the mesh network. For example upon receiving a message from a smart nightlight indicating the presence of a person the central server or cloud computing system or some other device could trigger an alarm provided the alarm is arm at the time of detection. Thus the alarm system could be enhanced by various low powered and spokesman nodes located throughout the smart home environment . In this example a user could enhance the security of the smart home environment by buying and installing extra smart nightlights .

In some embodiments the mesh network can be used to automatically turn on and off lights as a person transitions from room to room. For example the low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. devices and detect the person s movement through the smart home environment and communicate corresponding messages through the mesh network. Using the messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall switches to automatically provide light as the person moves from room to room in the smart home environment . Further users may provide pre configuration information that indicates which smart wall plugs provide power to lamps and other light sources such as the smart nightlight . Alternatively this mapping of light sources to wall plugs can be done automatically e.g. the smart wall plugs detect when a light source is plugged into it and it sends a corresponding message to the central server or cloud computing system . Using this mapping information in combination with messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system or some other device activates and deactivates the smart wall plugs that provide power to lamps and other light sources so as to track the person s movement and provide light as the person moves from room to room.

In some embodiments the mesh network of low powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide exit lighting in the event of an emergency such as an earthquake a fire a detected home invasion dangerous CO levels etc. In some instances to facilitate this users provide pre configuration information that indicates exit routes in the smart home environment . For example for each room in the house the user provides a map of the best exit route. It should be appreciated that instead of a user providing this information the central server or cloud computing system or some other device could automatically determine the routes using uploaded maps diagrams architectural drawings of the smart home environment as well as using a map generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network e.g. positional information from the devices is used to construct a map of the house . In operation when an alarm is activated e.g. when one or more of the smart hazard detector detects smoke and activates an alarm the central server or cloud computing system or some other device uses occupancy information obtained from the low powered and spokesman nodes to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights e.g. nightlights wall switches wall plugs that power lamps etc. along the exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting. It should also be appreciated that all or some of the network connected smart devices including the smart hazard detector and the smart thermostat include a light that is activated to help occupants evacuate the home. Additionally in the event of an emergency such as earthquake or fire an audible alarm can be sounded in the home giving information about the event. Also a message such as an SMS or MMS message may be sent to the mobile device of the occupants.

In some embodiments the mesh network of low powered and spokesman nodes can be used to provide security lighting in the event an unauthorized occupant is detected in the home. In such cases all lights in and or outside of the home may be activated. Turning on all light will alert authorized occupants to the danger and will likely cause the unauthorized occupants to flee.

In some embodiments the smart home environment may include a home safe for storing valuables such as jewels money rare coins important documents etc. In the event an individual tampers with the safe such as if someone attempts to pick the lock carry it away or break it open the safe automatically sends out wireless alarms SMS notifies the authorities etc. The safe also includes a location tracking device such as a GPS device so that in the event it is carried away it can transmit information about its location. In some embodiments such a safe may be any suitable type of appliance and or .

Further included and illustrated in the example smart home environment of are service robots each configured to carry out in an autonomous manner any of a variety of household tasks. For some embodiments the service robots can be respectively configured to perform floor sweeping floor washing etc. in a manner similar to that of known commercially available devices such as the ROOMBA and SCOOBA products sold by iRobot Inc. of Bedford Mass. Tasks such as floor sweeping and floor washing can be considered as away or while away tasks for purposes of the instant description as it is generally more desirable for these tasks to be performed when the occupants are not present. For other embodiments one or more of the service robots are configured to perform tasks such as playing music for an occupant serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant serving as a localized baby monitor serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant and so forth it being generally more desirable for such tasks to be carried out in the immediate presence of the human occupant. For purposes of the instant description such tasks can be considered as human facing or human centric tasks.

When serving as a localized thermostat for an occupant a particular one of the service robots can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal comfort area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the occupant s immediate space at a comfortable temperature wherever that occupant may be located in the home. This can be contrasted with conventional wall mounted room thermostats which have the more attenuated objective of keeping a statically defined structural space at a comfortable temperature. According to one embodiment the localized thermostat service robot is configured to move itself into the immediate presence e.g. within five feet of a particular occupant who has settled into a particular location in the home e.g. in the dining room to eat their breakfast and read the news . The localized thermostat service robot includes a temperature sensor a processor and wireless communication components configured such that control communications with the HVAC system either directly or through a wall mounted wirelessly communicating thermostat coupled to the HVAC system are maintained and such that the temperature in the immediate vicinity of the occupant is maintained at their desired level. If the occupant then moves and settles into another location e.g. to the living room couch to watch television the localized thermostat service robot proceeds to move and park itself next to the couch and keep that particular immediate space at a comfortable temperature.

Technologies by which the localized thermostat service robot and or the larger smart home system of can identify and locate the occupant whose personal area space is to be kept at a comfortable temperature can include but are not limited to RFID sensing e.g. person having an RFID bracelet RFID necklace or RFID key fob synthetic vision techniques e.g. video cameras and face recognition processors audio techniques e.g. voice sound pattern vibration pattern recognition ultrasound sensing imaging techniques and infrared or near field communication NFC techniques e.g. person wearing an infrared or NFC capable smartphone along with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence techniques that draw useful conclusions from the sensed information e.g. if there is only a single occupant present in the home then that is the person whose immediate space should be kept at a comfortable temperature and the selection of the desired comfortable temperature should correspond to that occupant s particular stored profile .

When serving as a localized air monitor purifier for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal health area network for the occupant with the objective being to keep the air quality in the occupant s immediate space at healthy levels. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith other health related functions can be provided such as monitoring the temperature or heart rate of the occupant e.g. using finely remote sensors near field communication with on person monitors etc. . When serving as a localized hazard detector for an occupant a particular service robot can be considered to be facilitating what can be called a personal safety area network for the occupant with the objective being to ensure there is no excessive carbon monoxide smoke fire etc. in the immediate space of the occupant. Methods analogous to those described above for personal comfort area networks in terms of occupant identifying and tracking are likewise applicable for personal health area network and personal safety area network embodiments.

According to some embodiments the above referenced facilitation of personal comfort area networks personal health area networks personal safety area networks and or other such human facing functionalities of the service robots are further enhanced by logical integration with other smart sensors in the home according to rules based inferencing techniques or artificial intelligence techniques for achieving better performance of those human facing functionalities and or for achieving those goals in energy conserving or other resource conserving ways. Thus for one embodiment relating to personal health area networks the air monitor purifier service robot can be configured to detect whether a household pet is moving toward the currently settled location of the occupant e.g. using on board sensors and or by data communications with other smart home sensors along with rules based inferencing artificial intelligence techniques and if so the air purifying rate is immediately increased in preparation for the arrival of more airborne pet dander. For another embodiment relating to personal safety area networks the hazard detector service robot can be advised by other smart home sensors that the temperature and humidity levels are rising in the kitchen which is nearby to the occupant s current dining room location and responsive to this advisory the hazard detector service robot will temporarily raise a hazard detection threshold such as a smoke detection threshold under an inference that any small increases in ambient smoke levels will most likely be due to cooking activity and not due to a genuinely hazardous condition.

The above described human facing and away functionalities can be provided without limitation by multiple distinct service robots having respective dedicated ones of such functionalities by a single service robot having an integration of two or more different ones of such functionalities and or any combinations thereof including the ability for a single service robot to have both away and human facing functionalities without departing from the scope of the present teachings. Electrical power can be provided by virtue of rechargeable batteries or other rechargeable methods with illustrating an example out of the way docking station to which the service robots will automatically dock and recharge its batteries if needed during periods of inactivity. Preferably each service robot includes wireless communication components that facilitate data communications with one or more of the other wirelessly communicating smart home sensors of and or with one or more other service robots e.g. using Wi Fi Zigbee Z Wave 6LoWPAN etc. and one or more of the smart home devices of can be in communication with a remote server over the Internet. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith each service robot can be configured to communicate directly with a remote server by virtue of cellular telephone communications satellite communications 3G 4G network data communications or other direct communication method.

Provided according to some embodiments are systems and methods relating to the integration of the service robot s with home security sensors and related functionalities of the smart home system. The embodiments are particularly applicable and advantageous when applied for those service robots that perform away functionalities or that otherwise are desirable to be active when the home is unoccupied hereinafter away service robots . Included in the embodiments are methods and systems for ensuring that home security systems intrusion detection systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental control systems for example occupancy sensitive automated setback thermostats that enter into a lower energy using condition when the home is unoccupied are not erroneously triggered by the away service robots.

Provided according to one embodiment is a home automation and security system e.g. as shown in that is remotely monitored by a monitoring service by virtue of automated systems e.g. cloud based servers or other central servers hereinafter central server that are in data communications with one or more network connected elements of the home automation and security system. The away service robots are configured to be in operative data communication with the central server and are configured such that they remain in a non away service state e.g. a dormant state at their docking station unless permission is granted from the central server e.g. by virtue of an away service OK message from the central server to commence their away service activities. An away state determination made by the system which can be arrived at i exclusively by local on premises smart device s based on occupancy sensor data ii exclusively by the central server based on received occupancy sensor data and or based on received proximity related information such as GPS coordinates from user smartphones or automobiles or iii any combination of i and ii can then trigger the granting of away service permission to the away service robots by the central server. During the course of the away service robot activity during which the away service robots may continuously detect and send their in home location coordinates to the central server the central server can readily filter signals from the occupancy sensing devices to distinguish between the away service robot activity versus any unexpected intrusion activity thereby avoiding a false intrusion alarm condition while also ensuring that the home is secure. Alternatively or in conjunction therewith the central server may provide filtering data such as an expected occupancy sensing profile triggered by the away service robots to the occupancy sensing nodes or associated processing nodes of the smart home such that the filtering is performed at the local level. Although somewhat less secure it would also be within the scope of the present teachings for the central server to temporarily disable the occupancy sensing equipment for the duration of the away service robot activity.

According to another embodiment functionality similar to that of the central server in the above example can be performed by an on site computing device such as a dedicated server computer a master home automation console or panel or as an adjunct function of one or more of the smart home devices of . In such embodiment there would be no dependency on a remote service provider to provide the away service OK permission to the away service robots and the false alarm avoidance filtering service or filter information for the sensed intrusion detection signals.

According to other embodiments there are provided methods and systems for implementing away service robot functionality while avoiding false home security alarms and false occupancy sensitive environmental controls without the requirement of a single overall event orchestrator. For purposes of the simplicity in the present disclosure the home security systems and or occupancy sensitive environmental controls that would be triggered by the motion noise vibrations or other disturbances of the away service robot activity are referenced simply as activity sensing systems and when so triggered will yield a disturbance detected outcome representative of the false trigger for example an alarm message to a security service or an arrival determination for an automated setback thermostat that causes the home to be heated or cooled to a more comfortable occupied setpoint temperature . According to one embodiment the away service robots are configured to emit a standard ultrasonic sound throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard ultrasonic sound and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard ultrasonic sound is detected. For other embodiments the away service robots are configured to emit a standard notification signal throughout the course of their away service activity the activity sensing systems are configured to detect that standard notification signal and the activity sensing systems are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that standard notification signal is detected wherein the standard notification signal comprises one or more of an optical notifying signal an audible notifying signal an infrared notifying signal an infrasonic notifying signal a wirelessly transmitted data notification signal e.g. an IP broadcast multicast or unicast notification signal or a notification message sent in a TCP IP two way communication session .

According to some embodiments the notification signals sent by the away service robots to the activity sensing systems are authenticated and encrypted such that the notifications cannot be learned and replicated by a potential burglar. Any of a variety of known encryption authentication schemes can be used to ensure such data security including but not limited to methods involving third party data security services or certificate authorities. For some embodiments a permission request response model can be used wherein any particular away service robot requests permission from each activity sensing system in the home when it is ready to perform its away service tasks and does not initiate such activity until receiving a yes or permission granted message from each activity sensing system or from a single activity sensing system serving as a spokesman for all of the activity sensing systems . One advantage of the described embodiments that do not require a central event orchestrator is that there can optionally be more of an arms length relationship between the supplier s of the home security environmental control equipment on the one hand and the supplier s of the away service robot s on the other hand as it is only required that there is the described standard one way notification protocol or the described standard two way request permission protocol to be agreed upon by the respective suppliers.

According to still other embodiments the activity sensing systems are configured to detect sounds vibrations RF emissions or other detectable environmental signals or signatures that are intrinsically associated with the away service activity of each away service robot and are further configured such that no disturbance detected outcome will occur for as long as that particular detectable signal or environmental signature is detected. By way of example a particular kind of vacuum cleaning away service robot may emit a specific sound or RF signature. For one embodiment the away service environmental signatures for each of a plurality of known away service robots are stored in the memory of the activity sensing systems based on empirically collected data the environmental signatures being supplied with the activity sensing systems and periodically updated by a remote update server. For another embodiment the activity sensing systems can be placed into a training mode for the particular home in which they are installed wherein they listen and learn the particular environmental signatures of the away service robots for that home during that training session and thereafter will suppress disturbance detected outcomes for intervals in which those environmental signatures are heard.

For still another embodiment which is particularly useful when the activity sensing system is associated with occupancy sensitive environmental control equipment rather than a home security system the activity sensing system is configured to automatically learn the environmental signatures for the away service robots by virtue of automatically performing correlations over time between detected environmental signatures and detected occupancy activity. By way of example for one embodiment an intelligent automated nonoccupancy triggered setback thermostat such as the Nest Learning Thermostat can be configured to constantly monitor for audible and RF activity as well as to perform infrared based occupancy detection. In particular view of the fact that the environmental signature of the away service robot will remain relatively constant from event to event and in view of the fact that the away service events will likely either a themselves be triggered by some sort of nonoccupancy condition as measured by the away service robots themselves or b will occur at regular times of day there will be patterns in the collected data by which the events themselves will become apparent and for which the environmental signatures can be readily learned. Generally speaking for this automatic learning embodiment in which the environmental signatures of the away service robots are automatically learned without requiring user interaction it is more preferable that a certain number of false triggers be tolerable over the course of the learning process. Accordingly this automatic learning embodiment is more preferable for application in occupancy sensitive environmental control equipment such as an automated setback thermostat rather than home security systems for the reason that a few false occupancy determinations may cause a few instances of unnecessary heating or cooling but will not otherwise have any serious whereas false home security alarms may have more serious consequences.

Although in some examples provided herein the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from the network connected smart devices of smart home environment of it should be appreciated that the devices and services platform communicates with and collects data from a plurality of smart home environments across the world. For example the central server or cloud computing system can collect home data from the network connected devices of one or more smart home environments where the network connected devices can routinely transmit home data or can transmit home data in specific instances e.g. when a device queries the home data . Thus the devices and services platform routinely collects data from homes across the world. As described the collected home data includes for example security data such as a map of the home and the respective network connected smart devices and their capabilities in each room alarm settings information contact information for the registered occupants of the home etc. The collected home data may also include for example power consumption data occupancy data HVAC settings and usage data carbon monoxide levels data carbon dioxide levels data volatile organic compounds levels data sleeping schedule data cooking schedule data inside and outside temperature humidity data television viewership data inside and outside noise level data etc.

The central server or cloud computing architecture can further provide one or more services such as security related services described herein. The services can include software updates customer support remote access remote or distributed control use suggestions e.g. based on collected home data to improve performance reduce utility cost etc. and or sensor data collection logging where sensor data and other data from network connected smart devices of smart home environments is collected and logged. For example the data collected and logged may include maps of homes maps of users in home movements from room to room as determined by network connected smart devices equipped with motion and or identification technology time spent in each room intra home occupancy maps that indicate which rooms are occupied and by whom at different times including in real time fire detection incidents false alarms CO data temperature data humidity data etc. According to embodiments in the event the data collected from the network connected smart devices of a smart home environment indicates that an alarm threshold for a particular home is being approached the services increases the frequency at which it collects and logs data from network connected devices in that home. For example in the event the data collected from network connected devices indicates activity in a kitchen of a smart home environment while the occupants are asleep then instead of collecting data from the network connected smart devices of the home in thirty second intervals the services collects data in ten second intervals. According to embodiments the data collected and logged may be provided to investigators after the occurrence of a crime fire etc. so that the data may be used to solve the crime determine the cause of the fire etc.

The services can further include for example remote access remote or distributed control security improvement suggestions e.g. provide suggestions for enhancing security of a home based on collected home data etc. software updates customer support etc. Data associated with the services can be stored and or logged at the central server or cloud computing system and the central server or the cloud computing system can retrieve and transmit the data at an appropriate time e.g. at regular intervals upon receiving request from a user etc. .

As illustrated in an embodiment of the extensible devices and services platform includes a processing engine which can be concentrated at a single server or distributed among several different computing entities without limitation. The processing engine can include engines configured to receive data from network connected smart devices of smart home environments e.g. via the Internet or a hubbed network to index the data to analyze the data and or to generate statistics based on the analysis or as part of the analysis. The analyzed data can be stored as derived home data .

Results of the analysis or statistics can thereafter be transmitted back to the network connected smart device s that provided home data used to derive the results to other network connected smart devices to a user mobile device to a server providing a webpage to the user s mobile device or to other non device entities. For example patterns and statistics summarizing data received from network connected smart devices can be generated by the processing engine and transmitted. The results or statistics can be provided via the Internet . In this manner the processing engine can be configured and programmed to derive a variety of useful information from the home data . A single server can include one or more engines.

The derived data can be highly beneficial at a variety of different granularities for a variety of useful purposes ranging from explicit programmed control of network connected smart devices on a per home per neighborhood or per region basis for example demand response programs for electrical utilities security related statistics unique to particular neighborhoods can be used to control particular network connected smart devices etc. to the generation of inferential abstractions that can assist on a per home basis for example an inference can be drawn that the homeowner has left for vacation and so security detection equipment can be put on heightened sensitivity to the generation of statistics and associated inferential abstractions that can be used for government or charitable purposes. For example processing engine can generate statistics about network connected smart device usage across a population of devices and send the statistics to device users service providers or other entities e.g. that have requested or may have provided monetary compensation for the statistics .

In some embodiments to encourage security related innovation and research and to increase security related and other products and services available to users the devices and services platform exposes a range of application programming interfaces APIs to third parties such as law enforcement agencies e.g. police or public and or private security entities governmental entities e.g. Health and Safety Agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration FDA the Environmental Protection Agency EPA etc. academic institutions e.g. university researchers businesses e.g. private security businesses or charities or utility companies or companies that may provide device warranties or service to related equipment targeting advertisers based on home data etc. emergency response providers such as fire and ambulance and other third parties. The APIs are coupled to and permit third party systems to communicate with the central server or the cloud computing system including the services the processing engine the home data and the derived home data . For example the APIs allow applications executed by the third parties to initiate specific data processing tasks that are executed by the central server or the cloud computing system as well as to receive dynamic updates to the home data and the derived home data .

For example third parties can develop programs and or applications such as web or mobile apps that integrate with the central server or the cloud computing system to provide services and information to users. Such programs and applications may be for example designed to help users reduce energy consumption to preemptively service faulty equipment to prepare for high service demands to track past service performance etc. or to secure their homes by performing any of a variety of beneficial functions or tasks now known or hereinafter developed. Examples include providing users with local crime news information and statistics safety tips and check lists such as tips for installing security lights door and window locks etc.

According to some embodiments third party applications make inferences from the home data and the derived home data such inferences may include when are occupants home when are they sleeping when are they in the den watching television when they shower. The answers to these questions may help third parties benefit consumers by providing them with interesting security related information products and services as well as with providing them with targeted advertisements. In one example a private security company creates an application that makes inferences regarding when people are away from home. The application uses the inferences to schedule private security officers to stop or drive by the home when people will most likely be away from home the application may also put the user s network connected smart devices in alarm mode notify trusted neighbors that the user is away etc.

In one example a business may be a shipping company that may create an application that makes inferences regarding when people are at home. The application uses the inferences to schedule deliveries for times when people will most likely be at home. The application can also build delivery routes around these scheduled times. This reduces the number of instances where the shipping company has to make multiple attempts to deliver packages and it reduces the number of times consumers have to pick up their packages from the shipping company e.g. as described below with respect to .

In some embodiments the devices and services platform exposes APIs to third parties such as businesses in exchange for revenue such as for a monthly fee similar to a subscription service. In one example the business may be a retail store that sells consumer products and building and construction supplies and materials including the network connected smart devices described above with reference to . In one example the retail store agrees to sell network connected smart devices at discount in exchange for free or discounted access to the APIs . The retails store can use the information from the APIs to better target their customers and increase sales. While the provider of the devices and services platform benefits from a proliferation of discounted network connected smart devices.

For example shows processing engine as including a number of paradigms . Processing engine can include a managed services paradigm that monitors and manages primary or secondary device functions. The device functions can include ensuring proper operation of a network connected smart device given user inputs detecting e.g. and responding to an intruder that has entered or is attempted to enter a dwelling e.g. security implementing or otherwise responding to energy demand response events detecting a failure of equipment coupled to a network connected smart device e.g. a light bulb having burned out passive IR senor having gone bad etc. or alerting a user of a current event or predicted future events.

Processing engine can further include an advertising communication paradigm that estimates characteristics e.g. demographic information time spent doing particular activities like cooking or watching television desires and or products of interest of a user based on device usage and or data received from network connected smart devices. Services promotions products or upgrades can then be offered or automatically provided to the user. Processing engine can further include a social paradigm that uses information from a social network provides information to a social network e.g. based on device usage and or processes data associated with user and or device interactions with the social network platform. For example a user s status as reported to their trusted contacts on the social network could be updated to indicate when they are home or away based on light detection security system inactivation or device usage detectors. As another example a user may be able to share device usage statistics with other users. As yet another example a user may share HVAC settings that result in low power bills and other users may download the HVAC settings to their smart thermostat to reduce their power bills.

The processing engine can include a challenges rules compliance rewards paradigm that informs a user of challenges competitions rules compliance regulations and or rewards and or that uses operation data to determine whether a challenge has been met a rule or regulation has been complied with and or a reward has been earned. The challenges rules or regulations can relate to efforts to conserve energy improve security in the home e.g. regularly lock door install adequate number of motion detectors or outdoor lights etc. to live safely e.g. reducing exposure to toxins or carcinogens to conserve money and or equipment life to improve health etc. For example one challenge may involve participants turning down their thermostat by one degree for one week or achieving a certain security score by properly equipping their home with security devices and services and properly using and maintaining those devices. Those that successfully complete the challenge are rewarded such as by coupons virtual currency status etc. Regarding compliance an example involves a parent making a safety and security rule that children are not permitted to leave the home alone after a specified curfew such as 9 00 PM. The network connected smart devices in the home could track the movement of the various occupants and send alerts to the parent when a child leaves the home alone after the curfew or when the child is away from home after the curfew. Regarding compliance another example involves a rental property owner making a rule that no renters are permitted to access certain owner s rooms. The devices in the room having occupancy sensors could send updates to the owner when the room is accessed.

The processing engine can integrate or otherwise utilize extrinsic information from extrinsic sources e.g. via the Internet such as weather forecasts prices of certain goods services neighborhood home information etc. to improve the functioning of one or more processing paradigms. Extrinsic information can be used to interpret data received from a network connected smart device to determine a characteristic of the environment near the device e.g. outside a structure that the device is enclosed in to determine services or products available to the user to identify a social network or social network information to determine contact information of entities e.g. public service entities such as an emergency response team the police or a hospital near the device etc. to identify statistical or environmental conditions trends or other information associated with a home or neighborhood and so forth.

An extraordinary range and variety of benefits can be brought about by and fit within the scope of the described extensible devices and services platform ranging from the ordinary to the profound. Thus in one ordinary example each bedroom of the smart home environment can be provided with a smart wall switch a smart wall plug and or smart hazard detectors all or some of which include an occupancy sensor wherein the occupancy sensor is also capable of inferring e.g. by virtue of motion detection facial recognition audible sound patterns e.g. voice detection etc. whether the occupant is asleep or awake. If a home intruder is detected the remote security monitoring service or police department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom and whether those occupants are still asleep or immobile and the real time location of the intruder in the home. Further video from the home can be broadcasted to video capable devices of the nearest security personnel and police so that the police can monitor the activity in the home while in route to the home. By way of another example the same data that is being used for home security can also be repurposed by the processing engine in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood security. Thus for example the same data discussed in the example above can be collected and made available for processing properly anonymized in which the crime patterns and home safety in a particular ZIP code can be tracked. If a serious fire event is sensed the remote security monitoring service or fire department is advised of how many occupants there are in each bedroom and whether those occupants are still asleep or immobile or whether they have properly evacuated the bedroom. While this is of course a very advantageous capability accommodated by the described extensible devices and services platform there can be substantially more profound examples that can truly illustrate the potential of a larger intelligence that can be made available. By way of perhaps a more profound example the same data bedroom occupancy data that is being used for fire safety can also be repurposed by the processing engine in the context of a social paradigm of neighborhood child development and education. Thus for example the same bedroom occupancy and motion data discussed in the ordinary example can be collected and made available for processing properly anonymized in which the sleep patterns of schoolchildren in a particular ZIP code can be identified and tracked. Localized variations in the sleeping patterns of the schoolchildren may be identified and correlated for example to different nutrition programs in local schools.

In some embodiments the devices and services platform provides a home security services into which users can enroll their smart home environments . The security services can be offered on a non commitment month to month basis. It should also be appreciated that the security services can be offered year to year or for lifetime. For example the security services can provide multi tiered offerings including offer basic plus and premium services. Basic services for example include basic intrusion detection and emergency personnel notification. For example the basic security services monitor incoming data from the network connected smart devices of the home to determine when a possible intrusion is occurring as indicated by motion detection outside the home information from the smart entry detectors indicating that any one of the doors or windows of the home have been opened etc. Upon detection the basic security services contact the occupants of the home and or local law enforcement. Plus security services for example monitor dangerous conditions in the home including smoke CO in addition to home invasion. Premium services include for example availing the home to the many benefits of neighbor security networks described below detecting when individuals in the home are in distress mimicking user patterns of turning on lights and appliances when the user is on vacation providing users with security scores and corresponding tips for improving the security of their home providing live video stream of activity in the home to the user when the user is away and to local law enforcement etc.

In some embodiments pricing for the security services or any suitable type of home insurance may vary depending on the security score of the home. As described below security score is based on information such as having adequate numbers and placement of network connected smart devices e.g. hazard detectors entry detectors etc. percentage of smart devices that have WiFi rather than low power communication protocols percentage of smart devices that are wired rather than battery powered number of strangers that visit the home etc. The higher the security score of the home the more secure the home and the cheaper the security services and or insurance may be. The devices and services platform according to embodiments provides suggestions regarding how to improve security scores and to incent users to improve their home s score the platform also indicates what discounts the user will receive if the user s home achieves a particular score.

In some embodiments upon receiving an enrollment request from a user the devices and services platform assess the capabilities of the network connected smart devices in the user s home and determines whether the requested services are appropriate for the user. For example if the user requests a premium service such as the capability to broadcast live video stream to law enforcement but the user only has but a couple of video enabled smart devices and or a limited WiFi network then the devices and services platform recommends that the user upgrade the smart devices in the home or select more basic services.

Examples of security related objectives will now be provided with reference to . In one security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices function as tripwires in the security system. In this example in the event one of the network connected smart devices detects motion heat sound etc. it sends a corresponding message through the mesh network e.g. from network connected smart device to network connected smart device and in some cases over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system which triggers an alarm if the security system is armed e.g. the occupants are away or asleep . In this example a user could enhance the security of the smart home environment by buying and installing extra network connected smart devices such as smart motion detectors and smart nightlights .

In another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with identification technology e.g. face recognition RFID ultrasonic sensors that fingerprints or creates a signature for the people animals and objects. The identification technology can be the same as or similar to the fingerprinting and signature creating techniques described in other sections of this application. In this example based on information received from the network connected smart devices the central server or cloud computing system stores a list of registered occupants and or guests of the home. When a person whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the central server or cloud computing system as a registered occupant or guest comes within range of or otherwise interacts with one of the network connected smart devices of the home the central server or cloud computing system logs that person s presence and if the security system is armed activates an alarm indicating the presence of an intruder. Further the central server or cloud computing system may reference maps of the smart home environment and schedules to whether the identified person animal or object is permitted to be in a particular area e.g. room of the house at a particular time and trigger an alarm accordingly.

In yet another security related example occupant location data e.g. GPS data IPS data etc. is used to achieve home security objectives. According to embodiments the occupants of a home e.g. the individuals who live in or frequently visit the home register their respective mobile devices as being associated with the home and the central server or cloud computing system tracks the occupants movement inside and outside of the home based on occupant location data received from the mobile devices . The central server or cloud computing system uses this tracking information to make inferences regarding the current and future occupancy of the home and or rooms and to control the network connected smart devices inside the home in a corresponding manner. For example outdoor lights can be turned on when it is determined that an occupant is returning home or the smart doorknobs can be locked and the security system can be armed when the occupant is leaving home. Also for example the threshold for notifying authorities of an emergency can be adjusted depending on whether an occupant having a registered mobile device is at home. For example if the registered occupant is at home when an alarm condition e.g. fire distressed person home invasion is detected a message can be sent to the occupant s mobile device requesting confirmation that everything is okay. The authorities will only be notified if the registered occupant responds confirming that there is an emergency or if the registered occupant does not respond within a timeout period. On the other hand if an alarm condition is detected and there are not registered occupants at home then the authorities are immediately notified and a concurrent message is sent to the mobile devices of the registered occupants.

In some instances the central server or cloud computing system receives occupant location data directly from the mobile devices whereas in other instances the data is received from an intermediary such as one of the network connected smart devices in the home. In instances where occupant location data is received directly from the mobile device the central server or cloud computing system can determine if the occupant is at home or away based on whether the received occupant location data corresponds with the location of the home. What s more in some embodiments the central server or cloud computing system can use the occupant location data received directly from the mobile devices to determine the occupant s actual room location e.g. bedroom kitchen garage etc. . To do so for example the central server or cloud computing system cross references the received occupant location data e.g. GPS data IPS data etc. with a map of the home. On the other hand in instances where occupant location data is received from network connected smart devices the central server or cloud computing system can infer that the occupant is in the room where the network connected smart device is located. Network connected smart devices can detect mobile devices via WiFi Bluetooth NFC etc.

It should also be appreciated that passive RFID tags rather than or in addition to mobile devices can be used to determine the room location of occupants and pets . For example an RFID is associated with each of the occupants and pets of the house such as by including the tags in wallets bracelets wristbands mobile devices collars etc. The network connected smart devices in the various rooms detect the RFID tags and send that information to the central server or cloud computing system .

According to an embodiment the determined room location of an occupant is used determine which user controls to provide to the occupant s mobile device when the occupant uses the mobile device to control the smart home environment . In other words a different menu is displayed to the occupant depending on the occupant s location in the home. For example if the occupant is located in the garage then the displayed menu gives the occupant the option to turn up or down sensitivity of the smart entry detector of the garage door. Also for example if the occupant is in the kitchen then the displayed menu gives the occupant the option to adjust the smoke detection sensitivity of the smart hazard detector in the kitchen. This might enable the occupant to cook without triggering a smoke alarm condition. Further for example if the occupant is located in a bedroom then the displayed menu may give the occupant the option to lock the smart doorknob and arm the alarm system.

In the event all occupants of the smart home environment register their mobile device as being associated with the home the central server and cloud computing systems can infer that strangers are in the home when unknown mobile devices are detected. For example if the network connected smart devices detected two people in the home and both of those people are associated with registered mobile devices then it can be inferred that no strangers are in the home. However if three people are detected in the home but only two people are associated with registered mobile devices then it can be inferred that there is one stranger in the home. A home may be considered less secure when there are unregistered mobile devices in the home and when there are more occupants than registered devices. For example a home that is undergoing a remodel and that has dozens of unregistered construction workers with unregistered mobile devices coming and going is less secure than a home where all occupants are associated with registered mobile devices and where there are no unregistered mobile devices in the home.

According to some embodiments occupants can use their registered mobile devices to access the smart home environment . For example the smart doorknob and the mobile device may be capable of communicating via near field communication NFC BLUETOOTH or some other short ranger wireless protocol. To gain access to the home e.g. cause the smart doorknob to unlock the mobile device of the user may transmit an access code to the smart doorknob which then verifies with the server that the person is a registered occupant.

Turning to another security related example the mesh network can be used to track a person s movement as the person transitions from room to room. As such the central server or cloud computing system knows which room in the smart home environment is occupied and by whom e.g. using identification technology at all times. For example the low powered and spokesman nodes e.g. network connected smart devices and detect the person s movement through the smart home environment and communicate corresponding messages through the mesh network. Using the messages that indicate which rooms are occupied the central server or cloud computing system logs the information for later use and or instructs various smart devices in the home to perform certain operations such as turn on and off lights lock the smart doorknobs sound alarms notify public safety authorities and the home owner etc. as the person enters and exits rooms.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system can review the logged information about the occupants movement in the home to detect signature patterns of movement unique to the various occupants. These signature patterns help the central server or cloud computing system detect strangers in the home. For example if an individual is quickly moving from room to room at a time when occupants typically are not at home and according to a pattern that is not associated with any of the occupants the central server or cloud computing system may infer that this individual is a burglar moving from room to room searching for valuable items.

In yet another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with WiFi BLUETOOTH NFC and or other wireless communication capability. Accordingly in the event one or more burglars enter the home carrying on their person their mobile devices e.g. smart phones the network enabled smart home devices upon detecting the home invasion condition automatically interrogate a burglar s mobile device to try and extract as much useful information as possible about the burglar including but not limited to the MAC address of their phone their cell number and or anything else that their mobile device will divulge about itself or the burglar. In addition an alarm message could be sent to the occupant s mobile device and also to a security service or police etc. containing some or all of this information. According to embodiments the smart home environment and or the security service that monitors the smart home environment can automatically connect with a wireless telephone carrier to determine which mobile devices are currently communicating with the cell tower s nearest the burglarized home. The wireless telephone carriers could automatically generate a suspect list that would necessarily include the burglar s mobile device.

According to embodiments the smart home environment includes a small cellular base station such as a picocell or microcell. Such cellular base stations provide great LTE 3G 4G etc. data rates in the home and in some cases could replace or supplement WiFi. This base station could provide a cellular backup to call emergency personnel such as fire police in the event of an emergency. Also referring to the scenario above in the event a burglar is inside the home the base station could capture all unique IDs e.g. mac imei serial number from the burglar s mobile device.

In another security related example some or all of the network connected smart devices are equipped with video cameras. In this case the network connected smart devices can transmit video to the central server and cloud computing system which can make the video available to client devices such as the user device in the form of a live or prerecorded video stream. An occupant when away from the home can use their user device to connect to the central server and cloud computing system to receive live or prerecorded video of activity occurring in the home. In some embodiments central server and cloud computing system automatically provides video from the network connected smart device that is observing the most activity. For example if there is an intruder in the house the central server and cloud computing system can detect which room is experiencing the most activity e.g. based on noise and motion and provide video from that room. It should also be appreciated that the central server and cloud computing system can provide for display on the user device a grid of cameras in the home to choose from. In this case the central server and cloud computing system can highlight which camera is observing the most activity so that the user knows that camera is likely the best one to select. It should also be appreciated that the network connected smart devices have a microphone and speaker and that two way voice communication can be established between the network connected smart device and the user device . For example the two way voice communication can be over internet protocol. This allows users to see and talk to home occupants when the user is away from home.

According to an embodiment in moments of distress the network connected smart devices can broadcast a live video stream to nearby emergency personnel such as police and fire departments. For example upon detecting an intruder or some other emergency occurring in the home or upon someone pressing a panic button in the home live video can be broadcast to nearby emergency personnel such as police fire medical and other first responders. The video for example is transmitted from the room where the most activity is occurring or where the button was pressed. In some cases the video is transmitted directly to the police car that is responding to the call e.g. the closest police car . It should be appreciated that rather than broadcast the video may be provided via a secure stream using secure sockets layer SSL . It should also be appreciated that the security score of the home may be adjusted based on whether the home has the requisite SSL certificates in place to support the secure video stream to emergency personnel.

According to an embodiment the network connected smart devices function as nanny cams . In one example when the nearest network connected smart device detects that a sleeping child has woken it will turn on its camera and microphone speaker. The network connected smart device will then send a message to the user device of the parent home occupant who can accept the message to establish live video of the child and two way audio communication. It should be appreciated that live two way video communication can also be established. In the case the network connected smart device can project a video of the user include a video screen for display of video of the parent and or control a nearby television or monitor to display video of the user. The network connected smart device can detect when the child goes back to sleep and can automatically shut down the video and or audio.

According to embodiments some or all of the network connected devices are equipped with pressure sensors such as digital air pressure sensors digital barometric pressure sensors etc. These pressure sensors may be for example resonant types that measure changes in air density thermal types that measure changes in thermal conductivity of air ionization types that measure changes in the flow of ions in air and or force collector types e.g. bellow diaphragm piston etc. that measure deflection. One example security related application for these pressure sensors to detect opening and closing of doors as well as occupant movement in the house by sensing pressure variation patterns associated with such activities. For example when a door opens or closes the pressure sensors of the network connected smart devices would record the associated pressure variation. The central server and cloud computing system upon reviewing the recorded pressure variation can determine the activity associated with the pressure variation. For example pressure variation in a first range may indicate that an adult occupant walked through a doorway while transitioning from one room to another while pressure in a second range may indicate that a particular door internal or external opened or closed.

According to embodiments the smart home environment learns over time what activity corresponds with particular pressure variations detected by particular network connected smart devices in the home. For example a smart hazard detector located in a foyer near the front door of a home can learn that it is located near an external door. For example during initial installation the smart hazard detector can ask the installing user to indicate the room e.g. kitchen den foyer hallway etc. in which it is being installed and whether it is proximate to an external door. Later when it senses a pressure variation a message can be sent to an occupant s user device asking Was the external door near the foyer just opened Yes No Did an occupant just walk through the foyer Yes No . After the smart hazard detector learns which pressure differentials are associated with which activities it can contribute to home security. For example the smart home environment automatically goes into security mode when it determines that all occupants are in bed for the night or that all occupants are away from the home. When in this security mode if the smart hazard detector in the foyer senses a pressure differential that indicates the external door has just been opened it triggers the alarm.

According to embodiments the occupants of the home can pre program the smart home environment to broadcast specific alarms in response to specific detected conditions. For example in the event of smoke detection the smart home environment can broadcast via the network connected smart devices and or the home appliances such as television and stereos a pre recorded message from the occupant notifying the occupants of a possible fire and providing emergency exit instructions. In another example in case of detected home invasion the smart home environment can broadcast a message to the intruders notifying them that their presence has been detected that the occupants possess and are trained to use firearms to protect their home that the police have been notified etc.

According to embodiments the thresholds for triggering these alarms can be varied based on activities occurring in the home. More particularly technologies including the sensors of the network enabled smart devices in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided by the central server and cloud computer system are used to vary alarm thresholds based on the occupants activities. Inferences about the occupants activities can be learned based on data received over time. For example if the smart hazard detector located in the kitchen observes increased temperature humidity and motion in the kitchen then an inference can be made that one or more of the occupants are cooking cooking inference . These data inputs can be considered on a sliding scale based on time of day and day of week. For example only slight increases in temperature and humidity may invoke the cooking inference at 5 pm on weekdays when history shows that is when the occupants typically cook. However much larger increases are required to invoke the cooking inference at 10 am on a weekday when the occupants are typically away at that time. In some embodiments the smoke alarm threshold is varied when the cooking inference is made. For example the smart hazard detector in the kitchen becomes less sensitive when one of the occupants is cooking whereas the hazard detectors in other rooms remain in normal operation.

In other embodiments alarm thresholds are varied based on human population in the home. Inferences about human population in the home can be made based on sensed changes in motion temperature CO noise air pressure differentials frequency of door openings and closings etc. According to one example in the event of detecting a concurrent increase in temperature motion noise and CO an inference can be made than there is a higher than normal human population in the home high population inference . Certain alarm thresholds may be adjusted when a high population inference is made. For example the alarm threshold for CO can be increased to account for the high number of CO emitting humans in the home and to avoid triggering a false CO alarm. In another example the security system can be disarmed so that guests can freely transition from room to room and in and out of external doors without triggering the alarm. On the other hand the alarm threshold for smoke detection can be decreased so that the smoke detectors are more sensitive than usual. This is to protect the large number of people in the home from fire. In other examples the network connected thermostat may adjust the temperature of the home to a standard temperature that is comfortable for most people. For example if the occupants like the house to be cool and teach the network connected thermostat to maintain the home at a cooler temperature then in the event of a high occupancy inference the network connected thermostat can adjust up to a temperature that is comfortable for most people. Similarly for example if the occupants like the house to be warm and teach the network connected thermostat to maintain the home at a warmer temperature then in the event of a high occupancy inference the network connected thermostat can adjust down to a temperature that is comfortable for most people.

According to embodiments alarm thresholds can be varied based on proximity of law enforcement and other emergency personnel. For example if a law enforcement office is nearby the threshold for the home invasion alarm condition can be increased. This may be applicable in apartments of buildings that have private security including a doorman.

According to some embodiments an occupancy emulator can be provided to emulate the occupants of a smart home environment when the occupants are away such as on vacation. For example the smart wall switches and or the smart wall plugs can function as an occupancy emulator by learning the occupants patterns of turning on and off lights appliances etc. and mimicking those patterns when the occupants are away.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system processes artificial intelligence algorithms capable of making rules based or learning based inferences based on sensed patterns of user control of network connected smart devices optionally in conjunction with sensed home conditions or other sensed user behaviors. By way of example for one embodiment one or more of the smart wall switches is configured to process information acquired by home occupancy sensing devices in conjunction with information from light switch control behaviors of the user to produce a result in which the smart wall switches are automatically self programmed to help the user turn off and on lights according to a preferred schedule and to mimic the user s patterns when the user is away. This automatic self programming can also be applied to smart wall plugs which can learn when to turn on and off lamps as well as appliances such as televisions and stereos. Further it should be appreciated that all network connected smart devices can automatically self program.

In one example the artificial intelligence algorithms can be configured to sense whether there have been a threshold number of days over the past month or other evaluation period for which at roughly the same time of day X o clock the user has turned on or off the same or roughly the same set of smart wall switches and or smart wall plugs to turn on or off the same or roughly the same lights and or appliances in the home. If such a pattern has been detected the user can be sent a message on their smartphone allowing them to opt in to a setting in which one or more the relevant smart wall switches and or smart wall plugs will be automatically turned on or off so as to turn on or off the relevant lights and or appliances at about X o clock. It should be appreciated that the smart home environment could learn and emulate other patterns. For example it could learn when the dog barks such as when a person is within 100 feet of the home or when an occupant returns home from work at about X o clock and then record and play back barking sounds at appropriate times. It should also learn when to open and close the garage door to give the appearance that the occupant is going and coming to and from the home.

By way of example the opt in message can say When you are not at home I can emulate your presence by automatically turning on the lights and television in the den at about X o clock on weekdays for about two hours and at about Y o clock on weekends for about three hours. It might better secure your home by deterring home invasions Would you like me to do this for you YES NO . The user can then opt in to this functionality and or modify the schedule and opt in to the modified schedule. If the user s schedule changes the artificial intelligence algorithms can learn the new schedule and make the proper adjustments. Thus in accordance with the described embodiment the collection of smart home sensors is configured to automatically learn selected user behaviors to emulate the user s patterns when the user is away and to automatically learn changes in the user s schedule and make corresponding adjustments.

According to some embodiments security of the smart home environment can be further enhanced by predicting through inferences when the user intends to leave the home and raising away preparedness measures. To accomplish this artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of making rules based or learning based inferences about when the user intends to leave the home based on sensed patterns of user control of smart home devices optionally in conjunction with sensed home conditions or other sensed user behaviors. By way of example for one embodiment one or more of the light switches is configured to process information acquired by home occupancy sensing devices in conjunction with information from light switch control behaviors of the user to predict when the user intends to leave the home. More particularly the artificial intelligence algorithms can be configured to sense whether there have been a threshold number of weekdays over the past month or other evaluation period for which at roughly the same time of day X o clock i the user has turned off a same or roughly same set of active light switches in the home including the front door light switch over a five minute period or other pre departure period and ii this event was followed by an extended period of non occupancy such as at least one hour of non occupancy. If such pattern has been detected the user can be sent a message on their smartphone allowing them to opt in to a setting in which if the light switch near the front door is turned off at about X o clock on a weekday the set of active light switches will be automatically turned off as well. By way of example the opt in message can say If you turn off the light switch near the front door at about X o clock on weekdays I can automatically turn off the rest of the lights for you that you have been turning off manually at about that time. It might save you a few steps Would you like me to do this for you YES NO The user can then opt in to this functionality. If the user s schedule changes and they end up not wanting this functionality later on the artificial intelligence algorithms can readily unlearn it by virtue of detecting a punishing or undo action by the user in which the next time the user turns off the front door light switch they simply walk to one of the automatically turned on light switches and turn it off within five minutes or other undo interval . Thus in accordance with the described embodiment the collection of smart home sensors is configured to automatically learn selected user behaviors to assist the user with certain tasks when selected qualifying behaviors are observed and to automatically stop providing such assistance when one or more straightforward undo actions are taken by the user. Additionally or alternatively if such a pattern has been detected the central server and cloud computing system makes an inference that the user intends to leave the home soon. Responsive to this inference the sensitivity of the network connected smart devices can be increased in anticipation of the user s imminent departure from the home. For example the threshold for triggering an alarm indicating a home invasion can be reduced. It should be appreciated that the pattern of turning off lights is merely an example and that other patterns exist on which imminent departure inferences can be made.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart devices located in the mesh network of the smart home environment in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud computing system are used to provide a personal smart alarm clock for individual occupants of the home. According to embodiments the smart alarm clock is capable of monitoring weather and traffic data and adjust the user s wakeup time to account for delays that could be caused by bad traffic and weather. For example user occupants can communicate with the central server or cloud computing system via their mobile devices to access an interface for the smart alarm clock. There occupants can turn on their smart alarm clock and input a wake time for the next day and or for additional days. In some embodiments the occupant may have the option of setting a specific wake time for each day of the week as well as the option of setting some or all of the inputted wake times to repeat . Artificial intelligence will be used to consider the occupant s response to these alarms when they go off and make inferences about the user s preferred sleep patterns over time. In some embodiments the occupant may have the option of setting a specific time at which the user would like to arrive at a particular destination. The user may input information about the destination and its location such as its address. Artificial intelligence will be used to determine how long it typically takes the occupant to wake up and get ready to leave the home. This information will be considered in combination with traffic on the route to the occupant s specified destination and weather conditions to determine what time to wake the occupant so that the occupant will arrive at the destination at the specified time.

According to embodiments the network connected smart device in the smart home environment that happens to be closest to the occupant when the occupant falls asleep will be the device that transmits messages regarding when the occupant stopped moving from which the central server or cloud computing system will make inferences about where and when the occupant prefers to sleep. This closest network connected smart device will be the device that sounds the alarm to wake the occupant in time to arrive at the specified destination accounting for traffic and weather conditions and how long it typically takes the occupant to get ready in the mornings. In this manner the smart alarm clock will follow the occupant throughout the house by tracking the individual occupants based on their unique signature which is determined based on data obtained from sensors located in the smart devices. For example the sensors include ultrasonic sensors passive IR sensors and the like. The unique signature is based on a combination of walking gate patterns of movement voice height size etc. It should be appreciated that facial recognition may also be used.

According to embodiments in the event of bad weather such as rain snow sleet ice etc. the smart alarm clock can communicate via the central server and or could computing system with the occupants automobile and thereby instruct the automobile to automatically shift into all wheel drive when the user starts up the automobile to drive to the destination. It should also be appreciated that in cold winter conditions the smart home environment can instruct the automobile to warm up and defrost while the occupant is getting ready for work or to leave the home.

According to an embodiment the wake times associated with the smart alarm clock are used by the smart thermostat to control the HVAC in an efficient manner so as to pre heat or cool the house to the occupant s desired sleeping and awake temperature settings. The preferred settings can be learned over time such as be observing which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to before going to sleep and which temperature the occupant sets the thermostat to upon waking up.

According to an embodiment a device is positioned proximate to the occupant s bed such as on an adjacent nightstand and collects data as the occupant sleeps using noise sensors motion sensors e.g. ultrasonic IR and optical etc. Data may be obtained by the other smart devices in the room as well. Such data may include the occupant s breathing patterns heart rate movement etc. Inferences are made based on this data in combination with data that indicates when the occupant actually wakes up. For example if on a regular basis the occupant s heart rate breathing and moving all increase by 5 to 10 twenty to thirty minutes before the occupant wakes up each morning then predictions can be made regarding when the occupant is going to wake. Other devices in the home can use these predictions to provide other smart home objectives such as adjusting the smart thermostat so as to pre heat or cool the home to the occupant s desired setting before the occupant wakes up. Further these predictions can be used to set the smart alarm clock for the occupant to turn on lights etc.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart devices location through the smart home environment in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at the central server or cloud computing system are used to detector or monitor the progress of Alzheimer s Disease. For example the unique signatures of the occupants are used to track the individual occupants movement throughout the smart home environment . This data can be aggregated and analyzed to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer s. Oftentimes individuals with Alzheimer s have distinctive patterns of migration in their homes. For example a person will walk to the kitchen and stand there for a while then to the living room and stand there for a while and then back to the kitchen. This pattern will take about thirty minutes and then the person will repeat the pattern. According to embodiments the remote servers or cloud computing architectures analyze the person s migration data collected by the mesh network of the smart home environment to identify such patterns.

 Mapping the smart home environment provides a number of advantages. For example informed by a map of the smart home environment the central server and cloud computing system can determine a distressed occupant s or an intruder s location in the home and notify emergency personnel regard the same. This enables emergency personnel to quickly find distressed people or intruders upon entering the home. In other examples the central server and cloud computer system determines an emergency exit route for each room of the home. In the event an alarm is activated e.g. when one or more of the smart hazard detectors detects smoke and activates an alarm the central server or cloud computing system uses occupancy information obtained from the network connected smart devices in the home to determine which rooms are occupied and then turns on lights e.g. nightlights wall switches wall plugs that power lamps etc. along exit routes from the occupied rooms so as to provide emergency exit lighting. These are just a few example advantages of mapping the home and it should be appreciated that there are an unlimited number of advantages.

According to embodiments mapping of the home can be done automatically. For example a map may be generated based on positional information obtained from the nodes of the mesh network e.g. positional information from the network connected smart devices is used to construct a map of the house . According to this example the individual network smart devices obtain or determine their location upon being installed or at some other time and send the location information to the central server or cloud computing system or to a mapping application on the mobile device of a user. For example when installed a network connected smart device can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth. In other examples a smart device can provide the user with instructions such as Press button once if I am in the kitchen press twice if I am in the den etc. Also for example the smart devices may be capable of determining their GPS coordinates and or transmitting WiFi location or cellphone tower location information. The central server or cloud computing system or the mapping application on the mobile device uses this information to automatically construct a map of the home. In some examples a robot discussed below in detail roams free in the house and sends mapping information to the application on the mobile device or to the central server or cloud computing system which uses the mapping information to construct a map of the home. For example the robot could be put into a mapping mode where it obtains location data as it moves along the walls of each room in the house and then sends the location data to the application on the mobile device or to the central server or cloud computing system which uses the mapping information to construct a map of the home.

According to other embodiments an indoor positioning system IPS could be used to map the smart home environment . For example a user could launch a mapping application on the mobile device that uses IPS to create a map of the home. In this case the user would walk along the walls of the home and the mobile device would collect location information using IPS and or other indoor localization techniques and use that information to construct a map of the home or send the collected information to the central server or could computer system which creates the map. It should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to using IPS and or other indoor localization techniques the application on the mobile device could use the mobile device s gyroscope magnetometer accelerometer and altimeter to obtain location information.

According to still other embodiments RFID tags are used to map the smart home environment . For example RFID tags are placed throughout the home. Upon placing the tag the user could scan the tag using the mobile device which would launch an application instructing the user to input location information. Also for example instead of instructing the user to input location information the mobile device could determine its own location e.g. using any techniques known to those having skill in the art such as GPS at the time of the scan and associate that location information with the tag.

According to embodiments in the event of an alarm condition a map of the smart home environment is sent to emergency responders. For example upon detecting the emergency event such as an intruder or a distressed occupant the central server and cloud computing services sends a map e.g. a map created as described above of the smart home environment along with an indication of where on the map the emergency event is occurring. This map can be displayed in the vehicles or on mobile devices of emergency responders so that they can review the map in advance of entering the home. This will enable them to quickly find the appropriate location upon entering the home.

According to embodiments smart home environments can be grouped into neighborhood security networks and information can be shared among smart home environments in the same neighborhood. For example in the event one smart home environment experiences a fire an intrusion a missing child a medical emergency or some other type of emergency or notable event notification is sent to other smart home environments in the same neighborhood. Such neighborhood security networks enable smart home environments to communicate with one another in real time or near real time about emergencies and other important events happening in the neighborhood. This real time communication enables network connected smart devices in non affected smart home environments to make appropriate security and safety related responses that minimize or eliminate impact from the emergency event such as lock the smart doorknob arming security systems turning on outdoor and indoor lights to deter home invasion sounding alarms to wake up and warn sleeping occupants of a nearby fire etc. In some cases these responses can even resolve or help resolve emergency events such as by using identification technology to locate a missing child or turning on outdoor lighting so that law enforcement can locate and apprehend fleeing criminals.

A number of different techniques may be used to create neighborhood security networks. According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computing architecture automatically creates the neighborhoods based on a combination of neighborhood criteria information such as geographic location of the homes demographic information about occupants of the homes and opt in information about which types of alerts the homes wish to receive. Geographic location information may include home address ZIP code GPS coordinates Win location information cellular tower location information etc. Demographic information about the occupants may include age gender health special needs etc. Opt in information may include fire alerts home invasion alerts missing children alerts missing pets alerts missing property alerts earthquake alerts etc. According to embodiments the network connected smart devices of smart home environments provide the neighborhood criteria information to the central server or cloud computing architecture upon registration and or during ongoing use and the central server or cloud computing architecture logs and stores the neighborhood criteria information as the home data the derived home data and or other data.

According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computer architecture correlates network connected smart devices using the geographic location information and therefore creates the neighborhoods based on geo proximity such that homes in close proximity to one another are grouped into the same neighborhood. It is possible that each smart home environment has its own neighborhood that includes other homes within a predefined radius. This way each home is in the middle of its neighborhood and benefits from being surrounded by neighbors rather than being on the edge of a neighborhood. The geographic reach of the neighborhood may vary based on the type of event or emergency in question. For example in the event a home experiences a fire the central server or cloud computer architecture creates a neighborhood that includes all homes within a one mile radius whereas if a child goes missing then the neighborhood can include all homes within a ten mile radius or all homes in a particular ZIP code city county etc.

According to some embodiments the central server or cloud computer architecture creates neighborhoods based on demographic information. For example in the event a teenage child of one smart home environment is out past his or her curfew the created neighborhood consists of nearby homes where teenagers are members of the household. This way notice that the teenager is out past his or her curfew is sent to the homes of the neighborhood and the teenager can be located if he or she is out visiting another teenager whose home is in the same neighborhood . In another example in the event an occupant of a particular home contracts the flu or some other communicable illness the created neighborhood consists of nearby homes where small children or elderly adults live. In this example a notice is sent to the other homes in the neighborhood so that precautionary measure can be taken to help prevent the young children and elderly adults from contracting the illness.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing architecture automatically identifies smart homes within a radius of the home experiencing the emergency or event and sends an alarm to the identified homes. In such instances the other homes in the neighborhood do not have to sign up for or register to be a part of a safety network but instead are notified of emergency or event based on their proximity to the location of the emergency or event. This creates robust and evolving neighborhood security watch networks such that if one person s home is getting broken into an alarm can be sent to nearby homes such as by audio announcements via the smart devices located in those homes.

However it should be appreciated the neighborhood security networks can be opt in services and that in addition to or instead of the central server or cloud computing architecture selecting which homes to send alerts to individuals can subscribe to participate in such networks and individuals can specify which homes they want to receive alerts from and the types of alerts to be received. This can include for example the homes of family members who live in different cities such that individuals can receive alerts when their loved ones in other locations are experiencing an emergency or other types of events. In some examples homes having children can subscribe or opt in to be a part of a neighborhood that sends alerts when children are missing or out past curfew. Further homes having elderly people can subscribe or opt in to be a part of a neighborhood that sends alerts regarding their elderly peers and attempt to form a community that looks out for the security safety and health of its members.

According to embodiments before a smart home environment is included in a neighborhood security network an opt in message is sent to the home owner such as via the home owner s mobile device . The home owner is provided with information about the other homes in the neighborhood the basis on which the neighborhood security network was formed e.g. geographic location family relationships demographic information etc. the types of information that will be shared with other homes in the neighborhood security network e.g. occupants away on vacation potential invasion missing child etc. .

As discussed notification of an emergency or event occurring in one home can trigger responses in other homes in the neighborhood . For example in the event of a burglary in one home the central server or cloud computing architecture instructs the network connected smart devices of the other smart home environments in the neighborhood to turn on outside lights to lock the smart doorknob and window latches to arm the security system etc. Also for example in the event smoke is detected in one home in the neighborhood the central server or cloud computing architecture can increase the sensitivity of the smoke detecting components of other smart hazard detectors in the neighborhood. In this example the neighborhood may include all units in the same apartment or condominium building. Further for example in the event a dog goes missing in one home the network connected smart devices of other homes in the neighborhood can be tuned to detect motions that indicate a dog. In this example if a dog is detected by an outdoor network connected smart device that does not typically detect dogs then a message can be sent to the home of the missing dog indicating that a stray dog was detected and providing the location of the detection. Further in some examples a RFID tag may be provided on the dog s collar and the network connected smart device of the other homes in the neighborhood may locate the dog by reading the RFID tag and give the location of the dog upon request. RFID tags may be placed on other property too such as bicycles such that other property may be located in a similar manner.

According to embodiments individuals may manually broadcast messages to other homes in the neighborhood . For example when a family is leaving for vacation they can cause the central server and cloud computing system to send a notification to a network of trusted neighbors. This network can be manually defined or inferred.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system may obtain and store identifying information such as facial recognition data for the occupants of the smart home environments . In this case when a recognized individual who is an occupant of one of the smart home environments is approaching an external door such as the front door of another smart home environment the smart doorbell via the processing capabilities of the central server or cloud computing system is able to recognize the approaching individual and announce his presence. For example the approaching individual s name and or status as being a neighbor may be announced a video of him approaching may be displayed and or his image such as a photograph taken from his social networking account may be displayed inside the smart home environment .

According to embodiments a security score may be calculated for a smart home environment. In some examples a security score for a home is calculated by comparing the security features of the home against a list of security criterions to determine how many of the security criterions are satisfied. Higher scores indicate that a home satisfies a high number of security criterions and is therefore relatively secure whereas lower scores indicate that the home fails to satisfy many of the criterions. According to embodiments security scores can be normalized and scaled so that occupants of a home can compare the security of their home to other homes. For example a score of 0 to 100 can be used where 0 is the lowest possible score and 100 is the highest possible score. Further for example the central server or cloud computing system may generate a report or log that lists the security criterions and provides an indication of whether the home satisfies each of the criterions. Occupants can review this list to determine which criterions are not satisfied and then make the appropriate improvements to the home so as to increase the home s security score. Additionally the central server or cloud computing system can use this log to generate a list of suggestions for improving the home. It can prioritize the list based on which criterions are associated with the most points indicate which creation can be easily and cheaply satisfied with only minor improvement and indicate which unsatisfied criterions are typically satisfied in other homes. For example the central server or cloud computing system can send the following message to an occupant s electronic device We notice that you often leave the front door unlocked. Most homes in your neighborhood keep the front door locked at all times. Locking your front door at night is an easy and inexpensive way to improve your home s security and to improve your security score. Example security criterions for assessing the security of and calculating a security score are discussed below. However it should be appreciated that any number and combination of security criterions can be used when assessing security and calculating a security score for a home.

One example security criterion is whether the home has a requisite number of network connected smart devices such as smart hazard detectors smart entry detectors etc. The requisite number can be determined based on the size of the home the number of bedrooms in the home the configuration of the home single story two story the number of occupants living in the home the laws rules and regulations of the jurisdiction s where the home is located etc. In some cases this information can be automatically obtained from public real estate databases. For example the central server and or cloud computing services can access a public real estate database s to obtain the size location configuration number of bedrooms bathrooms etc. The central server and or cloud computing services can also access the home data to determine how many network connected smart devices are located in the home and compare that number to the requisite number to determine whether the criterion is satisfied.

Another example security criterion is whether the various types of network connected smart devices are properly located in the home. For example for this criterion the central server and or cloud computing services can determine whether a smart entry detector is located at each window and external door whether a smart hazard detector with smoke and motion detecting capabilities is located in all of the appropriate locations such as one in the kitchen and at least one on each floor of the home whether the doorbell of the home is a smart doorbell with the security capabilities described herein whether the wall switches are smart wall switches whether the wall plugs are smart wall plugs etc. The central server and or cloud computing services can make these determinations by reviewing the home data to obtain information about the location and capabilities of the various network connected smart devices in the home and comparing that information against a map of the home. The map can be generated according to the example techniques described herein.

In some embodiments a security criterion is whether the house has been mapped . As discussed elsewhere herein maps of the homes can be created and stored in the home data . Mapping improves security not only because it enables the central server and or cloud computing services to determine whether the home has an adequate number of appropriate located network connected smart devices but it also enables the central server and or cloud computing services to pinpoint within the home where a security event is taking place and to provide that information for emergency responders. Another example security criterion is the average amount of time it takes first responders to get to the home after an alarm has been triggered. This information can be averaged based on data from nearby homes. If the response time is fast then the security score of the home is increased.

Other example security criteria may be related to the capabilities and configurations of the respective network connected smart devices in the home. For example the central server and or cloud computing services can access and review the home data to determine whether the network connected smart devices are wired rather than battery operated whether the batteries are sufficiently charged whether they are WiFi enabled and connected to a strong and reliable WiFi network whether the CO date codes of the smart hazard detectors are up to date whether there is cellular backup in the event WiFi goes down etc. Another example criterion is whether the hub spokesman node in the home is wired rather than battery operated .

In some embodiments the central server and or cloud computing services can review the security logs for the house provided in the home data to assess whether the occupants are keeping the home secure. For example one security criterion that can be considered during this review is whether a door or window was left unlocked overnight. Another example criterion is the number of strangers that visit the house on a regular basis. This can be determined per the discussion above by detecting strangers based on the number of unregistered mobile device and or occupants in the home. The more strangers that visit the less secure the home and the lower the security score. On the other hand if the home occupants regularly consist of just registered occupants then the more secure the home and the higher the security score. Another example security criterion is the number of unregistered mobile devices that come into contact with the home on a regular basis. This can be particularly relevant for apartments condos and homes in densely populated areas where strangers are frequently nearby. One way the central server and or cloud computing services can make this determination is by reviewing the number of unrecognized mac addresses that contact the router of the home s WiFi network. In some examples for those homes located in apartment and condo buildings and in densely populated areas the mac addresses of the neighbors mobile devices can be factored out over time. For example if the same mac address is seen on a regular basis then it can be assumed that that device is associated with a neighbor and will not be used to lower the security score of the home.

Other example security criteria involve how readily the occupants or non resident individuals who are in a position to confirm whether an alarm condition is false can be contacted in the event of an alarm condition. Here for example the central server and or cloud computing services considers whether the occupants of the home have verified their contact information. For example this may include determining whether and which of the occupants have provided their emergency contact information e.g. mobile telephone number to the central server and or cloud computing services . The security score increases if the occupants have verified their contact information because in the event of an alarm condition the occupants can be contacted to verify whether the alarm is false and if not they can help resolve or otherwise address the emergency. The security score increases even more if every occupant of the home verifies their contact information.

Another example security criterion is the quality of coverage in the home. For example the central server and or cloud computing services determines whether the home has a comprehensive mesh network of nodes that are capable of sensing conditions at all locations within the home and communicating data regarding the sensed conditions through the mesh network and to the central server and or cloud computing services . According to one embodiment to determine whether the home has a comprehensive mesh network the central server and or cloud computing services tracks an occupant s movement through the home to identify black spots which are areas in the home where the central server and or cloud computing services was unable to detect the occupant. The security score can be adjusted based on the extent of the black spots in the home.

At the process involves comparing the security data of the home against the obtained security criterions to determine which of the security criterions are satisfied. Here according to an embodiment the central server and or cloud computing service processes the obtained home data against the list of security criterions to determine which of the security criterions are satisfied. At the security score is calculated. To do so for example the central server and or cloud computing service determines a security score for the home based on the number of security criterion that were satisfied. The higher the number of satisfied criterion the higher the security score. At a security log is generated. For example the central server and or cloud computing service generates a log that lists each of the security criterions and corresponding indications of whether the respective criterions were satisfied. This log can be outputted for example by sending the log to the electronic devices of the occupants. In some embodiments the log includes a written description for each of the security criterions so that occupants can review the descriptions of the unsatisfied criterions to determine what they can do to improve the security of their home. In some examples the corresponding indications of whether the respective criterions are satisfied are binary indicators whereas in other examples the corresponding indications are values indicative of a degree of compliance. For example if the home has fifty percent of the requisite number of smart hazard devices then the indication corresponding to that criterion can indicate that it is fifty percent satisfied. As discussed above the security criterions can include a proper sensor location criterion a low sensor battery criterion a low WiFi signal criterion a door open criterion a door closed criterion a door locked criterion a window open criterion and a window locked criterion.

According to some embodiments pre alarm condition trend detection and notification services are provided to warn users of potential dangerous conditions. More particularly technologies including the sensors of the network enabled smart devices in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided by the central server and cloud computer system are used to make inferences about potential security conditions in the home. This may occur in situations where the sensor data is not strong enough to support an actual alarm condition but it is enough to cause an inference that potentially dangerous activity may be occurring in the home and that it is worth investigating whether such activity is indeed occurring.

For example as discussed above the central server or cloud computing system can review the logged information about occupants movement in the home to detect signature patterns of movement unique to the individual occupants of the home. These signature patterns help the central server or cloud computing system detect strangers in the home. For example if an individual is quickly moving from room to room at a time when occupants typically are not at home and in a pattern that is not a signature pattern of any of the occupants the central server or cloud computing system may infer that this individual is potentially a robber moving from room to room searching for valuable items. While this inference may not rise to the level of a home invasion alarm condition it may be worth investigating. Thus the central server or cloud computing system sends a pre alarm alert message to the registered occupants mobile device informing the occupants of the detected pattern that there may be suspicious activity occurring in the home. The message may include an indication of where in the house suspicious activity is occurring. The message may also request that the occupant verify that this is a false alert or that an actual home invasion condition exists.

In another example the smart doorbell may observe the same car parked on a street out front of the smart home environment over the course of several days. In particular the smart doorbell in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided by the central server and cloud computer system may infer that the comings and goings of the car are consistent with burglars casing the home. Upon making this inference rather than triggering an alarm condition the central server and cloud computer system may send a pre alarm message to the occupants mobile devices and or to local law enforcement alerting them to the potential casing and including a description of the car.

According to other embodiments the pre alarm condition trend detection and notification can be applied to detect evaluated levels of potentially dangerous substances e.g. CO smoke etc. in the smart home environment . For example an alarm condition may be established based at least in part on a predetermined amount of a substance in an environment. The alarm condition may be stored locally by a smart hazard detector or remotely by the central server and cloud computer system . For example once the concentration level of CO in the air reaches a certain level an alarm condition will be triggered. Additionally a pre alarm condition is established based at least in part on a predetermined trend in the amount of the substance in the environment. For example the pre determined trend can be at least a twenty percent increase in the amount of the substance over at least a two week period. After establishing the alarm and the pre alarm conditions the central server and cloud computer system the smart hazard detector and or other smart home devices receives sensor data indicating the amount of the substance in the environment and analyzes the sensor data to detect the presence of either the alarm or pre alarm condition. Responsive to detecting the pre alarm condition but not the alarm condition the central server and cloud computer system the smart hazard detector and or other smart home devices provides a notification of the pre alarm condition. For example the central server and cloud computer system may send a message to the mobile device of the occupant stating The CO level in your home has increased twenty percent in the last two weeks. You might consider having an expert inspect your home to determine the cause. Also for example the smart hazard detector and or other devices in the home may make a similar audible announcement or display a similar written message.

Additionally the pre alarm message may be sent to a repair contractor or a public safety agency so that they can respond directly. For example the repair contractor may call the owner to notify the owner of the problem and prepare a plan to repair the problem. According to embodiments the pre alarm message giving notification of the pre alarm condition is sent to a centralized bidding system that solicits bids from repair contractors and selects one of the repair contractors to resolve the problem.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by running water. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about water usage in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what water sounds like and when it is running in the home. According to one embodiment to map the various water sources of the home upon detecting running water the central server or cloud computing architecture sends a message to an occupant s mobile device asking if water is currently running or if water has been recently run in the home and if so which room and which water consumption appliance e.g. sink shower toilet etc. was the source of the water. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to determine the signature or fingerprint of each water source in the home. This is sometimes referred to herein as audio fingerprinting water usage. 

In one illustrative example the central server or cloud computing architecture creates a signature for the toilet in the master bathroom and whenever that toilet is flushed the central server or cloud computing architecture will know that the water usage at that time is associated with that toilet. Thus the central server or cloud computing architecture can track the water usage of that toilet as well as each water consumption application in the home. This information can be correlated to water bills or smart water meters so as to provide users with a breakdown of their water usage.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by mice and other rodents as well as by termites cockroaches and other insects collectively referred to as pests . Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about pest detection in the home and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that recognize what certain pests sound like how they move and or the vibration they create individually and or collectively. According to one embodiment the central server or cloud computing architecture can determine the signatures of particular types of pests.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds that may be associated with pests it notifies the occupants of such sounds and suggests hiring a pest control company. If it is confirmed that pests are indeed present the occupants input to the central server or cloud computing architecture confirmation that its detection was correct along with details regarding the identified pests such as name type description location quantity etc. This enables the central server or cloud computing architecture to tune itself for better detection and create signatures or fingerprints for specific types of pests. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can use the tuning as well as the signatures and fingerprints to detect pests in other homes such as nearby homes that may be experiencing problems with the same pests. Further for example in the event that two or more homes in a neighborhood are experiencing problems with the same or similar types of pests the central server or cloud computing architecture can make inferences that nearby homes may also have such problems or may be susceptible to having such problems and it can send warning messages to those home to help facilitate early detection and prevention.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created by intruders impermissibly entering the home. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about home invasion and provides related services. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can run programs algorithms that assess detected sounds vibrations and movement in view of whether the home occupants are home or away sleeping or awake etc.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds proximate to windows doors and other external entryways while concurrently receiving information that all registered occupants are away from the home or are accounted for and asleep in their respective rooms the central server or cloud computing architecture alerts the occupants to the possible invasion and or deters the intruders by turning on nearby lights sounding audible warnings etc. For example the audible announcement could be an indication that an intrusion is occurring. This will alert the occupants and hopefully scare away the intruder.

According to some embodiments sound vibration and or motion sensing components of the smart devices are used to detect sound vibration and or motion created when an occupant of the home is under distress such as when an individual falls and cannot get up. Based on the detected sound vibration and or motion the central server or cloud computing architecture makes inferences about the respective occupants of the home and their patterns of movement. These inferences may be enhanced by providing the central server or cloud computing architecture with age health and other information about the individual occupants. For example the central server or cloud computing architecture can identify and track the movement through the home of the respective occupants using techniques described herein such as based on their signature or signals emitted from their tracking devices e.g. mobile phones and activate a distress alarm when an occupant s movement indicates distress. For example an elderly occupant may be in distress immediately after making a very swift movement or causes a strong vibration that an elderly person would be incapable of making unless that person were falling. A distress alarm may also be activated when an occupant remains in one position such as in bed or in a bath for a period that exceeds a threshold. Further a distress alarm may be activated upon receiving a verbal command such as help from an occupant.

For example in the event the central server or cloud computing architecture detects sounds proximate to windows doors and other external entryways while concurrently receiving information that all registered occupants are away from the home or are accounted for and asleep in their respective rooms the central server or cloud computing architecture alerts the occupants to the possible invasion and or deters the intruders by turning on nearby lights sounding audible warnings etc.

Turning now to illustrations are provided of example embodiments of the smart wall switch . According to embodiments the wall switches enhance the smart home environment by providing a retrofit wall light switch that in addition to maintaining the basic character and purpose of a light switch incorporates a host of sensing interface and communications capabilities for enhancing occupant comfort convenience and safety.

By virtue of being mounted in place of traditional wall switches the wall switch has access to plentiful electrical operating power such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires that is behind the walls of the smart home environment and that is present at virtually all standard home wall light switches. This essentially unlimited power budget the near ubiquity of excellent installation locations throughout the home and the reasonably ample physical space on its face plate and in its housing to fit the necessary components combine to enable the wall switch to accommodate a rich and wide variety of sensing interface and communications capabilities for the smart home environment as well as a general platform for the provision of even newer sensing interface and communications hardware as it becomes available over the coming decades.

A rich variety of new interactions are made possible between wall switch and other devices of the smart home environment . Occupancy sensing for example can be significantly enhanced by virtue of the great locations usually right next to room doorways of most wall light switches allowing for easy tracking of occupants as they transition between rooms predictive occupancy algorithms and so forth.

As illustrated in according to some embodiments the wall switch is split into two parts a head unit and a backplate . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the wall switches by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to some embodiments the backplate is a permanent interface box sometimes referred to herein as docking station that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment and that contains a AC to DC powering circuitry . When installed the docking station may resemble a conventional one gang or two gang wall box except no dangerous high voltage wires are exposed to the user. According to some embodiments docking station also includes a cellular wireless interface.

According to some embodiments the head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module actually contains all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth. Users can plug and unplug the unit in and out of the docking station . Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station . There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a motion occupancy detector and light switch and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with small OLED televisions and high fidelity mini speakers. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station . This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the kitchen or living room for example can be replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed in a bedroom or a basement etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth. In other examples the head unit can provide instructions such as Press button once if I am in the kitchen press twice if I am in the den etc. 

According to some embodiments the head unit contains a main processor storage display and user interface audio speaker microphone power converter GPS receiver RFID locator and general physical module receiver . The head unit further contains wireless and wired networking . In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. Furthermore because the wall switch can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided.

Also included are sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera etc. A rechargeable battery or equivalently capable onboard power storage medium is also included. For example the battery can be a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. In operation the wall switch charges the battery during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is less than what power stealing can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what power stealing can safely provide.

The user interface can include one or more visual displays TFT OLED etc. touchscreen and or button input capabilities the audio speaker and so forth. According to the embodiment illustrated in the module head unit of smart wall switch has a click and rotate annular ring input . According to this embodiment the click and rotate annular ring input of the wall switch can be used as a dimming light switch. Further the click and rotate annular ring input can provide menu driven interfaces for user governance of all its various capabilities. As illustrated in an optional 2D image and or 3D holographic image projector can also be provided so that the effective dimension of the display is not just limited to the physical size of the wall light switch. For example in smart home environments that also include smart doorbells the combination of the smart wall switches and the smart doorbells can bring about new features. For example if a visitor approaches the front door or rings the doorbell the camera in the doorbell can transmit their image to the smart wall switches which can instantly show the image on the dial of the light switch or project the image in 2D or 3D holographic form. Further for example the image of the arriving visitor at the front door can be projected only from the smart wall switches of those rooms where occupancy is sensed.

According to one embodiment that is particularly appealing for a lighting control functionality of the described wall switches which are temporarily simply termed light switches for this lighting control related embodiment the light switches in the home such as the smart home environment are configured such that at least one of them can be used to control a all of the light switches in the home b a single selectable one of the other light switches in the home and or c one or more selectable groups or sub groups of the other light switches in the home. This can be particularly convenient for example for a light switch that is near the front door or other entryway commonly used for ingress and egress of the home. For such an example scenario an occupant who is the last person to leave the home can simply turn off all lights at once by controlling the single light switch nearest the door. Similarly a returning occupant can turn on a particular subset of lights for example the lights corresponding to a pathway from the front door to the kitchen all at once by controlling that single light switch. As another advantageous example a light switch that is in an upstairs master bedroom of the home can be used by the parents to control a the lights in all downstairs rooms in the home b the lights leading between the master bedroom and the kitchen and or c the lights in each of the children s bedrooms.

The above described provision for mutually controllable or selectively mutually controllable light switches can be extended in other embodiments to similar mutual or selectively mutual control of any population of smart home controllers that are so amenable. Examples can include mutual or selectively mutual control of irrigation controllers door opening closing actuating controllers entertainment device controllers computing device controllers portable plug in heater controllers window opening closing controllers and so on.

In some embodiments a network connected smart keypad is provided in the smart home environment . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of the smart keypad is to control the functionality of security features of the smart home environment . It should be appreciated that the smart keypad is enhanced with a variety of multi sensing capabilities that while indeed enhancing home safety and security in many ways can provide additional functionalities relating to controlling the other smart devices in the home HVAC control home energy conservation intra home communications entertainment etc.

According to embodiments smart keypad includes powering circuitry including a rechargeable battery for extracting power as needed from the 120V hot line voltage wire. The rechargeable battery can either be used as a conventional back up source or as a reservoir to supply excess DC power if needed for short periods.

According to some embodiments like other smart home devices described herein the smart keypad is split into two parts a head unit and a backplate. This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart keypads by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to some embodiments the backplate is a permanent interface box sometimes referred to herein as docking station that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment and that contains AC to DC powering circuitry.

According to some embodiments the smart keypad contains a main processor storage display and user interface audio speaker microphone power converter GPS receiver RFID locator and general physical module receiver. The smart keypad further contains wireless and wired networking. In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. Furthermore because the smart keypad can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided. Accordingly the smart keypad can be connected to and communicate with the other smart home devices of the smart home environment and to the central server or cloud computing system .

The smart keypad can include any of the components e.g. temperature sensor humidity sensor occupancy sensor ambient light sensor communication equipment processors memory etc. that are included in any of the other smart home devices e.g. smart doorbells smart thermostats smart wall switches smart wall plugs etc. described herein. In some embodiments the smart keypad is hardwired with a battery backup. In some embodiments the smart keypad is incorporated into the wall switch whereas in other embodiments the smart keypad can be its own device.

The smart keypad also includes sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera etc. As mentioned above a rechargeable battery is also included or equivalently capable onboard power storage medium . For example the battery can be a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. In operation the smart keypad charges the battery during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is less than what power stealing can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what power stealing can safely provide.

The user interface of the smart keypad can include one or more visual displays TFT OLED etc. touchscreen and or button input capabilities the audio speaker and so forth. According to embodiments an optional 2D image and or 3D holographic image projector can also be provided so that the effective dimension of the display is not just limited to the physical size of the smart keypad. The user interface can be user customized by the home occupants.

The smart keypad can be secured by a user determined passcode. In some embodiments the passcode can be a PIN comprising any number and combination of letters and or numbers. In other embodiments the passcode can be a phrase. In yet other embodiments the passcode can be a gesture which the smart keypad senses using ultrasonic sensors PIR sensors etc. In still other embodiments the passcode is in the form of a unique connect the dot pattern where the user interface displays a plurality of dots e.g. a grid of dots and the user moves his or her finger from dot to dot in a unique pattern. Any one of these forms of the passcode including the gesture and the connect the dots pattern can provide users with a quick and easy way to arm and disarm the alarm system of the home. For example when leaving the home the user can walk up to the smart keypad and make the unique gesture or input the connect the dots pattern to arm the alarm. According to some embodiments the smart keypad manages a user list which includes a list of users and corresponding times they can control the keypad to arm disarm the security system and to control other functions of the smart home. In some cases the various users may identify themselves to the smart keypad using unique identification numbers and access codes including the passcodes described above. Further in some cases the smart keypad may be capable of recognizing a user based on the user s digital fingerprint such as by wirelessly identifying the user s mobile electronic device .

According to embodiments the smart keypad includes a light your path feature whereby the smart keypad activates a light when it senses that a user is approaching in darkness or near darkness. For example in the event the user approaches the smart keypad in the middle of the night the smart keypad may activate nearby lights in the home or a light incorporated in the smart keypad itself e.g. LED to provide a lighted pathway for the user. In one example the smart keypad is incorporated in a wall light switch and the smart keypad activates the light associated with the wall switch when a user is approaching the smart keypad. In some examples upon detecting an approaching user when the security system is armed the smart keypad or other devices of the home or the server can send notification to the occupants mobile devices or other electronic devices. Also for example the smart keypad can send a notification message to the occupants mobile devices any time the alarm system is armed or disarmed by a user.

According to embodiments the smart keypad is smash and bash resistant. For example in the event the home s alarm system is armed and the smart keypad is smash e.g. by an intruder attempting to disarm the alarm by bashing the keypad the alarm remains armed. In some cases upon being smashed the smart keypad triggers the alarm and executes pre configured actions such as notifying police and or other emergency personnel.

According to embodiments the smart keypad or other devices in the home are capable of assigning user defined gestures to actions or sets of actions. For example the user may program the smart keypad with a panic gesture that causes the smart keypad other devices in the smart home or the server to notify authorities such as by calling or otherwise notifying medical police etc. Such a panic gesture may be for example the user quickly waving his or her hands in the air. The user may also program the smart keypad or other devices in the home with an audible panic command. For example when the user yells help then medical police etc. may be called or otherwise notified. In other examples the smart keypad can include a panic button that the user can press to call the police medical etc.

According to embodiments the smart keypad or any of the other smart home devices have the ability to display customer messages such as via a display on the device itself or by projection. For example in the event a child is sleeping the smart doorbell may display Baby is sleeping. Do not ring. In other embodiments the smart keypads and other devices are capable of projecting or displaying messages. For example when a person is at the front door the keypads may project a message such as Someone s at the door . This would be good for situations where the users have deactivated or the smart home has automatically deactivated the doorbell and or other audible notifications because some or all of the occupants are sleeping. These messages would also be useful for hearing impaired occupants. The smart keypads and other devices could also project or display warning messages such as Evacuate due to possible intruder fire CO etc. The message could be projected in large font on walls floors ceilings etc. And the message could provide additional information. For example the message could be Intruder detected in den Fire detected in kitchen etc.

According to embodiments the smart keypad and the other smart devices are used as a platform for running home applications. For example the smart keypad has the capability of downloading and or executing applications that enable users to control their smart homes. For example the user could install a thermostat app that can be accessed and controlled from any of the smart devices in the home including the smart keypads to control the home s HVAC. The user could also install a security app for example. It should be appreciated that the number and type of apps that could be download and installed are endless.

Turning now to an illustration is provided of an example embodiment of the smart hazard detector . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of each smart hazard detector is for smoke detection fire detection and carbon monoxide detection more generally hazard detection and associated audible alarming via a speaker and a buzzer . However it should be appreciated that the smart hazard detector is further enhanced with network connectedness and a variety of multi sensing capabilities that while indeed enhancing home safety and security in many ways can provide additional functionalities relating to HVAC control home energy conservation intra home communications and entertainment. In some embodiments the smart hazard detector complies with the standards as required by Underwriter Laboratories UL for detecting smoke heat and carbon monoxide. For example the smart hazard detector meets the alarm response time requirements of UL standard 2034 which are as follows at 70 PPM the detector must alarm within 60 240 minutes at 150 PPM the detector must alarm within 10 50 minutes and at 400 PPM the detector must alarm within 4 to 15 minutes.

According to embodiments the smart hazard detector is a retrofit designed to replace older hazard detectors. Although not shown in the figures the smart hazard detector may comprise two primary components a head unit and a backplate or docking station . The head unit comprises the sensors battery processor storage and other components while the docking station serves as a physical connection into the wall and if applicable to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment . When installed the docking station may resemble a conventional backplate for a tradition hazard detector. Users can plug and unplug the head unit in and out of the docking station. Thus many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station. There are also many different versions for the head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a smoke detector and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station. This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for detecting hazards in the kitchen for example can replaced by a newer version then the old head unit can be re deployed in a bedroom or a basement etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select bedroom or living room and so forth.

There can be substantial overlap between the smart hazard detector and the wall switch as well as the other devices of the smart home environment with respect to processing sensing user interface and communications capabilities. The smart hazard detector may be a low power consuming device that is powered by battery and that includes a low power communication chip such as a ZigBee chip and may participate as a low power node in the mesh network of the smart home environment by generating and transmitting messages relay messages from other devices as well as by listen and sometimes making a corresponding response. However it should be appreciated that instead of or in addition to being battery powered the smart hazard detector may be powered by AC voltage from the home. In some embodiments the smart hazard detector includes a WiFi chipset that enable it to communicate its status to other devices in the smart home environment to user mobile devices to the central server or cloud computing system as well as to external managed security services. It should be appreciated that smart hazard detector is microprocessor driven and that the WiFi chip may contain extra processing capacity for controlling all or some operations of the smart hazard detector . In some embodiments a separate processor is provided.

According to the illustrated embodiment the smart hazard detector includes a smoke detector which comprises a smoke photodiode a detector and a smoke chamber. The smoke photodiode may be for example an IR LED. Alternatively instead of IR a visible light LED or a laser may be provided. In some embodiments the detector may be a photon silicon photomultiplier chip. The smoke photodiode and the detector may be programmed to execute a duty cycle every ten seconds or so. For example every ten seconds the photodiode and the detector will do an X axes microsecond smoke test. The photodiode and the detector also execute self calibration tests at predetermined intervals.

Further the smart hazard detector includes a carbon monoxide sensor which can be either an electrochemical sensor or a metal oxide semiconductor. Additionally the smart hazard detector may include a temperature sensor a humidity sensor for reducing false alarms associated with showering and cooking and an ambient light sensor such as a single pixel that measures the brightness of the room.

The smart hazard detector may be provided with occupancy detecting capabilities. According to an embodiment one or more ultrasonic sensors are provided for motion detecting. However it should be appreciated that in addition to or instead of the ultrasonic sensors one or more passive IR PIR sensors are provided for occupancy sensing. Having multiple ultrasonic sensor and or passive IR sensors enhance the occupancy sensing capabilities of the detector. Because they are typically mounted in unobstructed locations high on walls of often occupied rooms smart hazard detectors are particularly well suited for occupancy detection such as by the use of RFID ultrasonic sensors etc. The smart hazard detector may also include a thermopile for flame heat detection. As it is well known in the art the thermopile or thermo camera is a group of thermo couples that take infrared light and correlate that to flame heat. In some instances this is advantageous because the thermo camera looks into the room and gives advanced warning of heat. Thus the thermo camera is able to see heat before the heat actually makes its way to the smart hazard detector . In some embodiments a PIR sensor may be replaced with an optical CCD sensor. In some embodiments a Fresnel lens may be provided within detector as a true optical imaging lens for light in the visible spectrum. The CCD sensor may provide optical pictures and or video of individuals and or objects within the room and within the field of view of the CCD sensor. The lens may also serve as a user pressable button. In other embodiments a PIR sensor a Fresnel lens and or CCD sensor may be incorporated in any of a variety of different smart home devices such as security cameras doorbells garage door openers entertainment devices and so forth. Essentially these components may be incorporated into any device where an occupancy detecting function of a PIR sensor and or CCD sensor might be useful and or where there is a need for a front selectable button.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart hazard detector in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to reduce the number of false alarms. For example inferences about the occupants activities can be learned based on data received over time. For example if the smart hazard detector located in the kitchen observes increased temperature humidity and motion in the kitchen then an inference can be made that one or more of the occupants are cooking cooking inference . These data inputs can be considered on a sliding scale based on time of day and day of week. For example only slight increases temperature and humidity may invoke the cooking inference at 5 pm on weekdays when history shows that when the occupants typically cook. However much larger increases are required to invoke the cooking inference at 10 am on a weekday when the occupants are typically away at that time. In some embodiments when the cooking inference is made the smart hazard detector in the kitchen becomes less sensitive whereas the hazard detectors in other room remain in normal operation.

In some embodiments the smart hazard detector is equipped with one or more air quality sensors . For example the air quality sensors may sniff for volatile organic compounds VOCs that may be present in the house. Thus the smart hazard detector can warn users when there are toxins in the user s home such as when the user is burning a paraffin wax candle. Paraffin is a by product of petroleum and has been shown to release an alarming range of VOCs such as toluene and benzene. Also for example the air quality sensors can sniff for gas leaks in the house such as by detecting methane which is commonly added to natural gas so as to make natural gas detectable. This sniffing capability is not only good for houses but also for schools and hospitals. Individuals will find peace of mind knowing such detection is in widespread use. Further as houses get more and more sealed air quality detection will grow in importance. Further the air quality sensors can measure levels of particulate dust pollen mold etc. for detection.

In addition to measuring air quality and detecting harmful VOCs the smart hazard detector is capable of transmitting this information to the other devices in the home as well as the central server or cloud computing system . For example in some embodiments when there are elevated levels of patent harmful gases particulate dust pollen mold etc. in the home the smart hazard detector can transmit this information to the central server or cloud computing system which communicates with other nodes in the home and just outside of the home such as the smart doorbell and assess whether the inside air or the outside air is purer. If the outside air is purer then the central server or cloud computing system instructs the smart thermostat to open a vent to permit fresh air into the home otherwise it instructs the thermostat to recirculate air in the home and to not draw in outside air. Furthermore the central server or cloud computing system upon receiving the air quality information from the hazard device can send detailed information about the air quality to the mobile device of user. For example the air quality information may identify the specific types of toxins particulate dust pollen mold etc. in the air. This can help the user identify which pollen etc. the user is allergic to. Further the central server or cloud computing system can use the air quality information to provide the user with medication recommendations e.g. be sure to take you allergy pills today . Furthermore the central server or cloud computing system can aggregate data received from multiple homes in various geographic locations and provide for example smog alerts pollen warnings etc.

According to some embodiments the smart hazard detector may include a carbon dioxide CO sensor for fire detection where the detector includes a passive IR detector from lead selenide. Fire produces CO CO and infrared light. The intensity of the infrared light emitted by the flame is pretty constant until it passes through the layer of COproduced by the fire. However the frequency of light having a wavelength of 4.26 excites COmolecules when the light contacts the CO. In response the COabsorbs the infrared light having a wavelength of 4.26 thereby decreasing the intensity of the light at this wavelength. Thus to detect fire a narrow optical bandpass filter is placed in front of the lead selenide IR detector to permit only light having a wavelength 4.26 to pass through to the lead selenide IR detector. In the event of fire the lead selenide detects the decrease in intensity of light at a wavelength of 4.26 and triggers the fire alarm.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors of the smart hazard detector in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to warn occupants of dangerous conditions in the home. For example an inference can be made that an occupant is burning a candle based of the qualities e.g. intensity wavelength frequency etc. of the light and or the toxins begin released into the air. Further an inference can be made that the occupant in the room has fallen asleep when the occupant is in the room and has not moved for a predetermined period of time. In situations where a candle is burning and the occupant has fallen asleep the smart hazard detector in that room will sound an alarm to wake up the occupant. In other example the smart hazard detector can sound an alarm or send an alert text or email message when it detects dangerous conditions in unoccupied rooms such as when the stove is left on in the kitchen.

In the event a fire does occur in the home technologies including the sensors of the hazard detectors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to determine the cause. For example the smart hazard detector can detect that the fire started in the kitchen and the smart hazard detector can detect an active stove candle etc. was left unattended in the kitchen just before the fire started. Additionally a central server such as can aggregate data from multiple homes that experienced a fire analyze the data to find patterns and reconstruct what caused the fires and share this information with fire departments.

In some embodiments the smart hazard detector is mounted in a location that is out of reach of the occupants such as high on a wall or on a ceiling. Thus in the event of a false alarm the occupants cannot reach the smart hazard detector to press a button that deactivates the alarm. Accordingly embodiments of the smart hazard detector allow for occupants to deactivate the alarm using silence gestures . For example the smart hazard detector detects a particular silence gesture from one of the occupants and in response deactivates the alarm.

According to embodiments the one or more ultrasonic sensors of the smart hazard detector are used to detect the silence gesture of the occupant. In some embodiments each of the ultrasonic sensors may contain multiple piezos so as to make the sensor omni directional and to make it easier to detect when an occupant is making a silence gesture. Using ultrasonic sensors in battery powered versions of the smart hazard detector is particularly advantageous because ultrasonic sensors consume very little power. The ultrasonic sensors work by sending out pulses and then calculate the time interval between sending the pulse and receiving the echo to determine the distance to an object. In some embodiments a single piezo of the ultrasonic sensor sends the pulse and receives the echo. In other embodiments separate piezos send pulses and receive echoes.

During normal operation the ultrasonic sensors of the smart hazard detector are merely performing occupancy sensing functions. For example they are determining whether the room is occupied. When performing this function the ultrasonic sensors have a ping rate of about one hertz. This low ping rate is designed to preserve battery power while still effectively perform occupancy detection. However when one of the other sensors such as the smoke fire or carbon monoxide sensors activates the alarm the smart hazard detector increases the ping rate such as up to twenty hertz. The increased ping rate better enables detection of silence gestures which are only made when the alarm is activated. When detecting a silence gesture the ultrasonic sensors are looking for an object such as a human hand to remain within in a predefined distance from the smart hazard detector for a specified period.

An example silence gesture will be described with references to . As shown in at block an occupant is standing in room while an alarm in hazard detector is active and making a BEEP sound. A light such as an LED is provided on an outer portion of the smart hazard detector such that the occupant can see the light when it is turned on. The operation of the light will be described with reference to . Suffice to say for the light is turned off in blocks through . As shown at block the occupant has walked to a position closer to the smart hazard detector which is mounted out of reach on the ceiling of the room. As shown at block the occupant walked to a position even closer to the smart hazard detector such that the occupant is almost directly under the smart hazard detector . As shown at arrow of block the occupant while standing almost directly under the smart hazard detector is beginning to extend an arm upward toward the smart hazard detector .

Referring now to block of the arm of the occupant is extended upward toward the smart hazard detector while the occupant is standing almost directly under the smart hazard detector . After an alarm sounds and the pulse rate increases the ultrasonic sensor of the smart hazard detector looks for a trigger to the silence gesture period which is the amount of time the silence gesture must be maintained to deactivate the alarm. According to some embodiments the trigger is a distance change from a baseline and to deactivate the alarm the distance change must be maintained for the entire silence gesture period e.g. three seconds . For example if the baseline is a distance between the sensor and the floor of the room then the sensor is looking for an object to come in between it and the floor thereby changing the distance measured by the pulse. In some embodiments the distance change must be significant enough to ensure that someone is close and likely intends to silence the alarm. For example if the distance to the floor is ten feet then the requisite distance change could be eight feet or eighty percent of the original distance. As such the object would be required to be within two feet of the sensor to trigger the silence gesture period and to deactivate the alarm the object must remain there for the duration of the period. The requisite distance change can be configured based on the height of the ceiling and based on the height of the occupants among other things.

Referring still to block the light is turned on when the occupant successfully triggers the silence gesture period thereby signaling to the occupant to remain in the position for the requisite period such as three seconds. Here the hand of the occupant triggered the silence gesture period. A tolerance is built in such that if the occupant slightly moves and loses but quickly regains the signal the silence gesture period will continue without having to start over. As shown in block the occupant kept the hand in within the requisite distance of the sensor for the duration of the silence gesture period and thus the alarm has been deactivated the BEEP has stopped and the light has turned off. As shown at blocks and the occupant can walk away from the smart hazard detector and resume normal activity.

It should be appreciated that in the event the smart hazard detector is of a design that receives reliable power from the wiring of the home rather than being battery powered a CCD chip could be used to detect the silence gesture . However such an arrangement is not suitable for battery powered hazard detectors because the CCD chips and associated processing consume a large amount of power and would quickly drain the battery. Other possible alternatives to ultrasonic sensors include passive IR sensors thermopile e.g. thermo cameras laser distance measuring laser and a camera combination because a camera looks for dot instead of time of arrival doppler shift and a full on camera and image processing system.

According to some embodiments to enhance the reliability and effectiveness of the silence gesture the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with one or more optical sensors to make the sensing even better. For example when an occupant attempts to silence by placing a hand in field the optical sensor will sense the presence of the occupant s hand and thereby trigger the silence gesture period. The ultrasonic sensor could also work in concert with the optical sensor after the silence gesture period has been triggered where the ultrasonic sensor detects the occupant s changing hand distance and the optical sensor detects the occupant s changing hand distance using proximity and heat techniques.

According to some embodiments the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with the passive IR sensor. For example when an occupant attempts to silence by placing a hand in field the passive IR will sense this and thereby trigger the silence gesture period. The ultrasonic sensor could also work in concert with the thermopile e.g. thermo camera where both distance change and heat are used to detect the silence gesture. For example the thermo camera detects when a human hand is nearby and triggers the silence gesture period. Further the ultrasonic sensor could work in concert with the ambient light sensor. For example when the occupant places a hand in the field and blocks light then the ambient light sensor know the occupant is nearby and thus triggers the silence gesture period.

It should be appreciated that according to embodiments similar gesture controls can be applied to other smart devices in the home such as to the smart thermostat the smart wall switches etc. For example there can be gestures for increasing or decreasing temperature controls for turning on and off lights HVAC etc.

Turning now to illustrations are provided of an example embodiment of a smart doorbell . According to embodiments an important underlying functionality of the smart doorbell is to serve as a home entryway interface unit providing a doorbell functionality or other visitor arrival functionality audio visual visitor announcement functionality and like functionalities. Like the smart hazard detector described above with reference to the smart doorbell is further enhanced with network connectedness and a variety of multi sensing capabilities to accommodate additional functionalities and there can be substantial overlap integration among the smart doorbell the smart hazard detector the smart wall switch and the smart wall plug that leverages their combined processing sensing and communications capabilities as well as their access to cloud based control and intelligence.

In some embodiments the smart doorbell is connected to the wiring of the smart home environment . For example as is common in many homes a 24V low voltage wire is provided at the outer entry points of the home such as at the front back and side doors. The smart doorbell can be connected to this 24V low voltage wire to obtain steady and reliable power. However it should be appreciated that the smart doorbell could include a battery for the purpose of replacing or supplementing power obtained from the home wiring. In some embodiments the battery could be a rechargeable battery such as a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery for extracting power as needed from the house wiring e.g. 24V low voltage wire . For example the smart doorbell could charge the battery during time intervals in which the doorbell s power usage is less than what the 24V low voltage wire can safely provide and that will discharge to provide the needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what the 24V low voltage wire can safely provide. Thus the rechargeable battery could be used as a conventional back up source or as a reservoir to supply excess DC power if needed for short periods.

As illustrated in according to some embodiments the smart doorbell includes two parts a head unit and a backplate which is also referred to as a docking station . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the doorbells by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. As with the wall switches and the hazard detectors this bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart doorbells by making them a modular platform. The docking station is a permanent interface box that serves as a physical connection into an area near the entry way such as a doorframe or outer wall of the home and to the voltage wires of the home. According to some embodiments the head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module actually contains all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth. Users can plug and unplug the unit in and out of the docking station . Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user will be able to buy a new version of the head unit and simply plug it into the docking station . There are also many different versions for the head unit such as low cost versions with few features and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of the head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station . This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the front door for example can be replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a back or basement door etc. When first plugged into a docking station the head unit can ask the user by 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select front door or back door and so forth.

Sensor devices such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion any other suitable motion sensing component ultrasound CCD video camera bar code scanner etc. as well as I O devices such as speakers user interfaces 2D 3D projectors etc. are provided in the head unit . The sensors and I O devices are generally represented at .

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as are used to detect when packages are delivered to the door of the smart home environment and to take a variety of automated actions in response. According to some embodiments the sensors can see the uniform of the delivery person approaching the door or the truck of the delivery person or the sensors can hear the truck in combination with a person approaching the door within a period after hearing the truck. Once the person is with a predetermined distance from the door the smart doorbell using its speaker asks the person if he or she is a delivery person to which that person can reply with an audible response or by indicating as such on the user interface of the doorbell. If the person is making a delivery the doorbell can instruct the person to place the package in a location proximate the doorbell such that its scanner can scan the bar code or other type of identifying tag affixed to or associated with the package being delivered.

According to embodiments a central server such as server can use the bar code to obtain information about the package such as the sender recipient a description of the item therein whether signature is required etc. Based on this information the rules based inferences engines or artificial intelligence can make inference regarding which action to take next. For example if occupants or more particularly if the specified recipient or recipients are in the home and the package is from a sender or contains an item that is of particular interest to the one or more occupants an announcement can be made in the home indicating the package is currently being dropped off and providing details about the package. On the other hand if the sender or item is not of particular interest to one of the occupants based on the occupants past responses to receiving such deliveries then no announcement will be made and the occupants can discover the package in due course. Similarly if no occupants are home but an inference is made that the package is of particular interest to one of the occupants a text message email phone call etc. can be made e.g. by server to the one or more identified occupants indicating that the package in being delivered.

According to embodiments in the event signature is required for the package but none of the occupants are home an inference is made to not disturb the occupants the smart doorbell can provide authorization to leave the package. For example the doorbell presents an authorization code either in plain text barcode or encrypted forms on its user interface and prompts the delivery person to use his or her handheld device to record scan photograph or otherwise acquire the authorization code. Once the authorization code has been acquired by the delivery person the doorbell can then instruct the delivery person regarding where to leave the package such as at the front door around the back of the house in a discrete location etc.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors such as noise motion and or facial recognition detection in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as server are used to detect when one or more unknown individuals are approaching the home. A number of learned inferences can be made in this situation. For example during late evening hours an alarm will be sounded in the house giving notice of the approaching person and or the doorbell may audibly announce to the individual that he or she is being monitored by a home security system. Further in the event the person attempts to enter a door window or other access point to the home a message will be sent to local law enforcement. However during day time hours when one or more occupants are at home a learned inference can be made to take no action such as when a meter reader mail carrier garbage collector etc. is approaching the house as per a reasonably predictable and learned schedule.

According to embodiments the smart doorbell provides a context based entry keypad. In some examples the entry keypad can be projected such as via a 2D 3D holographic projection. In other examples the entry keypad can be rendered on a display such as a 2D LCD display. Persons standing proximate to the smart doorbell can enter a code into the keypad to obtain access to the smart home environment . According to embodiments the occupants of the home get context based keypads and or access codes. For example the parents get a more sophisticated keypad that provides a variety of controls whereas children get a simple keypad into which they can enter their access code. Further non occupants get context based keypads too. For example a delivery person gets one keypad whereas uncategorized individuals get another keypad. According to some embodiments the keypad can vary based on factors such as time of day current news e.g. any recent crime in the neighborhood proximity of security guards and other law enforcement personnel and which if any occupants are currently at home. For example if there is a nearby security guard then the keypad requests a three digit access code or no access code at all rather than the usual ten digit access code. In another example if no one is home or if only children or elderly people are at home then a ten digit code is required. However if the parents of the children or the adult children of the elderly are at home then no access code is required or only a three digit code is required. If the approaching person is identified as a guest then the keypad prompts the guest to enter the guest access code assigned to him or her. It should also be appreciated that individuals are prompted to input their access code as they leave the home too. This way the codes of the guests the occupants and recognized categories of strangers e.g. a delivery person can be used to track the goings and comings of those people. It should be appreciated that this keypad can be provided on any smart device in the home such as the wall switch the thermostat hazard detector and the wall plug .

According to embodiments when the central server such as server based on information received from the doorbell such as noise and motion data determines that the street adjacent to the home has a threshold level of traffic the inferences are made regarding the safety of the children residing at the home. For example an alarm can be triggered in the home in the event one or more of the children are detected by the occupancy sensing to be outside of the home. This alert enables the parents or other caretakers to quickly take actions to protect the child from the traffic. Further for example automatic adjustments are made to audio equipment in the home to account for the increased traffic noise such as by increasing the volume a proportionate amount.

As discussed the sensors may include temperature and humidity sensors the data from which may be used for a number of useful services. For example the outside humidity and temperature data is considered by the thermostat when controlling the HVAC to best accomplish the occupants desired comfort preferences. Further for example this information may be presented to the occupants through a number of user interfaces such as a user interface associated with another one of the devices located inside of the home the television mobile and other computing devices or audibly. In some instances a central server such as server collects this information from a plurality of smart homes across a plurality of geographic locations. This aggregated data may be sold to weather services or may be used to provide weather data to smart home occupants.

According to embodiments the smart doorbell includes a button that upon being touched depressed or otherwise activated causes an audible visual or otherwise detectable audible notification to be broadcasted within the home or a message to be sent to user interfaces of devices within the home or to a mobile device associated with occupants of the home. Learned inferences can be made regarding the appropriate response to activation of the button . For example the audible notification is only broadcast in occupied rooms or rooms occupied by one or more occupants who have a relationship with the person at the door or no alarm is sounded in rooms where occupants such as small children are determined to be sleeping. Also for example the occupant selected songs such as uploaded MP3 s may be broadcast in the home where different songs may be broadcast for different occupants at home at the time or based on the identity of the person at the door. Further for example technologies and sensors at the smart doorbell may identify the person based on facial recognition or based on other characteristics such as the manner in which the person approached the door. For example over time based on input received from the smart doorbell a central server can build up an address book of profile data about people who approach the door such as some identifying biometric data. For example the address book can be built over time using low resolution data such as ultrasonic passive IR etc. to create a unique signature for individuals. This combined data from different domains becomes almost like a fingerprint regarding how that person approaches the house. In some instances when a familiar person approaches the door the smart doorbell asks the person if he is John Doe to which the person can verbally or physically respond. Upon obtaining this information John Doe s name or image can be announced or projected on device in the home and or John Doe will be given certain access rights to the home such as for example the door will automatically unlock as he approaches. Further in addition to or instead of identification based on these unique signatures individuals may enable their mobile devices to communicate with the smart doorbell such as via BLUETOOTH NFC or other wireless protocols. Also for example individuals may swipe their smart phones in front of the smart doorbell s MD scanner. Upon identifying the individual the smart doorbell may give the individual certain access right to the home such as by automatically unlocking the door.

According to embodiments technologies including the sensors in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as server also make learned decisions.

According to embodiments a home monitoring and control system is provided that may include one or more hazard detectors with wireless capability and occupancy detectors and audio speakers and a doorbell having a processor and wireless capability. A doorbell ringing event may trigger the processor to cause the doorbell to wirelessly communicate with one or more of the hazard detectors to cause the audio speakers to alert occupants of a visitor at the door. In some embodiments each hazard detector can be configured with a do not disturb setting such that it will remain silent under one or more pre determined conditions. According to embodiments the pre determined conditions may include one or more of an occupant determined to be sleeping proximate to the hazard detector room location of hazard detector is unoccupied hazard detector is located in an occupied bedroom and hazard detector is located in a kid s bedroom.

Turning now to an illustration is provided of an example embodiment of a smart wall plug . According to embodiments the smart wall plugs enhance the smart home environment by providing a retrofit wall plug that in addition to maintaining the basic character and purpose of a wall plug incorporates a host of sensing and communication capabilities for enhancing occupant comfort convenience and safety. Much like the smart wall switches by virtue of being mounting in place of traditional wall plugs the smart wall plugs have access to plentiful electrical operating power such as by connecting to wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires that is located behind the walls of the smart home environment and that is present at virtually all standard home wall plugs. This unlimited power budget the numerous installation locations throughout the home and the reasonably ample physical space in its housing to fit the necessary components combine to enable the smart wall plugs to accommodate a rich and wide variety of sensing and communications capabilities for the smart home environment as well as a general platform for the provision of even newer sensing and communications hardware as it becomes available. In addition to numerous installation locations inside the home there are numerous outdoor locations outside of the home too. For example smart wall plugs may may be mounted on the outside surface of external walls of the smart home environment and thereby may connect to the same wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires as do the indoor wall plugs.

A rich variety of new interactions are made possible between the smart wall plugs and other devices of the smart home environment . Occupancy motion or presence sensing for example can be enhanced by virtue of the numerous installation locations of wall plugs inside and outside of the home albeit some of these locations are hidden behind furniture or in locations where people are unlikely to go. According to embodiments the smart wall plugs can include all or some of the components that are included in the wall switch as illustrated in . For example the smart wall plugs can be comprised of two primary parts a head unit and a docking station which is a permanent interface box that serves as a physical connection into the wall and to the 120V line voltage wires or other wiring of the smart home environment . This bifurcation can increase the success and commercial longevity of the smart wall plugs by making them a modular platform consisting of two basic components. According to embodiments the head unit contains the sensors processors the I O devices and receptacles and so forth. Users can upgrade and or redistribute wall plug functionality throughout the home by plugging and unplugging head units of varying capabilities in and out of the docking stations in various locations throughout the home. For example to enhance security of the smart home environment head units having advanced motion sensing capabilities can be plugged into docking stations located in areas having clear lines of sight to entry points such as doorways and windows. Further these head units can be plugged into docking stations location in areas having clear lines of sight in commonly occupied rooms rather than behind furniture in or unused rooms. As discussed these head units may be capable of wirelessly communicating detected motion and can therefore serve as a tripwire for the home security system either inside the home or outside the home. For example smart wall plugs located outside the home such as on external walls near windows and doors provide outdoor tripwires that alert the central server or cloud computing system to the presence of intruders before unwelcome entry into the home even occurs. Also for example head units having advance communication capabilities are plugged into docking stations associated with high energy consuming appliances such as a clothes dryer. As discussed these head units may be capable of wirelessly communicating with smart meters and corresponding providing power to the clothes dryer at off peak hours. Because this head unit may be located behind a clothes dryer in a rarely occupied laundry room it is unnecessary for this head unit to include advanced occupancy sensors for example.

According to some embodiments the head unit includes a standard duplex receptacle having upper and lower outlets each having three slots. The head unit further contains some or all of a main processor storage audio speaker microphone power converter. GPS receiver RFID locator etc. Additionally the head unit may include wireless and wired networking. In view of the ample power availability a variety of communications capabilities can be provided including Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. According to embodiments the smart wall plugs are spokesman nodes in the mesh network described above. For example the smart wall plugs regularly send out messages regarding what they are sensing and in addition to sending out their own messages the smart wall plugs repeat messages from other smart devices in the mesh network thereby causing the messages to travel from node to node i.e. smart device to smart device throughout the smart home environment . As spokesman nodes in the smart home environment the smart wall plugs are able to drop down to low powered communication protocols to receive messages from low power nodes translate the messages to other communication protocols and send the translated messages to other spokesman nodes and or the central server or cloud computing system . Thus the smart wall plugs enable the low powered nodes using low power communication protocols to send messages across the entire smart home environment as well as over the Internet to the central server or cloud computing system . For example battery operated smart hazard detectors are able to preserve their limited power resource yet also communicate with the enteral server or could computing system in real time or near real time by sending messages in low power protocols to the wall plugs which repeat the messages in high power protocols which are transmitted to the central server or cloud computing system . According to embodiments the mesh network enables the central server or cloud computing system to regularly receive data from all of the smart devices in the home make inferences based on the data and send commands back to individual one of the smart devices to accomplish some of the smart home objectives descried herein.

Furthermore because the smart wall plug can be connected to the home 120V system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided See for example illustrations of such components being provided on a wall switch . It should also be appreciated that the smart wall plugs may include sensors such as temperature humidity occupancy ambient light fire smoke carbon monoxide active proximity passive infrared motion ultrasound CCD video camera an ambient light sensor such as a photoresistor or a single pixel sensor that measures light in the room etc.

In some examples the wall plug may include or be associated with a light source having variable intensity and color and can therefore function in a manner similar to the smart nightlight described above. In some embodiments the light source of the wall plug is configured to activate when the ambient light sensor detects that the room is dark and or when the occupancy sensor detects a person s presence or movement. The color and intensity of the light source can be adjusted based on information received from sensor of the wall plug or from other smart devices in the smart home environment. For example in the event the central server or cloud computing system triggers an alarm indicating unauthorized intrusion e.g. based on motion detection data received from smart devices in the home the light source associated with the smart wall plugs can be activated. In this example the light sources associated with the wall plugs can emit a high intensity red colored light to indicate that an emergency is occurring and to cause any intruder to leave the home.

According to embodiments the smart wall plugs wirelessly communicate with smart meters which are electrical meters that record consumption of electric energy in time intervals and then transmits that information a local radio receiver which forward the information to utility companies. Utility companies use this data to charge varying rates. For example power used midday during peak hours is more expensive than energy used at night during off peak hours. The smart wall plugs communicate with the smart meter of the home to obtain power usage data. This data can be forwarded to a central server such as server . Rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as to make decisions regarding how to efficiently operate certain appliances in the home so as to reduce energy costs yet also satisfy the occupants preferences. For example decisions are made regarding use appliances for non essential tasks at night e.g. wash dishes at night and to permit essential tasks when necessary e.g. allow refrigerator compressor to turn on mid day .

According to other embodiments the smart wall plugs wirelessly communicate with a central server such as server . Rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence provided at a central server such as make security related decisions based on data received from the smart wall plugs . For example decisions are made regarding when to trigger an alarm when to turn on lights when to send a warning to the owner s mobile device or to the neighborhood network. Furthermore the intelligence of the central process can be used for safety. For example the central server can be programmed with safe operating parameters for each application in the smart home and can shutoff power to the appropriate wall plug when the corresponding application deviates from its safe operating parameters. Also for example in the event data from an occupancy sensor on a particular wall plug indicates that a small child is really close to the wall plug the central server may shut off power to that plug. Further users can remotely control such as by use of their mobile device the outlets in the home. For example a parent may want to shutoff power to all wall plugs in their child s room or that are outside of the home and there is some risk that a child may be attracted to the plug.

Turning now to illustrations of a smart thermostat are provided according to some embodiments. Unlike many prior art thermostats smart thermostat preferably has a sleek simple uncluttered and elegant design that does not detract from home decoration and indeed can serve as a visually pleasing centerpiece for the immediate location in which it is installed. Moreover user interaction with smart thermostat is facilitated and greatly enhanced over known conventional thermostats by the design of smart thermostat . The smart thermostat includes control circuitry and is electrically connected to an HVAC system such as is shown with unit in . Smart thermostat is wall mounted is circular in shape and has an outer rotatable ring for receiving user input. Smart thermostat is circular in shape in that it appears as a generally disk like circular object when mounted on the wall. Smart thermostat has a large front face lying inside the outer ring . According to some embodiments smart thermostat is approximately 100 mm in diameter.

The outer rotatable ring allows the user to make adjustments such as selecting a new target temperature. For example by rotating the outer ring clockwise the target temperature can be increased and by rotating the outer ring counter clockwise the target temperature can be decreased. The smart thermostat may be configured to receive a plurality of types of inputs by virtue of the rotatable ring such as a scrolling input and a selection input. For example a rotation of the ring may allow a user to scroll through an array of selection options and inwards pressure exerted on the ring inward click may allow a user to select one of the options e.g. corresponding to a particular scroll position .

The outer rotatable ring may include a component that may be physically rotated or in other embodiments a static component that may sense a user s virtual rotation of the ring. For some embodiments the outer rotatable ring may include a touch pad configured to track arcuate motion of a user s finger on the touch pad. The touch pad may comprise e.g. a ring shaped or circular area. In some instances the touch pad includes multiple portions e.g. to detect arcuate motion in a first ring shaped area and to detect tapping in a second inner circular area . Boundaries of a touch pad area may be identified to a user using e.g. visual or tactile cues. For example a ring shaped touchpad area may be indented compared to neighboring areas on the smart thermostat or the area may be a different color than neighboring areas.

For preferred embodiments such as those of in which the outer ring is a continuous loop without fiducial markers one or more advantages are brought about. Thus a user may physically rotate the ring in embodiments in which the ring is configured to be physically rotatable regardless of a starting position of the ring. Further a user may select e.g. a value of a variable e.g. select a particular menu a particular setpoint temperature value etc. by rotating the ring multiple times. This feature may be particularly advantageous as the user does not need not to worry about precise rotations in order to select a desired option.

The front face of the smart thermostat comprises a clear cover that according to some embodiments is polycarbonate and a metallic portion preferably having a number of slots formed therein as shown. According to some embodiments the surface of cover and metallic portion form a common outward arc or spherical shape gently arcing outward and this gentle arcing shape is continued by the outer ring .

Although being formed from a single lens like piece of material such as polycarbonate the cover has two different regions or portions including an outer portion and a central portion . According to some embodiments the cover is painted or smoked around the outer portion but leaves the central portion visibly clear so as to facilitate viewing of an electronic display disposed thereunderneath. According to some embodiments the curved cover acts as a lens that tends to magnify the information being displayed in electronic display to users. According to some embodiments the central electronic display is a dot matrix layout individually addressable such that arbitrary shapes can be generated rather than being a segmented layout. According to some embodiments a combination of dot matrix layout and segmented layout is employed. According to some embodiments central display is a backlit color liquid crystal display LCD . An example of information displayed on the electronic display is illustrated in and includes central numerals that are representative of a current setpoint temperature.

Particular presentations displayed on the electronic display may depend on detected user input. For example one of a plurality of variables e.g. current setpoint temperature versus learning status or variable values e.g. 65 degrees versus 75 degrees may be displayed. The one being displayed may depend on a user s rotation of the outer rotatable ring . Thus for example when the device is configured to display a current setpoint temperature the value being displayed may gradually increase as the user rotates the ring in a clockwise direction. The sign of the change in the displayed temperature may depend on whether the user is rotating the ring in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The speed at which the displayed temperature is changing may depend e.g. in a linear manner on the speed at which the user is rotating the ring.

As described above a displayed characteristic may vary depending on received user input. For example a displayed temperature may increase as a user rotates the outer rotatable ring clockwise or a highlighted indicator may progress across a list of displayed options as the user rotates the ring . Further or additionally user inputs may cause the appearance of new types of information. For example if a user is viewing setpoint temperature options a dramatic clockwise rotation may cause a flashing red symbol to convey an anti environmental message . Thus a relationship may exist between a single type of user input e.g. ring rotation and a change in an active variable e.g. setpoint temperature changes and relationships may further exist between the single type of user input and an inactive variable e.g. an environmental warning flag . The latter relationship may be indirect and depend on a value or change in values of the active variable.

The presentations on the electronic display may depend on one or more types of user input. For example the display may change in a first manner e.g. to show a varying selection option as a user rotates the outer rotatable ring and may change in a second manner e.g. to confirm a selection or default to a menu screen as the user exerts inwards pressure on the outer rotatable ring .

According to some embodiments metallic portion has a number of slot like openings so as to facilitate the use of a passive infrared motion sensor mounted therebeneath. The metallic portion can alternatively be termed a metallic front grille portion. Further description of the metallic portion front grille portion is provided in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 U.S. Pat. No. 8 727 611 issued May 20 2014 . The design of the metallic portion compliments the sleek simple uncluttered and elegant design of smart thermostat while facilitating the integration and operation of sensors located within a housing of the thermostat. In the implementation as illustrated smart thermostat is enclosed by housing with a forward facing surface including the cover and the metallic portion . Some implementations of the housing include a back plate and a head unit. The housing provides an attractive and durable configuration for one or more integrated sensors used by smart thermostat and contained therein. In some implementations the metallic portion may be flush mounted with the cover on the forward facing surface of housing. Together the metallic portion as incorporated in housing does not detract from home or commercial decor and indeed can serve as a visually pleasing centerpiece for the immediate location in which it is located.

The metallic portion is designed to conceal sensors from view promoting a visually pleasing quality of the thermostat yet permitting them to receive their respective signals. Openings in the metallic portion along the forward facing surface of the housing allow signals to pass through that would otherwise not pass through the cover . For example glass polycarbonate or other similar materials used for cover are capable of transmitting visible light but are highly attenuating to infrared energy having longer wavelengths in the range of 10 microns which is the radiation band of operation for many passive infrared PIR occupancy sensors. Notably included in the smart thermostat according to some preferred implementations is an ambient light sensor not shown and an active proximity sensor not shown positioned near the top of the thermostat just behind the cover . Unlike PIR sensors the ambient light sensor and active proximity sensor are configured to detect electromagnetic energy in the visible and shorter infrared spectrum bands having wavelengths less than 1 micron for which the glass or polycarbonate materials of the cover are not highly attenuating. In some implementations the metallic portion includes openings in accordance with one or more implementations that allow the longer wavelength infrared radiation to pass through the openings towards a passive infrared PIR motion sensor as illustrated. Because the metallic portion is mounted over the radiation receiving surface of PIR motion sensor PIR motion sensor continues to receive the longer wavelength infrared radiation through the openings and detect occupancy in an enclosure.

Additional implementations of the metallic portion also facilitate additional sensors to detect other environmental conditions. The metallic portion may at least partly conceal and or protect one or more such sensors. In some implementations the metallic portion helps a temperature sensor situated inside of the thermostat s housing measure the ambient temperature of air. Openings in the metallic portion promote air flow towards a temperature sensor located below the metallic portion thus conveying outside temperatures to the interior of the housing. In further implementations the metallic portion may be thermally coupled to a temperature sensor promoting a transfer of heat from outside the housing.

The smart thermostat is preferably constructed such that the electronic display is at a fixed orientation and does not rotate with the outer ring so that the electronic display remains easily read by the user. For some embodiments the cover and metallic portion also remain at a fixed orientation and do not rotate with the outer ring . According to one embodiment in which the diameter of the smart thermostat is about 80 mm the diameter of the electronic display is about 45 mm. According to some embodiments an LED indicator is positioned beneath portion to act as a low power consuming indicator of certain status conditions. For example the LED indicator can be used to display blinking red when a rechargeable battery of the thermostat is very low and is being recharged. More generally the LED indicator can be used for communicating one or more status codes or error codes by virtue of red color green color various combinations of red and green various different blinking rates and so forth which can be useful for troubleshooting purposes.

Motion sensing as well as other techniques can be used in the detection and or prediction of occupancy as it is described further in the commonly assigned U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 430 supra U.S. Pat. No. 8 510 255 issued Aug. 13 2013 . According to some embodiments occupancy information is used in generating an effective and efficient scheduled program. Preferably an active proximity sensor A is provided to detect an approaching user by infrared light reflection and an ambient light sensor B is provided to sense visible light. The proximity sensor A can be used to detect proximity in the range of about one meter so that the smart thermostat can initiate waking up when the user is approaching the thermostat and prior to the user touching the thermostat. Such use of proximity sensing is useful for enhancing the user experience by being ready for interaction as soon as or very soon after the user is ready to interact with the thermostat. Further the wake up on proximity functionality also allows for energy savings within the thermostat by sleeping when no user interaction is taking place or about to take place. The ambient light sensor B can be used for a variety of intelligence gathering purposes such as for facilitating confirmation of occupancy when sharp rising or falling edges are detected because it is likely that there are occupants who are turning the lights on and off and such as for detecting long term e.g. 24 hour patterns of ambient light intensity for confirming and or automatically establishing the time of day.

According to some embodiments for the combined purposes of inspiring user confidence and further promoting visual and functional elegance the smart thermostat is controlled by only two types of user input the first being a rotation of the outer ring as shown in referenced hereafter as a rotate ring or ring rotation input and the second being an inward push on an outer cap see until an audible and or tactile click occurs referenced hereafter as an inward click or simply click input . For the embodiment of the outer cap is an assembly that includes all of the outer ring cover electronic display and metallic portion . When pressed inwardly by the user the outer cap travels inwardly by a small amount such as 0.5 mm against an interior metallic dome switch not shown and then springably travels back outwardly by that same amount when the inward pressure is released providing a satisfying tactile click sensation to the user s hand along with a corresponding gentle audible clicking sound. Thus for the embodiment of an inward click can be achieved by direct pressing on the outer ring itself or by indirect pressing of the outer ring by virtue of providing inward pressure on the cover metallic portion or by various combinations thereof. For other embodiments the smart thermostat can be mechanically configured such that only the outer ring travels inwardly for the inward click input while the cover and metallic portion remain motionless. It is to be appreciated that a variety of different selections and combinations of the particular mechanical elements that will travel inwardly to achieve the inward click input are within the scope of the present teachings whether it be the outer ring itself some part of the cover or some combination thereof. However it has been found particularly advantageous to provide the user with an ability to quickly go back and forth between registering ring rotations and inward clicks with a single hand and with minimal amount of time and effort involved and so the ability to provide an inward click directly by pressing the outer ring has been found particularly advantageous since the user s fingers do not need to be lifted out of contact with the device or slid along its surface in order to go between ring rotations and inward clicks. Moreover by virtue of the strategic placement of the electronic display centrally inside the rotatable ring a further advantage is provided in that the user can naturally focus their attention on the electronic display throughout the input process right in the middle of where their hand is performing its functions. The combination of intuitive outer ring rotation especially as applied to but not limited to the changing of a thermostat s setpoint temperature conveniently folded together with the satisfying physical sensation of inward clicking together with accommodating natural focus on the electronic display in the central midst of their fingers activity adds significantly to an intuitive seamless and downright fun user experience. Further descriptions of advantageous mechanical user interfaces and related designs which are employed according to some embodiments can be found in U.S. Ser. No. 13 033 573 supra U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2012 0130546 U.S. Ser. No. 29 386 021 supra U.S. Design patent No. D660 732 issued May 29 2012 and U.S. Ser. No. 13 199 108 U.S. Pat. No. 8 727 611 issued May 20 2014 .

According to some embodiments the smart thermostat includes a processing system display driver and a wireless communications system . The processing system may be disposed within a housing of smart thermostat coupled to one or more temperature sensors of smart thermostat and or coupled to rotatable ring . The processing system may be configured to dynamically identify user input via rotatable ring dynamically identifying a variable value e.g. a setpoint temperature value and or dynamically identify an HVAC control related property. The processing system may be configured and programmed to provide an interactive thermostat menuing system on display area responsive to an inward pressing of rotatable ring e.g. such as for asking questions or otherwise obtaining data from users during interactive information exchange sessions as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 440 910 now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013 0268125 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and or to provide user navigation within the interactive thermostat menuing system based on rotation of rotatable ring and inward pressing of rotatable ring e.g. such as is described in relation to . The processing system may be adapted to cause the display driver and display area to display information to the user and or to receive user input via the rotatable ring .

For example an active variable e.g. variable value selection setpoint selection ZIP code selection may be determined based on a default state smart logic or previously received user input. A relationship between the variable and user input may be identified. The relationship may be e.g. linear or non linear continuous or discrete and or saturating or non saturating. Such relationships may be pre defined and stored within the thermostat. User input may be detected. Analysis of the user input may include e.g. identifying a type of user input tapping versus rotation a degree of input e.g. a degree of rotation a final input position e.g. a final angular position of the rotatable ring an input location e.g. a position of a tapping and or a speed of input e.g. a speed of rotation . Using the relationship the processing system may then determine a display indicator such as a digital numerical value representative of an identified value of a variable e.g. a setpoint temperature . The display indicator may be displayed on display area . For example a digital numerical value representative of a setpoint temperature to be displayed may be determined based on a prior setpoint value and a saturating and continuous relationship between rotation input and the temperature. The displayed value may be e.g. numeric textual or graphical.

The processing system may further set a variable value in accordance with a user selection. For example a particular type of user input e.g. inwards pressure exertion may be detected. A value of a selected variable may be determined based on e.g. a prior ring rotation displayed variable value etc. The variable may then be set to this value.

The processing system according to some embodiments is capable of carrying out the governance of the operation of smart thermostat including the user interface features described herein. The processing system is further programmed and configured to carry out other operations as described further hereinbelow and or in other ones of the commonly assigned incorporated applications. For example processing system is further programmed and configured to maintain and update a thermodynamic model for the enclosure in which the HVAC system is installed such as described in U.S. Ser. No. 12 881 463 U.S. Pat. No. 8 606 374 issued Dec. 10 2013 . According to some embodiments the wireless communications system is used to communicate with devices such as personal computers and or other thermostats or HVAC system components which can be peer to peer communications communications through one or more servers located on a private network and or communications through a cloud based service.

It should be appreciated that the smart thermostat could be equipped with a tactile mechanical feedback feature for providing software triggered mechanical feedback to encourage energy efficient user behavior. For example in the event a user attempts to input an ill advised temperature setting e.g. a setting that consumes a large amount of energy the tactile mechanical feedback features provide the user with negative mechanical feedback such as by vibrating making the ring hard or impossible to turn.

Further it should be appreciated that any of the smart devices described herein such as the smart hazard detector the smart thermostat the smart wall switch the smart doorbell etc. could have means for self generating power and optionally storing the generated power in a local battery. For example in some embodiments the smart devices include a Peltier Junction for generating power. In these embodiments for example the Peltier Junction generates electricity from heat differentials created between the smart device and its mounting location such as when the smart device gets hot from use. In other embodiments the smart devices are equipped with generators such as piezoelectric devices that generate electricity when the device is physically used such as when a user turns the ring on the smart thermostat. While piezoelectric devices are used in this example it should be appreciated that any generator devices known to those having skill in the art could be used.

Referring now to provided according to some embodiments are systems and methods for achieving smart home objectives using occupant location data e.g. GPS data . According to embodiments occupant location data in addition to other data obtained from smart home devices is provided to the central server or cloud computing system which uses the data to make inferences regarding the current and future occupancy of the home and or rooms and to control the smart devices in the home or otherwise associated with the home in a corresponding manner. Further according to embodiments provided are systems and methods for conflict sensing and resolution for accommodating multiple occupants in the smart home environment which has occupant location based controls of the smart home devices such as temperature adjustments via the smart thermostat. For example as described below the systems and methods identify conflicts in the preferences e.g. preferred temperature settings of the occupants of the home and resolves the conflicts based on prescribed or learned rules such has giving priority to the preferences of some occupants.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system obtains occupant location data such as GPS data from the mobile devices of the occupants. For example the occupants of a home e.g. the individuals who live in or frequently visit the home register their respective mobile devices as being associated with the home.

In some instances the central server or cloud computing system receives occupant location data directly from the mobile devices whereas in others the data is received from an intermediary such as one of the smart devices in the home.

In instances where occupant location data is received directly from the mobile device the central server or cloud computing system can determine if the occupant is at home or away as explained below. When an occupant is at home the central server or cloud computing system can determine the occupant s actual room location e.g. bedroom kitchen garage etc. . To do for example the central server or cloud computing system cross references the occupant location e.g. GPS coordinates with a map of the home.

In instances where occupant location data is received from smart devices the central server or cloud computing system can infer that the occupant is inside the home. Further the room location of the occupants can be determined. For example the smart wall switches the smart wall plugs the smart doorbells and other smart devices in the smart home environment detect the presence of the mobile device and transmit corresponding data to the central server or cloud computing system . Such detection of mobile devices can be accomplished using WiFi Bluetooth NFC etc. It should also be appreciated that passive RFID tags can be used to determine the room location of occupants and pets . For example an RFID is associated with each of the occupants and pets of the house such as by including the tags in wallets bracelets wristbands mobile devices collars etc. The smart devices in the various rooms detect the RFID tags and send that information to the central server or cloud computing system . It should be appreciated that because they are typical mounted in unobstructed locations high on walls of often occupied rooms smart hazard detectors are particularly well suited for RFID sensors.

In the illustrated example the occupants include Wife Husband and Child all of whom have registered their mobile device with the central server or cloud computing system as being associated with the smart home environment . Further two geo location boundaries or geo fences of any suitable area are registered as being associated with the smart home environment . In some embodiments the occupants of the home define and register the geo fences while in other embodiments the central server or cloud computing system auto generates the geo fences for the home.

Inner geo fence defines the perimeter of living area of the home. The area within the inner geo fence includes not only the home but also the land immediately surrounding the house including any closely associated structures such as garages or sheds the curtilage . Outer geo fence defines an outer perimeter which is sometimes miles from the home. The outer geo fence is adjustable and extends well beyond the curtilage. For example the perimeter defined by the outer geo fence may have a radius of two to three miles in some embodiments while in other embodiments the radius is larger or smaller.

According to embodiments the central server or cloud computing system infers that an occupant is at home when inside the inner geo fence and that the occupant is away when outside of the inner geo fence . Further the central server or cloud computing system infers an occupant is going home when the occupant moves e.g. travels by car from outside to inside the outer geo fence . As such the central server or cloud computing system uses the inner geo fence to determine when occupants leave the home and it uses the outer geo fence to determine when occupants are heading home.

Several example smart home objectives will now be described with reference to . In one example the central server or cloud computing system predicts that Wife is going home and makes adjustments in the smart home environment in anticipation of her arrival. In this example Wife travels from outside to inside the outer geo fence thereby triggering an indication that Wife is heading home. The Wife s speed and the distance between the fence and the home is used to predict the Wife s time of arrival. Using this information central server or cloud computing system can prepare for Wife s arrival such as by pre heating or cooling some or all of the rooms in the home to Wife s preferred temperature. Time to temperature calculations can be used to make the pre cooling or heading as efficient as possible and to ensure Wife s preferred temperature is achieved before she arrives. In the event neither Husband nor Child is home all rooms are pre heated or cooled. However if either or both Husband and Child are home rooms associated with Wife can be pre heated or cooled to Wife s desired temperature while other rooms are set to temperatures based the preferences of Husband and or Child . Rooms associated with Wife can be inferred by the central server or cloud computing system based on historical occupancy and usage data as well as based on a set of rules provided by the occupants see below .

In another example the central server or cloud computing system determines that the home is vacant because all occupants Wife Husband and Child are outside of the inner geo fence . In this case the central server or cloud computing system places the smart devices in their away settings. For example the lights are turned off the HVAC is set to a temperature that requires little or no heating or cooling the alarm is armed the doors are locked electronics and appliances e.g. televisions stoves space heaters etc. are turned off etc. In the event all occupants mobile devices are outside of the inner geo fence and movement is detected in the house the central server or cloud computing system can infer the movement is the family dog and can apply the dog s smart devices settings.

In yet another example Wife Husband and Child are all inside the inner geo fence . Applying the techniques described above the central server or cloud computing system knows that Wife is in the master bedroom and that Husband and Child are both in the den see discussion regarding room occupancy detection . Accordingly the central server or cloud computing system adjusts the temperature in the master bedroom to Wife s preferred setting and it applies a set of rules to determine whether to set the den to the Husband s or the Child s preferred setting. The set of rule for each room of the home provide a prioritized list of occupants and their respective settings. For example for the den Wife s settings are highest priority then Husband s and then the Child s. Thus in this case Husband s setting are applied in the den because his setting are higher priority than Child s. However if Wife were to later join them in the den her setting would be applied instead of Husband s.

In still another example Wife Husband and Child are all inside the inner geo fence . Wife and Husband are in the den but Child is in the yard playing. The central server or cloud computing system applies the above described techniques to determine that Wife and Husband are in the den. However Child is unaccounted for in any of the rooms. In this example Child was detected in the den earlier that day and none of the occupants have traveled outside of the inner fence that day. Using this information the central server or cloud computing system infers that Child is in the yard playing. Alternatively the central server or cloud computing system infers that Child is in the yard because it received data from the smart doorbell that the child exited the house yet it is also receiving data from Child s mobile device that Child is inside of the inner geo fence . Because the Child is in the yard the central server or cloud computing system prevents the irrigation system from turning on and it broadcasts occasional reminders to Husband and Wife via speakers provided in the smart devices for example.

As described above e.g. with respect to process of a security score may be calculated for a smart home environment. In some embodiments a computing system may be configured to receive home data from one or more network connected smart devices of a smart home environment process the received home data and generate a security score based on the processed home data. For example a computing system such as central server or cloud computing system may be configured to receive home data from one or more network connected smart devices such as one or more of devices of a smart home environment process the received home data as derived home data e.g. with a processing engine and or services and or third party sources and or paradigms and or extrinsic information and or any other suitable information services and generate a security score e.g. as a security service based on the processed home data . The security score may be generated based on processed home data that may include at least one of various types of data including but not limited to capability data opportunity data and environmental data.

Capability data may include any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one capability of at least one network connected smart device of the one or more network connected smart devices of the smart home environment for which a security score is being calculated or otherwise generated. Such capability data may be indicative of any suitable capability or capabilities of any suitable smart device or smart devices where each capability may be independent of any or all potential external influences. For example certain capability data may be device capability data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one capability of a particular network connected smart device of the smart home environment where each capability may be independent of any or all potential external influences on that smart device e.g. as if the particular smart device were placed in a vacuum and not affected by any external influences such as by an active user or by other characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the smart device may currently exist . Such device capability data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following capabilities of a particular smart device i current charge level of a battery of the device ii maximum potential charge capacity of a battery of the device iii any other current or potential capability of a battery or other power source of the device e.g. estimated length of use possible if no external power source were to be provided for the device iv currently enabled communication protocol s of the device v all communication protocols available to the device vi any other currently enabled or available communication capability of the device e.g. bidirectional communication capability vii currently enabled security features of the device viii all security features available to the device ix any other currently enabled or available security capability of the device e.g. user authentication capabilities data encryption capabilities etc. x currently enabled sensing features of the device xi all sensing features available to the device xii any other currently enabled or available sensing capabilities of the device e.g. the number and types and quality of each sensor available to the device the remaining lifespan need to replace a worn down part of the device etc. xiii currently enabled processing features of the device xiv all processing features available to the device xv any other currently enabled or available processing capabilities of the device e.g. the data processing speed and or data processing power available to the device xvi currently enabled output features of the device xvii all output features available to the device xviii any other currently enabled or available output capabilities of the device e.g. the number and types and quality of each output component available to the device xix any other suitable capabilities and xx any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the capabilities of a particular smart device of the smart home environment are outdated insufficient sufficient or top notch e.g. as compared to all available smart devices that may be readily available in the current market which may be determined via extrinsic information accessible to processing system thereby enabling a security score and or associated suggestions to reflect the ability of a user to upgrade one or more aspects of one or more smart devices of the smart home environment e.g. if an upgradeable head unit or software is available . Such device capability data may be processed by a computing system using data from one or more particular smart devices of the environment e.g. based on information available to detectable by the device and communicated by the device to the computing system and or using information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the smart device s for enabling processed home data of the device capability type.

As another example certain capability data may be network capability data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one capability of a network of two or more networked smart devices of the smart home environment where each capability may be independent of any or all potential external influences on that network of smart devices e.g. as if the particular network of smart devices were placed in a vacuum and not affected by any external influences such as an active user or characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the network of smart devices may currently exist . Such network capability data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following capabilities of a particular network of two or more smart devices i distance between any two smart devices of the network ii shared communication protocol s between any two smart devices of the network iii combined sensing capabilities of the network iv mesh spokesman node relationship between any two or all smart devices of the network v any other suitable capabilities and vi any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the capabilities of the network of the smart home environment enable proper networked communication between devices of the network whether each one of various desired sensing capabilities and or output capabilities for the environment are provided by at least one of the devices of the network and the like. Such network capability data may be processed by a computing system using data from the various smart devices of the network itself e.g. based on information available to detectable by the network and communicated by the network to the computing system and or using information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the network for enabling processed home data of the network capability type.

Opportunity data may include any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one opportunity afforded to at least one network connected smart device by at least one influencer of the smart home environment in which the at least one network connected smart device is provided. Such opportunity data may be indicative of any suitable opportunity or opportunities afforded to any suitable smart device or smart devices where each opportunity may be afforded by at least one influencer of the smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided. That is opportunity data may be indicative of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of smart device s and or the ability or inability of smart device s to succeed based on any or all potential external factors capable of influencing the smart device s . For example certain opportunity data may be device opportunity data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one opportunity afforded to a particular network connected smart device of the smart home environment where each opportunity may be based on any or all potential external factors capable of influencing that smart device e.g. any external influences by an active user or characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the smart device may currently exist . Such device opportunity data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following opportunities afforded to a particular smart device by the particular environment i type and or reliability of any environmental power source provided for the device e.g. whether a fixed power source such as a 120V line voltage wires of a structure of environment is powering the device ii position and or use of the device with respect to the environment e.g. what type of room the device is provided in e.g. kitchen or bedroom what type of element the device is proximate coupled to e.g. HVAC lamp window door etc. etc. iii proximity of device to any environmental influencers that may have an undesired or desired effect on the performance of the device e.g. a PIR sensor of a device being positioned in the direct path of an HVAC vent whereby the air flow from the vent may alter a characteristic of the sensor to increase the likelihood of triggering a false reading or preventing an accurate reading a smoke detector being provided inside a fireplace thereby increasing the likelihood of triggering false alarms a smoke detector being provided directly next to an open window thereby decreasing the likelihood of an accurate reading for the interior of the environment a sensor of a smart device positioned next to a dog bed or other influencer of the environment where a considerable amount of dander or other uncommon particles may exist and undesirably influence the operation effectiveness of that sensor etc. iv exposure to any environmental influencers that may have an undesired or desired effect on the security of the device e.g. a large number of authentication codes being active for the device may indicate unnecessary exposure to a security breach an authentication code for the device being too short untrustworthy how many occupants have had their contact information verified for use in response to an alarm condition of the device responsiveness of a user occupant to previous alarm conditions or other actions of the device e.g. how quickly a user occupant responded to an actual alarm or a test alarm that may be randomly generated by the device for testing the responsiveness of the user etc. v currently enabled disabled communication protocol s of the device e.g. as set by a user of the environment vi currently enabled disabled security feature s of the device e.g. as set by a user of the environment vii currently enabled disabled sensing feature s of the device e.g. thresholds or otherwise as set by a user of the environment viii currently enabled disabled processing feature s of the device e.g. timers or otherwise as set by a user of the environment ix currently enabled disabled output features of the device e.g. as set by a user of the environment x any other suitable device opportunities and xi any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the capabilities of a particular smart device of the smart home environment are promoted or inhibited or jeopardized by one or more external influencers e.g. by a user or other characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the smart device may currently exist thereby enabling a security score and or associated suggestions to reflect the ability of a user to make adjustments with respect to such external influencers on the smart device e.g. a suggestion to move the smart device away from the vent to increase a sensing threshold of a sensor to turn on a device option such that the device may mimic the user s patterns when the user is away etc. . Such device opportunity data may be processed by a computing system using data from one or more particular smart devices of the environment e.g. based on any information available to detectable by the device and communicated by the device to the computing system and or using information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the smart device s for enabling processed home data of the device opportunity type. Following just one particular example a smart device with a PIR sensor may also include a camera or thermometer to detect data indicative of the device being positioned too close to a vent. Following another example a sensor may continuously detect a high level of a particular particle e.g. pet dander and determine that an influencer of the environment may be causing such detection.

As another example certain opportunity data may be network opportunity data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one opportunity afforded to a network of two or more networked smart devices of the smart home environment where each opportunity may be based on any or all potential external factors capable of influencing that network of smart devices e.g. any external influences by an active user or characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the network of smart devices may currently exist . Such network opportunity data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following opportunities afforded to a particular network of two or more smart devices i environmental impediments to a communication channel pathway between any two smart devices of the network e.g. a concrete wall between two adjacent devices that may degrade inhibit data communicated amongst the devices ii environmental impediments to a communication channel pathway between the network and communication system e.g. reliability of the environment s wireless router or connection to internet for communicatively coupling the network of smart devices to computing system availability of requisite trusted SSL certificates for supporting secure video streaming with emergency personnel etc. iii type and or reliability of any environmental power source provided for particular devices of the network e.g. whether a fixed power source such as a 120V line voltage wires of a structure of environment is powering at least one spokesman node of the network iv availability detectability of a map of the environment e.g. quality of the map positional information of the network with respect to the expanse or specific features of the environment v network coverage of the environment e.g. amount locations of detected black spots percentage of doors of environment associated with a particular smart device e.g. smart entry detector and or smart doorknob and or smart doorbell percentage of overall interior volume of structure of environment monitored sensed by hazard detectors or any other smart device sensor type percentage of overall exterior area of environment covered by outdoor lighting system or any other smart device output type etc. vi exposure to any environmental influencers that may have an undesired or desired effect on the security of the network e.g. a large number of authentication codes being active for the network may indicate exposure to a security breach an authentication code for the network being too short untrustworthy current security measures of an occupant s web browser or mobile app e.g. on a device how many occupants have had their contact information verified for use in response to an alarm condition of the network responsiveness of a user occupant to previous alarm conditions or other actions of the network e.g. how quickly a user occupant responded to an actual alarm or a test alarm that may be randomly generated by the network for testing the responsiveness of the user etc. vii currently enabled disabled communication protocol s of the network e.g. as set by a user of the environment viii currently enabled disabled security feature s of the network e.g. as set by a user of the environment ix currently enabled disabled sensing feature s of the network e.g. thresholds or otherwise as set by a user of the environment x currently enabled disabled processing feature s of the network e.g. timers or otherwise as set by a user of the environment xi currently enabled disabled output features of the network e.g. as set by a user of the environment xii any other suitable network opportunities and xiii any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the capabilities of a network of smart devices of the smart home environment are promoted or inhibited or jeopardized by one or more external influencers e.g. by a user or other characteristic s of the smart home environment in which the network may currently exist thereby enabling a security score and or associated suggestions to reflect the ability of a user to make adjustments with respect to external influencers on the network e.g. a suggestion to move at least one of two adjacent smart devices such that a direct path between the two devices avoids a concrete wall or to decrease the number of active authentication codes for the network or to turn on a network option such that one or more devices of the network may work in tandem to mimic the user s patterns when the user is away etc. . Such network opportunity data may be processed by a computing system using data from the various smart devices of the network itself e.g. based on information available to detectable by the network and communicated by the network to the computing system and or information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the network for enabling processed home data of the network opportunity type.

Environmental data may include any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one behavioral characteristic of the smart home environment in which at least one network connected smart device is provided. Such environmental data may be indicative of any suitable behavioral characteristic or characteristics of the smart home environment in which any suitable smart device or smart devices is provided where each behavioral characteristic may be indicative of at least one security influencer of the smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided. For example certain environmental data may be micro environmental data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one behavioral characteristic of the particular smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided e.g. on a micro level independent of other smart home environments or any other environments beyond the scope of the particular smart home environment that may be in the same neighborhood or share similar traits with the particular smart home environment . Such micro environmental data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following behavioral characteristics of the particular smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided i exposure of environmental objects with respect to public view e.g. an expensive item such as a large television being visible through a window of a structure of the environment may increase the target of that environment and the likelihood of an attempted robbery while a crime deterring item such as a guard dog or a label identifying the security features of the environment being made apparent to a would be thief may decrease the target of that environment and the likelihood of an attempted robbery ii a potentially dangerous object not being secured e.g. a gun detected outside of a suitable receptacle such as a home safe smart device as described above iii features of an ingress or of any other vulnerability of a structure of the environment e.g. the size of a window being too small to enable a criminal to enter therethrough and or a window being protected by security bars for preventing a criminal to enter through the window thereby reducing the security risk of such a window or the distance of a window above the external ground earth being less than a certain threshold for enabling a criminal on foot to access the window thereby increasing the security risk of such a window iv occupant personal device recognition e.g. the number of occupants personal devices at the environment that are known verified or unknown unverified to the smart device s computing system thereby increasing or decreasing the security of the environment v activities habits of the environment such as v.a tendencies for a user to remember to lock a door and or turn off a light appliance after use as may be detected by any suitable smart device as described above which may increase a security score due to ingresses being locked and or potentially dangerous environment elements being shut down after use v.b certain types of food preparation in the environment may tend to be considered dangerous e.g. deep frying as may be detected through examination of particle size sensed by a blue IR sensor or any other suitable sensor of a smart device may be considered more dangerous than making a bowl of cereal and may decrease a security score v.c recreational smoking in the environment may negatively affect a security score e.g. tobacco smoking or even use of a fire place that emits certain smoke that may be detectable by any suitable sensor of any suitable smart device may be dangerous or increase risk of fire v.d nocturnal behaviors may increase a security score by discouraging a would be night thief e.g. occupants that are detected to be awake and active and or using lights at night may reduce the size of a target of the environment for theft rather than occupants that are either asleep or away from the environment at night such that a thief under the cover of darkness may be tempted to burglarize an inactive environment and or v.e irrational careless behavior may decrease a security score by increasing the likelihood of a dangerous situation e.g. as may be detected through analysis of the age mental state of an occupant such as an occupant that is sleep deprived or otherwise compromised e.g. intoxicated forgetful immature etc. as may be detected by any suitable sensor of any suitable smart device etc. vi user provided answers to security questions e.g. Do you hide a key to the environment under a door mat When is the last time you practiced a fire drill Is your environment provided with a back up power generator in case of a power grid power outage etc. as may be generated proposed by one or more smart devices during interactive information exchange sessions as described in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 440 910 now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013 0268125 which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety where such answers may increase or decrease the security score vii any other suitable micro environmental data and viii any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the behaviors exhibited at the environment on a micro level promote or inhibit or jeopardize the security of the environment thereby enabling a security score and or associated suggestions to reflect the ability of a user to make adjustments with respect to such behaviors e.g. a suggestion to stop deep frying inside a structure of the environment or to move the expensive television away from the see through window etc. . Such micro environmental data may be processed by a computing system using data from one or more particular smart devices of the environment e.g. based on any information available to detectable by the device s and communicated by the device s to the computing system and or information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the smart device s for enabling processed home data of the micro environmental type. Following just one particular example a single smart device or a combination of adjacent smart devices may include one or more cameras or other suitable sensors for identifying an expensive object within the environment that may be within a threshold distance of an uncovered window or for detecting the presence of a pet that barks whenever a sound over a certain threshold is made and the like. Following another particular example a smart device may include a camera for identifying a window as well as an altimeter for identifying the altitude or height of that window above the ground. As yet another example a smart device may identify a window and a proximate user device and then poll that device for its altimeter data. As another example a smart device may include a camera configured to detect a window as well as security bars that may be protecting that window. As yet another example a smart device may identify a window and then propose questions to a user about that window such as What is the height of this window above the earth or What is the cross sectional area of this window or Are there any security bars protecting this window etc.

As another example certain environmental data may be macro environmental data which may be any suitable data that may be indicative of at least one behavioral characteristic of the environment surrounding or otherwise associated with the particular smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided e.g. on a macro level related to other environments beyond the scope of the particular smart home environment that may be in the same neighborhood as or share similar traits with the particular smart home environment . Such macro environmental data may include but is not limited to data that may be indicative of one or more of the following behavioral characteristics of environment s related to the particular smart home environment in which each of the at least one smart device is provided i accessibility of the particular environment to security agencies e.g. the distance or travel time between the particular smart home environment and an emergency response entity such as the police fire department etc. where increased distance travel time may decrease the security score and where such travel time may vary by taking into account current weather travel conditions ii ambient environmental conditions e.g. weather acts of nature traffic construction service status entities e.g. nuclear power plants etc. existing at around the particular smart home environment that may impact the security of the particular smart home environment such as where a current drought or nearby forest fires or a firefighter strike may negatively impact the security score iii historical data regarding the macro environment e.g. crime rates for the neighborhood of the particular smart home environment frequency and average duration of power outages in the neighborhood etc. which may negatively or positively impact a security score iv accessible security networks e.g. number and size of neighborhood security networks accessible to or otherwise in communication with the particular smart home environment as described above whereby the greater the amount of other smart device equipped environments a particular smart home environment may synergize with the higher the security score for that particular smart home environment may be v any other suitable macro environmental data e.g. security data related to other floors or the entrance of an apartment building if the particular smart home environment is a single apartment or floor in a larger apartment complex where such data may include the secureness of the ingress to the entire apartment complex the crime rate for that building the security features of the building that are not directly associated with the particular smart home environment e.g. fire escape available on the roof of the complex and the distance to the roof from the particular smart home environment etc. and vi any combinations thereof. For example this may enable the security score to be based on a determination of whether or not the behaviors exhibited at the environment on a macro level promote or inhibit or jeopardize the security of the environment thereby enabling a security score and or associated suggestions to reflect the ability of a user to make adjustments with respect to such behaviors e.g. a suggestion to enable communication with more neighborhood security networks or to buy a backup power generator etc. . Such macro environmental data may be processed by a computing system using data from one or more particular smart devices of the environment e.g. based on any information available to detectable by the device s and communicated by the device s to the computing system and or information from other sources accessible to the computing system e.g. extrinsic information paradigms entities etc. that may be used to supplement the processing of any data received from the smart device s for enabling processed home data of the macro environmental type. Following just one particular example a smart device may include a GPS device for identifying the current geographical location of the device and thus the particular smart home environment while extrinsic information or law enforcement may provide crime data for that geographical location. As another example a smart device may include a weather sensor that may be configured to calculate total rainfall or snowfall at that device for any given historical time period.

As mentioned above a security score for a particular smart home environment may be calculated by comparing home data from one or more smart devices of the particular smart home environment against a list of security criterions to determine how many of the security criterions are satisfied e.g. through processed capability data opportunity data and or environmental data . Higher scores may indicate that a particular smart home environment satisfies a high number of security criterions and is therefore relatively secure whereas lower scores indicate that the particular smart home environment fails to satisfy many of the criterions. According to embodiments security scores can be normalized and scaled so that occupants of a particular smart home environment can compare the security of their particular smart home environment to other particular smart home environments. For example a score of 0 to 100 can be used where 0 is the lowest possible score and 100 is the highest possible score. Further for example the central server or cloud computing system may generate a report or log that may list the security criterions and or provide an indication of whether the particular smart home environment satisfies each of the criterions. Occupants can review this list to determine which criterions are not satisfied and then make the appropriate improvements to the particular smart home environment so as to increase the security score of the particular smart home environment. Additionally the central server or cloud computing system can use this log to generate a list of suggestions for improving the particular smart home environment. It may prioritize the list based on which criterions are associated with the most points indicate which creation can be easily and cheaply satisfied with only minor improvement and or indicate which unsatisfied criterions are typically satisfied in other smart home environments. For example the central server or cloud computing system can send the following message to an occupant e.g. to an occupant s personal electronic smart device We notice that you often leave the front door unlocked. Most homes in your neighborhood keep the front door locked at all times. Locking your front door at night is an easy and inexpensive way to improve your home s security and to improve your security score. While certain security criterions for assessing the security of and or calculating a security score have been discussed herein it should be appreciated that any number and combination of security criterions can be used when assessing security and or calculating a security score for a particular smart home environment.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Various capabilities of smart doorbell may provide a smart and at least partially automated interface between a resident of smart home environment and any potential visitor at smart home environment including delivery services friends solicitors strangers and would be thieves. Smart doorbell may be leveraged with one or more other network connected smart devices of environment such as one or more of devices and or and or with services platform such that smart doorbell may serve as a trusted and effective liaison between a system user associated with environment e.g. a resident owner occupant etc. and a visitor that may approach an entry point of environment at which smart doorbell may be provided whether or not the system user is currently at environment . For example smart doorbell may be a visitor interface or entryway interface device operative to detect and react to the approach to and or departure from a location e.g. an outer door of structure of environment by a person or any other suitable visitor entity announce such an approach or departure enhance conventional doorbell functionality for both system users and visitors control settings on a security system increase the convenience and efficiency of package delivery increase the traceability of package delivery enable secure package delivery detect environmental data and other useful data for environment and system and the like.

By virtue of potentially being mounted in place of a traditional doorbell or other conventional entryway interface e.g. at outer structure door at gated entry at a lobby of a shared residence such as a condominium or apartment building at the front door of an individual residence at such a building etc. smart doorbell may have access to plentiful electrical operating power such as by coupling to wiring e.g. to 120V hot line voltage wires that may be behind walls of smart home environment and that may be present at virtually all standard wired areas. Such an essentially unlimited power budget the near ubiquity of excellent installation locations throughout an environment and the reasonably ample physical space on its face plate and in its housing to fit the necessary components may combine to enable smart doorbell to accommodate a rich and wide variety of sensing interface and communications capabilities for smart home environment as well as a general platform for the provision of even newer sensing interface and communications hardware as it becomes available over the coming decades. A rich variety of new interactions may be made possible between smart doorbell and other devices of the smart home environment . Occupancy sensing for example can be significantly enhanced by virtue of the great locations e.g. usually right next to entryways of most visitor or entryway interfaces which may thereby allow for easy tracking of entities e.g. system users visitors etc. as they approach and or enter and or depart and or exit entryways of environment predictive occupancy algorithms and so forth.

According to some embodiments head unit sometimes referred to herein as replacement module may actually at least partially contain or otherwise provide some or all of the sensors processors user interfaces the rechargeable battery and so forth of smart doorbell . Users can plug and unplug or otherwise removably couple unit in and out of docking station . Many different commercial and functional possibilities for provisioning maintenance and upgrade are possible. For example after years of using any particular head unit a user may be able to acquire a new version of head unit and simply plug it into the docking station . There are also many different versions for head unit such as an extremely low cost version that is nothing but a motion occupancy detector and conventional doorbell and then a progression of increasingly capable versions up to and including extremely fancy head units with a large number of features. Thus it should be appreciated that the various versions of head units can all be interchangeable with any of them working when placed into any docking station . This can advantageously encourage sharing and re deployment of old head units for example when an important high capability head unit for the front door for example can be replaced by a great new version of the head unit then the old head unit can be re deployed to a back or basement door etc. When first plugged into a particular docking station a particular head unit may be configured to ask the user via any suitable interface e.g. 2D LCD display 2D 3D holographic projection voice interaction etc. a few simple questions such as Where am I and the user can select front door or garage door or back door or front gate and so forth. In other examples head unit can provide instructions such as Press button once if I am at the front door press twice if I am at the back door etc.

According to some embodiments head unit may include one or more of a main processor storage button and or touch screen display and or any other suitable user interface e.g. keyboard trackball switch slide 3 dimensional user input devices user interfaces etc. audio speaker microphone power converter global positioning system GPS component e.g. GPS receiver radio frequency identification RFID locator and general physical module receiver . Head unit may additionally or alternatively include one or more types of a wireless and or wired networking component . In view of the ample power availability a variety of any suitable communications capabilities can be provided by networking component to smart doorbell including Bluetooth Wi Fi ZigBee 3G 4G wireless CAT6 wired Ethernet and even optical fiber from the curb. Furthermore because smart doorbell may be coupled to a home 120V system or any other suitable wired or wireless power system a HomePlug or other powerline communications capability can be provided by networking component . Such communication capabilities may enable smart doorbell to communicate with any other smart device of environment and or with any suitable element of platform .

Head unit of smart doorbell may additionally or alternatively include any number of any suitable sensor components such as any suitable temperature sensor any suitable humidity sensor any suitable occupancy sensor any suitable ambient light sensor ALS any suitable fire sensor any suitable smoke sensor any suitable carbon monoxide CO sensor any suitable proximity sensor any suitable passive infrared PIR or other motion sensor any suitable ultrasound sensor any suitable still or video camera or scanner e.g. a charge coupled device CCD camera a complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS camera or any suitable scanner e.g. a barcode scanner or any other suitable scanner that may obtain identifying information from a code such as a linear barcode a two dimensional or matrix barcode e.g. a quick response QR code a three dimensional barcode or the like any suitable near field communication NFC technique sensor e.g. for sensing an entity wearing an infrared or NFC capable smartphone or other suitable element any suitable RFID technique sensor e.g. for sensing an entity wearing an RFID bracelet RFID necklace RFID key fob or other suitable element any suitable audio sensor e.g. a microphone which may operate in conjunction with an audio processing application that may be accessible to doorbell e.g. at environment system or other accessible component s of platform which may identify a particular voice or other specific audio data for authenticating a user or for any other suitable purpose any suitable biometric sensor e.g. a fingerprint reader or heart rate sensor or facial recognition sensor or any other feature recognition sensor which may operate in conjunction with a feature processing application that may be accessible to doorbell e.g. at environment system or other accessible component s of platform for authenticating a user or for any other suitable purpose and the like. A rechargeable battery or any equivalently capable onboard power storage medium may also be provided by head unit . For example battery can be a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery. In operation smart doorbell may charge battery during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is less than what power stealing can safely provide and may discharge to provide any needed extra electrical power during time intervals in which the hardware power usage is greater than what power stealing can safely provide which may thereby extract power as needed from the 120V hot line voltage wire or other suitable power source. Battery may be used as a conventional back up source or as a reservoir to supply excess DC power if needed for short periods.

User interface may include one or more visual displays e.g. thin film transistor TFT organic light emitting diode OLED or any other suitable display touchscreen and or button input capabilities audio speaker microphone and the like. In some embodiments e.g. as may be shown in a particular head unit of smart doorbell may include user interface with a click and rotate annular ring input button. According to such embodiments the click and rotate annular ring input button may be used by a visitor to simply ring a doorbell e.g. for a visitor to attempt to announce itself . Furthermore in some embodiments such a click and rotate annular ring input button may be operative to provide menu driven interfaces for user governance of some or all of the various capabilities of doorbell . User interface may additionally or alternatively be configured to take a variety of forms including but not limited to a touch pad dial click wheel scroll wheel touch screen 3 dimensional input and or output interface one or more buttons e.g. a single conventional doorbell like button or multiple buttons of a keyboard mouse joy stick track ball and the like. Moreover one or more of sensor components may also be at least partially used as an input component e.g. by sensing data from a user e.g. as a microphone camera scanner biometric sensor and the like and or may be at least partially integrated into user interface e.g. user interface may include a biometric fingerprint scanner to identify the fingerprint of an entity that may touch user interface . As may be shown in a 2D image and or 3D holographic image projector may also be provided so that the effective dimension of the display is not just limited to the physical size of a face of head unit . For example as described below e.g. with respect to if a package is to be deposited by a visitor smart doorbell may leverage projector to project a defined drop off area for the package e.g. area AL of as described below in more detail . When button is depressed touched or otherwise selectively interacted with and or utilized by a visitor doorbell may be operative to generate and transmit a signal e.g. via any suitable wired or wireless communication path to a user communicative component for alerting a user that a visitor is at doorbell where such a user communicative component may be any suitable smart component of smart environment e.g. an output component of a hazard device or a communication mechanism available to a user device or any conventional component of a user environment e.g. a chime of a conventional doorbell and or an emergency light of a home .

Smart doorbell of environment may be configured to include any suitable combination of any of the components described above with respect to any component of platform so as to appropriately interact with other smart devices of environment and services platform and any other suitable entity such as system users registered with or associated with environment e.g. owners occupants etc. and or visitor entities that may visit environment e.g. package deliverers friends solicitors strangers would be thieves etc. . Such a smart doorbell may be a visitor interface or entryway interface device operative to control and detect a visitor s approach to and or departure from a location e.g. an outer door of structure of environment announce such an approach or departure enhance conventional doorbell functionality for both system users and visitors control settings on a security system increase the convenience and efficiency of package delivery increase the traceability of package delivery enable secure package delivery detect environmental data and other useful data for environment and system and the like. Doorbell on behalf of smart environment and platform e.g. system may act as a custodian to environment with respect to any visitors that may approach environment .

One or more sensors of doorbell alone or in combination with other smart devices and or rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence and or any other processing capabilities provided at environment and or otherwise by services platform may be operative to detect when a package is attempted to be delivered to smart home environment and then doorbell may be operative to take one or more of a variety of automated actions in response to such detection. For example as shown in if a visitor entity or deliverer DL e.g. a human courier or a drone or otherwise is attempting to deliver a package PL to a portion of environment such as to structure at an entryway provided with a smart doorbell doorbell may be operative to access certain package identification information associated with package PL. In some embodiments doorbell may be operative to receive certain package identification information from deliverer DL such as by deliverer DL actively physically communicating such package identification information to doorbell e.g. audibly to an sensing component of doorbell and or by deliverer DL electronically communicating such package identification information to a networking communication component of doorbell e.g. by communicating digital data from a deliverer s mobile device which may be similar to a user device using any suitable communications protocol e.g. via a communication path . In some embodiments doorbell may be operative to access certain package identification information directly from package PL such as by a scanner sensing component of doorbell scanning information e.g. code information from a label ID e.g. a shipping label or delivery label coupled to or otherwise associated with package PL e.g. via a communication path . In response to detecting such package identification information of package PL platform e.g. doorbell alone or in combination with other smart devices and or rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence provided at environment and or services platform may be operative to access additional information based on that detected package identification information e.g. the sender recipient a description of the contents of package PL whether signature is required to complete the delivery etc. and or to take one or more of a variety of automated actions based on that detected package identification information and or additionally accessed information.

Such package identification information that may be associated with a package e.g. package PL may be generated by any suitable entity or combination of entities using any suitable data. In some embodiments certain package identification information that may be associated with package PL may uniquely identify a particular smart home environment and or a system user registered with or otherwise associated with environment e.g. a resident of environment and or a mode setting thereof such that an entity with access to such package identification information may be able to access additional information associated with that environment or user of environment . For example a delivery entity e.g. a courier service such as Federal Express that may be in the process of delivering package PL to environment may use certain package identification information to access any suitable smart environment data e.g. dynamic data regarding environment or a user thereof that may be identifiable by that package identification information for increasing the convenience and efficiency of package delivery. Such smart environment data may be indicative of a status of environment or of a particular user of environment e.g. the availability of someone at environment to receive package PL whereby a delivery entity may be able to leverage such smart environment data for more efficiently attempting to deliver package PL.

Next at step process may include accessing smart environment data that may be associated with at least one of the recipient and the location of the order of step . Such smart environment data may include any suitable data indicative of a particular smart home environment and or user e.g. user UL or UR of that may be registered or otherwise associated with platform e.g. a smart entity . For example any smart environment e.g. smart home or other environment equipped with one or more smart devices that may be integrated with platform may be associated with any suitable environment platform identifier e.g. via address geographic coordinates unique environment ID etc. that platform may use to uniquely identify environment in any suitable way. Additionally or alternatively any system user e.g. person animal etc. that may be registered or otherwise associated with platform may be associated with any suitable user platform identifier e.g. via name address facial detection a registered personal mobile device unique user ID etc. that platform may use to uniquely identify that user in any suitable way. In some embodiments by leveraging the identification of the recipient and or location provided during placement of the order at step certain smart environment data may be accessed that may be associated with that recipient and or location e.g. any suitable user platform identifier of platform associated with that recipient as a known user of platform and or any suitable environment platform identifier of platform associated with that location as a known environment of platform . For example a facilitator entity such as a fulfillment entity that may facilitate the placement of the order and or a delivery entity that may facilitate the delivery of the order may communicate with platform in order to attempt to access such smart environment data e.g. if the recipient or location of the order matches any known user or environment of platform . As just one example such a facilitator entity may be a fulfillment entity e.g. Amazon.com or a delivery entity e.g. Federal Express and may be a business that may be operative to communicate with any other suitable portion of platform e.g. system via one or more APIs to access such smart environment data that may be associated with the recipient and or location of the order. As another example a fulfillment entity may also be a delivery entity e.g. a restaurant that receives an order prepares the meal content and then delivers e.g. on foot or bicycle or car the meal content in a package e.g. brown bag to environment . Alternatively or additionally the ordering entity that placed the order of step may provide the facilitator entity with suitable smart environment data e.g. a user platform identifier of platform associated with the recipient and or an environment platform identifier of platform associated with the location may be known to and shared by the ordering entity with a facilitator entity either during or after placement of the order at step . Alternatively or additionally the order placed at step may be at least partially enabled by a component or subsystem of platform e.g. of system that may be operative to provide the facilitator entity e.g. fulfillment entity and or delivery entity with suitable smart environment data associated with the order e.g. a user platform identifier of platform associated with the recipient and or an environment platform identifier of platform associated with the location of the order may be known to and shared by system with a facilitator entity e.g. via API either during or after placement of the order at step .

At step process may include generating unique package identification information e.g. unique invitation identification information based on the accessed smart environment data and at least one of the content the recipient and the location of the ordered package and or a facilitator of the ordered package. For example if a smart environment and or a user of platform e.g. a smart system entity is associated with the location and or recipient of the ordered package such that smart environment data indicative of that smart environment and or user may be accessed at step unique package identification information may be generated at step that may identify that smart environment and or that user of platform e.g. using the smart environment data and or at least one identifier of the ordered package e.g. the content the recipient the location and or a facilitator fulfiller deliverer entity that may be at least partially responsible for delivering the package etc. . Such unique package identification information may be generated by any suitable entity such as by system and or a business facilitator entity and may be shared with any other suitable entity or entities e.g. with system by facilitator entity and or with facilitator entity by system . For example in some embodiments system may associate smart environment data of a smart system entity e.g. an environment and or user U with at least one of a recipient or location of a placed order and may generate unique package identification information for that order using the smart environment data and any suitable identifier s of that order and then may share that unique package identification information with a facilitator of the order e.g. a delivery entity charged with delivering the ordered package . Alternatively in some embodiments a business that may facilitate the order e.g. a retail entity or a delivery entity may access smart environment data when at least one of the recipient and location of an order is associated with a smart system entity of system and then business may generate unique package identification information for that order using the smart environment data and or any suitable identifier s of that order e.g. recipient deliverer orderer contents location etc. where such unique package identification information may be shared by facilitator business with system or any other suitable portion of platform e.g. a confirmation number generated by such a facilitator entity for a specific order e.g. a unique order confirmation number may be leveraged as such unique package identification information .

Process may include a facilitator obtaining at step a current status or mode setting of a smart system entity e.g. an environment and or user U of the smart environment data that may be associated with the unique identification information of the ordered package and then at step altering delivery of the ordered package based on the obtained status. That is when a smart environment and or a user U of system e.g. a smart system entity may be associated with a placed order e.g. as a location and or recipient of the order such that unique package identification information may be generated that links that environment or user with the placed order the handling of that order may be affected by any suitable characteristic of that environment or user. For example after an order for a package is placed e.g. at step but before that ordered package is delivered e.g. at step a current status or characteristic of at least one smart system entity associated with the ordered package as may be determined through leveraging platform and unique package identification information e.g. at step may be obtained by a facilitator for altering the delivery of the package.

As just one example when a facilitator delivery entity is about to deliver the ordered package e.g. when the ordered package is received at a distribution center proximal to the location from a remote originating distribution center the delivery entity may leverage the unique package identification information of the package to obtain current status information of a smart system entity associated with the package e.g. associated with the unique package identification information from platform e.g. system in order to determine how to most efficiently deliver the package. In some embodiments e.g. after step and or prior to step the unique package identification information may be incorporated into data e.g. code data or NFC data of a shipping label that may be affixed to or otherwise associated with the package e.g. label ID of package PL of and such a label may be scanned by the delivery entity in advance of an actual delivery attempt of the ordered package e.g. at step so as to enable the delivery entity to obtain current status information about the ordered package from platform . Such status information may be dynamic and change over time e.g. after step but before step such that the facilitator entity may obtain current status information before attempting to deliver the package in order to efficiently deliver the package based on the most useful status information. For example a deliverer of delivery entity business may first access and leverage the unique package identification information of a package to obtain current status information prior to a deliverer of delivery entity business arriving at environment with the package. As shown in for example a deliverer agent DR at a dispatch center DC of business remote from location LU of environment may utilize label ID of package PL to access and leverage the unique package identification information of package PL to obtain current status information prior to business instructing deliverer agent DL of to arrive at door of environment with package PL.

Status information regarding a smart system entity e.g. a smart environment or user U may be any suitable information generated by or inferred from any suitable data of platform e.g. of sensors of environment and or from user U . As just one particular example as mentioned above system may use tracking information to make inferences regarding the current and or future occupancy of home environment and or the current and or future location of a user U e.g. at environment like user UL of and Husband of or away from environment like user UR of and Wife of where such current and or future occupancy inferences may be obtained as current status information and then may be leveraged by a facilitator to affect the delivery of the package e.g. to delay delivery until a time when environment may be occupied by the recipient to receive the delivery . As another example system may be configured to enable a user U to access information about any ordered packages that may be associated with that user e.g. packages to be delivered to that user as a recipient or to that user s smart environment as a location which may be determined through identifying any unique package identification information that may be associated with that user or an environment of that user e.g. with an applicable smart system entity such that the user may manually update any settings that he or she may wish to have be associated with any such ordered package e.g. for affecting its delivery . For example using a device a user may interface with any suitable user interface that may be provided by any suitable entity of platform e.g. system to dictate and or edit any status information that may be associated with an ordered package and then used by a facilitator business for efficiently delivering that package such as altering the delivery location e.g. target at which the package ought to be delivered or defining a particular time during which the delivery should or should not be made to the location and the like. Therefore the status information that may be obtained by a facilitator e.g. a deliverer at step may be indicative of the actual current status of a smart system entity e.g. a smart environment or user U at that moment and or of a future status of that smart system entity e.g. during what future times environment is expected to be occupied and during what future times environment is expected to not be occupied etc. and such status information may be based on inferences or other processing that may be automatically carried out by platform e.g. system based on any suitable sensed data with respect to any smart system entity e.g. by any smart sensing devices of environment and or based on any manual instructions or settings defined or otherwise provided by a system user to platform e.g. to a smart device and or to system .

A do not disturb mode may be set for a particular environment or at least a portion thereof for any suitable length of time that may start at a current or future moment. Such a mode may indicate that environment may not be willing or able to accept at least certain package deliveries e.g. deliveries requiring a confirmation of receipt user signature by a particular user or any user . Such a mode may be manually set by an appropriate user e.g. a user with appropriate management rights for environment using any suitable device or interaction with any other suitable smart device of environment or any other suitable component of system of platform for any suitable reason such as when the user does not want to greet a visitor e.g. if the user is feeling under the weather or going to sleep or when the user will not be at environment e.g. when the user is going on vacation or leaving a babysitter at home with a child . Alternatively platform may be operative to collect any suitable information from one or more smart devices of environment and may make inferences in order to automatically set a do not disturb mode for environment e.g. based on sensed occupancy data and sensed movement data .

Information indicative of when environment may be associated with such a mode may be a type of current status information that may be associated by platform with unique package identification information and shared with or otherwise made accessible to a facilitator entity e.g. a delivery business for increasing the efficiency of package delivery and or of any other activity that may include a visitor interacting with environment . Such information may be handled with sensitivity so as to not be leveraged for sinister purposes e.g. for a third party to detect when an environment is in a do not disturb mode so as to assume no one is home and attempt a robbery of the premises . System may be configured to share information about a do not disturb mode of an environment or any other suitable status information of environment or a user thereof with a third party such as a facilitator of a package delivery only when certain data is accessible to that third party. For example system may only share such status information when a facilitator entity queries system with respect to particular unique package identification information e.g. such information as may be generated at step and linked with a particular ordered package . Certain facilitator entities e.g. Federal Express may be trusted and enabled by platform to interpret such unique package identification information for appropriately querying system about such status information and whereby system may be configured to only share such status information when queried by a trusted entity e.g. when the unique package identification information is known by or otherwise leveraged by an entity e.g. a deliverer entity trusted by system and not just when any entity has access to the recipient and or location data of the ordered package .

Status information of a smart system entity associated with unique package identification information of an ordered package may include various types of information that may be obtained and leveraged e.g. at steps by a facilitator entity for delivering the package in a manner that may be more efficient for the facilitator entity and or that may be more convenient for environment or a user thereof. For example such status information may include information indicative of when to allow delivery to a particular location e.g. after 4 00 PM on Mondays and Wednesdays only at environment information indicative of preferred alternate delivery methods e.g. do not deliver to environment but rather hold a particular package at a particular deliverer pick up location for manual pick up by a particular user or deliver to another recipient and or to another location other than the recipient and or location initially defined at step information indicative of authorization to deliver without signed confirmation of receipt of delivery e.g. a particular authenticated user of the system hereby authorizes deliverer to deliver a particular package to a particular location and leave next to the front door of that location without a human user signing for that delivery and or any other suitable information indicative of any other suitable delivery preferences or delivery instructions. For example in response to receiving status information indicative of authorization to deliver to another location the facilitator may be operative to obtain status information associated with a smart environment of that other location e.g. for repeating one or more steps of process with respect to that smart environment .

In some embodiments status information may be provided to a facilitator on a macro level in addition to or as an alternative to providing status information with respect to just one particular environment and or user thereof. For example status information may be made available to a facilitator entity business that may be generally indicative of a status or trend of a particular group of smart system entities e.g. a neighborhood or ZIP code that may include multiple smart environments that may include a smart system entity identified based on certain package information. As just one example such status information may be indicative of certain days of the week or other suitable current or future periods when a majority or any suitable threshold amount of environments of a group of environments including an environment associated with certain package information are not available to receive packages and such information may be leveraged by the facilitator entity to avoid scheduling deliveries to that entire group e.g. neighborhood of environments during those days. Any suitable grouping of environments or users or other suitable smart system entities of any suitable size and type may be used to generate group or macro level status information that may be made available to a facilitator entity for more efficiently handling business e.g. deliveries associated with that group. By grouping smart system entities and only sharing status data at a group level with third parties such as facilitator entities platform may protect the privacy and or security of certain environments by not sharing status information associated specifically with only a particular single environment e.g. to preserve at least some anonymity about the status of a particular smart environment .

By accessing certain status information of a smart environment or other suitable smart system entity of platform as may be detected or inferred by system a facilitator entity business may be configured to optimize package delivery. For example data indicative of when a particular location may and may not be able to receive a package delivery may be processed by any suitable distribution system to dictate when certain packages are dispatched for maximizing the likelihood of a successful physical delivery. In some embodiments when status information is obtained at step indicative of current availability of a target environment to receive a package e.g. availability for the next 4 hours facilitator may immediately deliver the package to environment yet in other embodiments when status information is obtained at step indicative of no current availability of a target environment to receive a package e.g. not available for at least the next 4 hours facilitator may delay the delivery of the package to environment e.g. until new status information may be obtained at a later use of step . As another example in some embodiments when status information is obtained at step indicative of an instruction to deliver a package to an initial target environment that is currently available to receive the package e.g. availability for the next 4 hours facilitator may immediately deliver the package to environment yet in other embodiments when status information is obtained at step indicative of an instruction to deliver a package to a new target environment rather than an initial target environment facilitator may repeat one or more of steps with respect to smart environment data associated with that new target environment . This may reduce overhead costs for a delivery entity e.g. reduce fuel prices and wasted man hours by limiting the number of failed delivery attempts and or may reduce insurance costs by limiting the exposure of perishable contents from unnecessary and degrading delivery effects.

One some or all of steps and may be at least partially or completely automated using one or more computer systems e.g. computer system and or computer system that may be leveraged by one or more of environment system facilitator entity business and the like for automatically associating a smart system entity of system with an ordered package and then sharing certain status information of that smart system entity with a deliverer or other facilitator entity at any suitable time for positively affecting the delivery of the package. A user of system may actively and manually define certain preferences or instructions to be shared with facilitator entity businesses for affecting the delivery of a particular ordered package currently associated with that user or for affecting the delivery of any package that may be associated with that user in the future. Alternatively or additionally the delivery of ordered packages associated with a user or environment may be based on inferences made by system and selectively shared with facilitator entity businesses e.g. without any active manual preferences made by the user but instead done transparently to a user . Therefore in some embodiments once an order is placed at step one some or all of steps may be carried out transparently to a system user e.g. to a recipient of package PL by platform based on any status information that may be determined automatically by system and or based on previously defined settings made by a system user.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

When delivery of an ordered package is actually attempted at a smart environment whether or not in accordance with process one or more smart devices of environment may be leveraged to at least partially automate the handling of the delivery attempt which may increase the efficiency of the delivery attempt and or to minimize any inconvenience to a user of environment that such a delivery attempt may cause. For example an entryway interface device such as a smart doorbell may be provided at a suitable entryway of a suitable portion of a smart environment for initiating or otherwise facilitating interaction between a delivery entity and smart environment that may efficiently handle a package delivery attempt e.g. to reduce delivery failures to increase user satisfaction and convenience and or to minimize risk of package theft .

According to some embodiments one or more sensing components or other suitable components of doorbell in combination with rules based inference engines or artificial intelligence or any other suitable processing components of platform provided at a central server such as system or otherwise may be used to detect when a package is attempted to be delivered to smart home environment and to take a variety of automated actions in response. For example sensing components may be operative to see the uniform of a delivery person approaching doorbell or the truck of the delivery person or the sensors can hear a delivery drone or hear a delivery truck in combination with footsteps of a delivery person approaching the door within a period after hearing the truck. Once the deliverer is within a predetermined distance from the door or entry point that may be associated with smart doorbell doorbell may be configured to ask the suspected deliverer e.g. using speaker if he or she is a delivery person to which that person can reply with an audible response or by indicating as such on user interface of doorbell . If the person is making a delivery doorbell can be configured to instruct the person to place the package in a suitable location proximate doorbell such that its scanner or any other suitable sensing component can scan the bar code or other type of identifying tag affixed to or associated with the package being delivered for detecting suitable package identification information.

According to embodiments a central server such as system can use the bar code or any suitable data detected directly from the deliverer or local package to obtain information about the package such as the sender recipient a description of the item therein whether signature is required etc. Based on this information rules based inferences engines or artificial intelligence or otherwise of platform may be operative to make one or more inferences regarding any action to take next. For example if occupants or more particularly if a specified recipient or recipients are in the home and the package is from a sender or contains an item that is of particular interest to the one or more occupants an announcement can be made in the home indicating the package is currently being dropped off and providing details about the package. On the other hand if the sender or item is not of particular interest to one of the occupants based on the occupants past responses to receiving such deliveries then no announcement may be made and the occupants can discover the package in due course. Similarly if no occupants are home but an inference is made that the package is of particular interest to one of the occupants a text message e mail telephone call or any other suitable contact attempt can be made to the one or more identified occupants indicating that the package is being delivered.

According to embodiments in the event a signature may be required for the package but none of the occupants are home or available to interface with the deliverer to provide such a signature an inference may be made not to disturb the occupants and doorbell can be configured to provide authorization to the deliverer to leave the package. For example doorbell may be operative to present an authorization code e.g. in plain text barcode or encrypted forms via any suitable output component of doorbell and may prompt the deliverer to use a deliverer device to record scan photograph or otherwise acquire the authorization code. Once the authorization code has been acquired by the deliverer doorbell can then instruct the deliverer regarding how to properly leave the package at environment such as at the front door around the back of the house in a discrete location etc.

Such detected package identification information of step may be unique package identification information that may be initially generated or at least partially defined by system of platform based on smart environment data of a smart system entity associated with the package prior to the delivery attempt e.g. as described above with respect to step of process where such smart unique package identification information may be detected by doorbell directly from deliverer DL or device of deliverer DL and or from package PL e.g. from label ID . Alternatively such detected package identification information of step may be conventional package identification information such as handwritten addressee information that may be manually entered on a shipping label ID of the package by a human or any other conventional delivery shipping label information. In some embodiments the delivery attempt may be for a package that does not include any shipping label ID at all. For example package PL may simply be a plate of cookies that a friendly neighbor has made and is attempting to deliver as deliverer DL to an occupant of environment . In such embodiments the information associated with the package that may be detected by doorbell may be captured image data of deliverer DL and or package PL e.g. as may be captured by a camera sensing component of doorbell spoken word data as may be provided by deliverer DL describing the delivery of package PL e.g. as may be captured by an audio sensing component of doorbell textual data as may be entered by deliverer DL describing the delivery of package PL e.g. as may be captured by a keyboard user interface input component of doorbell or any other suitable data that may be detected by doorbell via any suitable data path regarding deliverer DL and or package PL.

Doorbell may be configured to detect any suitable package identification information at step in any suitable way such as by instructing a detected deliverer DL to share such information e.g. by instructing deliverer DL to position an appropriate portion of package PL e.g. label ID in an appropriate location e.g. using any suitable output component of doorbell or other smart device such that a sensing component of doorbell may be able to access information therefrom or doorbell may be configured to automatically detect any suitable package identification information without requiring any specific activity on behalf of the deliverer DL e.g. doorbell may automatically detect suitable package identification information whenever a deliverer DL arrives with package PL within a particular distance of doorbell e.g. via NFC or RFID or Bluetooth technology . When deliverer DL or package PL is detected by doorbell either in response to a deliverer actively identifying itself or the package to doorbell or in response to doorbell automatically identifying the deliverer and or the package certain types of information may be accessed for analysis by environment e.g. time and date of attempted delivery identification of deliverer recipient content of package any delivery requirements etc. .

At step process may include analyzing the detected visitor information e.g. the detected package identification information of step e.g. in conjunction with any other suitable data available to platform such as settings of a current mode of environment or of a user . For example in response to detecting such package identification information at step with respect to deliverer DL and or package PL doorbell alone or in combination with other smart devices and or rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence provided locally at environment and or in conjunction with system and or any other component s of services platform e.g. business may be operative at step to access any suitable additional information based on that detected package identification information that may be useful e.g. identification of the sender intended recipient intended delivery location deliverer description of the contents of package PL whether signature is required to complete the delivery etc. and or any other suitable data available to platform e.g. setting information of a current mode of environment and or of a system user and then to analyze all such available information for determining whether or not to take one or more of a variety of automated actions based on that detected package identification information and or any additionally accessed information.

Certain package identification information may be directly determined by doorbell from any suitable initial data provided by deliverer DL and or package PL e.g. via data communication paths or while other package identification information may be accessed by doorbell from other sources based on such initial data e.g. from service and or business via service . For example a unique code that may be scanned by doorbell from label ID at package PL may be a unique identifier that doorbell may share with service such that service may access particular types of data associated with that identifier e.g. recipient content etc. from facilitator business . Alternatively such particular recipient and content data may be locally obtained by doorbell directly from package PL or deliverer DL e.g. via path from device which may or may not be accessing such data from server data of business via internet .

Current status information of a smart system entity associated with the package delivery which may be similar to the status information that may be obtained by a deliverer at step may be obtained and analyzed at step . Whether or not a facilitator entity may be configured to or otherwise allowed to obtain current status information of a smart system entity associated with package PL e.g. at step environment e.g. in conjunction with system may be configured to obtain and utilize such current status information at step in response to detecting certain package identification information at step where such status information may have been actively defined by a user of system or inferred or artificially generated by system for all deliveries generally or for a specific package delivery.

Any rules or instructions that may be obtained generated or otherwise determined by platform e.g. environment and or system at step based on the detected package identification information of step may be leveraged in any suitable way for positively affecting the delivery attempt of package PL. Once all available and accessible package data associated with the package delivery attempt has been obtained by environment e.g. package information obtained directly by doorbell from package PL and or deliverer DL and or any additional package information obtained via system based on any initial package information obtained by doorbell environment e.g. in combination with system may analyze that package data in combination with any suitable smart environment data or rules or settings or inferences or modes that may be associated with environment or any user or other smart system entity that may be associated with the package data and or with environment so as to determine one or more ways in which to efficiently handle the delivery attempt of package PL at doorbell . Such smart environment data that may be analyzed or processed in conjunction with any package data and or visitor deliverer data may include any suitable data associated with a smart environment user e.g. a user that has been identified as an intended recipient of the package or any other user associated with environment and or any suitable data associated with the smart environment itself such as the current and or anticipated future location of the smart environment user e.g. location within environment or outside of environment such as with respect to geo fences e.g. the user is currently driving towards environment and will arrive at environment within 2 minutes so as to receive the package the current and or anticipated future status or mode of a smart environment user e.g. sleeping busy on the telephone etc. the current and or anticipated future mode of the environment or user e.g. a do not disturb mode etc. and the like. Any suitable smart environment data described herein with respect to any smart device of environment or in conjunction with any other feature of platform e.g. system and or third parties and or extrinsic information and or processing paradigms may be analyzed or otherwise processed at step in conjunction with any package information that may be associated in any way with a package delivery attempt detected at step in order to initiate or otherwise prompt e.g. with doorbell and or other suitable components of environment and or platform any suitable action s for positively affecting the handling of a visitor e.g. the delivery attempt of package PL e.g. at one or more of steps of process . In some embodiments as soon as a deliverer DL is detected doorbell may be operative to indicate to deliverer DL that doorbell button is disabled e.g. to prevent deliverer DL from even bothering to try to contact an occupant through interaction with button . In some particular embodiments as described below in more detail doorbell may be operative to indicate that doorbell button is disabled in order to prevent any visitor from even bothering to try to contact an occupant through interaction with button at least until certain visitor detection and analysis has been completed by system .

At step process may include adjusting the functionality of at least one smart device of environment based on the analysis of step or even based solely on the detection of step . As just one example when a visitor is detected at step smart environment may be operative to turn on a light e.g. outdoor lighting to increase the safety of the visitor and or to increase the security of environment . As another example when a visitor is detected at step smart environment may be operative to emit any suitable sound e.g. a dog bark or a greeting from any suitable smart device e.g. from audio speaker of doorbell to increase the awareness of the visitor with respect to environment . As another example when a visitor is detected at step smart environment may be operative to lock any unlocked entry ways to structure e.g. by locking smart doorknob to increase the security of environment .

At step process may include communicating with a user associated with the smart environment based on the analysis of step . As just one example when the analysis of step determines that an intended recipient of package PL is a user that is currently located at environment and is in an active and available state e.g. not sleeping on the telephone or in any another do not disturb state as may be determined by smart environment smart environment may be operative to communicate information indicative of the current package delivery attempt to that user in any suitable way at step e.g. by audibly announcing any suitable information related to the delivery attempt of the particular package via an audio speaker of a smart device that may be located most proximal to the current location of that user within environment . As another example when the analysis of step determines that an intended recipient of package PL is a user that is not currently located at environment smart environment may be operative to communicate information indicative of the current package delivery attempt to that user via system in any suitable way at step e.g. by transmitting an electronic message to a personal device associated with that user .

In response to such communication by environment to a user the user may communicate in any suitable way a response back to environment e.g. via any suitable smart device e.g. hazard device or device to any suitable component of environment or system where such communication may be indicative of how the user would like environment to handle the detected delivery attempt. For example the user may instruct any suitable device of environment that the user does not wish to directly interface with the deliverer but that the delivery should be completed or carried out in some particular automated manner by environment and the deliverer. As another example the user may communicate to environment that the user will interface with the deliverer locally whereby the user may move towards entry point for physically interacting with deliverer DL to receive package PL. As yet another example the user may communicate to environment that the user will interface with the deliverer remotely via one or more devices of environment or system whereby environment may enable the user to communicate via a first smart device e.g. a hazard device of environment that may be proximate to user UL local to environment or a personal device of user UL or UR whether the user is local to or remote from environment and whereby environment may enable deliverer DL to communicate via a second smart device e.g. doorbell or other suitable device of environment such that the interconnectivity of those devices of environment may facilitate effective communication between the user and the deliverer. In certain embodiments by facilitating communication with an appropriate user via environment and system rather than requiring a deliverer to attempt to contact a user independently e.g. via a telephone number that may be associated with the ordered package e.g. at step process may reduce the burden of the deliverer while also retaining certain privacy of the user by utilizing system as an intermediary between the user and the deliverer such that certain types of contact information or ways of communicating with the user are guarded and protected by system and not necessarily shared with the deliverer while still enabling communication between the deliverer and the user via such ways of communication. That is whether or not a user is local to environment system may enable communication between the user and the deliverer without sharing the whereabouts or contact information of the user with the deliverer. A user may communicate with system via any suitable communication enabled by a smart device of environment when the user e.g. user UL is local to environment e.g. via gestures as may be described above with respect to smart device via touch input via a touch user interface audible spoken commands etc. and or via any suitable communication enabled by a system when the user is local to or remote from e.g. user UR environment e.g. via a user device .

At step process may include providing the visitor e.g. the deliverer with feedback based on at least one of the analysis of step and any communication of step . As just one example when the analysis of step determines that there are currently no occupants local to environment or otherwise in an active and available state and or when no user response is received for any communication attempt of step system may be operative to determine that smart environment may handle the attempted delivery without active user input and doorbell may provide the deliverer at step with instructions or other suitable feedback on how to proceed with the delivery. Alternatively when the analysis of step determines that there is a user local to environment that is in an active and available state and or when a user response is received for any communication attempt of step system may be operative to determine that a user of smart environment may at least partially handle the attempted delivery and doorbell may provide the deliverer at step with instructions or other suitable feedback on how to proceed with the delivery. The type of feedback that may be provided via doorbell to the deliverer at step may vary based on the analysis of step and or any communication of step . For example the feedback may include active communication from the user to the deliverer via doorbell e.g. audio and or visual or other suitable information may be conveyed to the deliverer by doorbell where such information may be generated and transmitted by or otherwise under the control of the user via another smart device that the user may directly interface with and that may be communicatively coupled to doorbell . Alternatively the feedback may include automated instructions generated by system for communication to the deliverer via doorbell e.g. a message that may communicate that a user is not currently able to actively receive the package right now please do the following to complete the delivery . . . etc. . Additionally or alternatively the feedback may include providing certain environment access to the deliverer such as by opening door by unlocking doorknob for a certain amount of time e.g. if deliverer DL is approved by system as an expected and or authorized deliverer e.g. through analysis of a label ID door may be unlocked such that deliverer DL may be enabled to enter structure for delivering package PL within structure . In some embodiments a deliverer device may be operative to be communicatively coupled with a smart device of environment and feedback may be communicated by such a smart device to deliverer device for receipt by the deliverer via an output of deliverer device e.g. device may be communicatively coupled with a communication component via path e.g. paired via BlueTooth or any other suitable protocol and such feedback may be communicated via path and then provided to the deliverer via any suitable output component of device .

At step process may include detecting an act of the visitor e.g. an act of the deliverer with the package based on the provided feedback of step e.g. an act performed by the visitor in response to the provided feedback . Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment may be configured to detect an action of deliverer DL and or package PL at step in response to system providing deliverer DL with feedback at step where that action may be any suitable action indicative of deliverer handling package PL in a particular way. As just one example in response to instructing deliverer DL to leave package PL at a particular location e.g. within a detection range of a sensing component of doorbell at step doorbell may detect such placement of package PL at step . As another example in response to requesting that deliverer DL deliver package PL to a neighboring environment e.g. to a next door neighbor of environment that may also be equipped with a smart doorbell at step doorbell of environment may detect a confirmatory response provided by deliverer DL that the request will be followed e.g. directly from deliverer DL at a user interface component of doorbell or from deliverer device via path at a communications component of doorbell or a confirmatory communication by a smart device of the neighboring environment that may confirm receipt of the package . Any suitable action of deliverer DL and or of package PL may be detected or otherwise received by any suitable component of environment and or of system at step where such detection may enable system to update system information about the status of the attempted delivery e.g. successfully delivered at front door successfully delivered to neighbor ABC to be re delivered at time XYZ etc. . Alternatively or additionally a deliverer DL may communicate with system at step via any suitable communication enabled by a smart device of environment accessible by deliverer DL e.g. via gestures at doorbell as may be described above with respect to smart device via touch input via a touch user interface audible spoken commands etc. and or via any suitable communication enabled by system and deliverer device .

At step process may include communicating with at least one of the user and the visitor e.g. the deliver based on the detected act of step . Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment may be configured to confirm detection of an action of deliverer DL and or package PL with deliverer DL e.g. by communicating any suitable confirmation information directly to deliverer DL or to delivery device via doorbell or to delivery business via system of platform . Alternatively or additionally doorbell and or any other component of environment and or system may be configured to confirm detection of an action of deliverer DL and or package PL with a user of environment e.g. by communicating any suitable confirmation information to the user via any suitable smart device or personal device of the user similarly to any communication of step . This may enable deliverer DL and or the user to remain updated with respect to the current status of the attempted delivery as determined by environment of system e.g. successfully delivered at front door successfully delivered to neighbor ABC to be re delivered at time XYZ etc. . Such communication of step may enable deliverer DL to know whether or not any action performed at step was successfully detected by system thereby removing any doubt about the status of the delivery. This may also create an electronic receipt or trail of the attempted delivery not only for the particular deliverer DL and or a user of environment but also any other interested party such as a management system of a delivery entity or fulfillment entity business . By such confirmation of delivery status being electronically or otherwise generated by system rather than by delivery entity business the confirmation may be considered even more reliable or leveraged in combination with any similar confirmation data that may be generated by delivery business e.g. based on manual entry into delivery device by deliverer DL to ensure accurate delivery status is available to platform . By providing confirmation data indicative of a detected delivery action to deliverer DL e.g. via doorbell and or to delivery entity business e.g. via an API of platform system may serve as a secondary or impartial source of information regarding the delivery of packages carried out by delivery entity business . This may increase the efficiency and or effectiveness of delivery entity business and or may lower overhead costs e.g. insurance costs of delivery entity business as system may provide a new source of accurate and real time electronic data that may be made available to delivery entity business for use in managing its package delivery tasks while also not being as dependent on delivery data provided by its own deliverers DL. Moreover by providing confirmation data indicative of a detected delivery action to a user of environment e.g. via any suitable system user communication capability of platform a user may be able to have access to an up to date status of a package delivery while also being enabled to virtually communicate with a deliverer during a delivery attempt in a manner that is convenient and secure for the user and the deliverer.

One or more of steps of process may be repeated for a particular delivery attempt of a particular package or for any other visitor handling. For example in response to analysis at step of any package delivery information detected at step a user may communicate with the smart environment at step and that user communication may be shared with deliverer DL at step in response to which an action of deliverer DL may be detected by the smart environment at step and that detected action may be communicated back to the user at step in response to which the user may once again communicate with the smart environment at step based on that communicated detected action thereby repeating at least part of process . Therefore process may support a virtual conversation between deliverer DL and a user or service as an automated agent of the user.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

In some embodiments communication of certain package information to a user at step may equip the user with the ability to decide how the user may want the delivery attempt to be handled. For example the user may decide to go meet the deliverer at door for personally receiving the package or the user may remotely instruct the deliverer to leave the package at a certain location via a communication path supported by environment e.g. via doorbell and any other suitable device such that the user may actively determine at least a portion of the feedback that may be provided to the deliverer at step . Alternatively communication of certain package information to a user at step may not be successfully received by a user in time for the user to effectively respond for immediate use by system or such communication may not even be attempted e.g. if the user is known by system to be on vacation or otherwise or otherwise in a do not disturb mode where system may determine not to contact the user . In such embodiments system may be configured to determine and generate the feedback provided to the deliverer at step without any active input from the user. Such feedback may instead be automatically determined based on inferences or rules of platform e.g. system and or any restrictions that may be applicable to the particular delivery e.g. user signature required . For example feedback provided at step may include an instruction for deliverer DL to simply leave package PL at door or to deliver package PL to a neighbor or to re attempt the delivery at another time that may be specified e.g. a time that may be determined by system as when an appropriate system user is expected to be available at environment for receiving a delivery . However if a signature or any other suitable type of acknowledgment of receipt of the package is required in order to complete delivery e.g. as may be detected through the package information detected and analyzed at steps and feedback provided at step by doorbell may include certain data that may satisfy that receipt acknowledgment requirement. For example system may have access to any suitable trusted security information that may also be known by or validated by delivery business whereby use of such information by system within feedback provided to deliverer DL at step may be received and confirmed by delivery business as an acceptable form of waiver of responsibility or acknowledgment such that deliverer DL may be able to leave package PL at environment without actively receiving a signature of a user. For example doorbell may present an authorization code e.g. in plain text as any suitable code or encrypted forms on a user interface e.g. on a display as at least a portion of feedback at step and may prompt deliverer DL to use deliverer device to record scan photograph or otherwise acquire the authorization code for authentication and acceptance e.g. as a detectable act at step . Once the authorization code has been acquired and accepted by deliverer DL doorbell may be operative to then instruct deliverer DL with respect to where to leave package PL.

Communication between deliverer DL and a system user of system may include various types of conversation types. For example in some embodiments deliverer DL may specifically dictate when and how package PL will be delivered. As just one such example in response to system providing feedback to deliverer DL at step indicative of the fact that a user of environment is not available to actively communicate with deliverer DL for facilitating completion of the delivery deliverer DL may communicate information to system e.g. via doorbell at step that may be indicative of the fact that deliverer DL is going to return package PL to a suitable pick up location e.g. distribution center DC of business and that package PL will be available at that location for pick up by the user at a certain time. In response to such a communication from deliverer DL system may confirm receipt of that information to deliverer DL and or may share such information with a user at step . Such a situation may enable the user to be informed of the pick up status of the package PL in real time or as soon as the user is able to receive such a communication from system thereby allowing the user to conveniently swing by that pick up location to retrieve package PL on the user s way home to environment . As opposed to conventional practice where a deliverer leaves a paper notice on a user s front door indicating that the user missed the delivery attempt and that the user must bring that paper notice to the pick up center to retrieve the package system may immediately and automatically share such notification information with a user electronically e.g. via e mail or text messaging or any other suitable system communication with the user such that the user need not waste time by driving home to receive a paper notice only to turn right around and drive to the pick up location to retrieve the package . Such interaction between deliverer DL and system e.g. via doorbell and such interaction between system and a system user may not only increase the convenience for the user but may also increase the efficiency of deliverer DL e.g. by saving paper notices and removing doubt as to whether the notice will be received by the user . Moreover the automated communication of such notice information may be provided to a system user without requiring or even allowing direct communication between deliverer DL and the user thereby enabling system to remain a custodian of certain contact information and whereabouts information of the user.

As another example communication between deliverer DL and a system user of system may include two way communication. As mentioned a real time virtual two way conversation between a user and a deliverer DL at doorbell may be enabled by system . For example a user may communicate a request to system at step e.g. I am unable to come to the door to sign for the package what are my options that may then be provided by system to deliverer DL at step e.g. relayed as audio data from an audio sensing device at the user to audio output data from doorbell in response to which deliverer DL may provide a response with one or more options for the user e.g. you can sign for the package at a designated pick up location after 5 pm today or a neighbor can sign for the package now on your behalf that may be detected by system e.g. doorbell at step and relayed to the user at step after which the user may again communicate to deliverer DL with his decision.

Alternatively a delayed response virtual conversation between a user and a deliverer DL may be enabled by system . For example system may communicate to deliverer DL e.g. via doorbell at step that a user of environment is not available to actively communicate with deliverer DL for facilitating completion of the delivery. In response to such feedback deliverer DL may communicate information to system e.g. via doorbell at step that may be indicative of the fact that deliverer DL will re attempt to deliver package PL at environment tomorrow. In response to detection of such a communication from deliverer DL system may confirm receipt of that information to deliverer DL and may share such information with a user at step e.g. automatically or immediately after such detection . However at some later time that same day e.g. after deliverer DL and package PL have left environment a system user may actually digest that information as shared with it by system . In response thereto as opposed to allowing deliverer DL to re attempt delivery of package PL at environment the following day as currently planned the user may wish to retrieve package PL from delivery business that evening at dispatch center DC or the user may wish for deliverer DL to deliver package PL to the user s office rather than to environment or any other suitable change to the currently planned delivery strategy. Therefore system may be configured to enable the user to share such a desire with delivery business for systematically altering the delivery strategy. For example system may be operative to provide an intuitive application or user interface e.g. on the user s device or via any smart device of environment that may enable a user to select from any available options for altering the delivery strategy where such options may be known or otherwise determined by system based on the package information detected at steps and or based on any other suitable information that may be made available to system e.g. from delivery business via an API or otherwise . A user selected option may then be automatically communicated from system to delivery business for updating the planned delivery strategy of package PL thereby increasing the efficiency and or convenience of the delivery process.

Various types of feedback may be provided to deliverer DL by system e.g. via doorbell at step and responsive thereto deliverer DL may commit various types of acts that may be detected by system e.g. via doorbell at step for advancing the attempted delivery of package PL. In some embodiments platform e.g. environment and or system may be configured to enable secure drop off of package PL by deliverer DL at environment when a system user is unable to physically receive package PL from deliverer DL at environment e.g. when no user is at environment or when a user is at environment but currently unavailable for active package receipt e.g. when the user is sleeping or otherwise pre occupied or otherwise unfit to meet deliverer DL . Certain steps may be taken by system and or certain features of environment may be enabled so as to increase the security and reliability of such an unsupervised drop off otherwise such a drop off may not be approved by delivery business e.g. such an act may not meet insurance standards of business or may not be of interest to a user e.g. such an act may not meet the security interests of the user . For example platform e.g. system in conjunction with environment may be configured to enable a secure drop off of a package confirm such a drop off secure the package after such a drop off remind a user of the secured package enable authorized recovery of the secured package and confirm such authorized recovery for completing the delivery process.

In some embodiments an unsupervised drop off may be enabled when environment is configured with an ability to receive and retain package PL in a secure location that may be trusted by both deliverer DL and a system user. For example a certain secure area of environment may be temporarily made accessibly by system to deliverer DL e.g. by feedback at step such that deliverer DL may deposit package PL within that secure area e.g. at step for later retrieval by a trusted system user e.g. the intended recipient . Any suitable secure area may be provided by environment for this purpose. As one example structure may include a lobby not shown just beyond entry point door that itself may be separated by the remainder of structure by another locked door and system may be configured to temporarily unlock door e.g. via smart doorknob for granting deliverer DL temporary access to that lobby for depositing package PL therein. Such a lobby may be a shared lobby amongst multiple distinct tenants e.g. a shared lobby of a multi residence apartment building . In such embodiments the lobby may include an area that may otherwise be selectively accessible to mailmen e.g. via a shared key that Postal Service workers often times are equipped with in urban areas where large apartment buildings are common . Such temporary access as may be granted by system in response to suitable detection and analysis e.g. at steps and may overcome the need for certain deliverers to carry around one or more master keys for certain neighborhoods or apartment buildings which may also reduce security concerns for the building while increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of deliverers to securely deposit packages in areas of an environment that have at least a certain amount of security provided to it e.g. due to a front door of a lobby that is generally accessible only by trusted occupants of the building and not by any visitor attempting to gain access to the building . As another example a smart safe e.g. a smart appliance may be provided by environment adjacent doorbell external to structure e.g. smart appliance the interior of which may be selectively and temporarily made accessible to deliverer DL e.g. via any suitable control signals of system or environment e.g. via doorbell for enabling placement of package PL therein. Any such secure area e.g. a lobby a safe etc. of environment that may be made temporarily accessible to deliverer DL by system e.g. automatically through system processing and control may be securely monitored by platform during such temporary access in order to ensure that deliverer DL positions package PL in that area and or to ensure that nothing is removed from that area during the period of that temporary access. One or more sensing components of doorbell or of any other smart device of environment may be configured to at least partially carry out such monitoring e.g. a sensing component within the secure area or external to the secure area but that may sense activity within the secure area and or at the temporarily accessible opening to the secure area may be activated and or enhanced e.g. by platform during such temporary accessibility for securely monitoring the activity of deliverer DL during that accessibility . Additionally or alternatively one or more output components of doorbell or of any other smart device of environment may be configured to at least partially indicate to deliverer DL where and how to deposit the package securely.

System may require that a certain level of trust be achieved between platform e.g. environment and or system and deliverer DL before enabling such temporary access to such a secure area of environment . For example certain package delivery data may be retrieved and analyzed at steps and prior to enabling such an unsupervised drop off such as specific identification data of the particular deliverer DL and or of the particular package PL at doorbell that system may be able to confirm or cross check with a trusted delivery business e.g. via an API of platform between system and business . Therefore system may confirm the identity of deliverer DL and or package PL based not only on identification data that may be provided to system locally at environment e.g. via doorbell but also on data that may be provided to system from business remotely from environment e.g. via an API such that a visitor may not attempt to gain access to a secure area of environment by fraudulently purporting to be a deliverer associated with a trusted delivery entity business . Such confirmation by cross referencing locally obtained deliverer package identification data with known or expected whereabouts status data for a particular deliverer package may be utilized by system for any suitable situation at steps in order to improve the security of an attempted package delivery.

Once a suitable level of trust is determined by system for deliverer DL and or package PL such that system may be configured to enable an unsupervised drop off system may be operative to instruct deliverer DL e.g. via doorbell how to carry out such an unsupervised drop off. For example doorbell may be configured to audibly instruct deliverer DL as to where to find a secure drop off area that may be made temporarily accessible to the deliverer for securing package PL e.g. via audio speaker that may provide any suitable audio output such as a verbal instruction to open the safe just to the right of the front door place the package therein and then close the safe . Alternatively or additionally doorbell may be configured to visually instruct deliverer DL as to where to find a secure drop off area that may be made temporarily accessible to the deliverer for securing package PL e.g. via user interface and or projector display . During such instructing system may also control the secure area for enabling deliverer DL to have access thereto e.g. by unlocking a door to a safe .

Once deliverer DL is instructed how where to access a secure area and such a secure area is made temporarily accessible to deliverer DL e.g. at step system may be configured to securely monitor that secure area during the period when the secure area is made accessible e.g. by leveraging any suitable monitor sensing components of doorbell and or any suitable sensing components of the secure area itself or otherwise e.g. any cameras that may be provided by a smart safe appliance etc. . Such monitoring may be leveraged not only to confirm that a particular package PL is secured within the secure area but also to confirm that nothing is removed from the secure area. For example one or more sensors of environment may be configured to detect label ID or any other suitable identifier of package PL intermittently and or continuously during the process of placing package PL within the secure area such that system may detect and confirm that package PL has been positioned with the secure area e.g. steps and . Additionally or alternatively one or more sensors of environment may be configured to monitor the access point of such a secure area continuously during the process of placing package PL within the secure area such that system may confirm that nothing is removed from the secure area. Such confirmation of proper drop off of package PL may be shared with delivery entity business by system e.g. via API and or with deliverer DL e.g. via doorbell and or with a system user e.g. via a user device or any suitable smart device . Once the positioning of package PL has been confirmed within the secure area system may be configured to terminate the accessibility to the secure area e.g. by locking the door to the safe .

If no physically distinct secure area e.g. safe or lobby is available to environment system may enable proper drop off of package PL by designating a certain area of environment as an area at which package PL may be left and adequately securely monitored by system e.g. doorbell . For example at step rather than instructing deliverer DL towards a safe or lobby that may be temporarily made accessible to deliverer DL for depositing package PL system may leverage doorbell or any other suitable smart device of environment to instruct deliverer DL towards an open area at which deliverer DL may deposit package PL. As shown in one or more components of doorbell e.g. projector may be operative to generate and display to deliverer DL a suitable deposit area AL at which package PL may be dropped off e.g. light from projector may shine to identify area AL on any suitable surface or instructions provided on a display user interface or audible instructions via audio speaker may otherwise enable deliverer DL to identify the location of area AL . Area AL may be on a portion of a stoop or sidewalk or any other suitable portion of environment adjacent door or otherwise easily accessible to deliverer DL that may be securely monitored by environment e.g. by one or more sensing components of doorbell . For example area AL may be within a sensing range of an NFC or RFID or camera or any other suitable sensing component of doorbell such that when package PL may be positioned within area AL by deliverer DL package PL may be securely monitored by one or more smart devices of environment which may ensure secure drop off of package PL. As another example area AL may not be proximate doorbell but may be an area that may be monitored by another smart device of environment e.g. a smart device that may be coupled to outdoor lighting which may be around a corner of structure from front door such that other visitors to front door may not obviously notice package PL that has been deposited by deliverer DL for secure monitoring by environment . As with the deposit of package PL within any other suitable secure area e.g. a safe or lobby system may be configured to monitor and confirm the adequate deposit of package PL at area AL with deliverer DL and or delivery entity business for furthering the delivery attempt e.g. such that deliverer DL may confidently leave package PL at environment . Any suitable smart device of environment may provide and or monitor such an area AL or any other secure area for use in unsupervised drop off and monitoring of a package PL.

Alternatively or additionally system may enable proper drop off of package PL by providing an accessory device that may be coupled to package PL for enabling secure monitoring of package PL by system e.g. doorbell . For example at step rather than instructing deliverer DL towards a safe or lobby that may be temporarily made accessible to deliverer DL for depositing package PL system may leverage doorbell or any other suitable smart device of environment to instruct deliverer DL to couple an accessory component e.g. of doorbell of to package PL and then to leave package PL with accessory component near doorbell for secure monitoring. As shown in accessory component of doorbell may be coupled to package PL e.g. fastened adhered affixed snapped tied to rest on or otherwise attached where accessory component may be operative to communicate with or be detected by any other component s of doorbell e.g. communications component e.g. Bluetooth and or sensor component or any other suitable components of environment or platform when coupled to package PL such that platform may monitor the location and or any other suitable characteristic s of package PL e.g. based on the monitored location and or any other suitable characteristic s of accessory component . For example accessory component may be configured to include any suitable sensing components e.g. motion sensing components or any other suitable sensing components as described above with respect to sensing components that may detect movement or any other suitable characteristic of accessory component and thus package PL when coupled thereto and such sensed characteristics may be communicated to or otherwise detected by any other component s of doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment and thus system . Alternatively or additionally doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment may be operative to detect the location of accessory component such that if package PL is moved after deliverer DL leaves package PL e.g. by an animal or wind or otherwise doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment may be operative to track such movement for use in finding package PL for recovery. Such a physical coupling of package PL to a component of environment e.g. accessory of doorbell may increase the ability and or effectiveness of system to securely monitor a package during and after an unsupervised drop off Accessory component may be reusable anytime a new package is to be deposited for secure monitoring by doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment . As just one example accessory component may be an RFID tag that may be communicatively coupled or otherwise known by another component of doorbell . Any movement of package PL e.g. as may be detected through leveraging accessory component at all or above a certain threshold may trigger one or more additional sensing components of doorbell or otherwise of environment to monitor package PL component so as to heighten the secure monitoring of package PL. Accessory component may be operative to wirelessly communicate with other components of doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment and or may communicate via a wire that may extend between accessory component and other components of doorbell . If wire is cut or otherwise disrupted additional heightened security may be enacted by system to track package PL. In some embodiments a holder of doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment may be selectively opened and closed e.g. through electronic control of system for selectively enabling accessory component to be removed from the remainder of doorbell and or any other suitable smart device of environment for attachment to package PL.

Once package PL has been disposed in a secure area of environment or otherwise disposed for secure monitoring e.g. using accessory component by deliverer DL system may continue to intermittently or continuously monitor package PL and or the secure area e.g. area AL to maintain the security of the dropped off package. As one example environment may be configured to continuously or intermittently monitor the position of dropped off package PL such as by detecting status data from accessory component coupled to package PL or by sensing package PL within area AL or by confirming that a secure area e.g. a lobby or safe has remained inaccessible since disposal of package PL therein. After any suitable monitoring period of any suitable length during which the security of package PL has been confirmed by environment system may be configured to communicate such security status with any suitable entity such as delivery entity business and or any suitable user of environment e.g. an intended recipient of package PL . However if at any time after secure disposal of package PL by deliverer DL environment detects any type of change in the status of package PL or of a secure area or component with which environment may be securing package PL any suitable sensing functionality of environment may be activated or enhanced and or any suitable alarm or notification functionality may be activated. For example if any movement of package PL is detected by environment e.g. by a motion sensing component of doorbell additional sensing components of environment e.g. a camera sensor of doorbell and or other helpful components of environment e.g. outdoor lighting may be activated to sense additional information about the status of package PL and or its surroundings e.g. whether an animal or other entity may be moving package PL . Alternatively or additionally in such instances an alarm may be activated and communicated within structure e.g. if any occupancy currently exists within structure and or outside of environment e.g. at doorbell and or to any suitable law enforcement entities or delivery entity business or users of environment for aid in securing package PL . When a package PL has been deposited by deliverer DL for secure monitoring by environment any suitable events may be monitored for enhancing the protection of package DL including for example detecting when any unknown user or visitor may come within a certain distance of a secure area at which package PL has been deposited. For example doorbell or any other suitable portion of smart environment that may be able to monitor package PL may be equipped with walkup identification technology e.g. face recognition RFID ultrasonic sensors that may fingerprint or create or otherwise have access to a signature for known users of environment such that in operation when a person who does not live in the home or is otherwise not registered with the smart home or whose fingerprint or signature is not recognized by the smart home walks up to package PL environment may provide an alarm and or may increase the protection of package PL by activating a new form of package monitoring securing e.g. a more sensitive movement sensor with respect to package PL .

As mentioned when a package PL has been left by a deliverer DL at environment system may be configured to communicate information indicative of that package deposit to any suitable entity e.g. a system user of environment and or delivery entity business and the like . Additionally or alternatively system may be configured to send any suitable reminders at any suitable moment to a system user or delivery entity or other suitable entity that may keep such an entity mindful of the status of a package that has been left at environment but that has not yet been claimed by a system user. Such reminders may be achieved via any suitable communication technique such as e mail telephone text message alert via any suitable smart device e.g. via a user interface of a hazard device within structure or via a user interface of doorbell that may be easily identified by a user of environment upon waking up within structure or arriving to door of structure . As just one example when a known system user of environment arrives at structure e.g. at door doorbell may be operative to detect that arrival and responsive thereto communicate to that user that package PL has been recently left by deliverer DL for user retrieval e.g. an audible or textual message via an output component of doorbell that may state welcome home user X a package PL was delivered by delivered by deliverer DL at time Y and is currently secured at location Z awaiting your retrieval . Alternatively a simple blinking light may be provided by doorbell e.g. projector when a package is awaiting user retrieval.

When a previously deposited package PL is awaiting user retrieval e.g. from a secure area being monitored by environment environment may be configured in various suitable ways for enabling secure retrieval of the package. In some embodiments certain particular users may be designated by system as authorized to retrieve a securely monitored package PL. For example an appropriately credentialed system user associated with environment generally and or package PL specifically may be enabled by system to identify one or more particular people that environment may allow to retrieve package PL. In such circumstances facial detection or other suitable fingerprint or signature detection capabilities of a smart device of environment may be leveraged to detect a particular user that system may be configured to determine has been authorized e.g. automatically or by rules based inferencing techniques or by specific user designation etc. to securely retrieve package PL. Alternatively certain entities may be provided with a particular security PIN or other suitable code that may be received by environment e.g. by doorbell and confirmed by system as a trusted pass for securely retrieving package PL. For example if an intended recipient of package PL is a known system user of environment and that user receives a communication e.g. at step that deliverer DL has successfully performed a secure unsupervised drop off of package PL in a secure area of environment that user may interface with system e.g. via personal device in any suitable way for enabling another entity e.g. a neighbor to retrieve that package PL on his or her behalf e.g. that communication received by the user may include a code generated by platform whereby the user may share that code with any entity for use by that entity at environment for re enabling accessibility to the secure area of the smart environment for collecting the disposed package . As one example the user may create a security clearance within system e.g. by sharing the identity of that entity with system such that when the entity is detected at environment e.g. at doorbell environment may be configured to share the location of the secured package PL with the entity and to at least temporarily grant access to that secured area for package retrieval. As another example the user may instruct system to generate a security code that may enable access to the securely monitored package and the user may then share that security code with the entity to retrieve the package e.g. by e mailing or otherwise communicating that code to the entity e.g. via communication techniques of system . As another example system may be operative to define a particular period of time during which the securely monitored package may be accessible for retrieval by any entity. For example a system user may interface with system e.g. via personal device in any suitable way for defining a future time period e.g. between 5 00 and 5 15 pm this afternoon during which system may be operative to alter certain security monitoring techniques that may enable any entity to effectively retrieve the package PL. As just one example although camera monitoring of the secure area at which package PL has been deposited may continue through the defined time period an alarm or other security features may be disabled during that time such that an entity may successfully retrieve the package without triggering any unnecessary enhanced security. Alternatively or additionally automatic deduction may be utilized by system for enabling environment to safely allow retrieval of a monitored package PL when certain situations arise. For example when a known system user is detected by environment within a threshold distance of package PL and then package PL is concurrently moved from the secure area then system may not sound any alarms but may simply allow the package to be retrieved and may communicate confirmation of such retrieval along with any other suitable information e.g. time and date of the retrieval identity of the detected system user associated with that retrieval etc. to any suitable entity e.g. to the recipient user associated with package PL deliverer entity business etc. via any suitable communication capability of system . As another example even if no entity is specifically detected when the package is retrieved if door is legitimately opened within a certain duration of time prior to or after such retrieval then no alarm may be generated and the retrieval may be communicated by system to any appropriate target.

When a package PL is retrieved at environment after being securely monitored system may be configured to obtain any suitable information in order to confirm user receipt of the package and or to otherwise appropriately complete the delivery process of that package. For example depending on any delivery requirements for a particular package as may be determined by system during data detection and or analysis of steps various data may be obtained by system during retrieval of package PL. In some embodiments when package retrieval is enabled any suitable signature or confirmation of receipt action may be collected or otherwise detected by system from the retrieving entity e.g. the intended recipient system user or a neighbor granted retrieval rights as described above . For example environment may instruct the retrieving entity to communicate its identity to environment e.g. via a sensing component or user interface of doorbell or otherwise environment may indicate that an alarm will be sound. As another example environment may require that a retrieving entity present the retrieved package at a suitable smart device of environment or to any other suitable component of system within a suitable period of time after retrieval otherwise environment may indicate that an alarm will be sound. In such embodiments the retrieving entity may position the retrieved package PL in functional view of a sensing component of a smart device of system e.g. position label ID within a sensing area of a sensing component of doorbell or within a sensing area of a sensing component of any other smart device other than doorbell e.g. a hazard device of structure or a personal device or smart environment device of the retrieving entity which may be a user of a neighboring environment that is not environment but that is also a part of system such that system may confirm that package PL has been retrieved at a certain time and or by a certain entity that may be in communication with system . Such sensed information by system may be leveraged by system to achieve a certain amount of trust with respect to the security of the retrieved package such that a confirmation communication may be sent e.g. at an iteration of step to one or more suitable parties e.g. an intended recipient system user and or delivery entity business to confirm successful retrieval of package PL from a securely monitored area of environment thereby enabling closure of that delivery. Such data may be invaluable to a delivery entity that may otherwise never determine if when a package left at a particular location was actually received by a trusted entity.

One some or all of the various sub processes described above with respect to enabling a secure delivery of a package by a deliverer to a system user of environment may provide for enhanced security data to be collected and shared throughout the delivery. For example at any one or more of step e.g. where information related to a package delivery attempt may be detected by environment step e.g. where additional system information related to the delivery may be acquired and analyzed step e.g. where any suitable data may be communicated between system and any suitable system user to further an attempted package delivery step e.g. where any suitable feedback or instructions may be communicated by system to a deliverer of the package or to a potential retriever of the package or any other suitable visitor e.g. at doorbell step e.g. where any suitable action or characteristic of the package or of a deliverer or of any other suitable visitor may be detected during an attempted package delivery and or step e.g. where any suitable confirmation of a detected action may be communicated by system to an entity at environment e.g. at doorbell or to any other suitable entity e.g. a system user and or a delivery entity business during an attempted package delivery of process any suitable data may be collected stored processed or otherwise analyzed by platform e.g. by environment and or system and shared with any suitable entity for enhancing the security and or convenience of an attempted package delivery.

Time stamps specific identification of packages and or visitors e.g. deliverers and retrievers specific actions of packages and or of visitors e.g. deliverers and or of retrievers and the like may be sensed collected stored and shared by environment and or system with any suitable entities such as system users other smart environments trusted third party entities e.g. businesses and any other suitable data targets. Such data collection and sharing may reduce any insurance liability previously held by a delivery entity business that may otherwise have had to attempt delivery of a package multiple times due to an environment being unable to securely receive the package during an initial attempt and or have left a package at an environment in an insecure fashion e.g. on a front stoop of a user without any smart devices of the environment being operative to securely monitor the package until it was appropriately retrieved etc. . As another example such data collection and sharing may enable better tracking of the handling of a package e.g. in order to determine when during the delivery process the package may have been ruined e.g. for fragile package contents where one or more sensors of environment may for example continuously or intermittently monitor and share movement data of a package as the package is deposited at environment by deliverer DL as the package is secured prior to retrieval and or as the package is retrieved. This also may enable accurate location and time tracking of deliverer DL and package PL by detecting and logging data at environment e.g. by enabling deliverer DL to check in to environment and or check out from environment . Moreover rather than relying on delivery information generated and reported by deliverer DL e.g. via data entered into delivery device by deliverer DL during an attempted delivery system may generate and report its own data that may be compared to and or relied on by delivery entity business instead of any data generated by deliverer DL as system data e.g. as may be generated by doorbell may be trustworthy as an impartial data source e.g. as compared to a deliverer who may enter incorrect data to inflate his efficiency and or hide his inefficiencies .

By enabling communication between system and delivery entity business status information about deliverer DL known to delivery entity business may be shared with system whereby system may leverage a known status of environment e.g. modes current future occupancy data current functionality of certain smart devices etc. in combination with the shared status information about deliverer DL to enhance the handling of a potential delivery at environment by deliverer DL. As one example delivery entity business may communicate to system an estimated time of arrival for deliverer DL at environment such that system may communicate with smart environment in order to accommodate the arrival of deliverer DL e.g. by turning on outdoor lighting to enable safe and easy access to door by deliverer DL and or by turning off any sprinkler system smart device not shown that may otherwise impair the deliverer s ability to easily bring package PL to door e.g. to prevent package PL from getting wet . Additionally or alternatively as another example delivery entity business may communicate to system information identifying the deliverer DL in order to improve the ability of environment to detect the expected deliverer e.g. by enhancing certain sensing functionality of one or more smart devices e.g. pre loading a picture of the expected deliverer to increase efficiency of facial detection or turning on additional sensors that may specifically attempt to detect characteristics of the expected visitor etc. . Additionally or alternatively as another example delivery entity business may communicate to system information identifying the contents of package PL e.g. contents requiring a cold environment to stay fresh in order to improve the ability of environment to appropriately receive the expected package e.g. by turning on a cooling feature of a secure area e.g. an air conditioner within the safe area of safe appliance . Such communication may also enhance convenience of the delivery process for a recipient user or any other suitable user of environment as system may be operative to continuously keep that user up to date with respect to the delivery status and security of package PL while enabling that user control over how that package may be delivered deposited and or retrieved. For example in response to system receiving status information from delivery entity business about an upcoming planned delivery to environment system may be operative to analyze that status information e.g. in combination with any current modes or other information associated with environment and may then automatically communicate certain information to a system user about that planned delivery e.g. via any suitable smart device or personal user device such that the system user may update any suitable mode settings or define a new mode or otherwise provide instructions to system for handling the planned delivery once the deliverer and or package are physically detected at environment . Additionally or alternatively by enabling communication between system and delivery entity business status information about environment and or system users associated therewith known to system may be shared with delivery entity business and or deliverer DL. As mentioned above e.g. with respect to a status of environment indicative that environment is in a do not disturb mode for times X Y and Z as may be shared by system with delivery entity business e.g. after status information about deliverer DL known to delivery entity business may be shared with system may enable delivery entity business to more efficiently schedule attempted deliveries to environment e.g. to adjust a planned and or current delivery attempt . As another example a status of environment indicative of the ability of smart environment to securely monitor a package during an unsupervised drop off as may be shared by system with delivery entity business e.g. after status information about deliverer DL known to delivery entity business may be shared with system may enable delivery entity business to more confidently deliver a package to environment even if a do not disturb status of environment may not be known.

Smart doorbell of environment may be configured to include any suitable combination of any of the components described above so as to appropriately interact with other smart devices of environment and services platform and any suitable user thereof such as users registered with or associated with environment e.g. owners occupants etc. and or users visiting environment e.g. package deliverers friends solicitors strangers and would be thieves . In addition to or as an alternative to increasing the convenience and efficiency of package delivery increasing the traceability of package delivery and or enabling secure package delivery such a smart doorbell may be a visitor interface or entryway interface device that may be operative to detect and control or otherwise handle a person s approach to or departure from a location e.g. an outer door of structure of environment announce such an approach or departure enhance conventional doorbell functionality for both residents and visitors control settings on a security system detect environmental data and other useful data for environment and system and the like. Therefore doorbell on behalf of smart environment and system and users associated therewith may act as a security custodian to environment with respect to any visitors that may approach environment where the behavior of such custodial action may be based on any suitable information of system including any suitable modes or settings of any suitable portion or entirety of smart environment and or of a user of such a smart environment.

Any suitable type of mode such as a do not disturb mode may be set for a particular system user U for a particular environment and or for at least a particular portion of a particular environment indefinitely or for any suitable length of time that may start at a current or future moment. Such a mode may be determined based on any suitable information generated by or inferred from any suitable data of environment and or user U available to platform . As just one particular example as mentioned above system may use tracking information to make inferences regarding the current and or future occupancy of home environment and or the current and or future location of a user U e.g. at environment like user UL of and Husband of or away from environment like user UR of and Wife of where such inferences may be used to define a current or future mode of environment and or of a user U. As another example platform may leverage sensed data from one or more sensors of one or more smart devices of environment to at least partially define a particular current or future mode for environment e.g. programs algorithms may assess detected sounds vibrations and movements to determine whether the home occupants are home or away sleeping or awake etc. . Alternatively or additionally a user U may actively select or otherwise at least partially define a particular current or future mode for environment or a system user by manually communicating mode selection data to system e.g. via direct user interaction with a user device and or any suitable smart device of system accessible by the user . Various determinations of various factors may combine to enable a particular mode for a particular system user and or a particular system environment or specific portion thereof e.g. no occupancy within environment lack of user movement within a darkened bedroom etc. and various settings may be enabled or made available during that enabled mode e.g. turn on lights within environment at a certain time of day to mimic occupancy prevent disruptive communication of an attempted delivery at environment to a darkened room thereof etc. .

For example a do not disturb mode for environment generally may indicate that environment may not be willing or able to accept at least certain package deliveries e.g. deliveries requiring a confirmation of receipt user signature by a particular user or any user . Such a mode may be manually set by an appropriate user e.g. a user with appropriate management rights for environment using any suitable device or interaction with any other suitable smart device of environment for any suitable reason such as when the user does not want to greet a visitor e.g. if the user is feeling under the weather or going to sleep or when the user will not be at environment e.g. when the user is going on vacation or leaving a babysitter at home with a child . Alternatively platform may be operative to collect any suitable information from one or more smart devices of environment and may make inferences in order to automatically set a do not disturb mode for environment e.g. based on sensed occupancy data and sensed movement data . When a current mode of environment is set to a do not disturb mode various suitable settings may be applied by system in response to various suitable detected activities. As just one example in response to a visitor e.g. deliverer DL with or without a package PL being detected by doorbell of environment when environment is in a do not disturb mode system may be operative to automatically initiate a particular action such as communicating to the detected visitor e.g. via user interface or audio speaker of doorbell that it is not an appropriate time to visit environment and to come back at a later time. Additionally or alternatively as mentioned above information indicative of when environment may be associated with a do not disturb mode may be a type of current status information that may be shared with or otherwise made accessible to a facilitator entity e.g. a delivery business for increasing the efficiency of package delivery e.g. delaying delivery until after a do not disturb mode is over and or of any other activity that may include a visitor interacting with environment . Such information may be handled with sensitivity so as to not be leveraged for sinister purposes e.g. for a third party to detect when an environment is in a do not disturb mode so as to assume no one is home and attempt a robbery of the premises . For example communication to a detected visitor of such a mode may simply indicate that an occupant of environment is otherwise preoccupied at the moment e.g. on an important telephone call or putting the baby to sleep and does not wish to interact with the detected visitor whether or not there is in fact an occupant currently at environment where such a communication may be automatically updated or selected by system as may be appropriate for a particular time of day e.g. communicate that an occupant is sleeping if after 10 00 pm or that an occupant is in an important meeting if during regular business hours etc. or for a particular visitor e.g. communicate that an occupant is not available when a known visitor is detected or on an important telephone call when an unknown visitor is detected etc. . As another example system may be configured to share information about a do not disturb mode of an environment or any other suitable status information of environment or a user thereof with a third party such as a facilitator of a package delivery only when certain data is accessible to that third party. For example system may only share such status information when a facilitator entity queries system with respect to particular unique package identification information e.g. such information as may be generated at step and linked with a particular ordered package . Certain facilitator entities e.g. Federal Express may be trusted and enabled by platform to interpret such unique package identification information for appropriately querying system about such status information and whereby system may be configured to only share such status information when queried by a trusted entity e.g. when the unique package identification information is leveraged by an entity trusted by system and not just when any entity has access to the recipient and or location data of the ordered package .

Various types of data may be detected and analyzed for potentially affecting a current or future mode of a system user and or at least a portion of a smart environment. For example user location information with respect to the boundaries of environment or a portion thereof e.g. with respect to a particular room of structure may be leveraged for determining a system mode. If no user is detected within a particular room of environment then that room may be put into a do not disturb mode such that no information is fruitlessly attempted to be communicated to an occupant of that room e.g. via any smart devices of that room . As another example if an occupant is detected within a particular room of environment but that occupant is detected to have not moved more than a particular threshold amount in a particular amount of time and or a brightness value of light is below a particular threshold in that room then it may be inferred that the occupant is asleep and that room may be put into a do not disturb mode such that no information is communicated to an occupant of that room e.g. via any smart devices of that room to prevent the occupant from being awoken. Additionally or alternatively any other suitable activity of a user may be detected by one or more smart devices for at least partially determining a mode of the user and or environment . For example platform may determine that a user is conducting a video conference call with business partners e.g. by analyzing certain movements and actions of the user in conjunction with detected operation of one or more appliances or electronic devices of environment e.g. a video conferencing machine or television or user device and may utilize that information to infer that the user should not be bothered during that activity. In certain embodiments calendar data may be accessible and analyzed for determining a system mode. For example a calendar application for a particular user e.g. as may be accessible by a processing component of platform from a user device may be accessed and analyzed e.g. independently or in combination with other detected data to determine a current or future activity of the user e.g. leveraging calendar data indicative of an important telephone call with client X at a current time in combination with detection of the user being on the telephone may be used to enable a do not disturb mode for that user during the duration of that telephone call .

Additionally or alternatively a user may affirmatively provide platform with information that may be leveraged to at least partially determine one or more modes to be enabled. For example a user may communicate any suitable information to platform via any suitable device of environment to define any suitable characteristic that may be analyzed for enabling a mode and or to specifically enable a particular mode. In some embodiments a user may communicate to platform e.g. via a user device and or any suitable user interface of any suitable smart device of environment a particular activity that the user is currently performing or will be performing at a future time such as putting my baby down for a nap or conducting an important business call or reading an important work document or feeling under the weather or the like. Such information may be verbally communicated by the user to platform or may be manually entered by interfacing with a graphical user interface or any other suitable user interface of platform . Such information may be communicated to platform by a user from any suitable location whether or not the user is local to a particular environment for affecting a mode of that environment. For example a user that may have recently left environment via car may utilize its personal device for communicating to platform that the user wishes for a do not disturb mode to be enabled for environment . In some embodiments a particular mode may be set manually by a user e.g. to override any alternative mode that might be enabled based on current detected data such as to enter a do not disturb mode for the entirety of environment despite a child and a babysitter currently actively occupying environment .

Each one of multiple different system users can be associated with its own distinct mode. For example a first user occupant of environment may be in a do not disturb mode e.g. when on an important telephone call or simply when wishing to not be disturbed and a second user occupant of environment may not be in a do not disturb mode whereby platform may be operative to balance the settings of each enabled mode of the various occupants of environment when responding to an event e.g. when a visitor is detected e.g. at step platform may communicate with a personal device associated with the second user e.g. at step while platform may avoid any communication with devices of environment that may disturb the first user . As one example platform may be operative to communicate silently with a user device of a first available user via a smart device that is proximate to a first available user e.g. with silent blinking lights or text message on a user interface of such a smart device but not to communicate in any manner that may disturb a not available user that may be sleeping next to the available user e.g. not with an audible message via a smart device proximate both users . Additionally or alternatively each one of multiple different zones or areas of environment can be associated with its own distinct mode. For example a first room of environment may be in a do not disturb mode e.g. a bedroom when one or more occupants may be resting therein and a second room of environment may not be in a do not disturb mode e.g. a living room where one or more occupants may be casually watching television whereby platform may be operative detect such modes and to balance the settings of each enabled mode of the various rooms of environment when responding to an event e.g. when a visitor is detected e.g. at step platform may communicate with one or more smart devices located within the second room e.g. at step while platform may avoid any communication with any devices of the first room that may disturb the occupant s therein .

Any particular data or combination of various types of data accessible by platform which may be detected or otherwise received by one or more of devices of a smart home environment may be processed by platform e.g. with a processing engine and or services and or third party sources and or paradigms and or extrinsic information and or any other suitable information services for example in combination with rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence as received home data e.g. for generating derived home data and that data may be analyzed or otherwise used to define and enable a particular mode for a particular user and or for at least a particular portion of an environment . Such a mode may be associated with an entire environment or only a portion thereof. For example a particular wing of structure may be utilized at a certain time as an exhibition area for a performance or a meeting such that that area should be in a do not disturb mode at that time such that information may not be communicated to that area by platform for specific events e.g. for detection of a deliverer DL with a package PL . Additionally or alternatively such a mode may be associated with a particular user whether or not the user is local to environment e.g. user UL or remote from environment e.g. user UR . For example a particular user may be associated with an enabled do not disturb mode when an important business call is being conducted by that user regardless of whether that user is conducting the call within environment or remotely from environment e.g. while driving away from environment such that that user may not be communicated to by platform in a disturbing manner for alerting that user of a specific event e.g. for detection of a deliverer DL with a package PL such as at step .

When a current mode is enabled for a particular environment or user various suitable settings may be followed by platform for that mode in response to particular events being detected. For example when a visitor is detected at environment e.g. at step different type s of communication may be conducted by platform with one or more users depending on whether or not environment is in a particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step and or different type s of feedback may be provided by platform to the visitor depending on whether or not environment is in a particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step . When environment is in a particular type of do not disturb mode for example platform may be operative not to communicate the detection of a visitor using any devices within environment according to communication settings of that mode e.g. so as not to wake any sleeping occupants or so as not to fruitlessly attempt to communicate with non existent occupants yet when environment is not in a do not disturb mode platform may be operative to communicate such detection of a visitor using one or more devices within environment e.g. so as to alert the occupants of the visitor .

In some embodiments certain settings of a particular mode may vary based on certain characteristics of a particular event being detected. For example when a first particular visitor is detected at environment e.g. at step a first particular communication operation may be conducted by platform with a user when environment is in a particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step and or a first particular feedback may be provided by platform to the visitor when environment is in a particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step yet when a second particular visitor is detected at environment e.g. at step a second particular communication operation may be conducted by platform with a user when environment is in that same particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step and or a second particular feedback may be provided by platform to the visitor when environment is in that same particular do not disturb mode e.g. at step . For example when a particular do not disturb mode has been enabled for environment e.g. because the user is taking a nap most visitors detected by environment may be provided by platform with feedback instructing the visitor to return at a later time as the occupants are currently unavailable and no communication may be provided by platform to an occupant that might wake the occupant yet a particular important visitor e.g. a deliverer DL with a highly anticipated or desired package PL detected by environment may be provided by platform with feedback e.g. at step instructing the visitor to wait for an occupant to come to the door and appropriate communication may be provided by platform e.g. at step to the napping occupant e.g. to wake the occupant and instruct the occupant to further the desired delivery process .

Various settings of a particular mode for an environment or system user may dictate the functionality of one or more devices e.g. one or more smart devices of environment . In some embodiments certain mode settings may dictate such functionality in a time based fashion. For example lighting of environment e.g. one or more lamps or outdoor lighting may be automatically turned on 30 minutes before sunset e.g. at 5 00 pm by platform when environment is in a do not disturb mode which may mimic occupant interaction with environment lighting such that environment may appear occupied. Additionally or alternatively in some embodiments certain mode settings may dictate such functionality based on detection of any visitor or a particular visitor. For example lighting of environment e.g. one or more lamps or outdoor lighting may be automatically turned on when a visitor is detected by platform e.g. at doorbell when environment is in a do not disturb mode which may mimic occupant interaction with environment lighting when a visitor is detected such that environment may appear occupied. As another example certain audio e.g. a dog barking may be automatically output e.g. by audio speaker of doorbell when an unknown visitor is detected by platform e.g. at doorbell when environment is in a do not disturb mode which may mimic occupant interaction with environment lighting when a visitor is detected such that environment may appear occupied or otherwise more prepared to thwart a would be thief.

As yet another example certain settings of a mode may dictate that platform automatically provides certain feedback with environment when a particular event is detected while that mode is enabled for environment or a user thereof. For example certain settings of a do not disturb mode may be operative to cause certain feedback e.g. a visual indicator or audible message to be automatically output by environment e.g. by projector user interface and or audio speaker of doorbell when a known visitor or any visitor is detected by platform e.g. by doorbell at environment when such a do not disturb mode is enabled for environment or for a user thereof. Such feedback may be provided e.g. at step to indicate to the visitor detected e.g. at step that no occupant of environment is currently available to interact with the visitor. For example such feedback may convey to the detected visitor that occupant X is currently on an important telephone call right now and cannot be bothered or occupant X is currently nursing the baby please come back at another time or the like which may in some way alert the visitor not to bother interacting any further with environment e.g. not to bother depressing or otherwise interacting with button of doorbell when the visitor is detected such that environment may appear occupied but unable to accommodate occupant interaction with the visitor. As another example such feedback may be provided as a simple indication of the mode on or with respect to user interface doorbell button or any other suitable component of doorbell or other smart device of environment that a visitor would usually interact with to reach an occupant e.g. doorbell button may be provided with a blinking red light or text message reading doorbell deactivated please come back at another time whereby a visitor may easily determine that any active visitor interaction with environment would not be worthwhile. In some such embodiments such feedback may be provided at an initial entry point to environment e.g. at a front gate at the border of the curtilage of environment which may thereby indicate the do not disturb mode to the visitor at an initial detection of the visitor at environment rather than after the visitor has fruitlessly advanced to the front door of structure . This may save valuable time for the visitor e.g. obviating the need for a deliverer DL to get out of a delivery truck with package PL for approaching door and or may prevent more intimate visitor interaction with portions of environment that may disturb an occupant e.g. visitor interaction with front door may needlessly rile up an occupant dog on the interior side of door . In some embodiments in addition to or as an alternative to providing such feedback to a detected visitor certain settings of a do not disturb mode may be operative to adjust certain functionalities of certain devices of environment when a known visitor or any visitor is detected by platform e.g. by doorbell at environment when such a do not disturb mode is enabled for environment or for a user thereof. Such functionality adjustment may include for example deactivating the functionality of platform to communicate an interaction of a visitor with doorbell button to a system user of environment when a particular mode is enabled for environment or a user thereof. That is the conventional functionality of doorbell button may be at least partially deactivated when a particular mode is enabled.

Various levels of detailed information regarding the mode may be communicated in such feedback dependent upon the type of visitor detected. For example if a deliverer DL of a trusted third party deliverer entity is detected e.g. at step then platform may be operative to provide feedback e.g. at step that may indicate when the current do not disturb mode will be over e.g. no one is currently available to receive you but please return between 3 00 pm and 5 00 pm when an occupant will be ready to greet you . However if an unknown visitor is detected then less detailed feedback may be provided such as no one is currently available to receive you please leave the premises immediately . In certain embodiments platform may be configured to provide visitor specific messages to specific visitors that may be detected during specific modes. For example when an occupant is set to take a nap and instructs platform to enable a do not disturb mode for the user and or at least a portion of environment but that occupant wishes to leave a message for a particular visitor if that visitor is detected during that mode e.g. Hi visitor Y I am sorry to miss you but I had to take a nap I left your backpack next to the mailbox for you the occupant may provide specific instructions for associating such a message with that mode and that message may be communicated to such a visitor if that visitor is detected by platform e.g. at doorbell when environment is in such a do not disturb mode. Such messages or other suitable customizable settings of a mode may be defined by a user when local to environment e.g. via any suitable smart device of environment or when remote from environment e.g. via a user device such as for example when the user is currently on vacation but would like to leave a customized note for a visitor that is expected to arrive at environment while the user is still on vacation and environment is in a do not disturb mode .

Certain current mode information and or future mode information of an environment or user may be shared with one or more suitable outside service providers. For example as mentioned above with respect to current status information e.g. mode of an environment or user may be obtained by a delivery facilitator business entity e.g. at step to affect the delivery of a package e.g. to delay delivery until a time when environment may be occupied by the recipient to receive the delivery . As another example current status information e.g. mode of an environment or user may be obtained by a law enforcement agency and or suitable emergency response entity or other suitable security entity or neighboring environment to affect protection of the environment or its users e.g. to increase security from thieves of environment in a do not disturb mode until an active occupant is within environment . Mode status information of a smart system entity may include various types of information that may be obtained and leveraged e.g. at steps by a third party for more efficiently delivering a package and or for protecting an environment entity that may be accomplished in a more convenient manner for environment or for a user thereof. For example such status information may include information indicative of when to allow delivery to a particular location e.g. after 4 00 PM on Mondays and Wednesdays only information indicative of preferred alternate delivery methods e.g. do not deliver to environment but rather hold a particular package at a particular deliverer pick up location for manual pick up by a particular user or deliver to another recipient and or to another location other than the recipient and or location initially defined at step information indicative of authorization to deliver without signed confirmation of receipt of delivery e.g. a particular authenticated user of the system hereby authorizes deliverer to deliver a particular package to a particular location and leave next to the front door of that location without a human user sitting for that delivery and or any other suitable information indicative of any other suitable delivery preferences or delivery instructions. As another example such status information may include information indicative of when an environment is more susceptible to certain security breaches e.g. no occupants will be alert at environment after 11 00 PM on Mondays and at all on Wednesdays information indicative of current occupancy on a room by room basis e.g. one child in room A two adults in room B etc. which may be leveraged for increasing the ability of security personnel to handle a situation e.g. a fire information indicative of last detected movement on a room by room basis e.g. movement detected within room A 10 minutes ago movement detected from room B into room C 5 seconds ago etc. which may be leveraged for increasing the ability of security personnel to handle a situation e.g. a robbery information indicative of authorization to access environment without real time user approval e.g. information indicative of user authorization of a particular authenticated security entity e.g. an authenticated firefighter to access at least certain portions of environment without a human user authorizing such access in real time which may be leveraged for increasing the ability of security personnel to handle a situation e.g. a fire and or any other suitable information indicative of any other suitable security preferences or security instructions.

In some embodiments mode status information may be provided to a delivery facilitator and or a security facilitator on a macro level in addition to or as an alternative to providing mode status information with respect to just one particular environment and or user thereof. For example mode status information may be made available to a facilitator entity that may be generally indicative of a mode status or mode trend of a particular group of smart system entities e.g. a neighborhood or ZIP code that may include multiple smart environments . As just one example such mode status information may be indicative of certain days of the week when a majority of such environments of the group are in a do not disturb mode and or are otherwise not available to receive packages and such information may be leveraged by the facilitator entity to increase security to that entire group e.g. neighborhood of environments during those days and or to avoid scheduling deliveries to that entire group e.g. neighborhood of environments during those days. Any suitable grouping of environments or users or other suitable smart system entities of any suitable size and type may be used to generate group or macro level mode status information that may be made available to a facilitator entity for more efficiently handling the purpose e.g. security and or deliveries associated with that group. By grouping smart system entities and only sharing mode status data at a group level with third parties such as delivery facilitator entities the privacy and or security of certain environments may be protected by platform by not sharing mode status information associated specifically with only a particular single environment or user e.g. to preserve at least some anonymity about the status of a particular smart environment or user .

By accessing certain mode status information of a smart environment or other suitable smart system entity of platform as may be detected or inferred by system a facilitator entity may be configured to optimize package delivery or environment security. For example data indicative of when a particular location may and may not be able to receive a package delivery may be processed by any suitable distribution system to dictate when certain packages are dispatched for maximizing the likelihood of a successful physical delivery. This may reduce overhead costs for a delivery entity e.g. reduce fuel prices and wasted man hours by limiting the number of failed delivery attempts and or may reduce insurance costs by limiting the exposure of perishable contents from unnecessary and degrading delivery effects. As another example data indicative of when a particular location may and may not be actively occupied may be processed by any suitable security system to dictate when certain security measures are dispatched for increasing the security of the environment. This may reduce overhead costs for a security entity e.g. reduce fuel prices and wasted man hours by limiting the number of unnecessary visits by a security officer to a location that is currently actively occupied and or may reduce insurance costs by limiting the exposure of environments to less than secure conditions. For example one some or all of steps and may be at least partially or completely automated using one or more computer systems e.g. computer system and or computer system that may be leveraged by each one of environment system facilitator entity and the like for associating a smart system entity of system with a mode and then sharing certain mode status information of that smart system entity with a deliverer or other entity at any suitable time for positively affecting the delivery of a package or the security of the environment or user. A user of system may actively and manually define certain preferences or instructions to be shared with such a facilitator entity. Alternatively or additionally the delivery of packages and or third party security of a user or environment by a facilitator entity may be based on inferences made by system or other suitable processing component s of platform e.g. at environment or remote therefrom and selectively shared with such a facilitator entity e.g. without any active manual preferences made by a user but instead done transparently to a user .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Smart doorbell of environment may be configured to include any suitable component or combination of components described above so as to effectively interact with other smart devices of environment and of services platform and with any suitable users thereof such as users registered with or associated with environment e.g. owners occupants etc. and or users visiting environment e.g. package deliverers friends solicitors strangers and would be thieves for increasing the security of environment and or for increasing the convenience of users of environment . For example doorbell may be operative to initially detect a visitor at environment analyze visitor information based on the initial detection e.g. in light of any applicable enabled modes adjust a functionality of one or more smart devices of environment based on such analysis communicate with a user of environment based on such analysis provide feedback to the visitor based on such analysis and or based on such communication detect at least one act performed by the visitor in response to the provided feedback and or communicate with at least one of the user and the visitor based on the detected act. A first adjustment of the functionality of a smart device may be performed based on analysis of initial visitor detection information e.g. based on the detection of a visitor generally while a second adjustment of the functionality of a smart device may be later performed based on analysis of additional visitor detection information e.g. based on the detection of an act of a visitor where detection and analysis of such an act may identify a class of the visitor or that may identify the visitor specifically . Certain adjustment of the functionality of a smart device may enable the visitor to access at least a portion of environment e.g. unlocking of doorknob of door for enabling a visitor to enter structure . Such access may be granted based on analysis of visitor information revealing a trusted invitee e.g. a guest to a party at a specifically designated time or a trusted security service entity e.g. a fireman during a detected emergency situation . The granted access may be limited in one or more ways based on the identity of the visitor and or based on any other suitable data available for analysis. Various additional data may be leveraged during the analysis of any suitable detected visitor information including data from a neighborhood security network of one or more additional smart environments associated e.g. physically with environment . Each one of these various security features that may be provided by doorbell and platform for enhancing visitor handling at environment is described below in more detail.

As described above at step of process for enhancing visitor handling visitor information of a visitor may be detected at an entryway interface device of a smart environment. For example one or more sensing components of doorbell may be operative to detect any suitable visitor information when any suitable visitor comes within a suitable sensing range of doorbell . Such a visitor may be any suitable entity such as a package deliverer e.g. deliverer DL of which may be a human or a drone or otherwise security entities e.g. firemen policemen security system agents etc. any other suitable agents of any third party entities known to platform e.g. entities friends of one or more users of environment that may or may not be known to platform solicitors strangers would be thieves and the like. At step first visitor identification information may be detected when a visitor is initially sensed by platform at environment e.g. by doorbell . Such initial first visitor identification information may be any suitable detectable data that may then be analyzed by platform e.g. at step in order to determine that a visitor may be present at environment . For example simple motion data e.g. as may be sensed by a motion sensing component of doorbell may be adequate for analysis by platform e.g. by doorbell alone in combination with other processing components of environment and or in combination with other processing components of platform such as system to determine that a visitor is present at doorbell . Alternatively more advanced sensing may be performed at step for initially detecting the presence of a visitor at step e.g. motion sensing audio sensing camera sensing PIR sensing ambient light sensing ultrasonic sensing and or any other suitable sensing capabilities of doorbell or of environment generally e.g. sensing capabilities of one or more other smart devices . As just one example audio sensing of a fingerprint or signature matching a delivery truck or any other suitable vehicle that may be generally associated with a visitor may be initially detected and analyzed which may result in additional visitor sensing functionality being enhanced for further detection and analysis e.g. video sensing and or motion sensing .

At step process may include analyzing the detected visitor information of step e.g. in conjunction with any other suitable data available to platform such as settings of a current mode of environment or of a user for determining the presence of a visitor at environment and how to initially respond to such a determination. For example in response to detecting such visitor information at step doorbell alone or in combination with other processing components of other smart devices and or rules based inference engines and or artificial intelligence provided locally at environment and or at or in conjunction with system and or at or in conjunction with any other component s of services platform may be operative at step to access any suitable additional information that may be useful for interpreting the detected visitor information e.g. motion sensing thresholds visitor signatures or fingerprints and or any other suitable data that may help to make a determination about the presence of a visitor in light of the detected visitor information and or additional information that may be useful for determining how to proceed if the presence of a visitor is determined e.g. current mode settings of environment etc. and then to analyze all such available information for determining whether or not a visitor is present and if so whether to take one or more of a variety of automated actions based on that detected visitor presence.

At step process may include adjusting the functionality of at least one smart device of environment based on the analysis of step or even based solely on the detection of step . As just one example when any potential visitor information is detected at step smart environment may be operative to turn on a light e.g. outdoor lighting or projector of doorbell at step to increase the safety of the potential visitor and or to increase the security of environment . As another example when any potential visitor information is detected at step smart environment may be operative to increase the sensing functionality of one or more smart devices of environment at step e.g. by increasing the sampling rate of a sensing component by increasing or varying the sensing area covered by a sensing component by turning on one or more additional sensing components e.g. of doorbell that may have previously been turned off for power conservancy etc. to increase the security of environment e.g. by enhancing the ability of environment to monitor any potential visitor activity . As another example when any potential visitor information is detected at step smart environment may be operative to generate certain activity at step that may mimic occupancy at environment detectable by the visitor to increase the security of environment such as by turning on a lamp within structure and or by outputting audio data from an audio output component of any smart device within structure that may resemble a dog barking or any other suitable noises or activity that may lead a visitor to believe that an active occupant is at environment . In some embodiments such audio data may be output by an audio output component of a device located within structure but adjacent to door such that the outputted audio e.g. a played back recording of a dog barking may realistically sound like occupancy within structure . In other embodiments such as when an actual dog is known to be within structure audio data that is only audible to a dog may be output by an audio output component of environment which may prompt the actual dog to bark for increasing the security of environment . As yet another example when any potential visitor information is detected at step smart environment may be operative to output a general message at step that may instruct the visitor how to initially interface with environment e.g. by outputting audio data from audio speaker or visual data from projector of doorbell or any other suitable data from any other suitable smart device of environment that may be received by the detected visitor where such a message may include any suitable instruction such as Please identify yourself and your intention or Please align any identification information with a sensing component of the doorbell or the like to increase the security of environment and further the visitor handling of process . As another example when any potential visitor information is detected at step smart environment may be operative to lock any unlocked entry ways to structure e.g. by locking smart doorknob at step to increase the security of environment whereby in such embodiments the previous locked unlocked condition of such entry ways may be restored once the visitor is no longer detected or has been otherwise securely dealt with.

Such adjusting of the functionality of one or more smart devices of environment at step may be based on the analysis of step . For example such adjusting may be done automatically in response to a determination that the presence of a visitor has been detected. Additionally or alternatively such adjusting may be done automatically not only in response to a determination that the presence of a visitor has been detected but also in response to analysis of any applicable mode settings rules inferences or other suitable information available to platform that may be processed for determining the way or ways in which certain smart device functionality ought to be adjusted in response to the determined visitor presence e.g. time of day current functionality of certain smart devices current mode of environment current occupancy of environment and or any other suitable information . Such adjusting may also be performed whether or not the detected visitor presence has been determined with respect to a particular visitor e.g. next door neighbor John Doe with respect to a particular visitor type e.g. a delivery drone or a gas utility service man or security agent or firefighter etc. or with respect to a visitor generally e.g. a human or drone or any other suitable entity that may be handled by platform as a potential visitor to environment even including an animal such as a cat that may be detectable as an unknown stray or detectable as the neighbor s missing pet e.g. via an NFC chip coupled to the cat and NFC sensing component whereby process may enable proper detection of the cat and communication of its presence to appropriate users authorities . Such initial detection of the presence of a visitor may be determined based on analysis of initial detected visitor information that may be compiled without active communication by the visitor of its intent to environment . Instead in some embodiments the presence may be initially determined when the analysis of the visitor information determines that the shape and or motion and or any other suitable characteristic of a potential visitor e.g. generically or specifically has been detected. Such initial adjusting of the functionality of one or more smart devices at step in response to initial detection of the presence of a visitor may automatically increase the security of environment and or increase the safety or convenience of the detected visitor that may be potentially attempting to interact with environment for any suitable purpose e.g. for communicating with an occupant for delivering a package for fetching an item etc. .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

As described above at step process may include communicating with a user associated with the smart environment based on the analysis of step . As just one example when the analysis of step determines that the presence of a visitor has been initially detected at environment and that a mode of environment or of a system user is such that communication may be attempted smart environment may be operative to communicate the determined visitor presence to an appropriate system user or portion of environment in any suitable way at step e.g. by audibly announcing any suitable information related to the visitor presence via an audio speaker of a smart device that may be located most proximal to the current location of a user within environment . As another example when the analysis of step determines that no appropriate user is available within environment smart environment may be operative to communicate the visitor presence to a system user or appropriate third party via platform in any suitable way at step e.g. by transmitting an electronic message to a personal device associated with a remote user UR or by transmitting an electronic message to a trusted third party security entity associated with environment . For example in some embodiments a video e.g. a recorded loop or a live stream of the detected visitor or still image or any other suitable detected visitor information e.g. as detected at step may be communicated at step to such a user or third party automatically or in response to a request relayed from such a user or third party after being notified of the detected visitor whereby such communicated visitor information data may be utilized by such a user or third party in any suitable way e.g. to actively monitor the visitor s activity and or to attempt to specifically identify the identity of the visitor or at least the type of the identified visitor .

At step process may include providing the visitor with feedback based on at least one of the analysis of step and or any communication of step . As just one example when the analysis of step determines that there are currently no occupants local to environment or otherwise in an active and available state for appropriately being told of the detected visitor and or when no user response is received for any communication attempt of step with respect to a detected visitor platform may be operative to determine that smart environment may proceed with handling the detected visitor without active user input and doorbell may provide the visitor at step with instructions or other suitable feedback on how to proceed. Alternatively when the analysis of step determines that there is a user local to environment that is in an active and available state for appropriately being told of the detected visitor and or when a user or third party response is received for any communication attempt of step with respect to a detected visitor platform may be operative to determine that a user or third party privy to smart environment may at least partially handle the visitor and doorbell may provide the visitor at step with instructions or other suitable feedback on how to proceed. The type of feedback that may be provided via doorbell and or via any other suitable smart device of environment to the visitor at step may vary based on the analysis of step and or any communication of step . For example the feedback may include active communication from the user or third party to the visitor via doorbell e.g. audible and or visual information and or any other suitable information may be conveyed to the visitor by doorbell where such information may be generated and transmitted by or otherwise under the control of the user via another smart device that the user may directly interface with and that may be communicatively coupled to doorbell . This may enable a virtual conversation between the user and the visitor via platform e.g. by repeating one or more of steps as described above with respect to a deliverer visitor . Alternatively the feedback may include automated messages or instructions generated by system for communication to the visitor via doorbell e.g. a message that may communicate that a user is not currently able to actively interact with you right now please proceed as follows . . . etc. . Additionally or alternatively the feedback may include providing certain environment access to the visitor such as by opening door by unlocking doorknob for a certain amount of time e.g. if the visitor is approved by system as an expected and or authorized visitor door may be unlocked such that the visitor may be enabled to enter structure .

In some embodiments feedback provided by platform at step to an initially detected visitor may convey a request for the detected visitor to provide more and or specific information about the visitor s identity and or the visitor s intent using any suitable output component of doorbell or any other smart device of environment that may be detected by the visitor. For example such feedback may include any suitable audible and or visual request for the visitor to physically communicate with environment such as a request to please state your full name and your intent . As another example such feedback may include any suitable request for the visitor to avail at least a specific portion of the visitor to environment for being properly sensed by environment e.g. within a detection range of a sensing component of doorbell such as a request to please align your face with the doorbell s camera or please present a form of identification to the doorbell s scanner or any other suitable instructions for facilitating the detection of any specific visitor identification information and or visitor intent information. Label ID may be any suitable form of visitor identification such as a label of package PL or a driver s license of the visitor or an identification tag of a delivery drone or an RFID tag of a pet or personal property etc. that may be properly sensed by environment .

At step process may include detecting an act of the visitor based on the provided feedback of step e.g. an act performed by the visitor in response to the provided feedback . Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment may be configured to detect an action of the visitor at step in response to platform providing the visitor with feedback at step where that action may be any suitable action indicative of the visitor interacting with environment e.g. doorbell in a particular way. As just one example in response to instructing the visitor to provide specific information about its identity and or its intent or otherwise to avail at least a specific portion of the visitor e.g. its face or a label ID to sensing by environment for detection of such specific identification information e.g. within a detection range of a sensing component of doorbell at step doorbell may detect such additional visitor identification intent information at step . Any suitable action of the visitor may be detected or otherwise received by any suitable component of environment and or otherwise of platform at step where such detection may enable platform to update system information about the detected visitor such as with respect to the specific identity of the visitor e.g. neighbor Billy Bob the specific type of visitor e.g. Federal Express deliverer child firefighter the specific intent of the visitor e.g. visitor wants to say hi to occupant X visitor wants to deliver package PL visitor wants to pick up an item it accidently left at environment etc. and or the like. For example a visitor may communicate with platform at step via any suitable communication enabled by a smart device of environment accessible by the visitor and or via any suitable communication enabled by platform and a visitor device . In some embodiments suitable visitor identification data may be communicated with platform by the visitor at step via visitor gestures towards doorbell as may be described above with respect to smart device via visitor touch input via a touch user interface via visitor audible spoken information via microphone and or the like. A visitor may scan a driver s license or other suitable identification such as the visitor s face or fingerprint e.g. at a scanner sensing component of doorbell . Additionally or alternatively platform may be configured to automatically detect such additional visitor identification intent information at step without prompting the visitor to do so at step . For example label ID may be automatically detected by a sensing component of doorbell when a visitor is present within a specific distance of doorbell and not in response to a specific act of the visitor done in response to a specific feedback request of platform .

Specific visitor identification intent information detected e.g. at step or initially at step may then be analyzed by platform for more specifically identifying the visitor or its intent e.g. by repeating step . For example platform may be operative to analyze such detected visitor information by running any suitable facial detection or fingerprint or other biometric sensing algorithms or any other suitable entity identification algorithms or comparisons using any available databases or processing paradigms or extrinsic information such as social network contact information of various entities known by the various occupants of environment or known agent information of various business emergency response entities or known sex offenders or criminals or missing person pet identification databases of law enforcement agencies in order to detect or confirm the identity of the visitor. One or more iterations of detecting visitor information analyzing detected visitor information providing the visitor with feedback and or detecting an act of the visitor of process may be conducted by platform e.g. via doorbell any other smart devices of environment and or any other processing capabilities of platform with or without any active communication from a system user or third party in order to determine the identity and or intent of a detected visitor with any suitable amount of clarity confidence accuracy and or specificity for effectively handling the visitor.

At step process may include communicating with at least one of the user and the visitor based on the detected identity and or intent of the visitor. Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment may be configured to confirm detection of an identity and or intent of the visitor with the visitor e.g. by communicating any suitable confirmation information directly to the visitor via doorbell . Alternatively or additionally doorbell and or any other component of environment and or system may be configured to confirm detection of an identity and or intent of the visitor with a user of environment e.g. by communicating any suitable confirmation information to the user via any suitable smart device of environment or personal device of the user similarly to any communication of step . This may enable the visitor and or the user to remain updated with respect to the current status of the handling of the visitor by platform .

One or more of steps of process may be repeated for any suitable visitor handling. For example in response to analysis at step of any visitor information detected at step feedback requesting additional visitor identification information may be provided to the visitor at step in response to which an action of the visitor attempting to provide additional visitor information may be detected by the smart environment at step and any additional visitor information of that detected action may be analyzed at step in response to which one or more of steps may again follow. Therefore process may support a virtual interaction between a visitor and platform e.g. environment or service as an automated agent of a system user .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Platform may be operative to enable certain functionality of doorbell to being utilized by a visitor whether or not certain visitor identification information and or certain visitor intent information has been confirmed. For example platform may be operative to enable the visitor to leave any suitable message for a system user of environment for eventual receipt by that user e.g. an audio message a video message a text message etc. that may be obtained by one or more sensing components of doorbell . The visitor may simply wish to leave a voicemail message for environment and doorbell may be operative to enable the visitor to record such a message e.g. via microphone whereby such a message may then be eventually communicated to a system user of environment e.g. according to any applicable rules or inferences or mode settings . For example at step doorbell may be operative to provide feedback to the visitor indicative of the ability of doorbell to receive such a message e.g. via audio speaker or projector communicating such a possibility to the visitor such as by conveying a message like leave a voicemail for a user of environment by pressing button now and in response the visitor may communicate such a message to doorbell at step . This may encourage certain types of visitors to interact with environment in a manner that may not unnecessarily bother a user of environment whether or not a do not disturb mode Is enabled for environment or that user. For example a neighbor visitor may be swinging by environment to return a mitten that was accidently left by a system user at the neighbor s home and such a visitor may simply provide a message for capture by platform at step e.g. Hi this is neighbor Billy Bob I am leaving your mitten at your doorstep and platform may then share that message with a system user at a time convenient to the user at step .

Platform may be operative to prevent certain functionality of doorbell from being utilized by a visitor until certain visitor identification information and or certain visitor intent information has been confirmed. For example user interface button of doorbell may be disabled or presented to the visitor as non functional e.g. by displaying a disabled message on the button until any suitable condition has been confirmed by platform . By seemingly presenting the visitor with no ability to ring the bell to beckon an occupant doorbell may encourage a visitor to interact with platform in a cooperative manner e.g. to provide appropriate visitor information at step . This may dissuade a visitor from incessantly pressing button or otherwise interacting with doorbell in an unproductive manner. In such embodiments the actual functionality of doorbell button may be enabled or disabled based on any suitable settings of platform e.g. if a visitor presses doorbell button despite being presented to the visitor as non functional such a visitor interaction may be detected by platform and handled in any suitable way such as by outputting an audible tone at one or more smart devices of environment for alerting an occupant of the visitor and or by storing data indicative of that visitor interaction for later use e.g. for security profiling and or user review as described below .

When platform may attempt to analyze certain system data e.g. at step and or to communicate with a system user during process e.g. at step such as for enabling a user to decide actively how platform may proceed with handling a detected visitor platform may also be operative to simultaneously communicate certain information to the detected visitor while such analysis and or user communication is attempted. For example certain feedback may be provided by environment e.g. by doorbell to a detected visitor at step while platform may also be at least attempting to analyze data at step and or to communicate with a user at step . Such feedback may be provided for maintaining the visitor s attention and or for providing security to environment . As one example such feedback may be a communication instructing the visitor to wait for further instructions e.g. by playing hold music or hold video e.g. an advertisement or telling the visitor please wait a moment which may maintain the visitor s attention and or ensure the visitor that their arrival is being handled. Any other suitable message which may be customizable by a system user and utilized by platform based on current mode settings or otherwise may be provided to a detected visitor e.g. if you are a solicitor please leave this property immediately otherwise you are hereby agreeing to pay the system user 50 . As another example such feedback may be a communication that may convey to the visitor that some active occupancy exists at environment e.g. by outputting audio of a dog barking from within structure as also described above with respect to step which may increase the security of environment rather than having the visitor wait for instructions amidst silence that may lead the visitor to assume that no one is home whether or not that assumption is correct. The type of such feedback may vary based on the identity and or intent of the visitor as may be already determined by platform . For example if the visitor has been determined to be somewhat trusted e.g. a known acquaintance of a system user or a deliverer of a trusted delivery entity business etc. then pleasant hold music may be provided as such feedback. However if the identity of the visitor has not yet been determined or has been determined to be a stranger or otherwise suspect then dog barking or other security enhancing feedback may be provided.

Similarly the type of attempted communication with a user e.g. at step which may be carried out at least partially simultaneously with such feedback to the visitor at step may vary based on the identity and or intent of the visitor as may be already determined by platform e.g. at step . For example if the visitor has been determined to be somewhat trusted e.g. a known acquaintance of a system user or a deliverer of a trusted delivery entity business etc. then attempted communication with the user may be conducted by platform through indicating as much e.g. communication conveying your acquaintance Billy Bob is here or a Federal Express deliverer is here . However if the identity of the visitor has not yet been determined or has been determined to be a stranger or otherwise suspect then attempted communication with the user may be conducted by platform through indicating as much e.g. communication conveying an unknown visitor is here . As another example if the identity of the visitor has not yet been determined or has been determined to be a stranger or otherwise suspect then an attempted communication may be carried out using a communication technique that may prompt a pet dog to bark loudly e.g. emitting a high pitched dog whistle type communication from an output component of a smart device of environment thereby not only putting any human user occupants on notice of the unknown visitor s detected presence but also increasing the security of environment by making the visitor aware of the presence of the barking dog but if the identity of the visitor has been determined to be somewhat trusted then an attempted communication may be carried out using a communication technique that may not prompt a pet dog to bark loudly e.g. emitting a communication e.g. visual information and or an audio communication that may not excite a dog from an output component of a smart device of environment thereby putting any human user occupants on notice of the trusted visitor s detected presence while not unnecessarily riling up a pet.

Platform may be configured to selectively enable a conventional doorbell interface to the visitor at step e.g. based on any suitable analysis at step . For example when any visitor is detected at environment or when a specific type of visitor is detected at environment during any mode or during a particular mode of environment e.g. at steps platform may be operative to provide feedback to the visitor at step that may be indicative of a visitor s option to interact with doorbell button of doorbell for attempting to announce the visitor s presence to an occupant of environment . In such embodiments doorbell may be operative to communicate to the visitor via any suitable communication mechanism e.g. via projector speaker or an indicator on button itself any suitable feedback indicating that button has been enabled for optional visitor interaction e.g. feedback conveying a message along the lines of the visitor may ring doorbell button to attempt to alert an occupant of your presence . For example this may be enabled by platform if a current occupant of environment is not in a do not disturb mode but is willing to be notified of visitors in response to a visitor s active interaction with a doorbell button. This may also provide the visitor with some sense of control in the process. As another example such feedback may be more specific based on current active occupancy or mode of environment . As just one specific example if a first user A e.g. Husband is an active and available occupant at environment but a second user B e.g. Wife is currently unavailable at environment e.g. as may be determined through analysis at step doorbell may be operative to communicate to the visitor via any suitable communication mechanism e.g. via projector speaker or an indicator on button itself any suitable feedback indicating that button has been enabled for optional visitor interaction for attempting to alert only first user A but not second user B of the visitor s presence. Therefore platform may be operative to provide the visitor with the option to choose whether or not to ring doorbell button for attempting to alert occupant user A of the visitor s presence which may increase the convenience of not only the visitor but also of occupant user A for example when the visitor may choose to walk away from environment without ringing the bell if the visitor only wanted to see user B but not user A. This too may provide the visitor with some sense of control in the process. In response to such feedback the visitor may choose to interact with button of doorbell for alerting the available occupant s of its presence at step . If two or more occupants are available to be notified of the visitor s presence such availability may be communicated to the visitor e.g. at step and doorbell may provide the visitor with the ability to selectively choose which of the available occupants may be notified of the visitor s presence e.g. at step . For example a first portion of button may indicate that visitor interaction therewith may notify a first available occupant of the visitor s presence e.g. using an output component of a first smart device proximate the first occupant while a second portion of button may indicate that visitor interaction therewith may notify a second available occupant of the visitor s presence e.g. using an output component of a second smart device proximate the second occupant and while a third portion of button may indicate that visitor interaction therewith may notify both the first available occupant and the second available occupant of the visitor s presence.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

When any suitable level of clarity confidence accuracy and or specificity has been achieved by platform with respect to the presence identity and or intent of a detected visitor such visitor identity and or intent may be analyzed e.g. at step in conjunction with any other suitable data e.g. occupancy data or availability data or settings of a mode of environment or of a system user inferences rules user input neighboring smart environments third party entities time of day etc. and then various potential types of specific feedback may be provided to the visitor based on that analysis e.g. at step and or various functionalities of smart devices of environment may be adjusted based on that analysis e.g. at step . Therefore in response to determining any visitor identification information and or visitor intention information platform may be operative to take particular action e.g. automatically based on various factors of the particular situation for controlling doorbell and or any other suitable smart devices of environment to increase the security of environment increase the efficiency of the visitor s intentions increase the convenience of a system user with respect to the handling of the visitor and the like.

When a general class of visitor has been determined various actions may be taken by platform . For example when a deliverer visitor of a known delivery business entity has been detected platform may be operative to communicate any suitable delivery instructions to the visitor as described above. As another example when a firefighter visitor has been detected platform may be operative to grant access to structure in all situations or only in certain situations e.g. if a hazard detector has detected a specific type of hazard within structure and no occupant activity has been detected within a certain duration of time . As another example if a solicitor visitor has been detected e.g. an entity with an identified intention to solicit something from a system user of environment platform may be operative to communicate any suitable message to the solicitor e.g. please leave this property immediately or you will be subject to arrest or please kindly leave a message with doorbell and your solicitation will be considered at a later time .

When a specific visitor has been identified various actions may be taken by platform . For example when a trusted friend visitor of a system user has been detected platform may be operative to communicate any suitable status information of that system user to the visitor where such status information may indicate that the user is currently napping that the user is currently putting the baby down for a nap but will be available in a few minutes that the user is currently away from but driving towards environment with an expected arrival time in a few minutes that the user is currently at the grocery store or any other suitable status information that may be determined by platform . Platform may enable a system user e.g. via an application on a user device to define different sharing thresholds for different visitors such that a user may enable platform to share only particular status information with particular visitors at particular times as the user desires. For example a system user may define a mode setting that instructs platform to convey a particular message if a particular visitor is detected at environment at a particular time such as Hi neighbor Billy I am currently napping but I left your sunglasses hidden next to the large oak tree in the backyard for your own retrieval . In some embodiments platform may be operative to adjust a functionality of a smart device in conjunction with conveying such a message to a particular detected visitor such as by conveying the message Hi Uncle Nick I am sorry I am running late I will be home in 10 minutes please go inside and make yourself comfortable with doorbell while also temporarily unlocking door with doorknob . Therefore a do not disturb mode that may be enabled by a system user when he is napping may include conditional settings that may be operative to instruct platform to interact with most detected visitors by conveying a message to the visitor that the occupant is currently unavailable at this time please try again later but that may be operative to instruct platform to interact with a particular detected visitor e.g. a highly anticipated visitor by conveying a unique message the occupant will be with you in just a moment to the visitor and to immediately alert the napping user of the particular detected visitor e.g. via any suitable smart device communication that may be suitable to wake the napping user and convey the presence of the particular detected visitor . Based on any suitable analysis in response to a particular visitor being detected any suitable message may be conveyed and or any suitable smart device functionality may be adjusted by platform .

Platform may be operative to remind system users of certain expected visitors in order to enable adjustment of certain mode settings. For example platform may leverage any suitable data such as user calendar event data deliverer entity business shipping schedule data and the like to identify certain periods of time during which a visitor is expected at environment and platform may enable adjustment of certain mode settings for handling such visitors in advance of that mode being enabled for execution by platform . As just one example delivery entity business e.g. Federal Express may share a planned delivery time for a package PL at environment with system e.g. via API and platform may utilize such information to alert a system user of that expected delivery time if it may coincide with a time frame of a particular mode to be enabled at environment . That is if user UL interacts with platform to enable a do not disturb mode for the next 3 hours because that user is about to take a nap platform may identify that the delivery of package PL is planned for within that 3 hour time period communicate as much to the user and may enable user adjustment of certain mode settings of the do not disturb mode that may affect the handling of the delivery of that particular package PL. For example the do not disturb mode may initially include mode settings operative to instruct platform to tell any detected visitor to come back at a later time but the expected delivery of package PL may require a physical user signature in order to complete the delivery whereby platform may be operative to analyze such data and ask the user whether it would like to adjust a setting of the do not disturb mode for the handling of that particular delivery visitor e.g. would you like to update the settings to alert you if this particular package is attempted to be delivered during the do not disturb mode such that the user may update the mode settings of the do not disturb mode to instruct platform to wake up the napping user if the delivery of package PL is actually detected by environment at doorbell while that do not disturb mode is enabled.

As another particular example a calendar application for a particular user e.g. as may be accessible from a user device may be accessed and analyzed e.g. independently or in combination with other detected data by platform to determine an expected arrival time of an expected visitor at environment e.g. leveraging calendar data indicative of repair man coming to environment at 3 00 pm to fix backyard swimming pool and platform may utilize such information to alert a system user of that expected visitor time if it may coincide with a time frame of a particular mode to be enabled or recently enabled at environment . That is if a system user interacts with platform to enable a do not disturb mode indefinitely e.g. if user Husband and Child are detected by platform to leave environment and exit inner geo fence at 2 30 pm thereby leaving environment unoccupied and thereby automatically enabling a particular do not disturb mode for environment platform may automatically identify that the time frame of the expected visitor may overlap with the enablement time frame of the do not disturb mode may communicate this identified overlap to the user and may enable the user to adjust one or more mode settings of that enabled mode in order to affect the handling of that expected visit. For example the do not disturb mode may initially include mode settings operative to lock gated entry and to convey a message to any detected visitor at gated entry e.g. via a doorbell at gated entry that no one is available at this time please come back again later however such visitor handling may prevent an expected pool repairman from servicing a pool of environment beyond gated entry whereby platform may be operative to analyze such data and ask the user whether it would like to adjust a setting of the do not disturb mode for the handling of that particular repairman visitor e.g. would you like to update the settings to enable access to the outdoor pool if a visit by this particular repairman is detected during the do not disturb mode such that the user may update the mode settings of the do not disturb mode to instruct platform to temporarily unlock gated entry if the pool repairman is actually detected by environment . Therefore platform may be operative to analyze expected visitor information in combination with mode settings of any modes to be enabled during expected visits and may be operative to either automatically update certain mode settings or automatically suggest certain mode setting updates to a system user based on that analysis. This may add an additional layer of convenience to a system user with respect to the handling of visitors at environment by platform .

Platform may be operative to detect any suitable type of behavior of a visitor in addition to or as an alternative to merely the presence identification and or intent of the visitor and platform may be operative to analyze such detected visitor behavior for increasing the effectiveness of platform to secure environment and or to handle a visitor. For example certain detected behavior of a visitor may be analyzed and deemed suspicious in response to which one or more security features of platform may be leveraged for increasing the security of environment . Additionally or alternatively certain detected behavior of a visitor may be analyzed and deemed informative for use in strengthening any suitable inferences that may be made by any suitable component s of platform . Any suitable behavior of a visitor at environment including any visitor interaction with structure or with any other suitable portion of environment may be detected by any suitable portion of platform including any sensing component s of doorbell entry detector doorknob and or any other suitable smart device of environment .

Certain visitor behavior may be detected as suspicious and leveraged to increase the security of environment in one or more ways. For example platform may be operative to detect if when a visitor attempts to open a door or other entry point to a portion of environment before platform has granted that visitor access to such an entry point in response to which platform may be operative to leverage the detection of such suspicious visitor behavior to adjust certain security mechanisms of environment . For example one or more sensing components of doorbell e.g. a camera or of entry detector at door may be operative to detect when a visitor touches doorknob and or otherwise attempts to gain access to structure through a closed door . As another example as shown in smart doorknob may include one or more sensing components which may include any suitable sensing components similar to those described above with respect to sensing components and which may be operative to detect when a visitor twists grabs pulls or at least touches doorknob and or otherwise attempts to gain access through door . For example one or more of sensing components may be positioned within a handle portion of doorknob that may be accessible to a visitor beyond an external side of door where an internal side of door may face an interior of structure when door is closed for preventing entry of the visitor into structure and at least one sensing component may be operative to detect visitor touching rotation pulling grabbing or any other suitable visitor interaction with doorknob handle or with any other suitable portion of doorknob . For example one doorknob sensing component may include an accelerometer or any other suitable motion sensing component for detecting certain visitor interaction with doorknob . Additionally or alternatively a doorknob sensing component may include a biometric sensing component such as a fingerprint detector that may be operative to detect certain specific identification information of a visitor interacting with doorknob e.g. for use in determining visitor trust and or unlocking doorknob . Any other suitable visitor behavior may be detected and deemed suspicious by platform for initiating enhanced security features other than visitor interaction with doorknob prior to being granted access through closed door . For example platform may be operative to analyze detected information e.g. at steps to deem any one of the following or any combination of the following visitor interactions to be suspicious any suitable unauthorized interaction with doorknob e.g. physically touching grabbing twisting pulling etc. any suitable unauthorized interaction with structure e.g. visitor physically knocking on door or opening a mail slot or other feature of door one or more failed attempts by the visitor to supply a correct access code or other suitable authentication for entry through closed door interaction with user interface button of doorbell in an unauthorized manner e.g. a visitor pressing button when button is presented as disabled any inappropriate visitor interaction with one or more components of a smart device e.g. a visitor blocking a camera sensing component of doorbell any visitor behavior that prevents or inhibits visitor identification e.g. a visitor detected to be wearing a mask and the like.

In response to platform detecting a visitor interacting with doorknob with doorbell with any other smart device associated with door and or with any suitable portion of closed door itself in any particular manner that may be deemed suspicious or otherwise for example prior to platform or an authorized user thereof granting the visitor access through door platform may be operative to adjust a functionality of environment to increase the security thereof. For example a first or additional lock e.g. a lock of doorknob may be enabled by platform to more securely retain door in its closed position. As another example an alarm or any other suitable message may be conveyed by platform to i the visitor e.g. by doorbell for instructing the visitor to stop attempting to open door but rather interact only with doorbell and or ii to a system user e.g. by personal device for alerting the user of the detected suspicious behavior and or iii to an appropriate trusted third party e.g. law enforcement for raising a threat level of environment . As another example platform may be operative to increase the sensing functionality of one or more smart devices of environment in response to detecting suspicious visitor behavior such as by increasing the sampling rate of a sensing component by increasing or varying the sensing area covered by a sensing component by turning on one or more additional sensing components e.g. biometric fingerprint scanner of doorknob etc. that may have previously been turned off for power conservancy etc. to increase the security of environment e.g. by enhancing the ability of environment to monitor any additional potential visitor activity or identify the visitor in any suitable way .

Certain visitor behavior may be detected as informative and leveraged for use in strengthening any suitable inferences that may be made by any suitable component s of platform . For example platform may be operative to detect when a visitor is granted access through door or is not granted access through door and may update any platform information based on that treatment of the visitor and any other interaction that visitor had with environment . For example if a detected visitor e.g. as detected at one or more iterations of step is granted authorized access through door e.g. through any suitable workings of platform such as a system user interacting with platform for authorizing the opening of door for that visitor or that visitor successfully providing an authorized access code for electronically opening door any suitable visitor information gathered about that visitor e.g. pictures fingerprints voice samples identification card information visitor interaction with doorbell or doorknob or any other portion of environment prior to the visitor s authorized access etc. may then be leveraged in any suitable way by platform for associating that visitor information with a trusted entity of environment . On the other hand if a detected visitor is not granted authorized access through door e.g. through any suitable workings of platform such as a system user interacting with platform for forbidding the opening of door for that visitor or that visitor unsuccessfully providing an authorized access code for electronically opening door any suitable visitor information gathered about that visitor e.g. pictures fingerprints voice samples identification card information visitor interaction with doorbell or doorknob or any other portion of environment prior to the visitor s access being declined etc. may then be leveraged in any suitable way by platform for associating that visitor information with an untrusted entity of environment . An association of detected visitor information with determined visitor accessibility treatment for a given visitor interaction with environment may be leveraged by platform as data for informing the processing analysis of any suitable operation or setting or inference or rule of platform including any future attempt to detect the identity of a visitor and or the level of trust to be afforded to such a visitor. Therefore if a particular visitor gains authorized access through door then any or all visitor information detected by doorbell or otherwise by environment about the identification of that visitor and or its interaction with environment may be leveraged in the future for any suitable purpose by platform such as for increasing the efficiency with which platform may handle a later visit by that particular visitor at environment or any other environment of platform e.g. by using that data for more quickly identifying the visitor or for more reliably classifying the visitor as a trusted or untrusted visitor for use in determining how platform may handle that later visit . For example if analysis e.g. at step of detected visitor information is not able to reveal the specific identity of a detected visitor currently at environment but such analysis is able to reveal that the detected visitor was previously granted access to environment five days earlier e.g. by leveraging previously collected visitor information during such analysis platform may be operative to classify the detected visitor as a trusted entity and may utilize that classification for enhancing the current handling of that visitor e.g. by sharing that trusted classification and any other suitable information such as the fact that the same visitor was granted access five days ago with a system user of environment during the current visitor handling e.g. at step . Similarly if analysis e.g. at step of detected visitor information is not able to reveal the specific identity of a detected visitor currently at environment but such analysis is able to reveal that the detected visitor was previously denied access to environment five days earlier e.g. by leveraging previously collected visitor information during such analysis platform may be operative to classify the detected visitor as an untrusted entity and may utilize that classification for enhancing the current handling of that visitor e.g. by sharing that untrusted classification and any other suitable information such as the fact that the same visitor was denied access five days ago with a system user of environment during the current visitor handling e.g. at step or by more securely locking door e.g. at step .

Platform may be operative to leverage data collected by one or more various other smart environments and or entities and or other suitable data sources of platform for increasing the security of a particular environment during a visitor interaction at environment and or for enhancing the efficiency convenience of how that visitor interaction is handled at environment . For example data collected by smart environments or other entities that are within a suitable threshold distance of environment may be leveraged by platform for adjusting the functionality of smart devices of environment and or analyzing data associated with smart environment . The threshold distance defining the relationship between such remote data collection sources and environment may vary based on the purpose of leveraging the data from such remote data sources.

Data indicative of a particular visitor being detected by one or more smart environments other than environment or by one or more third party entities or by any other detection source of platform may be leveraged by platform for affecting the operation of smart environment with respect to handling the potential arrival of that particular visitor at environment . For example if a particular visitor is detected at a first location LA by a first environment of platform e.g. by one or more smart devices of that environment at a first time A and platform determines through any suitable processing analysis that the detected visitor is of interest for any suitable reason then platform may leverage any suitable information about that detected visitor for any suitable use at other environments or entities of platform such as at one or more entities associated with environment location LA and or at smart environment at location LB and smart environment at location LC and smart environment at location LU each of which may be within a particular distance DD of detecting environment . Platform may be operative to determine that a particular visitor of interest has been detected at any suitable location not only from visitor information detected at a smart environment of platform e.g. at one or more of environments etc. but also from visitor information detected by any suitable entity of platform whether or not that entity is local to a smart environment e.g. by a personal device of user UR or Wife remote from environment or by a device of any agent of any entity or by any other device capable of sensing visitor information at any particular location and sharing such detected visitor information with any suitable component of platform . As mentioned above a visitor that may be detected by platform may be any suitable entity that can be identified in any suitable way by one or more sensing components or data sources of platform . Such a detectable visitor may be a human e.g. a deliveryman or delivery woman of firefighter or security guard or any other suitable human agent of an entity of platform a system user occupant associated with a smart environment a friend neighbor acquaintance of a system user a solicitor a stranger would be thieves etc. a vehicle of such a human e.g. a car of a system user or delivery truck of a deliverer a drone e.g. a delivery drone or a security drone or any other unmanned vehicle or robot that may carry out certain tasks an animal e.g. a pet or stray animal or wild animal that may be detected via facial recognition or any other suitable detection methods such as RFID tag detection etc. or any other property or entity that may be detectable in any suitable manner e.g. a briefcase that may include an RFID tag or any other suitable detectable identity .

As a particular example if a particular visitor detected at environment is determined to be a suspected criminal e.g. by detecting that visitor interact suspiciously with environment or by comparing visitor information detected by environment with a wanted persons database of law enforcement entity platform may be operative to increase the security of neighboring environments and in any suitable way. For example in response to detecting a suspected criminal at neighboring environment platform may inform law enforcement entity and or may adjust the functionality of one or more smart devices of environment by activating outdoor lighting of environment locking all entry points to environment increasing the sensing capabilities of certain sensing components of environment e.g. components of doorbell prioritizing the use of that suspected criminal s identification information when attempting to identify a detected visitor at environment e.g. at steps warning users occupants of environment to be extra cautions on the look out for that suspected criminal e.g. by communicating identification information of that suspect e.g. a photo last known whereabouts etc. via smart devices of environment to its users enabling a particular mode for environment e.g. a criminal high alert mode and the like.

Other types of detected visitors may be determined to be of interest by platform for various other reasons than for being a suspected criminal and such detection may be leveraged by platform for affecting the operation of neighboring environments accordingly in respective various ways. For example based on the detection of a missing child or a missing pet or a missing briefcase at a first location nearby environment e.g. within distance DD of environment platform may inform law enforcement entity and or may adjust the functionality of one or more smart devices of environment for increasing the likelihood that such a visitor of interest may be detected at environment e.g. turn on outdoor lights increase sensing functionality of one or more smart devices at environment at least with respect to detecting the visitor of interest etc. . As a particular example in in the event Child goes missing from environment that event may be reported to system or any other component s of platform distinct from environment e.g. by Husband of environment when he realizes the child is missing from environment or automatically by one or more smart devices of environment that may automatically detect when the child is no longer an occupant of environment or otherwise when Child moves outside of geo fence such that certain modes or operations or functionalities of various other smart environments of platform within a particular distance of environment e.g. environments in the neighborhood may be adjusted to increase the ability of platform to safely locate the missing child. As another particular example in the event a dog goes missing from one home environment platform can leverage data indicative of that event such that the network connected smart devices of other home environments in the neighborhood can be tuned to detect motions that indicate the presence of a dog. In this example if a dog is detected by an outdoor network connected smart device e.g. doorbell of a home environment that does not typically detect dogs then a message can be sent therefrom to the home environment of the missing dog indicating that a stray dog was detected and providing the location of the detection. Further in some examples any suitable specific identification information may be detected for a lost entity such as pet when any suitable identification component is coupled thereto. For example an RFID tag may be provided on the dog s collar and a network connected smart device of other home environments in the neighborhood may locate the dog by reading the RFID tag and sharing the location of the dog upon request e.g. automatically by platform when a located entity is known to be missing or otherwise of interest by platform e.g. by system or the environment that is missing the entity . RFID tags may be placed on other property too such as bicycles such that other property may be located in a similar manner.

As another example based on the detection of a deliverer at a first location nearby environment platform may inform deliverer entity business that may track such a deliverer and or may adjust the functionality of one or more smart devices of environment for handling a potential arrival of that deliverer e.g. by turning off a sprinkler system of environment alerting a system user of environment that a deliverer is nearby and may be attempting the delivery of a package to environment shortly etc. . As yet another example based on the detection of a solicitor at a first location nearby environment platform may inform academic institution that may track such solicitors and or may adjust the functionality of one or more smart devices of environment for preventing that solicitor from bothering any occupants of environment e.g. by preventing access of the solicitor through gated entry enabling a do not disturb mode for environment for a period of time within which platform may estimate the solicitor may arrive at environment etc. . Therefore detection of a particular type of visitor at a particular location within a particular distance of smart environment may be leveraged by platform to automatically pre emptively prepare smart environment for handling that visitor if it were to arrive at environment e.g. in accordance with any settings or preferences of that particular environment e.g. based on the system preferences of a user of environment to interact or not interact with a solicitor .

Platform may be operative to monitor detected visitor identification data from all available data sources over time for tracking the path traveled by particular visitors and or predicting a future path of such visitors. Platform may leverage such a tracked path of travel for dynamically updating the operation of a certain smart environment based on the calculated likelihood that the tracked path of travel will align with the location of that smart environment. Additionally or alternatively platform may leverage data about such a tracked path of travel for sharing with or selling to interested entities such as law enforcement agencies e.g. for tracked paths of suspected criminals or missing persons animal control agencies e.g. for tracked paths of certain animals that may be tagged or otherwise detectable by sensing components of platform academic institution entities e.g. for tracked paths of certain solicitors such as during election cycles for studying certain trends delivery business entities e.g. for tracked paths of deliverers emergency response entities e.g. for tracked paths of emergency risks and or emergency responders and the like. This may enable platform to leverage a wide net of visitor sensing components e.g. sensing components of smart doorbells that may be provided at effective locations e.g. at various smart environment entry points such as at door and or gated entry etc. at various environments e.g. environments etc. that may be spread out across various geographical locations across a neighborhood city state country or globe for tracking various types of visitor entities and or specific visitor entities not only to increase the security and efficiency of those environments but also to increase the effectiveness of various third party entities e.g. entities and paradigms e.g. paradigms of platform that may have a specific interest in such detected visitors.

Platform may be operative to analyze a tracked path of a visitor for making inferences regarding the likelihood of a predicted future path for that visitor and to adjust functionalities of a smart environment based on such tracking and predicting. For example in response to detecting a suspected criminal at environment at a first location LA at a first time platform may inform law enforcement entity of the specifics of that detection and or may adjust the functionality of one or more environments within a certain distance DD of location LA such as environment at location LB and environment at location LC and environment at location LU e.g. by increasing a security level of one or more smart devices of environment but not remote environments or that may be beyond distance DD of detecting location LA. However if the next time that same suspected criminal is detected by platform is at environment at location LC at a second time then platform may be operative to determine that the tracked path of the suspected criminal e.g. the direction of tracked path TPA is moving farther away from location LU of environment and in response to that determination platform may be operative to once again adjust the functionality of environment but this time by reverting the functionality back to its previous settings e.g. by reducing a security level of one or more smart devices of environment . Alternatively however if the next time that same suspected criminal is detected by platform is at environment at location LB at a second time then platform may be operative to determine that the tracked path of the suspected criminal e.g. the direction of tracked path TPB is moving closer towards location LU of environment and in response to that determination platform may be operative to once again adjust the functionality of environment but this time by increasing a security level of one or more smart devices of environment to an even higher level or by putting environment on even higher alert as analysis by platform of the tracked path of the suspected criminal from location LA to location LB may predict a predicted future path of that criminal e.g. the direction of predicted path PTPB that may be determined to pose an increased likelihood that the criminal may arrive at location LU of environment . Similarly analysis of a tracked path of a deliverer visitor e.g. deliverer DL may enable platform to dynamically adjust a predicted potential deliverer arrival time at environment and utilize that prediction to update modes or settings of environment for preparing environment and or its users accordingly. Moreover such tracking and prediction of a deliverer by platform may be shared with a delivery entity business for providing trusted impartial tracking data of its deliverer.

Platform may be operative to detect and track the path of a neighborhood security guard or any other suitable entity amongst various smart environments that the guard may be tasked with monitoring. As described above with respect to tracking a deliverer DL platform may be operative to track a security guard or any other suitable entity as it visits various smart environments. For example doorbell or any other suitable smart device of smart environment that may be accessible to a security guard as it inspects the security of environment may be leveraged for enabling accurate location and time tracking of such a security guard by detecting and logging data at each inspected environment e.g. by enabling the guard to check in at environment prior to inspecting environment and check out from environment after inspecting environment . For example when a security guard is initially detected at environment e.g. via any suitable sensing component of doorbell or of any other suitable smart device of environment the identity of that guard is authenticated and the time of that detection is collected by platform . The security guard may guarantee such detection by affirmatively using a guard identification card at doorbell when initially arriving at environment . Then environment may be operative to activate or otherwise utilize one or more additional sensing components of environment for tracking any action of the guard at environment e.g. for detecting the movements of the guard about certain portions of environment for confirming that the guard actually carried out certain security duties e.g. for confirming the guard investigated each applicable area of environment over a sufficient length of time . Then when finished inspecting the security of environment the security guard may be enabled to check out from environment by once again authenticating its identification at doorbell or elsewhere at environment before leaving environment .

Therefore rather than relying on inspection information generated and reported by a security guard itself during or after an inspection of an environment or multiple environments within a neighborhood as a neighborhood watch guard e.g. via data entered into a personal device of the guard which may be similar to delivery device of deliverer DL system may be operative to generate and report its own tracking data that may be compared to and or relied on by a security agency entity e.g. a security business instead of any data generated by the guard as data generated by system e.g. as may be generated by doorbell and or other smart devices of environment may be trustworthy as an impartial data source e.g. as compared to a guard who may enter incorrect data to inflate his efficiency and or hide his inefficiencies and or forget to enter data at all . By leveraging its visitor identity and activity sensing capabilities at one or more smart environments platform may be operative to effectively confirm the appearance and activity of any suitable entity not only at a single particular environment but also to track such appearance and activity at multiple other environments for ensuring that the entity fulfills its particular obligations or for at least providing some oversight for motivating the same. While certain above examples may describe multiple smart environments in the context of distinct lots of neighboring properties e.g. various distinct smart home environments on different plots of land within the same neighborhood or ZIP code various other arrangements of neighboring environments may be operative to enable the various concepts of this disclosure such as various smart environments being associated with various residential apartment units in the same condominium building structure or in various condominium building structures or with various commercial office suites in the same commercial office building structure or in various commercial office building structures.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Platform may be operative to enable at least partial or limited access to at least certain portions of smart environment by any suitable entity whether or not that entity is known by platform e.g. known by any smart environment or service entity or processing paradigm or extrinsic information or otherwise e.g. at system . Such access may be provided to any particular entity as an invitee by generating a smart invitation that may be associated with a particular type of access to a smart environment. While process of has previously been described with respect to placing an order for delivery of content in a package to a recipient at a location where unique package identification information may be generated based on one or more attributes of the order and on smart environment data associated with the order and where such unique package identification information may be integrated into data of a label ID that may be affixed to the package and later leveraged by a deliverer and or the smart environment for facilitating the delivery of that package by the deliverer to the environment one or more steps of process may be utilized with respect to inviting an invitee e.g. a person or other suitable entity to be a trusted visitor at a smart environment where unique invitation identification information may be generated based on one or more attributes of the invitation e.g. invitation time invitee etc. and or smart environment data associated with the smart environment and where such unique invitation identification information may be integrated into data of a smart invitation e.g. label ID that may be leveraged by the invitee and or the smart environment for facilitating the accessibility of that smart environment by the invitee. While the following may describe the generation and use of a smart invitation in the context of an invitee s access to a social gathering at a smart environment it is to be understood that such a smart invitation concept may be leveraged for any suitable situation including the above described package delivery context e.g. a Federal Express package delivery or a local restaurant food delivery .

When a system user of environment e.g. a user with management authority to grant access to environment wishes to enable access to environment by a visitor entity at a future time the user may be enabled by platform to define one or more parameters or rules or settings for environment that may be satisfied by a visitor entity upon arrival at environment e.g. via doorbell and or any other suitable smart device for gaining access to environment e.g. through gated entry into environment generally or through door into structure of environment . In some embodiments as described above a system user may define a mode setting that may instruct platform to adjust a functionality of a smart device of environment in conjunction with conveying a particular message if a particular visitor is detected at environment at a particular time such as by conveying the message Hi Uncle Nick I am sorry I am running late I will be home in 10 minutes please go inside and make yourself comfortable with doorbell while also temporarily unlocking door with doorknob for enabling access by that particular detected visitor to structure through door . This setting may be defined by the system user interacting with platform in any suitable way. For example the system user may interact with any suitable user interface of any suitable environment smart device or user personal device for conveying to platform the identity of the particular visitor to be granted access along with any suitable conditions for that access besides that visitor being detected at environment e.g. accessibility to be limited to only a portion of environment accessibility to be granted only if the visitor is detected during a certain time e.g. between 2 00 pm and 5 00 pm on Monday etc. . In some embodiments platform may only require that the system user convey the name or even a nickname e.g. Uncle Nick of the particular visitor as platform may already have access to at least some identification record data for an entity with that name that may have been previously associated with environment in any suitable way e.g. as a previously detected visitor at environment or as a social connection to the system user on a social network with photographs or other identification made available to platform e.g. at social paradigm etc. such that platform may be automatically enabled to adequately confirm the identity of that named particular visitor when its presence may be detected at environment for carrying out the accessibility setting made by the system user.

In other embodiments platform may not be pre equipped to detect the identity of a particular visitor at environment for association with a particular accessibility setting being made by the system user for that particular visitor. Instead some identification information for the particular visitor may need to be provided to platform e.g. by the system user such that platform may leverage that identification information for later confirming the presence of the particular visitor at environment for carrying out the accessibility setting made by the system user. For example the system user may communicate unique identifying feature data of the visitor to platform for later use in identifying the presence of that visitor at environment . In such embodiments such unique identifying feature data may include a photograph of the visitor s face or any other visually identifiable feature a voice sample of the visitor a fingerprint of the visitor e.g. if the visitor is a human an RFID code e.g. a unique ID code that may be associated with the visitor or the like which may be sensed by environment if that visitor arrives at environment . In such embodiments the visitor may not be aware of the accessibility setting enabled by environment prior to the visitor being granted such access but instead environment may be operative to detect the visitor identification information needed by platform to authenticate the visitor s identity solely due to the visitor s presence at environment e.g. due to the visitor being within a sensing range of a sensing component of doorbell .

In other embodiments not only may platform not be pre equipped to detect the identity of a particular visitor at environment for association with a particular accessibility setting being made by a system user for that particular visitor but also the system user may not be able to communicate unique identifying feature data of the visitor to platform for later use in identifying the presence of that visitor at environment e.g. the system user may not have access to a proper photograph of the visitor that may be made available to platform for enabling detection of that visitor at environment . In such embodiments or otherwise unique invitation identification information may be generated based on a system user s decision to generate a smart invitation for an invitee visitor with respect to environment and such unique invitation identification information may be shared with both the invitee visitor and platform for later use in identifying the presence of that invitee visitor at environment to authorize carrying out an accessibility setting made by the system user for that invitee visitor to environment . Such unique invitation identification information may be made available to both platform and the invitee visitor without specific physical identifying feature data of the invitee being known by the system user e.g. without the system user having access to a photograph or RFID code or other unique identifying feature of the invitee which may increase the security and or privacy of the invitee. Instead the unique invitation identification information generated and provided to platform and the invitee visitor may be uniquely created for a particular smart invitation that might be configured to be useful one time only. While the following may describe the generation and use of such a smart invitation and unique invitation identification information in the context of an invitee visitor s access to a social gathering at a smart environment it is to be understood that such a smart invitation concept may be leveraged for any suitable situation including the above described package delivery context e.g. a Federal Express package delivery or a local restaurant food delivery . For example such unique invitation identification information of such a smart invitation may be similar to the unique package identification information of label ID described above with respect to a package delivery process of whereby such an invitee visitor may be the facilitator e.g. a deliverer entity or fulfillment entity .

Next at step process may include sharing the acquired unique invitation identification information with an invitee e.g. as at least a portion of a smart invitation . For example once particular unique invitation identification information has been generated or otherwise acquired e.g. at step such unique invitation identification information may be shared by the system user with a particular invitee with which the system user may wish to associate a particular accessibility setting at environment . The system user may create a smart invitation including the unique invitation identification information and may communicate the smart invitation to the invitee using any suitable communication mechanism. If the unique invitation identification information is a password that may be manually entered by an invitee at environment the system user may simply call a human invitee on the telephone and orally share the password with the invitee as part of a smart invitation e.g. your password is XSG27HT along with any other suitable information that may help the invitee use the password such as the reason for the password e.g. Use your password to access my birthday party the address of environment e.g. Present your password to the smart doorbell adjacent the front door at 123 Main Street the time at which the invitee should use the password e.g. anytime between 7 00 pm and 11 00 pm this Saturday and or any special or additional instructions e.g. You must wear red to be granted access as we will be celebrating Valentine s Day . Similarly the user may physically mail or e mail a written message conveying similar information as a smart invitation to the invitee. As another example if the unique invitation identification information is a code that may be presented by an invitee for scanning at environment the system user may physically mail a print out of the code or e mail or otherwise communicate a digital copy of the code e.g. that may be printed by the invitee for use or presented in its digital form by the invitee for use along with any other suitable information descriptive of the intended use of the code to the invitee as a smart invitation. The unique invitation identification information for a particular smart invitation may be provided in a physical tag such as an RFID tag or NFC element that may be mailed to the invitee or otherwise made accessible to the invitee for use at environment . In certain embodiments if platform generates the unique invitation identification information on behalf of the system user or if platform is provided with the unique invitation identification information by the user or any other entity platform may be operative to generate a complete smart invitation for the system user and communicate that smart invitation to an invitee on behalf of the system user for making the entire process easier for the system user. In such embodiments for example the system user may simply have to communicate to platform a communication address for the invitee e.g. an e mail address of the invitee and any other suitable information that the user may wish to include in the smart invitation e.g. the time of the party dress code location of environment at which the party may be held etc. and platform may be operative to automatically generate and transmit to the invitee a smart invitation that may include not only the unique invitation identification information but also the other information describing the invitation. A web browser or a mobile application may be operative to provide such a service to a system user for generating unique invitation identification information and or communicating to a user designated invitee particular unique invitation identification information in combination with any additional user designated invitation information as a smart invitation where such a service may be provided by platform e.g. system or a third party entity e.g. an online invitation e card company business . As yet another example a third party order facilitator entity may generate unique invitation identification information when taking an order for a package from the system user e.g. as a confirmation code for that order where the facilitator entity may share such unique invitation identification information with the system user and or directly with platform .

Process may also include defining a mode setting at step based on the unique invitation identification information acquired at step . Before during or after sharing particular unique invitation identification information with a particular invitee at step that particular unique invitation identification information may also be provided to platform e.g. at step for use in defining any suitable mode setting that may instruct platform how to handle detection of that particular unique invitation identification information by environment e.g. when presented by the particular invitee at a sensing component of doorbell or any other suitable smart device of environment . Platform may be operative to enable a system user to interact with platform in any suitable manner for at least partially defining such a mode setting e.g. via a personal device or any suitable smart device of environment . Any environment that the system user may have authorization to control may be associated with such a mode setting and any suitable platform action s by any suitable component s of platform may be selectively associated with that environment and the particular unique invitation identification information in such a defined mode setting whereby platform may be operative to carry out such action s when the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment . Such a platform action may include enabling access to a portion of environment e.g. via door by controlling smart doorknob conveying a particular message at an entryway of environment where the particular unique invitation identification information may be detected e.g. via an output component of doorbell to the invitee such as Welcome to the party head through this door and straight back through the kitchen to the back patio conveying a particular message to the system user e.g. via user device or any suitable smart device local to the user such as Invitee John Doe has just arrived and is being let in to the party conveying a particular message to a social network e.g. via social paradigm such as Invitee John Doe arrived at System User s party at 9 08 pm and or any other possible platform action available to platform . As one particular example a message to be conveyed to a visitor as a platform action of a mode setting may be at least partially defined by dynamic information such as the current location of the system user within environment such that a particular message conveyed to the visitor at an entryway of environment e.g. via doorbell may be Welcome to the party head through this door and straight back through the kitchen to the back patio to find your party host if the system user is currently located on the back patio at the time the platform action is to be carried out e.g. as may be determined by platform through any suitable tracking capabilities as may be described herein or may be Welcome to the party head through this door and up the master stair case to the library to find your party host if the system user is currently located in the library at the time the platform action is to be carried out. Such a platform action for conveying a message to a visitor may be communicated by platform via any suitable smart device e.g. via an output component and or of doorbell or to a personal device of the visitor e.g. via a communications component of doorbell as may be sensed by a smart device of environment or otherwise determined by platform .

Along with one or more platform actions one or more conditions may also be selectively associated with a particular unique invitation identification information in such a defined mode setting whereby platform may be operative to carry out the one or more associated platform actions when the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment while any associated conditions are satisfied. As one example such a condition may include a particular time frame during which the mode setting may be active e.g. 7 00 pm to 11 00 pm such that if the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment before 7 00 pm or after 11 00 pm then the one or more associated platform actions of that mode setting may not be carried out by platform . As another example such a condition may include a particular maximum threshold occupancy of environment under which the mode setting may be active e.g. 75 people such that if the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment while 75 or more people are currently detected within environment then the one or more associated platform actions of that mode setting may not be carried out by platform . As another example such a condition may include general visitor identification information that must be satisfied for the mode setting to be active e.g. detected visitor wearing red such that if the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment when presented by a visitor that is not wearing any red clothing e.g. as may be detectable by a camera sensing component of doorbell then the one or more associated platform actions of that mode setting may not be carried out by platform e.g. for strictly enforcing a dress code requirement for a Valentine s Day party . As yet another example such a condition may include particular visitor identification information that must be satisfied for the mode setting to be active e.g. detected visitor satisfies a particular facial detection operation such that if the particular unique invitation identification information of that mode setting is detected at environment when presented by a visitor whose face does not successfully match a particular facial detection operation e.g. as may be detectable by a camera sensing component of doorbell in combination with a facial recognition process that may compare detected visitor facial data with a photograph of the intended invitee that may be provided to platform e.g. by the system user or otherwise accessible to platform e.g. via querying pictures of a social network database in conjunction with a name associated with the invitation etc. for defining such a condition of the defined mode setting then the one or more associated platform actions of that mode setting may not be carried out by platform e.g. for ensuring that the invitee visitor to whom the smart invitation was sent is the actual visitor presenting the particular visitor identification information at environment .

Multiple mode settings may be associated with a single event and each mode setting may be edited independently and or certain characteristics e.g. platform actions and or conditions of multiple mode settings may be edited simultaneously. For example each guest invited to a particular event e.g. a Valentine s day party at a system user s environment may receive its own smart invitation that may be associated with its own particular mode setting defined at platform . However platform may be operative to enable a system user to edit a certain condition of all such mode settings for that particular event at the same time e.g. through a single instruction provided to platform . For example the system user may decide that a time frame condition for each mode setting defined for each smart invitation for an event should be increased from 4 hours to 6 hours e.g. instead of from 7 00 pm to 11 00 pm now each smart invitation to that event should be active from 7 00 pm to 1 00 am . Alternatively different mode settings for different smart invitations for the same event may be edited independently. For example the system user may edit a general visitor identification information condition of the mode setting associated with a particular smart invitation to a particular user e.g. to not require that the specific invitee of that invitation be wearing red to be granted access . If any characteristic of any mode setting of a smart invitation has been edited after the smart invitation has been shared with an invitee platform may be operative to automatically send an updated invitation to that invitee alerting the invitee of the change made to its invitation e.g. a simple e mail or text message alerting the invitee that a condition or other characteristic of the invitation has changed which may or may not include generating and sharing new particular unique invitation identification information to be associated with that invitation as the initially acquired and shared unique invitation identification information that is also associated with a mode setting need not change when a condition of that mode setting is later edited.

Process may also include receiving invitation identification data that includes the unique invitation identification information from a smart environment as detected by a smart device of the smart environment at step and then analyzing the unique invitation identification information of the received invitation identification data from the smart environment to identify the defined mode setting associated with that smart environment at step . Once a mode setting has been defined for a particular unique invitation identification information with smart environment and one or more associated platform tasks and any suitable conditions e.g. at step platform may be operative to analyze that particular unique invitation identification information when detected at that smart environment using any suitable sensing component s of smart environment . In response to detecting that particular unique invitation identification information of the defined mode setting at environment platform may be operative to analyze that detected unique invitation identification information in combination with any appropriate defined mode setting s of that unique invitation identification information for example to confirm that any suitable conditions of that defined mode setting are also satisfied e.g. by analyzing any suitable data available to platform e.g. via one or more sensing components of one or more smart devices at environment and or any additional data otherwise accessible to a computing system of platform e.g. system or a computing system local to environment . In some embodiments platform may be operative to communicate with the visitor e.g. via doorbell and or adjust sensing capabilities of environment e.g. sensing components of doorbell in any suitable manner as described herein for enabling platform to properly determine whether or not a condition has been satisfied e.g. by conveying a message to the visitor to present your invitation to the scanner just above the doorbell button or please align your uncovered face with the camera just above the doorbell button etc. . If all such conditions are confirmed to be satisfied then platform may be operative to carry out any platform tasks of that defined mode setting. For example process may also include carrying out at least one platform action of a mode setting identified as associated with the detected unique invitation identification information and the smart environment at step . At any point after the mode setting has been defined e.g. at step but before the particular unique invitation identification information of the defined mode setting has been detected at environment e.g. at step platform may be operative to enable any appropriate system user to edit one or more characteristics of the defined mode setting e.g. any associated platform tasks and or any associated conditions and or even the associated smart environment that is to detect the particular unique invitation identification information of the defined mode setting . Therefore at any point after the smart invitation has been shared by the user with the invitee e.g. at step but before the smart invitation has been used at a smart environment of the user e.g. at step the functionality of the smart invitation may be altered in any suitable way s e.g. at step .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

In some embodiments platform may be operative to enable any suitable entity to edit or define certain characteristics of such a defined mode setting where that entity may be the invitee e.g. as may gain access to editing capabilities on platform through use of the smart invitation e.g. in an online user interface provided by platform or any other suitable entity that may be enabled by the system user or platform and where that entity may or may not be any user of any component of platform let alone the system user that may have initiated the smart invitation process and that may have management control of the associated smart environment. For example if a particular platform task associated with the mode setting is a message to be conveyed to the system user when the smart invitation is used at smart environment the invitee may be enabled to at least partially define what that message might be. As just one example such a platform task may be to communicate a particular message throughout every portion of environment that is occupied at the time when the smart invitation is used e.g. as a party wide announcement letting all the current party attendees know that the invitee associated with the smart invitation has just arrived . Therefore the invitee may be enabled to upload an audio recording to platform e.g. via an invitee visitor device to system in advance of the use of the smart invitation at environment such that platform may be operative to access and playback that audio recording throughout environment e.g. via audio output components of each smart device within environment when the invitee uses the smart invitation to access the party e.g. audio recording may be the invitee s catch phrase or favorite song or any other suitable information . Alternatively platform may enable the invitee to provide such a message to platform at the same time as when the invitee presents the smart invitation to smart environment . For example once a smart invitation has been presented by the invitee visitor and detected by environment platform e.g. via doorbell may prompt the invitee visitor to convey certain information to platform for use as the invitee enters environment e.g. a request for the invitee to state the name by which it should be introduced to the party e.g. John the Party Animal Doe is here and or the name of an intro song via microphone of doorbell or providing multiple options for an intro song to the visitor from which the visitor may select one via a touch screen user interface of doorbell where such options may be at least partially defined by any suitable data available to platform such as songs queued in a party playlist being played back at environment e.g. by a smart device of environment . Any suitable options determined in any suitable manner may be presented to the visitor for selection in response to which one or more suitable platform actions may be carried out such as options for music to be played options for an interactive game being played and the like.

In some embodiments a platform action of a mode setting of a smart invitation may require that platform only enable accessibility to environment by a single human in response to detection of that smart environment e.g. to prevent piggybacking such that each invitation may only be used by a single visitor . For example in response to detecting a smart invitation at doorbell of door a mode setting associated with that invitation may instruct platform to carry out a platform action that may unlock doorknob for enabling access through door while also enabling and or otherwise monitoring data from a camera or motion sensor or any other suitable sensing component functionally positioned at door for detecting movement through door e.g. a sensing component of doorbell or a sensing component of doorknob such that an alarm may be triggered if more than one person is detected passing through door in response to unlocking door for that detected invitation. Additionally or alternatively a platform action of a mode setting of a smart invitation may require that platform only enable accessibility to environment one time only in response to detection of that smart environment e.g. to prevent a particular invitation from being used more than once thereby preventing re admittance to an event and or preventing a smart invitation from being passed on to other entities for unauthorized use of a single invitation . For example in response to detecting a particular smart invitation at environment and carrying out any associated platform actions e.g. enabling accessibility to environment through door a condition of the mode setting for that invitation may instruct platform to prevent such platform actions from being carried out a second time for that invitation although there are various other suitable ways for defining a mode setting or otherwise configuring platform to carry out a certain platform action no more than a certain amount of times e.g. once per detection of a particular smart invitation.

After a system user has shared a smart invitation with an invitee and an associated mode setting has been defined with platform e.g. at steps the later handling of the smart invitation may occur transparent to the user e.g. at steps . That is a smart invitation with unique invitation identification information may be presented by an invitee visitor at environment detected and analyzed by platform and any suitable actions handled automatically by platform based on an associated defined mode setting without any further system user interaction. This may enable a system user to focus on enjoying the party without having to worry about whether or not a new guest is at door e.g. can the host hear the door bell ringing over the noise of the party and if such a guest needs to be let in e.g. does the host need to greet the guest and tell it where to go . Instead the host system user can enjoy the party knowing that platform has been enabled to automatically and securely and conveniently interact with any new guests that may arrive at environment .

This may be particularly useful for shared environments such as apartment buildings where a system user may not be able to leave door unlocked during an event like a system user of a suburban home might feel more comfortable doing. For example structure may be an urban apartment building where door may be a front door to a lobby that may be shared by each individual apartment resident. In such embodiments mode settings of a smart invitation presented at doorbell of door may enable door e.g. via doorknob to be accessible for 10 seconds after detection of the smart invitation and may convey a message to the visitor e.g. Please take the elevator to the 6floor then take a left as you exit the elevator and present your invitation to the doorbell at the front door of Apartment 6A whereby the same invitation may then be presented to and detected by a second smart device of environment for executing additional operations of the mode settings associated with that smart invitation e.g. for providing access to the actual apartment of the system user . Certain conditions of a mode setting associated with a particular smart invitation may be analyzed for satisfaction at a particular one of multiple presentation points of the smart invitation. For example mere detection of the unique invitation identification information of an invitation at a first smart device of environment may enable accessibility to a front door of a lobby of an apartment building yet a maximum threshold occupancy condition may only be analyzed for satisfaction at a second smart device of environment prior to enabling accessibility to a front door of a specific apartment of the apartment building.

A smart invitation may enable access to only a certain portion of environment e.g. via a platform action of an associated mode setting e.g. as carried out at step . For example continuing with the circumstances of an apartment building that may have a front lobby shared by multiple residents as well as a particular residential unit of a particular system user of platform a mode setting defined for a smart invitation may include a platform action that enables a visitor access to only that shared lobby in response to detection of that invitation at a smart device of environment . This may enable a deliverer with a particular smart invitation e.g. a package label ID containing unique invitation identification information to drop off a package in a lobby of a building without platform granting that deliverer access to any particular residence of that building thereby maintaining certain security of that residence while also providing certain security for that package e.g. that the package is held within a secure area of environment not accessible to untrusted entities e.g. members of the general public that are not able to access that lobby . Such limited accessibility may satisfy certain delivery requirements of a deliverer business entity e.g. drop off requirements generally or even signed recipient receipt requirements if that lobby is deemed secure enough e.g. a lobby of a single residence home to which no non system trusted entities may have accessibility . As another example a platform action associated with a particular smart invitation may enable temporary accessibility to a smart safe e.g. a smart appliance that may be provided by environment adjacent doorbell external to structure e.g. smart appliance the interior of which may be selectively and temporarily made accessible to deliverer DL e.g. via any suitable control signals of system by platform for enabling placement of package PL therein in response to detection of the smart invitation e.g. package label ID at doorbell . Any such secure area e.g. a lobby a safe etc. of environment that may be made temporarily accessible to an invitee visitor e.g. deliverer DL by platform e.g. automatically through system processing and control of mode settings of a smart invitation in response to presentation and detection of that smart invitation may be securely monitored by system during such temporary access in order to ensure that deliverer DL positions package PL in that area and or to ensure that nothing is removed from that area during the period of that temporary access. One or more sensing components of doorbell or of any other smart device of environment may be configured to at least partially carry out such monitoring. Additionally or alternatively one or more output components of doorbell or of any other smart device of environment may be configured to at least partially indicate to deliverer DL where and how to deposit the package securely.

A platform action of a mode setting associated with a particular smart invitation for a particular smart environment may be at least partially defined by one or more characteristics defining the details of the smart invitation. For example if a smart invitation is generated in response to an order being placed for delivery of contents e.g. whereby the unique invitation identification information of the invitation may be based on a confirmation number of that order or otherwise generated based on that order certain information detailing that order e.g. a description of the contents the time the order was placed the intended recipient of the order the facilitator of the order etc. may be automatically associated with the mode setting of that smart invitation e.g. through information sharing from an order facilitator business and system via an API . For example such information may be automatically leveraged by platform for defining certain characteristics of certain platform actions of the mode setting such as a platform action to convey a particular message to occupant s of environment e.g. via any all suitable smart devices of environment such as only those in rooms currently occupied within structure when the smart invitation is detected at environment e.g. at doorbell for example where such a message may convey The delivery of the food order placed at restaurant X by occupant Y at time Z is currently being attempted at door . Therefore not only may a smart invitation be automatically made accessible to the facilitator of an order at the time the order is placed e.g. as may be provided by system to the facilitator or generated by the facilitator and shared with system but one or more suitable platform actions of a mode setting associated with that smart invitation may be at least partially automatically defined by platform based on information associated with that order. This may increase the efficiency with which environment may handle an invitee visitor in response to that visitor presenting a specific smart invitation at environment e.g. if there are multiple people at environment that may have made different food orders and that are currently awaiting the delivery thereof . This may not only increase the convenience of the occupant users by being informed what delivery attempt is currently being detected but this may also increase the convenience of the deliverer by not having to manually announce the particulars of the attempted delivery e.g. Hello this is a delivery for occupant Y by restaurant X but instead by only having to present its smart invitation e.g. a delivery receipt containing the confirmation number i.e. the unique invitation identification information such as of a label ID to environment e.g. doorbell for automatic detection analysis handling by platform .

Smart invitations may be useful to a system user when managing accessibility to environment during times when that system user may not be present at environment . For example when a smart invitation is generated to provide environment accessibility to a somewhat trusted entity e.g. a temporary tenant as may be prevalent in the popular home sharing swapping context a system user may wish to provide certain constraints on the use of the environment by that entity. As just one example total occupancy conditions for such a smart invitation mode setting may be useful to prevent a temporary tenant from hosting large gatherings at environment . If detected occupancy within structure is equal to a certain number a mode setting may prevent additional access to structure through use of a smart invitation. In some embodiments a system user may define a do not disturb mode for environment when environment has been made temporarily accessible to entities that have only limited trust such that deliveries or other types of visitor handling may be suspended or handled in a special way when a temporary tenant has accessibility rights thereby preventing platform from enabling a temporary tenant to receive a package from a deliverer. As mentioned various platform actions may be edited for a smart invitation at any moment by an authorized system user such that a temporary tenant s rights with respect to environment may be varied remotely e.g. by a remote system user UR via system when a situation warrants. For example a system user may be notified by platform that a package has been left within a safe and that system user may then choose to grant temporary accessibility rights to safe to a temporary tenant that may currently have accessibility rights to certain areas of environment but not to safe via a particular smart invitation by editing a mode setting of that smart invitation to now allow accessibility to that safe via use of that smart invitation e.g. if the system user wishes for the package to be moved by the temporary tenant to a cooler climate e.g. a refrigerator .

A smart invitation may be leveraged in any suitable context for increasing the security of environment . For example particular unique invitation identification information of a smart invitation may be associated with a particular security entity e.g. an emergency response entity and a mode setting for that smart invitation may be managed for defining the various ways in which that smart invitation may be used by that security entity for interacting with environment . As just one example a fire department may have access to a particular smart invitation with particular unique invitation identification information that may be associated with a mode setting for environment such that a system user may edit that mode setting for varying the accessibility rights that the fire department may have with respect to environment . In some embodiments such a mode setting may be defined to instruct platform to enable the fire department to access all portions of environment at any time the smart invitation of the fire department is detected by environment e.g. if a system user occupant of environment is elderly and implicitly trusts the fire department in all situations at all times . Alternatively such a mode setting may be defined to instruct platform to enable the fire department to access environment only if no active occupants are detected at environment and a specific hazard is detected at environment when the smart invitation of the fire department is detected by environment e.g. if a system user wishes to allow the fire department to enter environment if no one is home or if everyone is sleeping motionless and at least one smart hazard detector or other smart device of environment detects smoke . Additionally or alternatively to determining physical accessibility to environment as a platform action e.g. via unlocking door with smart doorknob such a mode setting may be defined to instruct platform to convey certain information to the fire department when the smart invitation of the fire department is detected by environment as a platform action e.g. via any suitable output component of doorbell such as the current occupancy of environment and or the specific location of each occupant within environment and or a map of environment and or a listing of hazards detected by various hazard detectors of environment such that the fire department may be adequately informed when handling a potential emergency event at environment . Different conditions may be associated with different platform actions of a particular mode setting of a particular smart invitation. For example when a fire department smart invitation is detected at environment a mode setting may instruct platform to enable access through door only if a particular hazard has been detected by environment and no occupancy motion has been detected by environment whereas that same mode setting may instruct platform to convey detected occupancy status information and or environment map information and or detected hazard information of environment with the fire department visitor e.g. via doorbell at all times or only when no current occupancy is detected.

In some embodiments the particular unique invitation identification information of such a smart invitation available to the fire department may be generated by the fire department and shared with any appropriate component s of platform e.g. system for enabling a mode setting to be defined for that particular unique invitation identification information with respect to various particular smart environments. Therefore the same particular unique invitation identification information of a smart invitation available to the fire department may be used by multiple different system users of platform for defining multiple different mode settings for multiple different smart environments that are to be associated with that particular unique invitation identification information of the fire department which may enable the fire department to use only a single smart invitation with that same particular unique invitation identification information at every smart environment the fire department may potentially visit. This may obviate the need for the fire department to carry around multiple types of skeleton keys or otherwise worry about having to interact with various smart environments in different ways but instead may enable the fire department to present the same smart invitation with the same particular unique invitation identification information at every smart environment and the mode settings for that smart invitation with respect to any particular smart environment may vary based on the desires of the system user of that smart environment. Therefore a system user may be provided with the ability to control and edit the various ways in which platform may handle a fire department when the presence of the fire department is authenticated at environment while the fire department may only need one smart invitation for use with multiple smart environments. The same may be true for any other suitable entity such as a package delivery entity e.g. Federal Express or the local U.S. Postal Service that may have access to a single smart invitation that may be presented at each smart environment e.g. within a particular delivery area covered by that entity and different system users of different environments may define different mode settings for handling that smart invitation. For example a particular entity may be responsible for e.g. provide service to the entirety of the locations within a ZIP Code and the particular entity may share the particular unique invitation identification information of its smart invitation as well as its responsible ZIP Code with platform e.g. with system via API and platform may be operative to define a distinct mode setting based on the particular unique invitation identification information of that smart invitation with each smart environment within that ZIP Code.

If handling of a detected visitor at environment enables an attempt to communicate with a system user of environment platform may be operative to provide different feedback to the visitor e.g. at doorbell and to the system user e.g. via a user device or any other suitable smart device of environment proximate the user . Enabling different feedback to be provided to a system user and to a detected visitor may independently enhance the experience of the user and visitor in various ways.

Any suitable handling of the detection of any suitable visitor or invitation at environment may include any suitable communication attempt to a system user associated with environment . For example after initial detection of any visitor generally e.g. at steps and or after detecting a specific act of a visitor e.g. at step platform may be operative to attempt to communicate any suitable information indicative of that detection to a system user e.g. at step and or step whether or not that system user is local to environment e.g. user UL via communication at a personal device of the user and or via communication at any suitable smart device of environment or remote from environment e.g. user UR via communication at a personal device of the user . The content of such a communication to a system user and the manner in which such a communication may be attempted by platform may vary based on any suitable data available to platform such as any suitable information relating to the identification and or intent of the detected visitor the intended user the visitor is attempting to communicate with any mode setting of environment the occupancy status of environment information provided by any third party entity e.g. one or more of entities paradigms and the like. In certain situations the content and or manner of a communication to a system user may vary as more time elapses without receiving a user response.

For example when a particular system user is identified as a target of the communication platform may first attempt to communicate e.g. at step and or step just with that particular system user e.g. by communicating with a personal user device associated with that specific user and or with one or smart devices determined to be local to that specific user e.g. hazard device proximate user UL . However if no user response or other suitable indication is received by platform suggesting that the communication was received by the user e.g. within a particular amount of time or after a particular amount of attempts platform may be operative to adjust the communication attempt by varying a characteristic of the output component s with which a smart device may attempt to facilitate the communication e.g. by increasing the volume of an audibly conveyed message and or by switching to or also using a visual output component e.g. a flickering light of the smart device and or by communicating with additional smart devices e.g. by communicating with additional or all suitable smart devices of environment e.g. with any hazard detectors of environment not specifically associated with a do not disturb mode e.g. not in a sleeping baby s room or all hazard detectors of environment or all smart devices of environment and or by changing the message of the communication attempt e.g. from User UR there is someone at the door for you to Occupants there is someone at the door . Therefore platform may be operative to target one or more specific devices associated with one or more specific users and or one or more specific areas of environment with an initial output characteristic when initially attempting to communicate with a user before expanding that communication attempt to other output characteristics and or other devices and or other environment areas which may limit the amount that such an attempted communication may disturb environment while also maximizing the likelihood of eventually contacting an appropriate occupant. Additionally or alternatively platform may be operative to craft a targeted message for one or more specific users when initially attempting to communicate with a user before expanding the breadth of that message to incite a response from other users which may limit the amount that such an attempted communication may disturb environment while also maximizing the likelihood of eventually contacting an appropriate occupant. After an initial attempt an additional attempt may not only include the use of additional output characteristics or devices or messages but may also continue to employ the characteristics of the initial attempt. Alternatively after an initial attempt an additional attempt may only include the use of additional output characteristics or devices or messages but may not continue to employ the characteristics of the initial attempt e.g. to discontinue a potential disturbance to a user who is unable or unwilling to respond to the initial attempt .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

If handling of a detected visitor by platform enables a visitor to interact with environment e.g. doorbell for actively attempting to communicate with a system user of environment e.g. at step platform may be operative to provide different feedback to the visitor e.g. at doorbell and to the system user e.g. via a user device or any other suitable smart device of environment proximate the user . For example at any suitable time a visitor may actively interact with e.g. depress a doorbell button or other suitable doorbell user interface of doorbell for attempting to communicate with a system user of environment e.g. whether or not such interface may be indicative of being enabled or disabled for such use platform may be operative to communicate information indicative of that visitor interaction with a system user in any suitable manner. In some embodiments such communication to a system user may be based on an adjusted version of that visitor interaction such that certain characteristics of that visitor interaction may be filtered or otherwise processed in order to limit the annoyance of such a communication to the system user and or to otherwise make such a communication as effective as possible.

Platform may be operative to communicate any number of visitor interactions within a certain period of time as a single communication type to a system user. For example if a visitor presses doorbell button ten times within a single ten second period of time or only one time within a single ten second period platform may be operative to generate the same communication for a system user e.g. a single buzzer sound emitted from one or more smart devices within environment and or a single message conveyed within environment e.g. a visitor has rung the doorbell rather than doing so ten times . This may limit the disturbance caused to any system user by platform when communicating such a visitor interaction.

Additionally or alternatively platform may be operative to communicate any length of a visitor interaction within a certain period of time as a single communication type to a system user. For example if a visitor presses and then holds doorbell button for ten seconds straight within a single ten second period of time or presses and then holds doorbell button for only one second within a single ten second period platform may be operative to generate the same communication for a system user e.g. a single buzzer sound emitted for a single second length of time from one or more smart devices within environment rather than doing so for a ten second length of time . This may limit the disturbance caused to any system user by platform when communicating such a visitor interaction.

Platform may be configured in any suitable way e.g. by a system user or automatically through heuristics or rules or inferences or any other suitable data or controlling entity of platform to define the period of time within which one or more visitor interactions may result in a single communication to a system user and or the length of time during which a single visitor interaction may last that may result in a single communication to a system user. This may enable various modes whereby a certain type of visitor interaction may result in different communications to a system user depending on various factors e.g. environment mode occupancy status visitor identification etc. and or user customized settings for how defining particular visitor interaction types may be handled and communicated to that user . In some embodiments a pattern of two or more visitor interactions and or a single interaction of at least a specific length may result in a particular type of communication to a system user. For example if more than a certain amount of visitor interactions are detected within a particular amount of time and or if a single visitor interaction is held for more than a certain amount of time and or any other suitable type of visitor interaction is detected e.g. a specific pattern of multiple visitor interactions of specific types platform may be operative to communicate a respective particular type of alert to a system user e.g. to indicate an urgent visitor disposition or a unique visitor interaction e.g. a specific 7 note shave and a haircut two bits rhythmic interaction by a visitor with a smart device input component may be detected and operative to generate a melodic version of that same shave and a haircut two bits riff as a communication to a system user via a smart device output component . This may enable a certain type of visitor interaction to override certain standard response settings of platform so as to enable a visitor to communicate to a system user an urgent communication or an otherwise unique communication. Therefore while ten visitor depressions of doorbell button within ten seconds may result in the same user communication attempt as one visitor depression within ten seconds e.g. a single buzzer sound emitted from one or more smart devices within environment and or a single message conveyed within environment e.g. a visitor has rung the doorbell so as to not annoy or otherwise disturb a system user by providing ten distinct user communication attempts e.g. ten distinct buzzer sounds eleven visitor depressions of doorbell button within ten seconds may result in a different e.g. more urgent user communication attempt e.g. multiple buzzer sounds emitted from one or more smart devices within environment and or a single but stronger message conveyed within environment e.g. a visitor has URGENTLY rung the doorbell . Therefore while platform may be operative to filter down certain annoying visitor interaction types for providing a more palatable alert to a system user platform may also be operative to determine certain visitor interaction types to be urgent or otherwise unique in nature for providing a more urgent or otherwise unique alert to a system user. While visitor interactions with environment have been described with respect to visitor depressions or other suitable interactions with a doorbell button which may be similar to some conventional visitor interactions with conventional doorbells intercoms e.g. for ringing a doorbell any suitable visitor interaction type with respect to any suitable input component s and or sensing component s of any suitable smart device or devices of environment e.g. a visitor s audible communication via a microphone of doorbell or selection of an option on a touchscreen user interface of doorbell via touching that touchscreen may be processed and handled in any suitable manner by platform for filtering any undesirable or otherwise annoying visitor interactions while also appropriately detecting certain visitor interactions that maybe leveraged for adjusting the urgency or uniqueness or any other suitable tone of an attempted communication by platform to a system user in response to such detecting.

As described above platform may be operative to disable a functionality of a user interface or doorbell button input component of a smart doorbell for any suitable reason e.g. based on any suitable settings or inferences etc. . For example a message may be conveyed to the visitor that the doorbell input component has been disabled thereby discouraging the visitor from even attempting to functionally interact with the doorbell input component e.g. through the visitor depressing or ringing the doorbell . Alternatively or additionally whether or not it is conveyed to the visitor that a functionality of a doorbell input component is disabled platform may be operative to prevent contacting a system user in certain manners or at all in response to an interaction of any visitor with that doorbell input component under certain system circumstances e.g. if the visitor interacts with the doorbell input component before providing the smart environment with any requested visitor identification information and or visitor intent information . This may be considered whitelisting as platform may be operative to require that certain requirements be met before enabling the functionality of the doorbell input component for a visitor generally e.g. before platform may be operative to generate any system user notifications in response to any visitor interaction with that doorbell input component such as determining a specific identification of the visitor and or at least determining whether the visitor is trusted or untrusted.

Alternatively or additionally platform may be operative to prevent contacting a system user in certain manners or at all in response to an interaction of a particular visitor with that doorbell input component e.g. if a particular visitor has been determined to interact with environment e.g. doorbell in a manner that is undesirable to a system user. This may be considered blacklisting as platform may be operative to prevent certain visitor interaction by a certain visitor from being communicated as system user notification which may be done whether the certain visitor is determined to be trusted or untrusted. Therefore platform may be operative to enable a system user to easily blacklist a particular visitor during a particular mode of smart environment e.g. by defining a mode setting such that certain or all interactions by that particular visitor with environment e.g. with doorbell button may not result in a system user notification that might otherwise be generated by platform for a non blacklisted visitor interacting in the same manner. A blacklisted visitor may be detected like any other suitable visitor e.g. as described above with respect to steps . For example any suitable fingerprint or signature of a visitor may be identified e.g. through facial recognition receipt of affirmatively provided visitor identification detection of an NFC or RFID tag for that particular visitor Wi Fi pairing signals or any other suitable signals that may be detected from a visitor personal device and analyzed by platform etc. .

Platform may be operative to blacklist a visitor or at least certain visitor interactions of a visitor in any suitable way e.g. based on inferences or system user instructions . For example in some embodiments platform may be operative to record a log e.g. as home data that may include a listing of the identity e.g. general or specific of some or all of the visitors detected each day at environment as well as a listing of any interaction each visitor may have had with environment e.g. Visitor A pressed doorbell button of doorbell at front door five times within a ten second period starting at 3 45 15 PM on Tuesday . Platform may be operative to provide such a log for review by a system user of environment such that the system user may select certain visitors or certain interactions of certain visitors to be added to a blacklist whereby going forward platform may be operative to prevent such visitors or such interactions of such visitors from resulting in the generation of system user notifications e.g. via a smart device output component proximate the system user . Once a particular visitor e.g. all interactions by Visitor A and or a particular visitor interaction e.g. an interaction by Visitor A that includes pressing doorbell button more than once within a ten second period has been blacklisted platform may be operative to handle such a blacklisting in any suitable manner when detected. For example in response to detecting a blacklisted interaction platform may be operative to convey a message to the visitor e.g. via speaker or projector or otherwise that such an interaction will not be recognized by a system user and that discourages such behavior going forward. The message may include a customized message from the system user as to why the interaction has been blacklisted and what may be a preferable alternative.

As just one real world example there may be an overly enthusiastic mailman deliverer DL that always presses doorbell button when he or she delivers the mail each day despite a system user s requests to the contrary e.g. because user notifications provided in response to such doorbell presses inevitably wake up a napping child within environment . After 2 3 days of this same activity platform may be operative to recognize e.g. at steps that the same Wi Fi pairing signal is sensed when doorbell button is pressed each day and platform may be operative to store such data in a suitable log by identifying different interactions on different days as being provided by the same visitor. Later after the third day or so the angry homeowner system user may be enabled by platform to review that log and realize that this same visitor was the doorbell ringer at these offending times and then blacklist that visitor. Notably in one embodiment the actual identity of the blacklisted may not be specifically established or revealed by platform in the log and such a visitor may simply be identified in the log as Visitor A or Visitor whose Wi Fi beacon is XYZ . However in other embodiments the actual identity of one or more visitors may be provided in such a log e.g. through any suitable technique described herein such as comparing any detected visitor signature data to one or more databases available to platform .

Such a log may be leveraged by platform for any suitable purpose. For example rather than identifying a particular visitor or a particular visitor interaction in the log for blacklisting that visitor or interaction for preventing future system user notifications in response thereto platform may be operative to assign a particular type of system user notification to a particular visitor or particular visitor interaction identified via a log or otherwise such that such a particular type of system user notification may be utilized by platform in the future in response to detecting such a particular visitor or particular visitor interaction. For example platform may be operative to enable a certain audible message type e.g. a particular ringtones to be provided by platform as at least a portion of a system user notification in response to a future detection of a particular visitor or a particular visitor interaction e.g. to associate a melodic version of the shave and a haircut two bits riff with a particular rhythmic interaction by a visitor of that same shave and a haircut two bits riff.

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Platform may be operative to provide any suitable feedback to a visitor in response to any suitable visitor interaction with environment where such feedback provided to the visitor in response to the visitor interaction may or may not be similar to any communication attempt provided to a system user in response to the visitor interaction. In some embodiments when no audible communication attempt is provided to a system user within environment e.g. when such a communication attempt is done electronically as a text message to a system user device or as a visual only blinking light communication attempt via a smart device within environment e.g. when the system user may be putting a baby down for a nap or is on a telephone call and or when no communication attempt is provided within environment whatsoever e.g. when platform has determined that there is no occupancy within environment and or each occupant is in a do not disturb mode platform may still be operative to generate audible feedback or any other suitable form of feedback to the visitor which may provide the visitor with some sort of confidence that its interaction is being handled by environment . As just one example if platform determined that environment is in a do not disturb mode whereby no audible communication attempt to a system user is generated in response to a visitor interaction e.g. if platform instead only generates a silent communication within environment to a system user that may be attempting to put a baby down for a nap in response to a visitor interaction platform may still be operative to generate visitor feedback that may be audible by the visitor e.g. external to structure outside door in response to a visitor interaction. Such visitor feedback may be sensed and interpreted by the visitor as if it is hearing the same audible output that is being provided to a system user within environment e.g. internal to structure whether or not such an audible output is being provided to a system user within environment . For example such an audible output may be provided by doorbell e.g. audio speaker and or by an audio speaker of another smart device that may be positioned within structure just adjacent internal side of door e.g. within a user handle portion of doorknob where such an audible output may not disturb any system user within structure . As another example an audible output may be generated by platform that may be sensed and interpreted by the visitor as if a dog is barking from within environment in response to the visitor interaction and any attempted user communication. For example if a real dog may be present within environment platform may be operative to generate any suitable output that may instigate such a dog to bark e.g. by generating a dog whistle high pitch sound that may not be detectable by any system user or the visitor but that may excite a dog to bark . Alternatively a sound may be generated and output by any suitable device of environment that may mimic a dog bark.

Platform may be operative to provide different visitor feedback based on occupancy status and or visitor type. For example if platform attempts to communicate with a system user local to or remote from environment in response to a visitor interaction with environment platform may be operative to provide different feedback to the visitor dependent upon whether or not the visitor has been detected as a known or unknown visitor. If the visitor is currently unknown to platform or is otherwise considered a stranger with respect to environment or is otherwise to be treated with a heightened form of security platform may be operative to generate visitor feedback that may be sensed or otherwise interpreted by the visitor as indicative of some form of occupancy at environment e.g. turning on a light within structure or outdoor lighting external to structure or generating an audible dog bark or other suitable noise etc. . By generating such visitor feedback in response to such an unknown visitor interacting with environment e.g. ringing doorbell button platform may be operative to increase the security of environment by making environment seem occupied in some way to the visitor even if environment may currently be unoccupied or in a do not disturb mode. As mentioned above platform may be operative to provide such security enhancing feedback in response to any suitable visitor interaction with environment and not just in response to a visitor interaction with a doorbell button of doorbell . For example in some embodiments platform may be operative to turn on a light within or outside of structure or adjust the functionality of any other suitable device of environment for enhancing the security of environment when any potential visitor e.g. known or unknown is at least initially detected at environment e.g. when environment is in a do not disturb mode or otherwise . Alternatively such security enhancing functionality of platform may be carried out in response to a visitor being detected but then not actively interacting with environment e.g. when the presence of a visitor is detected but then that visitor does not provide requested information to doorbell or otherwise interact with a user interface of doorbell whereby platform may be operative to deem such visitor non interaction as suspicious. As another example such security enhancing functionality of platform may be carried out in response to a visitor actively interacting with environment in an unapproved manner e.g. in response to a visitor attempting to open door through interaction with doorknob before platform has granted such access whereby platform may be operative to deem such visitor interaction as suspicious.

However if the visitor is currently known to platform or otherwise meets any suitable trust threshold with respect to environment or is otherwise not to be treated with a heightened form of security platform may be operative to generate visitor feedback that may be sensed or otherwise interpreted by the visitor as indicative of the fact that platform is currently attempting to contact a system user without necessarily implying occupancy at environment e.g. by conveying a visitor feedback message like please wait while user contact is attempted or please enjoy this hold music as a user is notified of your presence . By generating such visitor feedback in response to such a known visitor interacting with environment e.g. ringing doorbell button platform may be operative to share with the visitor the actual current status of the attempted communication between platform and a system user rather than generating a decoy feedback that may not fool a visitor familiar with environment e.g. whether or not environment would include a barking dog .

It is understood that the steps shown in process of are merely illustrative and that existing steps may be modified or omitted additional steps may be added and the order of certain steps may be altered.

Platform may be operative to leverage any suitable data that may be sensed by any suitable smart device of environment for enhancing the security or convenience of environment . Additionally or alternatively to sensing data that may be indicative of the physical presence identity and or intent of a visitor and or a smart invitation or package label at environment one or more sensing components of one or more smart devices of environment e.g. doorbell may be operative to sense any other suitable data that may be utilized by platform in enhancing the security and or convenience of system users of environment in any suitable ways.

Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment e.g. outdoor lighting gated entry doorknob safe appliance entry detectors etc. may include one or more sensing components that may be operative to measure one or more characteristics for determining the quality of the air or any other similar detectable entity of the external environment of environment e.g. external to structure . For example one or more sensing components of doorbell positioned external to structure may be similar to any suitable sensing component of a hazard detector device positioned within structure or otherwise for measuring air quality and or detecting harmful VOCs and or patent harmful gases particulate dust pollen mold or the like of the environment external to structure . Such external environment data sensed by doorbell or any other suitable smart device or by any other data source of platform e.g. a third party air quality business may be leveraged by platform in combination with any other suitable data for adjusting a platform functionality e.g. a functionality of a smart device of environment or for reporting to any suitable entity for analysis . For example the detected air purity within a particular area or the entirety of structure e.g. as may be sensed by one or more hazard detector devices may be compared by platform e.g. by system or any suitable processing component local to environment with the detected air purity outside of structure e.g. as may be sensed by doorbell or otherwise to control a functionality of a smart device of environment . As a particular example if the outside air is purer than the inside air then platform may be operative to instruct a smart thermostat device to open a vent to permit fresh air into structure otherwise platform may be operative to instruct a thermostat device to recirculate air within structure and to not draw in outside air. Additionally or alternatively as another particular example platform may be operative to send detailed information about the air quality within and external to structure to a mobile personal device user device or other suitable smart device of a user which may help the user identify which pollen or other air impurity may be the culprit of any allergies that the user may be experiencing. As one other example platform may be operative to send an alert to a system user when cigarette smoke is detected by any suitable external sensor e.g. to catch a child attempting to sneak a cigarette outside front door . As another example platform may be operative to aggregate air quality data received from multiple environments in various geographic locations or other suitable groupings and to provide for example smog alerts pollen warnings etc. of those groupings to any suitable entity e.g. weather reporting business entities . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or internal air quality of different areas of environment with one another at a specific time or historically e.g. by time of day day of week season of year etc. for identifying certain areas that may have issues to be addressed e.g. a corner of structure that is exposed to significantly more pollen than other portions of environment during the Spring and may benefit from additional filtration or inspection of flora and fauna near that area at that time . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or internal air quality of environment with other smart environments. Any one or more of such comparisons or data aggregations with respect to air quality of one or more internal or external areas of environment may be stored for and or shared with certain entities such as prospective buyers of environment e.g. at real estate business entity for determining whether such qualities of environment are suitable. Additionally or alternatively any other weather phenomena or characteristic of the air quality e.g. temperature humidity wind levels e.g. strength speed of the movement of the air wind direction e.g. direction of the movement of the air etc. may be detected e.g. by any sensing component s doorbell at environment e.g. internal to and or ambient of structure and utilized similarly to any air purity levels described above. For example the outside humidity and temperature data may be compared with or considered by a thermostat when controlling the HVAC to best accomplish the occupants desired comfort preferences. Further for example this information may be presented to the occupants through a number of user interfaces such as a user interface associated with another one of the devices located inside of the home the television mobile and other computing devices or audibly. In some instances platform e.g. system may collect such weather data from multiple smart environments across a plurality of geographic locations or other suitable groupings and such aggregated weather data may be sold or otherwise provided to weather services e.g. any suitable business entity or may be used to provide weather data to smart home occupants or potential buyers.

Doorbell and or any other smart device of environment e.g. outdoor lighting gated entry doorknob safe appliance entry detectors etc. may include one or more sensing components that may be operative to measure one or more characteristics for determining noise of the external environment of environment e.g. external to structure . For example one or more sensing components of doorbell e.g. microphone may be positioned external to structure for sensing any suitable noise external to structure . Such ambient noise data sensed by doorbell or any other suitable smart device or by any other data source of platform e.g. a third party noise detection business may be leveraged by platform in combination with any other suitable data for adjusting a platform functionality e.g. a functionality of a smart device of environment or for reporting to any suitable entity for analysis . For example the detected noise levels within a particular area or the entirety of structure e.g. as may be sensed by one or more hazard detectors may be compared by platform e.g. by system or any suitable processing component local to environment with the noise levels outside of structure e.g. as may be sensed by doorbell or otherwise to control a functionality of a smart device of environment . As a particular example if the noise level outside of structure significantly spikes e.g. due to a helicopter hovering overhead then platform may be operative to instruct a smart appliance e.g. a television or smart hazard detector device or any other suitable smart device to increase its volume output level to overcome or otherwise compensate for the additional ambient noise pollution e.g. so a system user may still hear important warnings or other communications from such smart devices . As another example platform may be operative to analyze ambient noise detected at environment e.g. by doorbell to determine that a street adjacent to structure may meet a threshold level of traffic where such a determination may result in one or more inferences being made by platform about the safety of any children currently occupying environment e.g. Child playing outside of structure at environment of . For example platform may be operative to trigger any suitable alarm e.g. at environment such as with a hazard detector within structure in the event one or more of the children are detected by the occupancy sensing to be outside of the home during such a detected traffic event. Such an alert may enable a parent or other caretaker at environment e.g. Husband within structure to quickly take action to protect the child from the detected traffic of course other suitable environment detectors such as a camera and or motion detector alone or in combination with such a noise sensor may also enable platform to facilitate such a security feature . Additionally or alternatively as another particular example platform may be operative to send detailed information about the noise levels within and external to structure to a mobile personal device user device or other suitable smart device of a user which may help the user identify which areas of environment may be experiencing more problematic noise issues. As another example platform may be operative to aggregate noise data received from multiple environments in various geographic locations or other suitable groupings and to provide for example noise pollution reports of those groupings to any suitable entity e.g. law enforcement entities . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or internal noise levels of different areas of environment with one another at a specific time or historically e.g. by time of day day of week season of year etc. for identifying certain areas that may have issues to be addressed e.g. a corner of structure that is exposed to significantly more noise than other portions of environment at certain times of day and may benefit from additional sound proofing or noise filtration or other accommodations . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or noise levels of environment with other smart environments. Any one or more of such comparisons or data aggregations with respect to noise levels of one or more internal or external areas of environment may be stored for and or shared with certain entities such as prospective buyers of environment e.g. at a real estate agent business for determining whether such qualities of environment are suitable. Additionally or alternatively any motion levels or other suitable activity may be detected e.g. by any sensing component s doorbell at environment e.g. internal to and ambient of structure and utilized similarly to any noise levels described above e.g. a combination of detected motion and noise levels may be leveraged to detect a traffic threshold for enabling platform to initiate an alarm for protecting any children of environment or motion levels may be detected to indicate a stranger casing environment for potential theft or an animal wandering in the backyard etc. . Additionally or alternatively any ambient light levels or other suitable ambient conditions may be detected e.g. by any sensing component s doorbell at environment e.g. internal to and ambient of structure and utilized similarly to any noise levels described above.

As described above e.g. with respect to detected air quality any suitable data indicative of any suitable characteristic or phenomena external to structure e.g. noise levels activity levels ambient light levels weather etc. that may be detectable by doorbell or any other suitable data source of platform may be analyzed in any suitable manner e.g. with respect to any other suitable data for leveraging in any suitable way. As one particular example any suitable detected ambient data of structure may be compared with any suitable internal data of environment or analyzed on its own or with respect to any other suitable data for adjusting a platform functionality such as for adjusting a functionality of a smart device and or for adjusting a mode or mode setting enabled or to be enabled e.g. ambient detected noise e.g. by a microphone sensing component of doorbell may be leveraged to adjust the volume level of audio output by a smart device within structure e.g. from a smart hazard detector device or any suitable controllable device such as a stereo for dynamically tuning such internal volume to overcome any ambient noise sources . Additionally or alternatively as another particular example platform may be operative to send detailed information about the detected value of certain ambient conditions of environment to a mobile personal device user device or other suitable smart device of a user which may help the user identify when and where certain noises are coming from. As another example platform may be operative to aggregate ambient data received from multiple environments in various geographic locations or other suitable groupings and to provide for example air pollution reports of those groupings to any suitable entity e.g. law enforcement entities . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or internal phenomena from different areas of environment with one another at a specific time or historically e.g. by time of day day of week season of year etc. for identifying certain areas that may have issues to be addressed e.g. a corner of structure that is exposed to significantly more noise pollution than other portions of environment at a specific time of day and may benefit from additional sound proofing . As another example platform may be operative to compare detected external and or internal phenomena of environment with other smart environments. Any one or more of such comparisons or data aggregations with respect to detected phenomena e.g. air quality noise levels activity e.g. motion levels ambient light levels weather etc. of one or more internal or external areas of environment may be stored for and or shared with certain entities such as prospective buyers of environment for determining whether such qualities of environment are suitable.
