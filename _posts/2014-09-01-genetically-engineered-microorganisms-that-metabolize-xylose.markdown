The present invention relates to the expression of xylose metabolizing pathways in oleaginous microorganisms to allow them to metabolize xylose so as to produce lipid or other useful biomass and to oleochemical food fuel and other products produced from the biomass.

An important and difficult challenge in biotechnology is unleashing the vast potential of carbon capture in cellulosic materials for conversion into valuable substances such as liquid fuel chemicals food and other products. One specific challenge relates to using xylose commonly found in depolymerized hemicellulose as a carbon source for the heterotrophic cultivation of microorganisms. Although much work has been done in using xylose in the production of ethanol using yeast most yeast strains either cannot utilize xylose or utilize xylose only very inefficiently see Jeffries 2006 Curr. Op. Biotech. 17 320 326 and Wang et al. 2004 Biotechnol. Lett. 26 11 885 890 .

Certain oleaginous microorganisms e.g. oleaginous yeast and oleaginous microalgae are capable of converting fixed carbon energy sources into higher value products such as triglycerides fatty acids carbohydrates and proteins. In addition the microalgae themselves can be valuable as a food source. For example certain species of oleaginous microalgae have been genetically engineered to produce tailored oils which means that their triglyceride content shows altered distributions of fatty acid chain lengths and saturation relative to the strains from which they were derived. See PCT Pub. Nos. 2008 151149 2009 126843 2010 045358 2010 063031 and 2010 063032 and PCT App. Nos. U.S. Ser. No. 11 038 463 and U.S. Ser. No. 11 038 464.

 Recombinant is a cell nucleic acid protein or vector that has been modified due to the introduction of an exogenous nucleic acid or the alteration of a native nucleic acid. Thus e.g. recombinant cells express genes that are not found within the native non recombinant form of the cell or express native genes differently than those genes are expressed by a non recombinant cell. A recombinant nucleic acid is a nucleic acid originally formed in vitro in general by the manipulation of nucleic acid e.g. using polymerases and endonucleases or otherwise is in a form not normally found in nature. Recombinant nucleic acids may be produced for example to place two or more nucleic acids in operable linkage. Thus an isolated nucleic acid or an expression vector formed in vitro by ligating DNA molecules that are not normally joined in nature are both considered recombinant for the purposes of this invention. Once a recombinant nucleic acid is made and introduced into a host cell or organism it may replicate using the in vivo cellular machinery of the host cell however such nucleic acids once produced recombinantly although subsequently replicated intracellularly are still considered recombinant for purposes of this invention. Similarly a recombinant protein is a protein made using recombinant techniques i.e. through the expression of a recombinant nucleic acid.

Illustrative embodiments of the present invention overcome long standing challenges in using cell cultures to convert xylose into high value cell biomass by engineering a xylose utilization pathway into an organism that previously lacked the ability to metabolize xylose. In various aspects the present disclosure provides for engineering an active xylose metabolism pathway into an organism and especially a microorganism also referred to herein as a microorganism of the kingdom Plantae. Such organisms include microalgae. In another aspect the present disclosure provides for engineering an active xylose metabolism pathway into an organism and especially a microorganism having both plastids and a type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.

Although others may have obtained ethanol production using xylose in such organisms are not useful for commercial scale production of lipid. By contrast oleaginous microorganisms such as oleaginous yeast and oleaginous microalgae can accumulate greater than 20 lipid by dry cell weight mostly as triglyceride. Although oleaginous yeast are useful in producing lipid microalgae have a type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway which facilitates the use of genetic engineering to tailor the fatty acid profile of lipid and especially triglyceride produced by the cells. See PCT publications WO2011 151149 WO2010 063032 and WO2011 15040. In addition to producing lipid the organisms described herein can be used to produce protein vitamins fiber and other substances produced naturally or as a result of further genetic engineering.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention an exogenous nucleic acid is introduced into a cell with a plastid that is operable to produce a xylulose 5 phosphate transporter e.g. a xylulose 5 phosphate translocator protein that is operable to cause the transport of xylulose 5 phosphate into a plastid of the cell. In a specific embodiment the cell is transformed with exogenous DNA that encodes a xylulose 5 phosphate transporter in operable linkage with a plastid targeting sequence. The plastid targeting sequence can direct the transporter protein to a plastid membrane preferably the inner plastid membrane so as to effectively transport xylulose 5 phosphate into a plastid where it can be metabolized and potentially into fatty acid. For example the organism can have an endogenous pentose metabolism pathway in the plastid that metabolizes the xylulose 5 phosphate. As shown in the examples below this has been found to be an effective method of boosting xylose utilization concurrent with cell growth and or lipid production.

Optionally or in addition the cells may be capable of taking up xylose from the external milieu and converting the xylose to xylulose 5 phosphate. Exogenous genes may be needed to produce active proteins to perform these functions. For example and as described in the Examples below the cell may be transformed with DNA operable to encode an active xylose transporter for transporting xylose from an external medium into the cell and a pathway for converting the xylose into xylulose 5 phosphate. For example the pathway for converting the xylose into xylulose 5 phosphate can be a combination of a xylulokinase for converting xylulose to xylulose 5 phosphate with a pathway for converting xylose to xylulose. The pathway for converting xylose to xylulose can comprise a xylose isomerase or a combination of a xylose reductase and a xylitol dehydrogenase. Alternately xylose transport into the cell can rely on the activity of native proteins such as hexose transport proteins.

Optionally in a further refinement of any of the above embodiments the cells may be transformed to express an active xylitol dehydrogenase. This modification may function to reduce or eliminate inhibition of xylose isomerase by xylitol.

The various genes may be integrated into a chromosome of the organism or may be episomal. Preferably the genes are stably expressed and may be in multiple copy. In various embodiments the genes are under the control of a regulatable or constitutive promoter. After transformation and optionally for maintaining stability the cells may be transformed with a selectable marker.

The cells are capable of propogation and or lipid accumulation under heterotrophic growth conditions. Optionally the cells may be those of an obligate heterotroph such as those of the microalgae genus . The cells may be for example those of . In the Examples below cells are transformed to express an active xylose metabolic pathway. It should be noted however that the embodiments of the invention are applicable to many other species. Preferred species include those of the kingdom Plantae the subkingdom Viridiplantae the infrakingdom or phyla Chlorophytae the subphylum Tetraphytina the class Trebouxiophyceae or the order Chlorellales. Specific examples include and

In a preferred embodiment the resulting recombinant organism is capable of accumulating at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 or 80 triglyceride by dry cell weight when cultured using glucose as a carbon source. Further the organism can be capable of accumulating at least 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 or 80 triglyceride by dry cell weight when cultured on pure xylose. For example the microorganism may be capable of accumulating at least 50 triglyceride by dry cell weight when cultured on glucose as a carbon source and is capable of accumulating at least 20 triglyceride by dry cell weight when cultured on pure xylose. In another embodiment when cells of the recombinant organism are cultured on a carbon source that is 60 glucose and 40 xylose under nitrogen limiting conditions the cells produce lipid in which the carbon atoms are at least 5 10 20 30 40 or 50 derived from carbon atoms of xylose as measured by isotopic tracing. In yet another embodiment the cells of the recombinant organism are capable of consuming at least 90 of the xylose in a culture media having 2.5 xylose as a sole carbon source in less than or equal to 35 28 21 14 or 7 days.

In addition to the introduction of the xylose metabolic pathway the organism can be genetically engineered by introducing genes that are operable to alter the fatty acid profile of lipid produced by the microorganism. As a result xylose may be converted into acylglycerides having an altered fatty acid profile. For example the cells can have a recombinant modification comprising one or more exogenous genes encoding an active acyl ACP thioesterase ketoacyl ACP synthase or a fatty acid desaturase. Alternately or in addition the cells can have a recombinant modification that is operable to reduce or ablate an acyl ACP thioesterase ketoacyl ACP synthase or fatty acid desaturase. Methods for performing such genetic manipulations are provided in PCT publications WO2011 151149 WO2010 063032 and WO2011 15040.

In a preferred embodiment the xylose metabolizing cells are cultivated in a xylose containing medium. As a result biomass is produced. In a specific embodiment the xylose is converted into cell biomass and triglyceride in particular. This may be shown by isotope tracing e.g. using isotopically labeled xylose. To produce triglyceride an oleaginous microorganism can be cultivated under nutrient limiting conditions e.g. under nitrogen limitation. The resulting natural oil is harvested. Harvesting may include cell lysis to release oil. The oil may then be used to produce an oleochemical a lubricant detergent fuel food oil cosmetic ingredient or other product. For example the oil may be used to produce biodiesel fatty acid esters or renewable diesel a fuel produced from the oil via cracking .

In an embodiment the method includes cultivating the cells in a culture medium that comprises a carbon source that is greater than 50 xylose. For example the carbon source can be greater than 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 or 95 xylose.

Accordingly a specific embodiment of the present invention comprises a microorganism having a plastid and an operable xylose metabolic pathway resulting from the introduction and expression of exogenous genes. The genes are active to convert xylose to xylulose 5 phosphate and to transport the xylulose 5 phosphate into the plastid for further metabolism. The microorganism optionally has a xylose transporter to transport xylose from an external milieu into the cell. As a result of the expression of the exogenous genes the cell is able to grow on pure xylose and preferably can consume at least 90 of the xylose in a culture media having 2.5 xylose as a sole carbon source in e.g. 21 14 or 7 days or less.

Well established methods of phylogenetic analysis such as amplification and sequencing of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer ITS1 and ITS2 rDNA 23S rRNA 18S rRNA and other conserved genomic regions can be used by those skilled in the art to identify species of not only but other hydrocarbon and lipid producing organisms with similar lipid profiles and production capability. For examples of methods of identification and classification of algae also see for example 2005 August 170 4 1601 10 and 2005 April 11 4 361 4.

Thus genomic DNA comparison can be used to identify suitable species of microalgae to be used in the present invention. Regions of conserved genomic DNA such as but not limited to DNA encoding for 23S rRNA can be amplified from microalgal species and compared to consensus sequences in order to screen for microalgal species that are taxonomically related to the preferred microalgae used in the present invention. Examples of such DNA sequence comparison for species within the genus are shown below. Genomic DNA comparison can also be useful to identify microalgal species that have been misidentified in a strain collection. Often a strain collection will identify species of microalgae based on phenotypic and morphological characteristics. The use of these characteristics may lead to miscategorization of the species or the genus of a microalgae. The use of genomic DNA comparison can be a better method of categorizing microalgae species based on their phylogenetic relationship.

Microalgae for use in the present invention typically have genomic DNA sequences encoding for 23S rRNA that have at least 99 least 95 at least 90 or at least 85 nucleotide identity to at least one of the sequences listed in SEQ ID NOs 1 9.

For sequence comparison to determine percent nucleotide or amino acid identity typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm test and reference sequences are input into a computer subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence s relative to the reference sequence based on the designated program parameters.

Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted e.g. by the local homology algorithm of Smith Waterman 2 482 1981 by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman Wunsch 48 443 1970 by the search for similarity method of Pearson Lipman 85 2444 1988 by computerized implementations of these algorithms GAP BESTFIT FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Genetics Computer Group 575 Science Dr. Madison Wis. or by visual inspection see generally Ausubel et al. supra .

Another example algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm which is described in Altschul et al. 215 403 410 1990 . Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs HSPs by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence which either match or satisfy some positive valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold Altschul et al. supra. . These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using for nucleotide sequences the parameters M reward score for a pair of matching residues always 0 and N penalty score for mismatching residues always 

In addition to calculating percent sequence identity the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences see e.g. Karlin Altschul 90 5873 5787 1993 . One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability P N which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example a nucleic acid is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid to the reference nucleic acid is less than about 0.1 more preferably less than about 0.01 and most preferably less than about 0.001.

Other considerations affecting the selection of microorganisms for use in the invention include in addition to production of suitable lipids or hydrocarbons for production of oils fuels and oleochemicals 1 high lipid content as a percentage of cell weight 2 ease of growth 3 ease of genetic engineering and 4 ease of biomass processing. In particular embodiments the wild type or genetically engineered microorganism yields cells that are at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 or at least 70 or more lipid. Preferred organisms grow heterotrophically on sugars in the absence of light .

Microorganisms are cultured both for purposes of conducting genetic manipulations and for production of hydrocarbons e.g. lipids fatty acids aldehydes alcohols and alkanes . The former type of culture is conducted on a small scale and initially at least under conditions in which the starting microorganism can grow. Culture for purposes of hydrocarbon production is usually conducted on a large scale e.g. 10 000 L 40 000 L 100 000 L or larger bioreactors in a bioreactor. are typically cultured in the methods of the invention in liquid media containing xylose within a bioreactor. In one embodiment microalgae such as are cultured in a bioreactor using a fed batch process. Typically the bioreactor does not allow light to enter and the microorganisms are cultured heterotrophically metabolizing a fixed carbon source and in the substantial absence of light.

The bioreactor or fermentor is used to culture microalgal cells through the various phases of their physiological cycle. Bioreactors offer many advantages for use in heterotrophic growth and propagation methods. To produce biomass for use in food microalgae are preferably fermented in large quantities in liquid such as in suspension cultures as an example. Bioreactors such as steel fermentors can accommodate very large culture volumes 40 000 liter and greater capacity bioreactors are used in various embodiments of the invention . Bioreactors also typically allow for the control of culture conditions such as temperature pH oxygen tension and carbon dioxide levels. For example bioreactors are typically configurable for example using ports attached to tubing to allow gaseous components like oxygen or nitrogen to be bubbled through a liquid culture. Other culture parameters such as the pH of the culture media the identity and concentration of trace elements and other media constituents can also be more readily manipulated using a bioreactor.

Bioreactors can be configured to flow culture media though the bioreactor throughout the time period during which the microalgae reproduce and increase in number. In some embodiments for example media can be infused into the bioreactor after inoculation but before the cells reach a desired density. In other instances a bioreactor is filled with culture media at the beginning of a culture and no more culture media is infused after the culture is inoculated. In other words the microalgal biomass is cultured in an aqueous medium for a period of time during which the microalgae reproduce and increase in number however quantities of aqueous culture medium are not flowed through the bioreactor throughout the time period. Thus in some embodiments aqueous culture medium is not flowed through the bioreactor after inoculation.

Bioreactors equipped with devices such as spinning blades and impellers rocking mechanisms stir bars means for pressurized gas infusion can be used to subject microalgal cultures to mixing. Mixing may be continuous or intermittent. For example in some embodiments a turbulent flow regime of gas entry and media entry is not maintained until a desired increase in number of said microalgae has been achieved.

Bioreactor ports can be used to introduce or extract gases solids semisolids and liquids into the bioreactor chamber containing the microalgae. While many bioreactors have more than one port for example one for media entry and another for sampling it is not necessary that only one substance enter or leave a port. For example a port can be used to flow culture media into the bioreactor and later used for sampling gas entry gas exit or other purposes. Preferably a sampling port can be used repeatedly without altering compromising the axenic nature of the culture. A sampling port can be configured with a valve or other device that allows the flow of sample to be stopped and started or to provide a means of continuous sampling. Bioreactors typically have at least one port that allows inoculation of a culture and such a port can also be used for other purposes such as media or gas entry.

Bioreactors ports allow the gas content of the culture of microalgae to be manipulated. To illustrate part of the volume of a bioreactor can be gas rather than liquid and the gas inlets of the bioreactor to allow pumping of gases into the bioreactor. Gases that can be beneficially pumped into a bioreactor include air air COmixtures noble gases such as argon and other gases. Bioreactors are typically equipped to enable the user to control the rate of entry of a gas into the bioreactor. As noted above increasing gas flow into a bioreactor can be used to increase mixing of the culture.

Increased gas flow affects the turbidity of the culture as well. Turbulence can be achieved by placing a gas entry port below the level of the aqueous culture media so that gas entering the bioreactor bubbles to the surface of the culture. One or more gas exit ports allow gas to escape thereby preventing pressure buildup in the bioreactor. Preferably a gas exit port leads to a one way valve that prevents contaminating microorganisms from entering the bioreactor.

Microalgal culture media typically contains components such as a fixed nitrogen source a fixed carbon source trace elements optionally a buffer for pH maintenance and phosphate typically provided as a phosphate salt . Other components can include salts such as sodium chloride particularly for seawater microalgae. Nitrogen sources include organic and inorganic nitrogen sources including for example without limitation molecular nitrogen nitrate nitrate salts ammonia pure or in salt form such as NH SOand NHOH protein soybean meal cornsteep liquor and yeast extract. Examples of trace elements include zinc boron cobalt copper manganese and molybdenum in for example the respective forms of ZnCl HBO CoCl.6HO CuCl.2HO MnCl.4HO and NH MoO.4HO.

Solid and liquid growth media are generally available from a wide variety of sources and instructions for the preparation of particular media that is suitable for a wide variety of strains of microorganisms can be found for example from the culture collection of algae UTEX maintained by the University of Texas at Austin 1 University Station A6700 Austin Tex. 78712 0183. For example various fresh water and salt water media include those described in PCT Pub. No. 2008 151149 incorporated herein by reference.

In a particular example Proteose Medium is suitable for axenic cultures and a 1 L volume of the medium pH 6.8 can be prepared by addition of 1 g of proteose peptone to 1 liter of Bristol Medium. Bristol medium comprises 2.94 mM NaNO 0.17 mM CaCl.2HO 0.3 mM MgSO.7HO 0.43 mM 1.29 mM KHPO and 1.43 mM NaCl in an aqueous solution. For 1.5 agar medium 15 g of agar can be added to 1 L of the solution. The solution is covered and autoclaved and then stored at a refrigerated temperature prior to use. Another example is the isolation medium PIM which comprises 10 g L potassium hydrogen phthalate KHP 0.9 g L sodium hydroxide 0.1 g L magnesium sulfate 0.2 g L potassium hydrogen phosphate 0.3 g L ammonium chloride 10 g L glucose 0.001 g L thiamine hydrochloride 20 g L agar 0.25 g L 5 fluorocytosine at a pH in the range of 5.0 to 5.2 see Pore 1973 App. Microbiology 26 648 649 . Other suitable media for use with the methods of the invention can be readily identified by consulting the URL identified above or by consulting other organizations that maintain cultures of microorganisms such as SAG CCAP or CCALA. SAG refers to the Culture Collection of Algae at the University of G ttingen G ttingen Germany CCAP refers to the culture collection of algae and protozoa managed by the Scottish Association for Marine Science Scotland United Kingdom and CCALA refers to the culture collection of algal laboratory at the Institute of Botany Thacek over r ebohacek over n Czech Republic . Additionally U.S. Pat. No. 5 900 370 describes media formulations and conditions suitable for heterotrophic fermentation of species.

For oil production selection of a fixed carbon source is important as the cost of the fixed carbon source must be sufficiently low to make oil production economical. In one embodiment the fixed carbon source is xylose. Xylose is a five carbon monosaccharide that is found as a component of hemicellulose. Hemicellulose is a complex polysaccharide that is found in almost all plant cell walls comprising about 30 of all plant matter. In addition to xylose other carbon sources can be included for example acetate floridoside fructose galactose glucuronic acid glucose glycerol lactose mannose N acetylglucosamine rhamnose sucrose and or xylose selection of feedstocks containing those compounds particularly xylose is an important aspect of the methods of the invention.

Other suitable feedstocks useful in accordance with the methods of the invention include for example black liquor corn starch depolymerized cellulosic material milk whey molasses potato sorghum sucrose sugar beet sugar beet juice sugar cane sugar cane juice thick cane juice rice and wheat. Carbon sources can also be provided as a mixture such as a mixture of sucrose or xylose and depolymerized sugar beet pulp depolymerized cellulosic material and the like. The one or more carbon source s can be supplied at a concentration of at least about 50 M at least about 100 M at least about 250 M at least about 500 M at least about 1 mM at least about 2.5 mM at least about 5 mM at least about 10 mM at least about 25 mM at least about 50 mM at least about 100 mM at least 250 mM and at least about 500 mM of one or more exogenously provided fixed carbon source s . In some cases one or more carbon source s can be supplied as a feedstock for fed batch fermentation at a concentration of at least about 100 g L of at least about 200 g L of at least about 300 g L of at least about 400 g L at least about 500 g L at least about 600 g L at least about 700 g L at least about 800 g L or more or the exogenously provided fixed carbon source s into the fermentation culture. Carbon sources of particular interest for purposes of the present invention include xylose depolymerized cellulosic material glycerol glucose sucrose and sorghum each of which is discussed in more detail below.

In accordance with the present invention microorganisms can be cultured using depolymerized cellulosic biomass as a feedstock. Cellulosic biomass e.g. stover such as corn stover is inexpensive and readily available. Microalgae can grow on processed cellulosic material and microalgae of the invention are especially designed to utilize xylose as a carbon source with high efficiency. Cellulosic materials generally include about 40 60 cellulose about 20 40 hemicellulose and 10 30 lignin.

Suitable cellulosic materials include residues from herbaceous and woody energy crops as well as agricultural crops i.e. the plant parts primarily stalks and leaves not removed from the fields with the primary food or fiber product. Examples include agricultural wastes such as sugarcane bagasse rice hulls corn fiber including stalks leaves husks and cobs wheat straw rice straw sugar beet pulp citrus pulp citrus peels forestry wastes such as hardwood and softwood thinnings and hardwood and softwood residues from timber operations wood wastes such as saw mill wastes wood chips sawdust and pulp mill waste urban wastes such as paper fractions of municipal solid waste urban wood waste and urban green waste such as municipal grass clippings and wood construction waste. Additional cellulosics include dedicated cellulosic crops such as switchgrass hybrid poplar wood and miscanthus fiber cane and fiber sorghum. Five carbon sugars that are produced from such materials include xylose.

Cellulosic materials may be treated to increase the efficiency with which the microbe can utilize the sugar s contained within the materials. As discussed above lignocellulosic biomass is comprised of various fractions including cellulose a crystalline polymer of beta 1 4 linked glucose a six carbon sugar hemicellulose a more loosely associated polymer predominantly comprised of xylose a five carbon sugar and to a lesser extent mannose galactose arabinose lignin a complex aromatic polymer comprised of sinapyl alcohol and its derivatives and pectins which are linear chains of an alpha 1 4 linked polygalacturonic acid. Because of the polymeric structure of cellulose and hemicellulose the sugars e.g. monomeric glucose and xylose in them are not in a form that can be efficiently used metabolized by many microbes. For such microbes further processing of the cellulosic biomass to generate the monomeric sugars that make up the polymers can be very helpful to ensuring that the cellulosic materials are efficiently utilized as a feedstock carbon source .

Cellulose or cellulosic biomass can be subjected to a process termed explosion in which the biomass is treated with dilute sulfuric or other acid at elevated temperature and pressure. This process conditions the biomass such that it can be efficiently subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic fractions into glucose and xylose monomers. The resulting monomeric sugars are termed cellulosic sugars. Cellulosic sugars can subsequently be utilized by microorganisms to produce a variety of metabolites e.g. lipid . The acid explosion step results in a partial hydrolysis of the hemicellulose fraction to constitutent monosaccharides. These sugars can be completely liberated from the biomass with further treatment. In some embodiments the further treatment is a hydrothermal treatment that includes washing the exploded material with hot water which removes contaminants such as salts. This step is not necessary for cellulosic ethanol fermentations due to the more dilute sugar concentrations used in such processes. In other embodiments the further treatment is additional acid treatment. In still other embodiments the further treatment is enzymatic hydrolysis of the exploded material. These treatments can also be used in any combination. The type of treatment can affect the type of sugars liberated e.g. five carbon sugars versus six carbon sugars and the stage at which they are liberated in the process. As a consequence different streams of sugars whether they are predominantly five carbon or six carbon can be created. These enriched five carbon or six carbon streams can thus be directed to specific microorganisms with different carbon utilization cabilities. In certain embodiments of the methods of the present invention five carbon xylose enriched streams are preferred. In other embodiments different sugar streams containing five carbon sugars six carbon sugars or a combination of five carbon six carbon sugars that have been saccharified can be combined for use in microbial fermentation to produce high cell density lipid producing microbial biomass.

Embodiments of the present invention related to lipid production may involve fermentation to higher cell densities than what is achieved in ethanol fermentation. Because of the higher densities of the cultures for heterotrophic cellulosic oil production the fixed carbon source e.g. the cellulosic derived sugar stream s is preferably in a concentrated form. For example the glucose concentration or the xylose concentration or the sum of glucose and xylose concentration of the depolymerized cellulosic material can be at least about 100 g liter at least about 200 g liter at least about 300 g liter at least about 400 g liter at least about 500 g liter at least about 600 g liter at least about 700 g liter at least about 800 g liter or more of glucose or xylose or a combination of glucose and xylose in the feedstock prior to the cultivation step which is optionally a fed batch cultivation in which the material is fed to the cells over time as the cells grow and accumulate lipid. Various methods for such saccharification methods and other methods for processing cellulosics for use in microalgal fermentations are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

The explosion process treatment of the cellulosic material utilizes significant amounts of sulfuric acid heat and pressure thereby liberating by products of carbohydrates namely furfurals and hydroxymethyl furfurals. Furfurals and hydroxymethyl furfurals are produced during hydrolysis of hemicellulose through dehydration of xylose into furfural and water. While this loss of xylose is not desired in many embodiments of the methods of the present invention such that either a non explosion process is employed or the production of furfurals and hydroxymethyl furfurals is minimized when they are used these by products e.g. furfurals and hydroxymethyl furfurals can be removed from the saccharified lignocellulosic material prior to introduction into the bioreactor and the conductivities of the cellulosic materials resulting from the explosion process can be reduced by methods described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

In other embodiments the explosion process itself is changed so as to avoid the generation of salts at unacceptably high levels. For example a suitable alternative to sulfuric acid or other acid explosion of the cellulosic biomass is mechanical pulping to render the cellulosic biomass receptive to enzymatic hydrolysis saccharification . In still other embodiments native strains of microorganisms resistant to high levels of salts or genetically engineered strains with resistance to high levels of salts are used. A non limiting example of a method of treating cellulosic sugars so that it is suitable for use as a concentrated feedstock for the present invention is described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151538 hereby incorporated by reference. In one embodiment the saccharified lignocellulosic sugars have been treated to reduce both the toxins e.g. furfurals and hydroxymethyl furfurals and the salt level and then concentrated to a concentration of at least 600 g L or more sugar monomer in the concentrated sugar stream or fixed carbon source feedstock. In other embodiments such concentrated saccharified lignocellulosic sugars have a salt level of less than 700 mM sodium equivalents. In other embodiments such concentrated saccharified lignocellulosic sugars have a salt level of less than 100 mM sodium equivalents less than 200 mM sodium equivalents less than 300 mM sodium equivalents less than 400 mM sodium equivalents less than 500 mM sodium equivalents less than 600 mM sodium equivalents less than 700 mM sodium equivalents or less than 1000 mM sodium equivalents. In still other embodiments such concentrated saccharified lignocellulosic sugar feedstock has a conductivity of less than 20 000 S cm less than 15 000 S cm less than 10 000 S cm less than 7 500 S cm less than 5 000 S cm less than 1000 S cm less than 500 S cm less than 300 S cm or less than 200 S cm of conductivity. In still other embodiments such concentrated saccharified lignocellulosic sugar feedstock have been enriched for five carbon sugar monomers or six carbon sugar mononers or a combination of five and six carbon sugar monomers.

In another embodiment of the methods of the invention the carbon source includes glycerol such as acidulated and non acidulated glycerol byproduct from biodiesel transesterification. In one embodiment the carbon source includes glycerol and xylose. In some cases all of the glycerol and the xylose are provided to the microorganism at the beginning of the fermentation. In some cases the glycerol and the xylose are provided to the microorganism simultaneously at a predetermined ratio. In some cases the glycerol and the xylose are fed to the microbes at a predetermined rate over the course of fermentation.

Some microalgae undergo cell division faster in the presence of glycerol than in the presence of another carbon source such as glucose see PCT Pub. No. 2008 151149 . In instances where this is true for glycerol and xylose two stage growth processes in which cells are first fed glycerol to rapidly increase cell density and are then fed xylose to accumulate lipids can improve the efficiency with which lipids are produced. The use of the glycerol byproduct of the transesterification process provides significant economic advantages when put back into the production process. Other feeding methods are provided as well such as mixtures of glycerol and xylose. Feeding such mixtures also captures the same economic benefits. Thus the invention provides methods of feeding alternative sugars to microalgae such as xylose in various combinations with glycerol.

In various embodiments of the methods of the invention the carbon source is xylose including a complex feedstock containing xylose such as a cellulosics derived material. In one embodiment the culture medium further includes at least one xylose utilization enzyme. The use of complex feedstocks containing xylose can provide significant cost savings in the production of hydrocarbons and other oils.

For the production of oil in accordance with the methods of the invention it is preferable to culture cells in the dark or in the substantial absence of light as is the case for example when using extremely large 40 000 liter and higher fermentors that do not allow light to strike the culture. Obligate heterotroph species such as species of are grown and propagated for the production of oil in a medium containing a fixed carbon source and in the absence of light such growth is known as heterotrophic growth.

As an example an inoculum of lipid producing microalgal cells are introduced into the medium there is a lag period lag phase before the cells begin to propagate. Following the lag period the propagation rate increases steadily and enters the log or exponential phase. The exponential phase is in turn followed by a slowing of propagation due to decreases in nutrients such as nitrogen increases in toxic substances and quorum sensing mechanisms. After this slowing propagation stops and the cells enter a stationary phase or steady growth state depending on the particular environment provided to the cells. For obtaining lipid rich biomass the culture is typically harvested well after the end of the exponential phase which may be terminated early by allowing nitrogen or another key nutrient other than carbon to become depleted forcing the cells to convert the carbon sources present in excess to lipid. Culture condition parameters can be manipulated to optimize total oil production the combination of lipid species produced and or production of a specific oil.

As discussed above a bioreactor or fermentor is used to allow cells to undergo the various phases of their growth cycle. As an example an inoculum of lipid producing cells can be introduced into a medium followed by a lag period lag phase before the cells begin growth. Following the lag period the growth rate increases steadily and enters the log or exponential phase. The exponential phase is in turn followed by a slowing of growth due to decreases in nutrients and or increases in toxic substances. After this slowing growth stops and the cells enter a stationary phase or steady state depending on the particular environment provided to the cells. Lipid production by cells disclosed herein can occur during the log phase or thereafter including the stationary phase wherein nutrients are supplied or still available to allow the continuation of lipid production in the absence of cell division.

Preferably microorganisms grown using conditions described herein and known in the art comprise at least about 20 by weight of lipid at least about 40 by weight at least about 50 by weight at least about 60 by weight and at least about 70 by weight. Process conditions can be adjusted to increase the yield of lipids suitable for a particular use and or to reduce production cost. For example in certain embodiments a microalgae is cultured in the presence of a limiting concentration of one or more nutrients such as for example nitrogen phosphorous or sulfur while providing an excess of fixed carbon energy such as glucose. Nitrogen limitation tends to increase microbial lipid yield over microbial lipid yield in a culture in which nitrogen is provided in excess. In particular embodiments the increase in lipid yield is at least about 10 50 100 200 or 500 greater than obtained under nitrogen replete conditions. The microbe can be cultured in the presence of a limiting amount of a nutrient for a portion of the total culture period or for the entire period. In particular embodiments the nutrient concentration is cycled between a limiting concentration and a non limiting concentration at least twice during the total culture period. Lipid content of cells can be increased by continuing the culture for increased periods of time while providing an excess of carbon but limiting or no nitrogen.

In another embodiment lipid yield is increased by culturing a lipid producing microbe e.g. microalgae in the presence of one or more cofactor s for a lipid pathway enzyme e.g. a fatty acid synthetic enzyme . Generally the concentration of the cofactor s is sufficient to increase microbial lipid e.g. fatty acid yield over microbial lipid yield in the absence of the cofactor s . In a particular embodiment the cofactor s are provided to the culture by including in the culture a microbe e.g. microalgae containing an exogenous gene encoding the cofactor s . Alternatively cofactor s may be provided to a culture by including a microbe e.g. microalgae containing an exogenous gene that encodes a protein that participates in the synthesis of the cofactor. In certain embodiments suitable cofactors include any vitamin required by a lipid pathway enzyme such as for example biotin pantothenate. Genes encoding cofactors suitable for use in the invention or that participate in the synthesis of such cofactors are well known and can be introduced into microbes e.g. microalgae using constructs and techniques such as those described above.

The specific examples of bioreactors culture conditions and heterotrophic growth and propagation methods described herein can be combined in any suitable manner to improve efficiencies of microbial growth and lipid and or protein production.

Microalgal biomass with a high percentage of oil lipid accumulation by dry weight has been generated using different methods of culture which are known in the art see PCT Pub. No. 2008 151149 . Microalgal biomass generated by the culture methods described herein and useful in accordance with the present invention comprises at least 10 microalgal oil by dry weight. In some embodiments the microalgal biomass comprises at least 25 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 microalgal oil or at least 70 microalgal oil by dry weight. In some embodiments the microalgal biomass contains from 10 90 microalgal oil from 25 75 microalgal oil from 40 75 microalgal oil or from 50 70 microalgal oil by dry weight.

The microalgal oil of the biomass described herein or extracted from the biomass for use in the methods and compositions of the present invention can comprise glycerolipids with one or more distinct fatty acid ester side chains. Glycerolipids are comprised of a glycerol molecule esterified to one two or three fatty acid molecules which can be of varying lengths and have varying degrees of saturation. The length and saturation characteristics of the fatty acid molecules and the microalgal oils can be manipulated to modify the properties or proportions of the fatty acid molecules in the microalgal oils of the present invention via culture conditions or via lipid pathway engineering as described in more detail in Section V below. Thus specific blends of algal oil can be prepared either within a single species of algae by mixing together the biomass or algal oil from two or more species of microalgae or by blending algal oil of the invention with oils from other sources such as soy rapeseed canola palm palm kernel coconut corn waste vegetable Chinese tallow olive sunflower cottonseed chicken fat beef tallow porcine tallow microalgae macroalgae microbes flax peanut choice white grease lard mustard seed cashew nut oats lupine kenaf help coffee linseed flax hazelnut pumpkin seed coriander sesame safflower rice tung tree cocoa copra pium poppy castor beans pecan jojoba macadamia Brazil nuts avocado petroleum or a distillate fraction of any of the preceding oils.

The oil composition i.e. the properties and proportions of the fatty acid constituents of the glycerolipids can also be manipulated by combining biomass or oil from at least two distinct species of microalgae. In some embodiments at least two of the distinct species of microalgae have different glycerolipid profiles. The distinct species of microalgae can be cultured together or separately as described herein preferably under heterotrophic conditions to generate the respective oils. Different species of microalgae can contain different percentages of distinct fatty acid constituents in the cell s glycerolipids.

Generally wild type strains have very little or no fatty acids with the chain length C8 C14. For example UTEX 1435 UTEX 329 UTEX 1442 and UTEX 1438 contains no or undectable amounts C8 fatty acids between 0 0.01 C10 fatty acids between 0.03 2.1 C12 fatty acids and between 1.0 1.7 C14 fatty acids.

Microalgal oil can also include other constituents produced by the microalgae or incorporated into the microalgal oil from the culture medium. These other constituents can be present in varying amount depending on the culture conditions used to culture the microalgae the species of microalgae the extraction method used to recover microalgal oil from the biomass and other factors that may affect microalgal oil composition. Non limiting examples of such constituents include carotenoids present from 0.1 0.4 micrograms ml chlorophyll present from 0 0.02 milligrams kilogram of oil gamma tocopherol present from 0.4 0.6 milligrams 100 grams of oil and total tocotrienols present from 0.2 0.5 milligrams gram of oil.

The other constituents can include without limitation phospholipids tocopherols tocotrienols carotenoids e.g. alpha carotene beta carotene lycopene etc. xanthophylls e.g. lutein zeaxanthin alpha cryptoxanthin and beta crytoxanthin and various organic or inorganic compounds.

In some cases the oil extracted from species comprises no more than 0.02 mg kg chlorophyll. In some cases the oil extracted from species comprises no more than 0.4 mcg ml total carotenoids. In some cases the oil comprises between 0.40 0.60 milligrams of gamma tocopherol per 100 grams of oil. In other cases the oil comprises between 0.2 0.5 milligrams of total tocotrienols per gram of oil.

Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and materials for genetically modifying cells and recombinant host cells useful in the methods of the present invention including but not limited to recombinant oleaginous microorganisms microalgae and oleaginous microalgae such as and host cells. The description of these methods and materials is divided into subsections for the convenience of the reader. In subsection 1 transformation methods are described. In subsection 2 homologous recombination methods are described. In subsection 3 expression vectors and vector components are described.

Cells can be transformed by any suitable technique including e.g. biolistics electroporation see Maruyama et al. 2004 Biotechnology Techniques 8 821 826 glass bead transformation and silicon carbide whisker transformation. Another method that can be used involves forming protoplasts and using CaCland polyethylene glycol PEG to introduce recombinant DNA into microalgal cells see Kim et al. 2002 4 63 73 which reports the use of this method for the transformation of . Co transformation of microalgae can be used to introduce two distinct vector molecules into a cell simultaneously see for example Protist 2004 December 155 4 381 93 .

USA 1985 82 5824 5828 use of a laser beam microinjection or any other method capable of introducing DNA into a microalgae can also be used for transformation of a cell.

Homologous recombination refers to the ability of complementary DNA sequences in a host cell to align and exchange regions of homology. Transgenic DNA donor containing sequences homologous to the genomic sequences being targeted template is introduced into the host cell and then undergoes recombination into the genome at the site of the corresponding genomic homologous sequences. The mechanistic steps of this process in most cases include 1 pairing of homologous DNA segments 2 introduction of double stranded breaks into the donor DNA molecule 3 invasion of the template DNA molecule by the free donor DNA ends followed by DNA synthesis and 4 resolution of double strand break repair events that result in final recombination products.

The ability to carry out homologous recombination in a host organism has many practical implications for what can be carried out at the molecular genetic level and is useful in the generation of an oleaginous microbe that can produced tailored oils. By its very nature homologous recombination is a precise gene targeting event hence most transgenic lines generated with the same targeting sequence will be essentially identical in terms of phenotype necessitating the screening of far fewer transformation events. Homologous recombination also targets gene insertion events into the host chromosome resulting in excellent genetic stability even in the absence of genetic selection. Because different chromosomal loci can impact gene expression even from heterologous promoters UTRs homologous recombination can be a method of querying loci in an unfamiliar genome environment and to assess the impact of these environments on gene expression.

Particularly useful genetic engineering applications using homologous recombination is to co opt specific host regulatory elements such as promoters UTRs to drive heterologous gene expression in a highly specific fashion. For example precise ablation of the endogenous stearoyl ACP desaturase gene with a heterologous C12 0 specific FATB thioesterase gene cassette and suitable selective marker might be expected to dramatically decrease endogenous levels of C18 1 fatty acids concomitant with increased levels of the C12 0 fatty acids. See U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

Because homologous recombination is a precise gene targeting event it can be used to modify any nucleotide s within a gene or region of interest precisely so long as sufficient flanking regions have been identified. Therefore homologous recombination can be used as a means to modify regulatory sequences impacting gene expression of RNA and or proteins. It can also be used to modify protein coding regions in an effort to modify enzyme activities such as substrate specificity affinities and Km and thus affecting the desired change in metabolism of the host cell. Homologous recombination provides a powerful means to manipulate the gost genome resulting in gene targeting gene conversion gene deletion gene duplication gene inversion and the exchange of gene expression regulatory elements such as promoters enhancers and 3 UTRs.

Homologous recombination can be achieved by using targeting constructs containing pieces of endogenous sequences to target the gene or region of interest within the endogenous host cell genome. Such targeting sequences can either be located 5 of the gene or region of interest 3 of the gene region of interest or can flank the gene region of interest. Such targeting constructs can be transformed into the host cell either as a supercoiled plasmid DNA with additional vector backbone a PCR product with no vector backbone or as a linearized molecule. In some cases it may be advantageous to first expose the homologous sequences within the transgenic DNA donor DNA with a restriction enzyme. This step can increase the recombination efficiency and decrease the occurrence of undesired events. Other methods of increasing recombination efficiency include using PCR to generate transforming transgenic DNA containing linear ends homologous to the genomic sequences being targeted.

Vectors for transformation of microorganisms in accordance with the present invention can be prepared by known techniques familiar to those skilled in the art in view of the disclosure herein. A vector typically contains one or more genes in which each gene codes for the expression of a desired product the gene product and is operably linked to or contains one or more control sequences that regulate gene expression or target the gene product to a particular location in the recombinant cell. To aid the reader this subsection is divided into subsections. Subsection A describes control sequences typically contained on vectors as well as control sequences for use particularly in microalgae such as . Subsection B describes genes typically contained in vectors as well as codon optimization methods and genes prepared using them for use particularly in microalgae such as

Control sequences are nucleic acids that regulate the expression of a coding sequence or direct a gene product to a particular location in or outside a cell. Control sequences that regulate expression include for example promoters that regulate transcription of a coding sequence and terminators that terminate transcription of a coding sequence. Another control sequence is a 3 untranslated sequence located at the end of a coding sequence that encodes a polyadenylation signal. Control sequences that direct gene products to particular locations include those that encode signal peptides which direct the protein to which they are attached to a particular location in or outside the cell.

Thus an exemplary vector design for expression of an exogenous gene in a microalgae contains a coding sequence for a desired gene product for example a selectable marker a lipid pathway modification enzyme or a xylose utilization enzyme in operable linkage with a promoter active in microalgae. Alternatively if the vector does not contain a promoter in operable linkage with the coding sequence of interest the coding sequence can be transformed into the cells such that it becomes operably linked to an endogenous promoter at the point of vector integration.

Many promoters are active in microalgae including promoters that are endogenous to the algae being transformed as well as promoters that are not endogenous to the algae being transformed i.e. promoters from other algae promoters from higher plants and promoters from plant viruses or algae viruses . Illustrative exogenous and or endogenous promoters that are active in microalgae as well as antibiotic resistance genes functional in microalgae are described in PCT Pub. No. 2008 151149 and references cited therein . See also U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

The promoter used to express an exogenous gene can be the promoter naturally linked to that gene or can be a heterologous promoter. Some promoters are active in more than one species of microalgae. Other promoters are species specific. Illustrative promoters include promoters such as tubulin from used in the Examples below and viral promoters such as cauliflower mosaic virus CMV and chlorella virus which have been shown to be active in multiple species of microalgae see for example Plant Cell Rep. 2005 March 23 10 11 727 35 J Microbiol. 2005 August 43 4 361 5 Mar Biotechnol NY . 2002 January 4 1 63 73 . Another promoter that is suitable for use for expression of exogenous genes in is the glutamate dehydrogenase promoter 5 UTR SEQ ID NO 10 . Optionally at least 10 20 30 40 50 or 60 nucleotides or more of these sequences containing a promoter are used. Illustrative promoters useful for expression of exogenous genes in are listed in the sequence listing of this application such as the promoter of the HUP1 gene SEQ ID NO 11 and the nitrate reductase promoter SEQ ID NO 12 . virus promoters can also be used to express genes in such as SEQ ID NOs 1 7 of U.S. Pat. No. 6 395 965. Additional promoters active in can be found for example in Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Oct. 14 204 1 187 94 Plant Mol Biol. 1994 October 26 1 85 93 Virology. 2004 Aug. 15 326 1 150 9 and Virology. 2004 Jan. 5 318 1 214 23.

A promoter can generally be characterized as either constitutive or inducible. Constitutive promoters are generally active or function to drive expression at all times or at certain times in the cell life cycle at the same level. Inducible promoters conversely are active or rendered inactive or are significantly up or down regulated only in response to a stimulus. Both types of promoters find application in the methods of the invention. Inducible promoters useful in the invention include those that mediate transcription of an operably linked gene in response to a stimulus such as an exogenously provided small molecule e.g. glucose as in SEQ ID NO 11 temperature heat or cold lack of nitrogen in culture media etc. Suitable promoters can activate transcription of an essentially silent gene or upregulate preferably substantially transcription of an operably linked gene that is transcribed at a low level.

Inclusion of termination region control sequence is optional and if employed then the choice is be primarily one of convenience as the termination region is relatively interchangeable. The termination region may be native to the transcriptional initiation region the promoter may be native to the DNA sequence of interest or may be obtainable from another source. See for example Chen and Orozco Nucleic Acids Res. 1988 16 8411.

The present invention also provides control sequences and recombinant genes and vectors containing them that provide for the compartmentalized expression of a gene of interest. Organelles for targeting are chloroplasts plastids mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. In addition the present invention provides control sequences and recombinant genes and vectors containing them that provide for the secretion of a protein outside the cell.

Proteins expressed in the nuclear genome of can be targeted to the plastid using plastid targeting signals. Plastid targeting sequences endogenous to are known such as genes in the nuclear genome that encode proteins that are targeted to the plastid see for example GenBank Accession numbers AY646197 and AF499684 and in one embodiment such control sequences are used in the vectors of the present invention to target expression of a protein to a plastid.

The use of algal plastid targeting sequences to target heterologous proteins to the correct compartment in the host cell has been described. See Examples 11 and 12 of U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112. In one embodiment the native plastid targeting sequence of the heterologous protein is used to traffick the heterologous protein to the plastid chloroplast. In some embodiment the native plastid targeting sequences are replaced with heterologous plastid targeting sequences in order to increase the trafficking of the recombinant or heterologous proteins into the plastid chloroplast. In some embodiments native plastid targeting sequences are replaced with plastid targeting sequences of microalgal proteins. Sequences were BLASTed and analyzed for homology to known proteins that traffic to the plastid chloroplast. The cDNAs encoding these proteins were cloned and plastid targeting sequences were isolated from these cDNAs. Such algal plastid targeting sequences can be used in expression vectors useful in the cells and methods of the invention.

In another embodiment of the present invention the expression of a polypeptide in is targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum. The inclusion of an appropriate retention or sorting signal in an expression vector ensure that proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ER and do not go downstream into Golgi. For example the IMPACTVECTOR1.3 vector from Wageningen UR Plant Research International includes the well known KDEL retention or sorting signal. With this vector ER retention has a practical advantage in that it has been reported to improve expression levels 5 fold or more. The main reason for this appears to be that the ER contains lower concentrations and or different proteases responsible for post translational degradation of expressed proteins than are present in the cytoplasm. ER retention signals functional in green microalgae are known. For example see Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2005 Apr. 26 102 17 6225 30.

In another embodiment of the present invention a polypeptide is targeted for secretion outside the cell into the culture media. See Hawkins et al. Current Microbiology Vol. 38 1999 pp. 335 341 for examples of secretion signals active in that can be used in accordance with the methods of the invention in

Typically a gene includes a promoter coding sequence and termination control sequences. When assembled by recombinant DNA technology a gene may be termed an expression cassette and may be flanked by restriction sites for convenient insertion into a vector that is used to introduce the recombinant gene into a host cell. The expression cassette can be flanked by DNA sequences from the genome or other nucleic acid target to facilitate stable integration of the expression cassette into the genome by homologous recombination. Alternatively the vector and its expression cassette may remain unintegrated in which case the vector typically includes an origin of replication which is capable of providing for replication of the heterologous vector DNA.

A common gene present on a vector is a gene that codes for a protein the expression of which allows the recombinant cell containing the protein to be differentiated from cells that do not express the protein. Such a gene and its corresponding gene product is called a selectable marker. Selectable markers can be employed in a transgene construct useful for transforming . Examples of suitable selectable markers include the G418 resistance gene the nitrate reductase gene see Dawson et al. 1997 Current Microbiology 35 356 362 the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene HPT see Kim et al. 2002 Mar. Biotechnol. 4 63 73 the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and the ble gene which confers resistance to phleomycin Huang et al. 2007 Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 72 197 205 . Methods of determining sensitivity of microalgae to antibiotics are well known. For example Mol Gen Genet. 1996 Oct. 16 252 5 572 9.

For purposes of the present invention the expression vector used to prepare a recombinant host cell of embodiments of the invention can include at least two and often three genes if one of the genes is a selectable marker. For example a genetically engineered of the invention can be made by transformation with vectors of the invention that comprise in addition to a selectable marker one or more exogenous genes such as for example a xylose utilization gene or a a xylose utilization gene and an acyl ACP thioesterase gene. One or both genes can be expressed using an inducible promoter which allow the relative timing of expression of these genes to be controlled to enhance the lipid yield and conversion to fatty acid esters. Expression of the two or more exogenous genes may be under control of the same inducible promoter or under control of different inducible or constitutive promoters. In the latter situation expression of a first exogenous gene can be induced for a first period of time during which expression of a second exogenous gene may or may not be induced and expression of a second exogenous gene can be induced for a second period of time during which expression of a first exogenous gene may or may not be induced .

In other embodiments the two or more exogenous genes in addition to any selectable marker are a xylose utilization gene a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase a keto acyl ACP synthase a steroyl ACP desturase a fatty acid desaturase and a fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase the combined action of which yields an alcohol product. Further provided are other combinations of exogenous genes in addition to the xylose utilization gene including without limitation a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase and a fatty acyl CoA reductase to generate aldehydes. In one embodiment the vector provides in addition to the xylose utilization gene for the combination of a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase a fatty acyl CoA reductase and a fatty aldehyde decarbonylase to generate alkanes. In each of these embodiments one or more of the exogenous genes can be expressed using an inducible promoter.

Other illustrative vectors that express two or more exogenous genes include those encoding both a xylose utilization enzyme and a selectable marker. The recombinant transformed with vectors of the invention can be used to produce lipids at lower manufacturing cost due to the engineered ability to use xylose as a carbon source. Insertion of exogenous genes as described above can be combined with the disruption of polysaccharide biosynthesis through directed and or random mutagenesis which steers even greater carbon flux into lipid production. Individually and in combination trophic conversion engineering to alter lipid production and treatment with exogenous enzymes alter the lipid composition produced by a microorganism. The alteration can be a change in the amount of lipids produced the amount of one or more hydrocarbon species produced relative to other lipids and or the types of lipid species produced in the microorganism. For example microalgae can be engineered to produce a higher amount and or percentage of TAGs.

For optimal expression of a recombinant protein it is beneficial to employ coding sequences that produce mRNA with codons preferentially used by the host cell to be transformed. Thus proper expression of transgenes can require that the codon usage of the transgene matches the specific codon bias of the organism in which the transgene is being expressed. The precise mechanisms underlying this effect are many but include the proper balancing of available aminoacylated tRNA pools with proteins being synthesized in the cell coupled with more efficient translation of the transgenic messenger RNA mRNA when this need is met. When codon usage in the transgene is not optimized available tRNA pools are not sufficient to allow for efficient translation of the heterologous mRNA resulting in ribosomal stalling and termination and possible instability of the transgenic mRNA.

The present invention provides codon optimized nucleic acids useful for the successful expression of recombinant proteins in . Codon usage in species was analyzed by studying cDNA sequences isolated from . This analysis represents the interrogation over 24 000 codons and resulted in Table 1 below.

In other embodiments the gene in the recombinant vector has been codon optimized with reference to a microalgal strain other than a strain. For example methods of recoding genes for expression in microalgae are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 135 290. Additional information for codon optimization is available e.g. at the codon usage database of GenBank.

While the methods and materials of the invention allow for the introduction of any exogenous gene into genes relating to xylose utilization and lipid pathway modification are of particular interest as discussed in the following sections.

An embodiment of the present invention also provides recombinant oleaginous microbes that have been modified to alter the ability of the microbe to metabolize different feedstocks that include pentose sugars such as xylose which is abundant in cellulosic sources. Such recombinant oleaginous microbes include those that have plastids and type II fatty acid synthesis pathways are of the kingdom Plantae microalgae oleaginous yeast oleaginous bacteria and oleaginous fungi. In some embodiments the recombinant oleaginous microbe is a microalgae. In other embodiments the recombinant oleaginous microbe is a microalgae of the genus . In one embodiment the recombinant oleaginous microbe is genetically engineered to contain one or more exogenous genes that are involved in xylose utilization. Genes involved in xylose utilization are described in detail below. It is contemplated in one or more embodiments of the invention that the genes involved in xylose utilization can be used alone or in combination with other genes that involve xylose utilization without limit to the number or combination s of such genes. It is contemplated in one or more embodiments of the invention that genes involved in xylose utilization can be used in combination with other exogenous genes that involve utilization of other carbon sources or lipid production without limit to the number or combination s of such genes.

In one embodiment the recombinant cell of the invention further contains one or more exogenous xylose utilization genes. There are at least two different pathways utilized by eukaryotic organisms to metabolize xylose. One such pathway is the oxo reductive oxidoreductase pathway or aldo keto reductase pathway. In the first step in this pathway D xylose is reduced into xylitol by xylose reductase. Xylitol is then oxidized into xylulose by xylitol dehydrogenase. Xylulose is then converted into xylulose 5 phosphate by xylulose kinase and then metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway. Another pathway that is utilized to metabolize xylose is the xylose isomerase pathway. In the first step in the xylose isomerase pathway xylose is isomerized into xylulose by xylose isomerase. Xylulose is then converted into xylulose 5 phosphate by xyulose kinase. Xylulose 5 phosphate is then metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway.

In some organisms one or more of these pathways exist and are utilized in concert. In some organisms both the oxo reductive pathway and the xylose isomerase pathways exist. In such organisms the production of xylitol may inhibit xylose isomerase activity. In such cases xylitol dehydrogenase is expressed to relieve such inhibition.

In organisms that do not utilize xylose or are unable to utilize xylose in an efficient manner one or both of the above pathways may not exist or only exist partially in these organisms. Genetically engineering such organisms to efficiently utilize xylose may encompass the introduction of one or several or all members of one or both of these pathways. The introduction of a transporter protein may be necessary to transport xylose or more efficiently transport xylose into the cell from the extracellular environment. A transporter protein including a transporter protein that has specificity for pentose sugars such as xylose is a family of cell membrane proteins and genes encoding such proteins that transport sugars such as xylose from the extracellular environment such as the culture medium into the cytosol of the cell. A transporter may be active or passive. Passive transporters facilitate the transport of molecule s down a concentration gradient from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration without energy consumption. In some embodiments the transporter is a pentose transporter having specificity for pentose sugars. In other embodiments the transporter is a transporter derived from . In still other embodiments the transporter is derived from SUT1 without limitation GenBank Accession number XP 001387 hereby incorporated by this reference SEQ ID NO 37 SUT2 and or SUT3 transporters or from the HXT transporters. Active transporters consume energy in transporting molecules usually against a concentration gradient. Active transporters include without limitation primary active transporters which use ATP as an energy source i.e. ATP binding cassette ABC transporters and secondary active transporters which use energy from chemiosmotic gradients and include without limitation antiporters and symporters i.e. the GXS1 protein SEQ ID NO 39 of without limitation GenBank Accession number CAI44932.1 hereby incorporated by this reference and the H symporter like proteins e.g. SEQ ID NO 41 . In some embodiments the transporter is derived from the At5g59250n gene from . In other embodiments the transporter is derived from the gene encoding the XLT1 protein SEQ ID NO 43 from

Additionally the introduction of a transporter protein e.g. xylulose 5 phosphate translocator may also be necessary or preferred in order to distribute the correct substrate into the correct subcompartment of the microbe. Pentose sugar metabolism is thought to occur through the pentose phosphate pathway which occurs mainly in the plastid. Such translocators are a family of plastidic membrane proteins and genes encoding such proteins that transport hexose triose or pentose or phosphate versions of these molecules from the cytosol to the plastid. In one embodiment such a translocator has a preference for pentose or pentose phosphate molecules over hexose hexose phosphate or triose triose phosphate. In another embodiment the translocator is derived from a gene encoding a xylulose 5 phosphate translocator protein. In another embodiment the translocator is derived from the XPT gene from . In some cases the translocator is a chimeric protein comprising a transit peptide endogenous to the microbe being engineered to utilize xylose. For example chimeric translocators with a transit peptide endogenous to e.g. SEQ ID NOs 45 47 and 49 are useful in some embodiments.

In some embodiments the heterologous exogenous gene that is introduced into the microorganism is a part of the oxo reductive or aldo keto reductase pathway. In some cases the heterologous exogenous gene is a xylose reductase. In other cases the heterologous exogenous gene is a xylitol dehydrogenase. In other embodiments the xylitol dehydrogenase is the XYL2 gene from

In other embodiments the heterologous exogenous gene that is introduced into the microorganism is part of the xylose isomerase pathway. In some cases the heterologous exogenous gene is a xylose isomerase. In some embodiments the xylose isomerase is encoded by the XYLA gene from sp. In other embodiments the heterologous exogenous gene is a xylulose kinase. In some embodiments the xylulose kinase is encoded by the XYL3 gene from

In some embodiments the heterologous exogenous gene encodes a translocator protein. In other embodiments such translocator is a pentose phosphate translocator. In still other embodiments the pentose phosphate translocator is encoded by the XPT gene from . In still other embodiments the genetically engineered microorganism comprises one or more of the foregoing exogenous heterologous genes. In other embodiments the genetically engineered microorganism comprises all of the foregoing exogenous heterologous genes.

Example 3 below demonstrates the successful introduction of different members of the xylose isomerase pathway proteins oxo reductive pathway enzymes and a xylose translocator into microalgae to produce a genetically engineered microalgae cells that can utilize xylose as a fixed carbon source when grown under heterotrophic conditions.

Example 7 demonstrates the introduction of various combinations of xylose transporters xylose oxidoreductase isomerase enzymes and xylose translocators see Table 6 into . Example 8 demonstrates the lipid production capability of several selected strains.

In some embodiments the cell may further contain one or more exogenous sucrose utilization genes as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112. Such a cell can metabolize both xylose and sucrose.

In addition to altering the ability of to utilize feedstocks such as xylose containing feedstocks the present invention also provides recombinant that have been further modified to alter the properties and or proportions of lipids produced. The pathway can further or alternatively be modified to alter the properties and or proportions of various lipid molecules produced through enzymatic processing of lipids and intermediates in the fatty acid pathway. In various embodiments the recombinant cells of the invention have relative to their untransformed counterparts optimized lipid yield per unit volume and or per unit time carbon chain length e.g. for renewable diesel production or for industrial chemicals applications requiring lipid feedstock reduced number of double or triple bonds optionally to zero and increasing the hydrogen carbon ratio of a particular species of lipid or of a population of distinct lipid.

In particular embodiments one or more key enzymes that control metabolism to fatty acid synthesis have been up regulated or down regulated to improve lipid production. Up regulation can be achieved for example by transforming cells with expression constructs in which a gene encoding the enzyme of interest is expressed e.g. using a strong promoter and or enhancer elements that increase transcription. Such constructs can include a selectable marker such that the transformants can be subjected to selection which can result in maintenance or amplification of the construct and an increase in the expression level of the encoded enzyme. Examples of enzymes suitable for up regulation according to the methods of the invention are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

Up and or down regulation of genes can be applied to global regulators controlling the expression of the genes of the fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. Accordingly one or more global regulators of fatty acid synthesis can be up or down regulated as appropriate to inhibit or enhance respectively the expression of a plurality of fatty acid synthetic genes and ultimately to increase lipid production. Examples include sterol regulatory element binding proteins SREBPs such as SREBP 1a and SREBP 1c for examples see Genbank accession numbers NP 035610 and Q9WTN3 .

Embodiments of the present invention also provide recombinant microalgal cells that have been modified to contain one or more exogenous genes encoding lipid modification enzymes such as for example fatty acyl ACP thioesterases fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductases fatty acyl CoA reductases fatty aldehyde decarbonylase fatty aldehyde reductases and squalene synthases see U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112 .

Thus in particular embodiments microbes of the present invention are genetically engineered to express a xylose utilization gene as well as one or more exogenous genes selected from an acyl ACP thioesterase an acyl CoA aldehyde reductase a fatty acyl CoA reductase a fatty aldehyde reductase a fatty aldehyde decarbonylase or a naturally co expressed acyl carrier protein. Suitable expression methods are described above with respect to the expression of a lipase gene including among other methods inducible expression and compartmentalized expression. A fatty acyl ACP thioesterase cleaves a fatty acid from an acyl carrier protein ACP during lipid synthesis. Through further enzymatic processing the cleaved fatty acid is then combined with a coenzyme to yield an acyl CoA molecule. This acyl CoA is the substrate for the enzymatic activity of a fatty acyl CoA reductase to yield an aldehyde as well as for a fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase to yield an alcohol. The aldehyde produced by the action of the fatty acyl CoA reductase identified above is the substrate for further enzymatic activity by either a fatty aldehyde reductase to yield an alcohol or a fatty aldehyde decarbonylase to yield an alkane or alkene.

In some embodiments fatty acids glycerolipids or the corresponding primary alcohols aldehydes alkanes or alkenes generated by the methods described herein contain 8 10 12 or 14 carbon atoms. Preferred fatty acids for the production of diesel biodiesel renewable diesel or jet fuel or the corresponding primary alcohols aldehydes alkanes and alkenes for industrial applications contain 8 to 14 carbon atoms. In certain embodiments the above fatty acids as well as the other corresponding hydrocarbon molecules are saturated with no carbon carbon double or triple bonds mono unsaturated single double bond poly unsaturated two or more double bonds are linear not cyclic or branched. For fuel production greater saturation is preferred.

The enzymes described directly above have a preferential specificity for hydrolysis of a substrate containing a specific number of carbon atoms. For example a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase may have a preference for cleaving a fatty acid having 12 carbon atoms from the ACP. In some embodiments the ACP and the length specific thioesterase may have an affinity for one another that makes them particularly useful as a combination e.g. the exogenous ACP and thioesterase genes may be naturally co expressed in a particular tissue or organism from which they are derived . Therefore in various embodiments a recombinant cell of an embodiment of the invention can contain an exogenous gene that encodes a protein with specificity for catalyzing an enzymatic activity e.g. cleavage of a fatty acid from an ACP reduction of an acyl CoA to an aldehyde or an alcohol or conversion of an aldehyde to an alkane or the gene product of a KAS SAD or FAD gene with regard to the number of carbon atoms and saturation pattern contained in the substrate. See U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112 for various vectors and methods for expressing an exogenous thioesterase. Thus in an embodiment of the present invention a genetically modified cell both metabolizes xylose and produces an altered fatty acid profile i.e. distribution of chain length and or saturation pattern in fatty acids produced by the cell .

Thus the present invention provides a cell and in specific embodiments a cell that has been genetically engineered to express a xylose utilization enzyme and one or more lipid pathway enzymes at an altered level compared to a wild type cell of the same species. In some cases the cell produces more lipid compared to the wild type cell when both cells are grown under the same conditions. In some cases the cell has been genetically engineered and or selected to express a lipid pathway enzyme at a higher level than the wild type cell. In some cases the lipid pathway enzyme is selected from the group consisting of pyruvate dehydrogenase acetyl CoA carboxylase acyl carrier protein and glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase. In some cases the cell has been genetically engineered and or selected to express a lipid pathway enzyme at a lower level than the wild type cell. In at least one embodiment in which the cell expresses the lipid pathway enzyme at a lower level the lipid pathway enzyme comprises citrate synthase.

In some embodiments the cell has been genetically engineered and or selected to express a global regulator of fatty acid synthesis at an altered level compared to the wild type cell whereby the expression levels of a plurality of fatty acid synthetic genes are altered compared to the wild type cell. In some cases the lipid pathway enzyme comprises an enzyme that modifies a fatty acid. In some cases the lipid pathway enzyme is selected from a stearoyl ACP desaturase and a glycerolipid desaturase.

In other embodiments the present invention is directed to an oil producing microbe containing one or more exogenous genes wherein the exogenous genes encode protein s selected from xylose utilization enzymes as well as proteins selected from the group consisting of a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase a fatty acyl CoA reductase a fatty aldehyde reductase a fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase a fatty aldehyde decarbonylase and an acyl carrier protein. In one embodiment the exogenous gene is in operable linkage with a promoter that is inducible or repressible in response to a stimulus. In some cases the stimulus is selected from the group consisting of an exogenously provided small molecule heat cold and limited or no nitrogen in the culture media. In some cases the exogenous gene is expressed in a cellular compartment. In some embodiments the cellular compartment is selected from the group consisting of a chloroplast a plastid and a mitochondrion. In some embodiments the microbe is or . Various exogenous gene and gene combinations for lipid pathway modification are described in U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

An embodiment of the present invention also provides methods for producing an alcohol comprising culturing a population of recombinant cells in a culture medium wherein the cells contain a first exogenous gene encoding a xylose utilization enzyme a second exogenous gene encoding a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase and a third exogenous gene encoding a fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase and the cells synthesize a fatty acid linked to an acyl carrier protein ACP the fatty acyl ACP thioesterase catalyzes the cleavage of the fatty acid from the ACP to yield through further processing a fatty acyl CoA and the fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase catalyzes the reduction of the acyl CoA to an alcohol.

An embodiment of the present invention also provides methods of producing an aldehyde in a cell. In one embodiment the method comprises culturing a population of cells in a culture medium wherein the cells contain a first exogenous gene encoding a xylose utilization enzyme a second exogenous gene encoding a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase and a third exogenous gene encoding a fatty acyl CoA reductase and the cells synthesize a fatty acid linked to an acyl carrier protein ACP the fatty acyl ACP thioesterase catalyzes the cleavage of the fatty acid from the ACP to yield through further processing a fatty acyl CoA and the fatty acyl CoA reductase catalyzes the reduction of the acyl CoA to an aldehyde.

An embodiment of the present invention also provides methods of producing a fatty acid molecule having a specified carbon chain length in a cell that contains an exogenous xylose utilization gene. In one embodiment the method comprises culturing a population of lipid producing cells in a culture medium wherein the microbes contain an exogenous gene encoding an exogenous xylose utilization gene and a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase having an activity specific or preferential to a certain carbon chain length such as 8 10 12 or 14 carbon atoms and wherein the microbes synthesize a fatty acid linked to an acyl carrier protein ACP and the thioesterase catalyzes the cleavage of the fatty acid from the ACP when the fatty acid has been synthesized to the specific carbon chain length.

In the various embodiments described above the cell can contain at least one exogenous gene encoding a lipid pathway enzyme. In some cases the lipid pathway enzyme is selected from the group consisting of a stearoyl ACP desaturase a glycerolipid desaturase a pyruvate dehydrogenase an acetyl CoA carboxylase an acyl carrier protein and a glycerol 3 phosphate acyltransferase. In other cases the cell contains a lipid modification enzyme selected from the group consisting of a fatty acyl ACP thioesterase a fatty acyl CoA aldehyde reductase a fatty acyl CoA reductase a fatty aldehyde reductase a fatty aldehyde decarbonylase and or an acyl carrier protein.

For the production of fuel in accordance with the embodiments of the invention lipids produced by cells of the invention are harvested or otherwise collected by any convenient means. Lipids can be isolated by whole cell extraction. The cells are first disrupted and then intracellular and cell membrane cell wall associated lipids as well as extracellular hydrocarbons can be separated from the cell mass such as by use of centrifugation as described above. Intracellular lipids produced in microorganisms are in some embodiments extracted after lysing the cells of the microorganism. Once extracted the lipids are further refined to produce oils fuels or oleochemicals.

After completion of culturing the microorganisms can be separated from the fermentation broth. Optionally the separation is effected by centrifugation to generate a concentrated paste. The biomass can then optionally be washed with a washing solution e.g. DI water to get rid of the fermentation broth and debris. Optionally the washed microbial biomass may also be dried oven dried lyophilized etc. prior to cell disruption. Alternatively cells can be lysed without separation from some or all of the fermentation broth when the fermentation is complete. For example the cells can be at a ratio of less than 1 1 v v cells to extracellular liquid when the cells are lysed.

Microorganisms containing a lipid can be lysed to produce a lysate. As detailed herein the step of lysing a microorganism also referred to as cell lysis can be achieved by any convenient means including heat induced lysis adding a base adding an acid using enzymes such as proteases and polysaccharide degradation enzymes using ultrasound mechanical lysis using osmotic shock infection with a lytic virus and or expression of one or more lytic genes. Lysis is performed to release intracellular molecules which have been produced by the microorganism. Each of these methods for lysing a microorganism can be used as a single method or in combination simultaneously or sequentially. The extent of cell disruption can be observed by microscopic analysis. Using one or more of the methods described herein typically more than 70 cell breakage is observed. Preferably cell breakage is more than 80 more preferably more than 90 and most preferred about 100 .

In particular embodiments the microorganism is lysed after growth for example to increase the exposure of cellular lipid and or hydrocarbon for extraction or further processing. The timing of lipase expression e.g. via an inducible promoter or cell lysis can be adjusted to optimize the yield of lipids and or hydrocarbons. Below are described a number of lysis techniques. These techniques can be used individually or in combination.

In one embodiment of the present invention the step of lysing a microorganism comprises heating of a cellular suspension containing the microorganism. In this embodiment the fermentation broth containing the microorganisms or a suspension of microorganisms isolated from the fermentation broth is heated until the microorganisms i.e. the cell walls and membranes of microorganisms degrade or breakdown. Typically temperatures applied are at least 50 C. Higher temperatures such as at least 60 C. at least 70 C. at least 80 C. at least 90 C. at least 100 C. at least 110 C. at least 120 C. at least 130 C. or higher are used for more efficient cell lysis. Lysing cells by heat treatment can be performed by boiling the microorganism. Alternatively heat treatment without boiling can be performed in an autoclave. The heat treated lysate may be cooled for further treatment. Cell disruption can also be performed by steam treatment i.e. through addition of pressurized steam. Steam treatment of microalgae for cell disruption is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 750 048. In some embodiments steam treatment may be achieved by sparging steam into the fermentor and maintaining the broth at a desired temperature for less than about 90 minutes preferably less than about 60 minutes and more preferably less than about 30 minutes.

In another embodiment of the present invention the step of lysing a microorganism comprises adding a base to a cellular suspension containing the microorganism. The base should be strong enough to hydrolyze at least a portion of the proteinaceous compounds of the microorganisms used. Bases which are useful for solubilizing proteins are known in the art of chemistry. Exemplary bases which are useful in the methods of the present invention include but are not limited to hydroxides carbonates and bicarbonates of lithium sodium potassium calcium and mixtures thereof. A preferred base is KOH. Base treatment of microalgae for cell disruption is described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6 750 048.

In another embodiment of the present invention the step of lysing a microorganism comprises adding an acid to a cellular suspension containing the microorganism. Acid lysis can be effected using an acid at a concentration of 10 500 mN or preferably 40 160 mN. Acid lysis is preferably performed at above room temperature e.g. at 40 160 and preferably a temperature of 50 130 . For moderate temperatures e.g. room temperature to 100 C. and particularly room temperature to 65 acid treatment can usefully be combined with sonication or other cell disruption methods.

In another embodiment of the present invention the step of lysing a microorganism comprises lysing the microorganism by using an enzyme. Preferred enzymes for lysing a microorganism are proteases and polysaccharide degrading enzymes such as hemicellulase e.g. hemicellulase from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. H2125 pectinase e.g. pectinase from sp. Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. P2401 Mannaway 4.0 L Novozymes cellulase e.g. cellulose from Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. C9422 and driselase e.g. driselase from sp. Sigma Aldrich St. Louis Mo. D9515.

In other embodiments of the present invention lysis is accomplished using an enzyme such as for example a cellulase such as a polysaccharide degrading enzyme optionally from or a virus or a proteases such as protease chymotrypsin proteinase K proteases listed in Degradation of Polylactide by Commercial Proteases Oda Y et al. Journal of Polymers and the Environment Volume 8 Number 1 January 2000 pp. 29 32 4 Alcalase 2.4 FG Novozymes and Flavourzyme 100 L Novozymes . Any combination of a protease and a polysaccharide degrading enzyme can also be used including any combination of the preceding proteases and polysaccharide degrading enzymes.

Lysis can be performed using an expeller press. In this process biomass is forced through a screw type device at high pressure lysing the cells and causing the intracellular lipid to be released and separated from the protein and fiber and other components in the cell. See PCT patent application number U.S. Ser. No. 10 031 108 incorporated herein by reference.

In some cases the step of lysing a microorganism is performed by using ultrasound i.e. sonication. Thus cells can also by lysed with high frequency sound. The sound can be produced electronically and transported through a metallic tip to an appropriately concentrated cellular suspension. This sonication or ultrasonication disrupts cellular integrity based on the creation of cavities in cell suspension.

In some cases the step of lysing a microorganism is performed by mechanical lysis. Cells can be lysed mechanically and optionally homogenized to facilitate hydrocarbon e.g. lipid collection. For example a pressure disrupter can be used to pump a cell containing slurry through a restricted orifice valve. High pressure up to 1500 bar is applied followed by an instant expansion through an exiting nozzle. Cell disruption is accomplished by three different mechanisms impingement on the valve high liquid shear in the orifice and sudden pressure drop upon discharge causing an explosion of the cell. The method releases intracellular molecules. Alternatively a ball mill can be used. In a ball mill cells are agitated in suspension with small abrasive particles such as beads. Cells break because of shear forces grinding between beads and collisions with beads. The beads disrupt the cells to release cellular contents. Cells can also be disrupted by shear forces such as with the use of blending such as with a high speed or Waring blender as examples the french press or even centrifugation in case of weak cell walls to disrupt cells.

In some cases the step of lysing a microorganism comprises infection of the microorganism with a lytic virus. A wide variety of viruses are known to lyse microorganisms suitable for use in the present invention and the selection and use of a particular lytic virus for a particular microorganism is within the level of skill in the art. For example paramecium bursaria chlorella virus PBCV 1 is the prototype of a group family Phycodnaviridae genus Chlorovirus of large icosahedral plaque forming double stranded DNA viruses that replicate in and lyse certain unicellular eukaryotic like green algae. Accordingly any susceptible microalgae can be lysed by infecting the culture with a suitable Chlorella virus. Methods of infecting species of with a chlorella virus are known. See for example 2006 66 293 3361999 Apr. 25 257 1 15 232004 Jan. 5 318 1 214 232000 44 161 22006 March 80 5 2437 44 and 1999 53 447 94.

In some cases the step of lysing a microorganism comprises autolysis. In this embodiment a microorganism according to the invention is genetically engineered to produce a lytic protein that will lyse the microorganism. This lytic gene can be expressed using an inducible promoter so that the cells can first be grown to a desirable density in a fermentor followed by induction of the promoter to express the lytic gene to lyse the cells. In one embodiment the lytic gene encodes a polysaccharide degrading enzyme. In certain other embodiments the lytic gene is a gene from a lytic virus. Thus for example a lytic gene from a virus can be expressed in an algal cell see 260 308 315 1999 180 1999 45 53263 376 387 1999 and 230 361 368 1997 . Expression of lytic genes is preferably done using an inducible promoter such as a promoter active in microalgae that is induced by a stimulus such as the presence of a small molecule light heat and other stimuli.

Various methods are available for separating lipids from cellular lysates produced by the above methods. For example lipids and lipid derivatives such as fatty aldehydes fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons such as alkanes can be extracted with a hydrophobic solvent such as hexane see Frenz et al. 1989 Enzyme Microb. Technol. 11 717 . Lipids and lipid derivatives can also be extracted using liquefaction see for example Sawayama et al. 1999 Biomass and Bioenergy 17 33 39 and Inoue et al. 1993 Biomass Bioenergy 6 4 269 274 oil liquefaction see for example Minowa et al. 1995 Fuel 74 12 1735 1738 and supercritical COextraction see for example Mendes et al. 2003 Inorganica Chimica Acta 356 328 334 . Miao and Wu describe a protocol of the recovery of microalgal lipid from a culture of in which the cells were harvested by centrifugation washed with distilled water and dried by freeze drying. The resulting cell powder was pulverized in a mortar and then extracted with n hexane. Miao and Wu Biosource Technology 2006 97 841 846.

Thus lipids lipid derivatives and hydrocarbons generated by the microorganisms of the present invention can be recovered by extraction with an organic solvent. In some cases the preferred organic solvent is hexane. Typically the organic solvent is added directly to the lysate without prior separation of the lysate components. In one embodiment the lysate generated by one or more of the methods described above is contacted with an organic solvent for a period of time sufficient to allow the lipid and or hydrocarbon components to form a solution with the organic solvent. In some cases the solution can then be further refined to recover specific desired lipid or hydrocarbon components. Hexane extraction methods are well known in the art.

Lipids and lipid derivatives such as fatty aldehydes fatty alcohols and hydrocarbons such as alkanes produced by cells as described herein can be modified by the use of one or more enzymes including a lipase as described above. When the hydrocarbons are in the extracellular environment of the cells the one or more enzymes can be added to that environment under conditions in which the enzyme modifies the hydrocarbon or completes its synthesis from a hydrocarbon precursor. Alternatively the hydrocarbons can be partially or completely isolated from the cellular material before addition of one or more catalysts such as enzymes. Such catalysts are exogenously added and their activity occurs outside the cell or in vitro.

Thus lipids and hydrocarbons produced by cells in vivo or enzymatically modified in vitro as described herein can be optionally further processed by conventional means. The processing can include cracking to reduce the size and thus increase the hydrogen carbon ratio of hydrocarbon molecules. Catalytic and thermal cracking methods are routinely used in hydrocarbon and triglyceride oil processing. Catalytic methods involve the use of a catalyst such as a solid acid catalyst. For example the catalyst can be silica alumina or a zeolite which result in the heterolytic or asymmetric breakage of a carbon carbon bond to result in a carbocation and a hydride anion. These reactive intermediates then undergo either rearrangement or hydride transfer with another hydrocarbon. The reactions can thus regenerate the intermediates to result in a self propagating chain mechanism. Hydrocarbons can also be processed to reduce optionally to zero the number of carbon carbon double or triple bonds therein. Hydrocarbons can also be processed to remove or eliminate a ring or cyclic structure therein. Hydrocarbons can also be processed to increase the hydrogen carbon ratio. This can include the addition of hydrogen hydrogenation and or the cracking of hydrocarbons into smaller hydrocarbons.

Thermal methods involve the use of elevated temperature and pressure to reduce hydrocarbon size. An elevated temperature of about 800 C. and pressure of about 700 kPa can be used. These conditions generate light a term that is sometimes used to refer to hydrogen rich hydrocarbon molecules as distinguished from photon flux while also generating by condensation heavier hydrocarbon molecules which are relatively depleted of hydrogen. The methodology provides homolytic or symmetrical breakage and produces alkenes which may be optionally enzymatically saturated as described above.

Catalytic and thermal methods are standard in plants for hydrocarbon processing and oil refining. Thus hydrocarbons produced by cells as described herein can be collected and processed or refined via conventional means. See Hillen et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering Vol. XXIV 193 205 1982 for a report on hydrocracking of microalgae produced hydrocarbons. In alternative embodiments the fraction is treated with another catalyst such as an organic compound heat and or an inorganic compound. For processing of lipids into biodiesel a transesterification process can be used as described in Section V herein.

Hydrocarbons produced via methods of the present invention are useful in a variety of industrial applications. For example the production of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate LAS an anionic surfactant used in nearly all types of detergents and cleaning preparations utilizes hydrocarbons generally comprising a chain of 10 14 carbon atoms. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 946 430 5 506 201 6 692 730 6 268 517 6 020 509 6 140 302 5 080 848 and 5 567 359. Surfactants such as LAS can be used in the manufacture of personal care compositions and detergents such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 942 479 6 086 903 5 833 999 6 468 955 and 6 407 044.

Increasing interest is directed to the use of hydrocarbon components of biological origin in fuels such as biodiesel renewable diesel and jet fuel because renewable biological starting materials that may replace starting materials derived from fossil fuels are available and the use thereof is desirable. There is an urgent need for methods for producing hydrocarbon components from biological materials. The present invention fulfills this need by providing methods for production of biodiesel renewable diesel and jet fuel using the lipids generated by the methods described herein as a biological material to produce biodiesel renewable diesel and jet fuel.

Traditional diesel fuels are petroleum distillates rich in paraffinic hydrocarbons. They have boiling ranges as broad as 370 to 780 F. which are suitable for combustion in a compression ignition engine such as a diesel engine vehicle. The American Society of Testing and Materials ASTM establishes the grade of diesel according to the boiling range along with allowable ranges of other fuel properties such as cetane number cloud point flash point viscosity aniline point sulfur content water content ash content copper strip corrosion and carbon residue. Technically any hydrocarbon distillate material derived from biomass or otherwise that meets the appropriate ASTM specification can be defined as diesel fuel ASTM D975 jet fuel ASTM D1655 or as biodiesel if it is a fatty acid methyl ester ASTM D6751 .

After extraction lipid and or hydrocarbon components recovered from the microbial biomass described herein can be subjected to chemical treatment to manufacture a fuel for use in diesel vehicles and jet engines.

Biodiesel is a liquid which varies in color between golden and dark brown depending on the production feedstock. It is practically immiscible with water has a high boiling point and low vapor pressure. Biodiesel refers to a diesel equivalent processed fuel for use in diesel engine vehicles. Biodiesel is biodegradable and non toxic. An additional benefit of biodiesel over conventional diesel fuel is lower engine wear. Typically biodiesel comprises C14 C18 alkyl esters. Various processes convert biomass or a lipid produced and isolated as described herein to diesel fuels. A preferred method to produce biodiesel is by transesterification of a lipid as described herein. A preferred alkyl ester for use as biodiesel is a methyl ester or ethyl ester.

Biodiesel produced by a method described herein can be used alone or blended with conventional diesel fuel at any concentration in most modern diesel engine vehicles. When blended with conventional diesel fuel petroleum diesel biodiesel may be present from about 0.1 to about 99.9 . Much of the world uses a system known as the B factor to state the amount of biodiesel in any fuel mix. For example fuel containing 20 biodiesel is labeled B20. Pure biodiesel is referred to as B100.

Biodiesel can also be used as a heating fuel in domestic and commercial boilers. Existing oil boilers may contain rubber parts and may require conversion to run on biodiesel. The conversion process is usually relatively simple involving the exchange of rubber parts for synthetic parts due to biodiesel being a strong solvent. Due to its strong solvent power burning biodiesel will increase the efficiency of boilers. Biodiesel can be used as an additive in formulations of diesel to increase the lubricity of pure Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel ULSD fuel which is advantageous because it has virtually no sulfur content. Biodiesel is a better solvent than petrodiesel and can be used to break down deposits of residues in the fuel lines of vehicles that have previously been run on petrodiesel.

Biodiesel can be produced by transesterification of triglycerides contained in oil rich biomass. Thus in another aspect of the present invention a method for producing biodiesel is provided. In a preferred embodiment the method for producing biodiesel comprises the steps of a cultivating a lipid containing microorganism using methods disclosed herein b lysing a lipid containing microorganism to produce a lysate c isolating lipid from the lysed microorganism and d transesterifying the lipid composition whereby biodiesel is produced. Methods for growth of a microorganism lysing a microorganism to produce a lysate treating the lysate in a medium comprising an organic solvent to form a heterogeneous mixture and separating the treated lysate into a lipid composition have been described above and can also be used in the method of producing biodiesel.

The lipid profile of the biodiesel is usually highly similar to the lipid profile of the feedstock oil. Other oils provided by the methods and compositions of the invention can be subjected to transesterification to yield biodiesel with lipid profiles including a at least 4 C8 C14 b at least 0.3 C8 c at least 2 C10 d at least 2 C12 and 3 at least 30 C8 C14.

Lipid compositions can be subjected to transesterification to yield long chain fatty acid esters useful as biodiesel. Preferred transesterification reactions are outlined below and include base catalyzed transesterification and transesterification using recombinant lipases. In a base catalyzed transesterification process the triacylglycerides are reacted with an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol in the presence of an alkaline catalyst typically potassium hydroxide. This reaction forms methyl or ethyl esters and glycerin glycerol as a byproduct.

Animal and plant oils are typically made of triglycerides which are esters of free fatty acids with the trihydric alcohol glycerol. In transesterification the glycerol in a triacylglyceride TAG is replaced with a short chain alcohol such as methanol or ethanol. A typical reaction scheme is as follows 

Transesterification has also been carried out as discussed above using an enzyme such as a lipase instead of a base. Lipase catalyzed transesterification can be carried out for example at a temperature between the room temperature and 80 C. and a mole ratio of the TAG to the lower alcohol of greater than 1 1 preferably about 3 1. Lipases suitable for use in transesterification include but are not limited to those listed in Table 7. Other examples of lipases useful for transesterification are found in e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 798 793 4 940 845 5 156 963 5 342 768 5 776 741 and WO89 01032. Such lipases include but are not limited to lipases produced by microorganisms of and and pancreas lipase. Lipases suitable for use in transesterification are described in Table 7 of U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112.

One challenge to using a lipase for the production of fatty acid esters suitable for biodiesel is that the price of lipase is much higher than the price of sodium hydroxide NaOH used by the strong base process. This challenge has been addressed by using an immobilized lipase which can be recycled. However the activity of the immobilized lipase must be maintained after being recycled for a minimum number of cycles to allow a lipase based process to compete with the strong base process in terms of the production cost. Immobilized lipases are subject to poisoning by the lower alcohols typically used in transesterification. U.S. Pat. No. 6 398 707 issued Jun. 4 2002 to Wu et al. describes methods for enhancing the activity of immobilized lipases and regenerating immobilized lipases having reduced activity. Some suitable methods include immersing an immobilized lipase in an alcohol having a carbon atom number not less than 3 for a period of time preferably from 0.5 48 hours and more preferably from 0.5 1.5 hours. Some suitable methods also include washing a deactivated immobilized lipase with an alcohol having a carbon atom number not less than 3 and then immersing the deactivated immobilized lipase in a vegetable oil for 0.5 48 hours.

In particular embodiments a recombinant lipase is expressed in the same microorganisms that produce the lipid on which the lipase acts. Suitable recombinant lipases include those listed above in and or having GenBank Accession numbers listed in Table 7 of U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112 or a polypeptide that has at least 70 amino acid identity with one of the lipases listed in that Table 7 and that exhibits lipase activity. In additional embodiments the enzymatic activity is present in a sequence that has at least about 75 at least about 80 at least about 85 at least about 90 at least about 95 or at least about 99 identity with one of the above described sequences all of which are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth. DNA encoding the lipase and selectable marker is preferably codon optimized cDNA. Methods of recoding genes for expression in microalgae are described herein and in U.S. Pat. No. 7 135 290.

The common international standard for biodiesel is EN 14214. ASTM D6751 is the most common biodiesel standard referenced in the United States and Canada. Germany uses DIN EN 14214 and the UK requires compliance with BS EN 14214. Basic industrial tests to determine whether the products conform to these standards typically include gas chromatography HPLC and others. Biodiesel meeting the quality standards is very non toxic with a toxicity rating LD of greater than 50 mL kg.

Although biodiesel that meets the ASTM standards has to be non toxic there can be contaminants which tend to crystallize and or precipitate and fall out of solution as sediment. Sediment formation is particularly a problem when biodiesel is used at lower temperatures. The sediment or precipitates may cause problems such as decreasing fuel flow clogging fuel lines clogging filters and the like. Processes are well known in the art that specifically deal with the removal of these contaminants and sediments in biodiesel in order to produce a higher quality product. Examples for such processes include but are not limited to pretreatment of the oil to remove contaminants such as phospholipids and free fatty acids e.g. degumming caustic refining and silica adsorbant filtration and cold filtration. Cold filtration is a process that was developed specifically to remove any particulates and sediments that are present in the biodiesel after production. This process cools the biodiesel and filters out any sediments or precipitates that might form when the fuel is used at a lower temperature. Such a process is well known in the art and is described in US Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0175091. Suitable methods may include cooling the biodiesel to a temperature of less than about 38 C. so that the impurities and contaminants precipitate out as particulates in the biodiesel liquid. Diatomaceous earth or other filtering material may then added to the cooled biodiesel to form a slurry which may then filtered through a pressure leaf or other type of filter to remove the particulates. The filtered biodiesel may then be run through a polish filter to remove any remaining sediments and diatomaceous earth so as to produce the final biodiesel product.

Example 14 of U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112 describes the production of biodiesel using triglyceride oil from . The Cold Soak Filterability by the ASTM D6751 A1 method of the biodiesel produced in that Example 14 was 120 seconds for a volume of 300 ml. This test involves filtration of 300 ml of B100 which is chilled to 40 F. for 16 hours allowed to warm to room temp and filtered under vacuum using 0.7 micron glass fiber filter with stainless steel support. Oils of the invention can be transesterified to generate biodiesel with a cold soak time of less than 120 seconds less than 100 seconds and less than 90 seconds.

Subsequent processes may also be used if the biodiesel will be used in particularly cold temperatures. Such processes include winterization and fractionation. Both processes are designed to improve the cold flow and winter performance of the fuel by lowering the cloud point the temperature at which the biodiesel starts to crystallize . There are several approaches to winterizing biodiesel. One approach is to blend the biodiesel with petroleum diesel. Another approach is to use additives that can lower the cloud point of biodiesel. Another approach is to remove saturated methyl esters indiscriminately by mixing in additives and allowing for the crystallization of saturates and then filtering out the crystals. Fractionation selectively separates methyl esters into individual components or fractions allowing for the removal or inclusion of specific methyl esters. Fractionation methods include urea fractionation solvent fractionation and thermal distillation.

Another valuable fuel provided by the methods of the present invention is renewable diesel which comprises alkanes such as C10 0 C12 0 C14 0 C16 0 and C18 0 and thus are distinguishable from biodiesel. High quality renewable diesel conforms to the ASTM D975 standard. The lipids produced by the methods of the present invention can serve as feedstock to produce renewable diesel. Thus in another aspect of the present invention a method for producing renewable diesel is provided. Renewable diesel can be produced by at least three processes hydrothermal processing hydrotreating hydroprocessing and indirect liquefaction. These processes yield non ester distillates. During these processes triacylglycerides produced and isolated as described herein are converted to alkanes.

In one embodiment the method for producing renewable diesel comprises a cultivating a lipid containing microorganism using methods disclosed herein b lysing the microorganism to produce a lysate c isolating lipid from the lysed microorganism and d deoxygenating and hydrotreating the lipid to produce an alkane whereby renewable diesel is produced. Lipids suitable for manufacturing renewable diesel can be obtained via extraction from microbial biomass using an organic solvent such as hexane or via other methods such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 928 696. Some suitable methods may include mechanical pressing and centrifuging. See PCT patent application U.S. Ser. No. 10 031 108 incorporated herein by reference.

In some methods the microbial lipid is first cracked in conjunction with hydrotreating to reduce carbon chain length and saturate double bonds respectively. The material is then isomerized also in conjunction with hydrotreating. The naptha fraction can then be removed through distillation followed by additional distillation to vaporize and distill components desired in the diesel fuel to meet an ASTM D975 standard while leaving components that are heavier than desired for meeting the D975 standard. Hydrotreating hydrocracking deoxygenation and isomerization methods of chemically modifying oils including triglyceride oils are well known in the art. See for example European patent applications EP1741768 A1 EP1741767 A1 EP1682466 A1 EP1640437 A1 EP1681337 A1 EP1795576 A1 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 7 238 277 6 630 066 6 596 155 6 977 322 7 041 866 6 217 746 5 885 440 6 881 873.

In one embodiment of the method for producing renewable diesel treating the lipid to produce an alkane is performed by hydrotreating of the lipid composition. In hydrothermal processing typically biomass is reacted in water at an elevated temperature and pressure to form oils and residual solids. Conversion temperatures are typically 300 to 660 F. with pressure sufficient to keep the water primarily as a liquid 100 to 170 standard atmospheres atm . Reaction times are on the order of 15 to 30 minutes. After the reaction is completed the organics are separated from the water. Thereby a distillate suitable for diesel is produced.

In some methods of making renewable diesel the first step of treating a triglyceride is hydroprocessing to saturate double bonds followed by deoxygenation at elevated temperature in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. In some methods hydrogenation and deoxygenation occur in the same reaction. In other methods deoxygenation occurs before hydrogenation. Isomerization is then optionally performed also in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. Naphtha components are preferably removed through distillation. For examples see U.S. Pat. No. 5 475 160 hydrogenation of triglycerides U.S. Pat. No. 5 091 116 deoxygenation hydrogenation and gas removal U.S. Pat. No. 6 391 815 hydrogenation and U.S. Pat. No. 5 888 947 isomerization .

One suitable method for the hydrogenation of triglycerides includes preparing an aqueous solution of copper zinc magnesium and lanthanum salts and another solution of alkali metal or preferably ammonium carbonate. The two solutions may be heated to a temperature of about 20 C. to about 85 C. and metered together into a precipitation container at rates such that the pH in the precipitation container is maintained between 5.5 and 7.5 in order to form a catalyst. Additional water may be used either initially in the precipitation container or added concurrently with the salt solution and precipitation solution. The resulting precipitate may then be thoroughly washed dried calcined at about 300 C. and activated in hydrogen at temperatures ranging from about 100 C. to about 400 C. One or more triglycerides may then be contacted and reacted with hydrogen in the presence of the above described catalyst in a reactor. The reactor may be a trickle bed reactor fixed bed gas solid reactor packed bubble column reactor continuously stirred tank reactor a slurry phase reactor or any other suitable reactor type known in the art. The process may be carried out either batchwise or in continuous fashion. Reaction temperatures are typically in the range of from about 170 C. to about 250 C. while reaction pressures are typically in the range of from about 300 psig to about 2000 psig. Moreover the molar ratio of hydrogen to triglyceride in the process of the present invention is typically in the range of from about 20 1 to about 700 1. The process is typically carried out at a weight hourly space velocity WHSV in the range of from about 0.1 hrto about 5 hr. One skilled in the art will recognize that the time period required for reaction will vary according to the temperature used the molar ratio of hydrogen to triglyceride and the partial pressure of hydrogen. The products produced by such hydrogenation processes include fatty alcohols glycerol traces of paraffins and unreacted triglycerides. These products are typically separated by conventional means such as for example distillation extraction filtration crystallization and the like.

Petroleum refiners use hydroprocessing to remove impurities by treating feeds with hydrogen. Hydroprocessing conversion temperatures are typically 300 to 700 F. Pressures are typically 40 to 100 atm. The reaction times are typically on the order of 10 to 60 minutes. Solid catalysts are employed to increase certain reaction rates improve selectivity for certain products and optimize hydrogen consumption.

Suitable methods for the deoxygenation of an oil includes heating an oil to a temperature in the range of from about 350 F. to about 550 F. and continuously contacting the heated oil with nitrogen under at least pressure ranging from about atmospheric to above for at least about 5 minutes.

Suitable methods for isomerization include using alkali isomerization and other oil isomerization known in the art.

Hydrotreating and hydroprocessing ultimately lead to a reduction in the molecular weight of the triglyceride feed. The triglyceride molecule is reduced to four hydrocarbon molecules under hydroprocessing conditions a propane molecule and three heavier hydrocarbon molecules typically in the C8 to C18 range.

A traditional ultra low sulfur diesel can be produced from any form of biomass by a two step process. First the biomass is converted to a syngas a gaseous mixture rich in hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Then the syngas is catalytically converted to liquids. Typically the production of liquids is accomplished using Fischer Tropsch FT synthesis. This technology applies to coal natural gas and heavy oils. Thus in yet another preferred embodiment of the method for producing renewable diesel treating the lipid composition to produce an alkane is performed by indirect liquefaction of the lipid composition.

The present invention also provides methods to produce jet fuel. Jet fuel is clear to straw colored. The most common fuel is an unleaded paraffin oil based fuel classified as Aeroplane A 1 which is produced to an internationally standardized set of specifications. Jet fuel is a mixture of a large number of different hydrocarbons possibly as many as a thousand or more. The range of their sizes molecular weights or carbon numbers is restricted by the requirements for the product for example freezing point or smoke point. Kerosone type Aeroplane fuel including Jet A and Jet A 1 has a carbon number distribution between about 8 and 16 carbon numbers. Wide cut or naphta type Aeroplane fuel including Jet B typically has a carbon number distribution between about 5 and 15 carbons.

Both Aeroplanes Jet A and Jet B may contain a number of additives. Useful additives include but are not limited to antioxidants antistatic agents corrosion inhibitors and fuel system icing inhibitor FSII agents. Antioxidants prevent gumming and usually are based on alkylated phenols for example AO 30 AO 31 or AO 37. Antistatic agents dissipate static electricity and prevent sparking. Stadis 450 with dinonylnaphthylsulfonic acid DINNSA as the active ingredient is an example. Corrosion inhibitors e.g. DCI 4A can be used for civilian and military fuels and DCI 6A is used for military fuels. FSII agents include e.g. Di EGME.

In one embodiment of the invention a jet fuel is produced by blending algal fuels with existing jet fuel. The lipids produced by the methods of the present invention can serve as feedstock to produce jet fuel. Thus in another aspect of the present invention a method for producing jet fuel is provided. Herewith two methods for producing jet fuel from the lipids produced by the methods of the present invention are provided fluid catalytic cracking FCC and hydrodeoxygenation HDO .

Fluid Catalytic Cracking FCC is one method which is used to produce olefins especially propylene from heavy crude fractions. The lipids produced by the method of the present invention can be converted to olefins. The process involves flowing the lipids produced through an FCC zone and collecting a product stream comprised of olefins which is useful as a jet fuel. The lipids produced are contacted with a cracking catalyst at cracking conditions to provide a product stream comprising olefins and hydrocarbons useful as jet fuel.

In one embodiment the method for producing jet fuel comprises a cultivating a lipid containing microalgae in xylose containing media using cells and methods disclosed herein b lysing the lipid containing microorganism to produce a lysate c isolating lipid from the lysate and d treating the lipid composition whereby jet fuel is produced. In one embodiment of the method for producing a jet fuel the lipid composition can be flowed through a fluid catalytic cracking zone which in one embodiment may comprise contacting the lipid composition with a cracking catalyst at cracking conditions to provide a product stream comprising C Colefins.

In certain embodiments of this method it may be desirable to remove any contaminants that may be present in the lipid composition. Thus prior to flowing the lipid composition through a fluid catalytic cracking zone the lipid composition is pretreated. Pretreatment may involve contacting the lipid composition with an ion exchange resin. The ion exchange resin is an acidic ion exchange resin such as Amberlyst 15 and can be used as a bed in a reactor through which the lipid composition is flowed either upflow or downflow. Other pretreatments may include mild acid washes by contacting the lipid composition with an acid such as sulfuric acetic nitric or hydrochloric acid. Contacting is done with a dilute acid solution usually at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure.

The lipid composition optionally pretreated is flowed to an FCC zone where the hydrocarbonaceous components are cracked to olefins. Catalytic cracking is accomplished by contacting the lipid composition in a reaction zone with a catalyst composed of finely divided particulate material. The reaction is catalytic cracking as opposed to hydrocracking and is carried out in the absence of added hydrogen or the consumption of hydrogen. As the cracking reaction proceeds substantial amounts of coke are deposited on the catalyst. The catalyst is regenerated at high temperatures by burning coke from the catalyst in a regeneration zone. Coke containing catalyst referred to herein as coked catalyst is continually transported from the reaction zone to the regeneration zone to be regenerated and replaced by essentially coke free regenerated catalyst from the regeneration zone. Fluidization of the catalyst particles by various gaseous streams allows the transport of catalyst between the reaction zone and regeneration zone. Methods for cracking hydrocarbons such as those of the lipid composition described herein in a fluidized stream of catalyst transporting catalyst between reaction and regeneration zones and combusting coke in the regenerator are well known by those skilled in the art of FCC processes. Exemplary FCC applications and catalysts useful for cracking the lipid composition to produce C Colefins are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 538 169 and 7 288 685 which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.

Suitable FCC catalysts generally comprise at least two components that may or may not be on the same matrix. In some embodiments both components may be circulated throughout the entire reaction vessel. The first component generally includes any of the well known catalysts that are used in the art of fluidized catalytic cracking such as an active amorphous clay type catalyst and or a high activity crystalline molecular sieve. Molecular sieve catalysts may sometimes be preferred over amorphous catalysts because of their much improved selectivity to desired products. In some preferred embodiments zeolites may be used as the molecular sieve in the FCC processes. Preferably the first catalyst component comprises a large pore zeolite such as an Y type zeolite an active alumina material a binder material comprising either silica or alumina and an inert filler such as kaolin.

In one embodiment cracking the lipid composition of the present invention takes place in the riser section or alternatively the lift section of the FCC zone. The lipid composition is introduced into the riser by a nozzle resulting in the rapid vaporization of the lipid composition. Before contacting the catalyst the lipid composition will ordinarily have a temperature of about 149 C. to about 316 C. 300 F. to 600 F. . The catalyst is flowed from a blending vessel to the riser where it contacts the lipid composition for a time of abort 2 seconds or less.

The blended catalyst and reacted lipid composition vapors are then discharged from the top of the riser through an outlet and separated into a cracked product vapor stream including olefins and a collection of catalyst particles covered with substantial quantities of coke and generally referred to as coked catalyst. In an effort to minimize the contact time of the lipid composition and the catalyst which may promote further conversion of desired products to undesirable other products any arrangement of separators such as a swirl arm arrangement can be used to remove coked catalyst from the product stream quickly. The separator e.g. swirl arm separator is located in an upper portion of a chamber with a stripping zone situated in the lower portion of the chamber. Catalyst separated by the swirl arm arrangement drops down into the stripping zone. The cracked product vapor stream comprising cracked hydrocarbons including light olefins and some catalyst exit the chamber via a conduit which is in communication with cyclones. The cyclones remove remaining catalyst particles from the product vapor stream to reduce particle concentrations to very low levels. The product vapor stream then exits the top of the separating vessel. Catalyst separated by the cyclones is returned to the separating vessel and then to the stripping zone. The stripping zone removes adsorbed hydrocarbons from the surface of the catalyst by counter current contact with steam.

Low hydrocarbon partial pressure operates to favor the production of light olefins. Accordingly the riser pressure is set at about 172 to 241 kPa 25 to 35 psia with a hydrocarbon partial pressure of about 35 to 172 kPa 5 to 25 psia with a preferred hydrocarbon partial pressure of about 69 to 138 kPa 10 to 20 psia . This relatively low partial pressure for hydrocarbon is achieved by using steam as a diluent to the extent that the diluent is 10 to 55 wt of lipid composition and preferably about 15 wt of lipid composition. Other diluents such as dry gas can be used to reach equivalent hydrocarbon partial pressures.

The temperature of the cracked stream at the riser outlet will be about 510 C. to 621 C. 950 F. to 1150 F. . However riser outlet temperatures above 566 C. 1050 F. make more dry gas and more olefins. Whereas riser outlet temperatures below 566 C. 1050 F. make less ethylene and propylene. Accordingly it is preferred to run the FCC process at a preferred temperature of about 566 C. to about 630 C. preferred pressure of about 138 kPa to about 240 kPa 20 to 35 psia . Another condition for the process is the catalyst to lipid composition ratio which can vary from about 5 to about 20 and preferably from about 10 to about 15.

In one embodiment of the method for producing a jet fuel the lipid composition is introduced into the lift section of an FCC reactor. The temperature in the lift section will be very hot and range from about 700 C. 1292 F. to about 760 C. 1400 F. with a catalyst to lipid composition ratio of about 100 to about 150. It is anticipated that introducing the lipid composition into the lift section will produce considerable amounts of propylene and ethylene.

In another embodiment of the method for producing a jet fuel using the lipid composition or the lipids produced as described herein the structure of the lipid composition or the lipids is broken by a process referred to as hydrodeoxygenation HDO . HDO means removal of oxygen by means of hydrogen that is oxygen is removed while breaking the structure of the material. Olefinic double bonds are hydrogenated and any sulphur and nitrogen compounds are removed. Sulphur removal is called hydrodesulphurization HDS . Pretreatment and purity of the raw materials lipid composition or the lipids contribute to the service life of the catalyst.

Generally in the HDO HDS step hydrogen is mixed with the feed stock lipid composition or the lipids and then the mixture is passed through a catalyst bed as a co current flow either as a single phase or a two phase feed stock. After the HDO MDS step the product fraction is separated and passed to a separate isomerzation reactor. An isomerization reactor for biological starting material is described in the literature FI 100 248 as a co current reactor.

The process for producing a fuel by hydrogenating a hydrocarbon feed e.g. the lipid composition or the lipids herein can also be performed by passing the lipid composition or the lipids as a co current flow with hydrogen gas through a first hydrogenation zone and thereafter the hydrocarbon effluent is further hydrogenated in a second hydrogenation zone by passing hydrogen gas to the second hydrogenation zone as a counter current flow relative to the hydrocarbon effluent. Exemplary HDO applications and catalysts useful for cracking the lipid composition to produce C Colefins are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 232 935 which is incorporated in its entirety by reference.

Typically in the hydrodeoxygenation step the structure of the biological component such as the lipid composition or lipids herein is decomposed oxygen nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur compounds and light hydrocarbons as gas are removed and the olefinic bonds are hydrogenated. In the second step of the process i.e. in the so called isomerization step isomerzation is carried out for branching the hydrocarbon chain and improving the performance of the paraffin at low temperatures.

In the first step i.e. HDO step of the cracking process hydrogen gas and the lipid composition or lipids herein which are to be hydrogenated are passed to a HDO catalyst bed system either as co current or counter current flows said catalyst bed system comprising one or more catalyst bed s preferably 1 3 catalyst beds. The HDO step is typically operated in a co current manner. In case of a HDO catalyst bed system comprising two or more catalyst beds one or more of the beds may be operated using the counter current flow principle. In the HDO step the pressure varies between 20 and 150 bar preferably between 50 and 100 bar and the temperature varies between 200 and 500 C. preferably in the range of 300 400 C. In the HDO step known hydrogenation catalysts containing metals from Group VII and or VIB of the Periodic System may be used. Preferably the hydrogenation catalysts are supported Pd Pt Ni NiMo or a CoMo catalysts the support being alumina and or silica. Typically NiMo AlOand CoMo AlOcatalysts are used.

Prior to the HDO step the lipid composition or lipids herein may optionally be treated by prehydrogenation under milder conditions thus avoiding side reactions of the double bonds. Such prehydrogenation is carried out in the presence of a prehydrogenation catalyst at temperatures of 50 400 C. and at hydrogen pressures of 1 200 bar preferably at a temperature between 150 and 250 C. and at a hydrogen pressure between 10 and 100 bar. The catalyst may contain metals from Group VIII and or VIB of the Periodic System. Preferably the prehydrogenation catalyst is a supported Pd Pt Ni NiMo or a CoMo catalyst the support being alumina and or silica.

A gaseous stream from the HDO step containing hydrogen is cooled and then carbon monoxide carbon dioxide nitrogen phosphorus and sulphur compounds gaseous light hydrocarbons and other impurities are removed therefrom. After compressing the purified hydrogen or recycled hydrogen is returned back to the first catalyst bed and or between the catalyst beds to make up for the withdrawn gas stream. Water is removed from the condensed liquid. The liquid is passed to the first catalyst bed or between the catalyst beds.

After the HDO step the product is subjected to an isomerization step. It is substantial for the process that the impurities are removed as completely as possible before the hydrocarbons are contacted with the isomerization catalyst. The isomerization step comprises an optional stripping step wherein the reaction product from the HDO step may be purified by stripping with water vapour or a suitable gas such as light hydrocarbon nitrogen or hydrogen. The optional stripping step is carried out in counter current manner in a unit upstream of the isomerization catalyst wherein the gas and liquid are contacted with each other or before the actual isomerization reactor in a separate stripping unit utilizing counter current principle.

After the stripping step the hydrogen gas and the hydrogenated lipid composition or lipids herein and optionally an n paraffin mixture are passed to a reactive isomerization unit comprising one or several catalyst bed s . The catalyst beds of the isomerization step may operate either in co current or counter current manner.

It is important for the process that the counter current flow principle is applied in the isomerization step. In the isomerization step this is done by carrying out either the optional stripping step or the isomerization reaction step or both in counter current manner. In the isomerzation step the pressure varies in the range of 20 150 bar preferably in the range of 20 100 bar the temperature being between 200 and 500 C. preferably between 300 and 400 C. In the isomerization step isomerization catalysts known in the art may be used. Suitable isomerization catalysts contain molecular sieve and or a metal from Group VII and or a carrier. Preferably the isomerization catalyst contains SAPO 11 or SAPO41 or ZSM 22 or ZSM 23 or ferrierite and Pt Pd or Ni and AlOor SiO. Typical isomerization catalysts are for example Pt SAPO 11 AlO Pt ZSM 22 AlO Pt ZSM 23 AlOand Pt SAPO 11 SiO. The isomerization step and the HDO step may be carried out in the same pressure vessel or in separate pressure vessels. Optional prehydrogenation may be carried out in a separate pressure vessel or in the same pressure vessel as the HDO and isomerization steps.

Thus the present invention discloses a variety of methods in which chemical modification of microalgal lipid is undertaken to yield products useful in a variety of industrial and other applications. Examples of processes for modifying oil produced by the methods disclosed herein include but are not limited to hydrolysis of the oil hydroprocessing of the oil and esterification of the oil. The modification of the microalgal oil produces basic oleochemicals that can be further modified into selected derivative oleochemicals for a desired function. In a manner similar to that described above with reference to fuel producing processes these chemical modifications can also be performed on oils generated from the microbial cultures described herein. Examples of basic oleochemicals include but are not limited to soaps fatty acids fatty acid methyl esters and glycerol. Examples of derivative oleochemicals include but are not limited to fatty nitriles esters dimer acids quats surfactants fatty alkanolamides fatty alcohol sulfates resins emulsifiers fatty alcohols olefins and higher alkanes.

Hydrolysis of the fatty acid constituents from the glycerolipids produced by the methods of the invention yields free fatty acids that can be derivatized to produce other useful chemicals. Hydrolysis occurs in the presence of water and a catalyst which may be either an acid or a base. The liberated free fatty acids can be derivatized to yield a variety of products as reported in the following U.S. Pat. No. 5 304 664 Highly sulfated fatty acids U.S. Pat. No. 7 262 158 Cleansing compositions U.S. Pat. No. 7 115 173 Fabric softener compositions U.S. Pat. No. 6 342 208 Emulsions for treating skin U.S. Pat. No. 7 264 886 Water repellant compositions U.S. Pat. No. 6 924 333 Paint additives U.S. Pat. No. 6 596 768 Lipid enriched ruminant feedstock and U.S. Pat. No. 6 380 410 Surfactants for detergents and cleaners .

With regard to hydrolysis in one embodiment of the invention a triglyceride oil is optionally first hydrolyzed in a liquid medium such as water or sodium hydroxide so as to obtain glycerol and soaps. There are various suitable triglyceride hydrolysis methods including but not limited to saponification acid hydrolysis alkaline hydrolysis enzymatic hydrolysis referred herein as splitting and hydrolysis using hot compressed water. One skilled in the art will recognize that a triglyceride oil need not be hydrolyzed to produce an oleochemical rather the oil may be converted directly to the desired oleochemical by other known processes. For example the triglyceride oil may be directly converted to a methyl ester fatty acid through esterification.

In some embodiments catalytic hydrolysis of the oil produced by methods disclosed herein occurs by splitting the oil into glycerol and fatty acids. As discussed above the fatty acids may then be further processed through several other modifications to obtained derivative oleochemicals. For example in one embodiment the fatty acids may undergo an amination reaction to produce fatty nitrogen compounds. In another embodiment the fatty acids may undergo ozonolysis to produce mono and dibasic acids.

In other embodiments hydrolysis may occur via the splitting of oils produced herein to create oleochemicals. In some preferred embodiments of the invention a triglyceride oil may be split before other processes is performed. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are many suitable triglyceride splitting methods including but not limited to enzymatic splitting and pressure splitting.

Generally enzymatic oil splitting methods use enzymes lipases as biocatalysts acting on a water oil mixture. Enzymatic splitting then splits the oil or fat respectively is into glycerol and free fatty acids. The glycerol may then migrate into the water phase whereby the organic phase is enriched with free fatty acids.

The enzymatic splitting reactions generally take place at the phase boundary between organic and aqueous phase where the enzyme is present only at the phase boundary. Triglycerides that meet the phase boundary then contribute to or participate in the splitting reaction. As the reaction proceeds the occupation density or concentration of fatty acids still chemically bonded as glycerides in comparison to free fatty acids decreases at the phase boundary so that the reaction is slowed down. In certain embodiments enzymatic splitting may occur at room temperature. One of ordinary skill in the art knows the suitable conditions for splitting oil into the desired fatty acids.

By way of example the reaction speed can be accelerated by increasing the interface boundary surface. Once the reaction is complete free fatty acids are then separated from the organic phase freed from enzyme and the residue which still contains fatty acids chemically bonded as glycerides is fed back or recycled and mixed with fresh oil or fat to be subjected to splitting. In this manner recycled glycerides are then subjected to a further enzymatic splitting process. In some embodiments the free fatty acids are extracted from an oil or fat partially split in such a manner. In that way if the chemically bound fatty acids triglycerides are returned or fed back into the splitting process the enzyme consumption can be drastically reduced.

The splitting degree is determined as the ratio of the measured acid value divided by the theoretically possible acid value which can be computed for a given oil or fat. Preferably the acid value is measured by means of titration according to standard common methods. Alternatively the density of the aqueous glycerol phase can be taken as a measure for the splitting degree.

In one embodiment the slitting process as described herein is also suitable for splitting the mono di and triglyceride that are contained in the so called soap stock from the alkali refining processes of the produced oils. In this manner the soap stock can be quantitatively converted without prior saponification of the neutral oils into the fatty acids. For this purpose the fatty acids being chemically bonded in the soaps are released preferably before splitting through an addition of acid. In certain embodiments a buffer solution is used in addition to water and enzyme for the splitting process.

In one embodiment oils produced in accordance with the methods of the invention can also be subjected to saponification as a method of hydrolysis Animal and plant oils are typically made of triacylglycerols TAGs which are esters of fatty acids with the trihydric alcohol glycerol. In an alkaline hydrolysis reaction the glycerol in a TAG is removed leaving three carboxylic acid anions that can associate with alkali metal cations such as sodium or potassium to produce fatty acid salts. In this scheme the carboxylic acid constituents are cleaved from the glycerol moiety and replaced with hydroxyl groups. The quantity of base e.g. KOH that is used in the reaction is determined by the desired degree of saponification. If the objective is for example to produce a soap product that comprises some of the oils originally present in the TAG composition an amount of base insufficient to convert all of the TAGs to fatty acid salts is introduced into the reaction mixture. Normally this reaction is performed in an aqueous solution and proceeds slowly but may be expedited by the addition of heat. Precipitation of the fatty acid salts can be facilitated by addition of salts such as water soluble alkali metal halides e.g. NaCl or KCl to the reaction mixture. Preferably the base is an alkali metal hydroxide such as NaOH or KOH. Alternatively other bases such as alkanolamines including for example triethanolamine and aminomethylpropanol can be used in the reaction scheme. In some cases these alternatives may be preferred to produce a clear soap product.

In some methods the first step of chemical modification may be hydroprocessing to saturate double bonds followed by deoxygenation at elevated temperature in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. In other methods hydrogenation and deoxygenation may occur in the same reaction. In still other methods deoxygenation occurs before hydrogenation. Isomerization may then be optionally performed also in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst. Finally gases and naphtha components can be removed if desired. For example see U.S. Pat. No. 5 475 160 hydrogenation of triglycerides U.S. Pat. No. 5 091 116 deoxygenation hydrogenation and gas removal U.S. Pat. No. 6 391 815 hydrogenation and U.S. Pat. No. 5 888 947 isomerization .

In some embodiments of the invention the triglyceride oils are partially or completely deoxygenated. The deoxygenation reactions form desired products including but not limited to fatty acids fatty alcohols polyols ketones and aldehydes. In general without being limited by any particular theory the deoxygenation reactions involve a combination of various different reaction pathways including without limitation hydrogenolysis hydrogenation consecutive hydrogenation hydrogenolysis consecutive hydrogenolysis hydrogenation and combined hydrogenation hydrogenolysis reactions resulting in at least the partial removal of oxygen from the fatty acid or fatty acid ester to produce reaction products such as fatty alcohols that can be easily converted to the desired chemicals by further processing. For example in one embodiment a fatty alcohol may be converted to olefins through FCC reaction or to higher alkanes through a condensation reaction.

One such chemical modification is hydrogenation which is the addition of hydrogen to double bonds in the fatty acid constituents of glycerolipids or of free fatty acids. The hydrogenation process permits the transformation of liquid oils into semi solid or solid fats which may be more suitable for specific applications.

Hydrogenation of oil produced by the methods described herein can be performed in conjunction with one or more of the methods and or materials provided herein as reported in the following U.S. Pat.

One skilled in the art will recognize that various processes may be used to hydrogenate oil. One suitable method includes contacting the oil with hydrogen or hydrogen mixed with a suitable gas and a catalyst under conditions sufficient in a hydrogenation reactor to form a hydrogenated product. The hydrogenation catalyst generally can include Cu Re Ni Fe Co Ru Pd Rh Pt Os Ir and alloys or any combination thereof either alone or with promoters such as W Mo Au Ag Cr Zn Mn Sn B P Bi and alloys or any combination thereof. Other effective hydrogenation catalyst materials include either supported nickel or ruthenium modified with rhenium. In an embodiment the hydrogenation catalyst also includes any one of the supports depending on the desired functionality of the catalyst. The hydrogenation catalysts may be prepared by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

In some embodiments the hydrogenation catalyst includes a supported Group VIII metal catalyst and a metal sponge material e.g. a sponge nickel catalyst . Raney nickel provides an example of an activated sponge nickel catalyst suitable for use in this invention. In other embodiment the hydrogenation reaction in the invention is performed using a catalyst comprising a nickel rhenium catalyst or a tungsten modified nickel catalyst. One example of a suitable catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction of the invention is a carbon supported nickel rhenium catalyst.

In an embodiment a suitable Raney nickel catalyst may be prepared by treating an alloy of approximately equal amounts by weight of nickel and aluminum with an aqueous alkali solution e.g. containing about 25 weight of sodium hydroxide. The aluminum is selectively dissolved by the aqueous alkali solution resulting in a sponge shaped material comprising mostly nickel with minor amounts of aluminum. The initial alloy includes promoter metals i.e. molybdenum or chromium in the amount such that about 1 to 2 weight remains in the formed sponge nickel catalyst. In another embodiment the hydrogenation catalyst is prepared using a solution of ruthenium III nitrosylnitrate ruthenium III chloride in water to impregnate a suitable support material. The solution is then dried to form a solid having a water content of less than about 1 by weight. The solid may then be reduced at atmospheric pressure in a hydrogen stream at 300 C. uncalcined or 400 C. calcined in a rotary ball furnace for 4 hours. After cooling and rendering the catalyst inert with nitrogen 5 by volume of oxygen in nitrogen is passed over the catalyst for 2 hours.

In certain embodiments the catalyst described includes a catalyst support. The catalyst support stabilizes and supports the catalyst. The type of catalyst support used depends on the chosen catalyst and the reaction conditions. Suitable supports for the invention include but are not limited to carbon silica silica alumina zirconia titania ceria vanadia nitride boron nitride heteropolyacids hydroxyapatite zinc oxide chromia zeolites carbon nanotubes carbon fullerene and any combination thereof.

The catalysts used in this invention can be prepared using conventional methods known to those in the art. Suitable methods may include but are not limited to incipient wetting evaporative impregnation chemical vapor deposition wash coating magnetron sputtering techniques and the like.

The conditions for which to carry out the hydrogenation reaction will vary based on the type of starting material and the desired products. One of ordinary skill in the art with the benefit of this disclosure will recognize the appropriate reaction conditions. In general the hydrogenation reaction is conducted at temperatures of 80 C. to 250 C. and preferably at 90 C. to 200 C. and most preferably at 100 C. to 150 C. In some embodiments the hydrogenation reaction is conducted at pressures from 500 KPa to 14000 KPa.

Another chemical modification that may be performed on microalgal oil produced by the methods of the invention is interesterification. Naturally produced glycerolipids do not have a uniform distribution of fatty acid constituents. In the context of oils interesterification refers to the exchange of acyl radicals between two esters of different glycerolipids. The interesterification process provides a mechanism by which the fatty acid constituents of a mixture of glycerolipids can be rearranged to modify the distribution pattern. Interesterification is a well known chemical process and generally comprises heating to about 200 C. a mixture of oils for a period e.g. 30 minutes in the presence of a catalyst such as an alkali metal or alkali metal alkylate e.g. sodium methoxide . This process can be used to randomize the distribution pattern of the fatty acid constituents of an oil mixture or can be directed to produce a desired distribution pattern. This method of chemical modification of lipids can be performed on materials provided herein such as microbial biomass with a percentage of dry cell weight as lipid at least 20 .

Directed interesterification in which a specific distribution pattern of fatty acids is sought can be performed by maintaining the oil mixture at a temperature below the melting point of some TAGs which might occur. This results in selective crystallization of these TAGs which effectively removes them from the reaction mixture as they crystallize. The process can be continued until most of the fatty acids in the oil have precipitated for example. A directed interesterification process can be used for example to produce a product with a lower calorie content via the substitution of longer chain fatty acids with shorter chain counterparts. Directed interesterification can also be used to produce a product with a mixture of fats that can provide desired melting characteristics and structural features sought in food additives or products e.g. margarine without resorting to hydrogenation which can produce unwanted trans isomers.

Interesterification of oils produced by the methods described herein can be performed in conjunction with one or more of the methods and or materials or to produce products as reported in the following U.S. Pat. No. 6 080 853 Nondigestible fat substitutes U.S. Pat. No. 4 288 378 Peanut butter stabilizer U.S. Pat. No. 5 391 383 Edible spray oil U.S. Pat. No. 6 022 577 Edible fats for food products U.S. Pat.

In one embodiment in accordance with the invention transesterification of the oil as described above is followed by reaction of the transesterified product with polyol as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6 465 642 to produce polyol fatty acid polyesters. Such an esterification and separation process may comprise the steps as follows reacting a lower alkyl ester with polyol in the presence of soap removing residual soap from the product mixture water washing and drying the product mixture to remove impurities bleaching the product mixture for refinement separating at least a portion of the unreacted lower alkyl ester from the polyol fatty acid polyester in the product mixture and recycling the separated unreacted lower alkyl ester.

Transesterification can also be performed on microbial biomass with short chain fatty acid esters as reported in U.S. Pat. No. 6 278 006. In general transesterification may be performed by adding a short chain fatty acid ester to an oil in the presence of a suitable catalyst and heating the mixture. In some embodiments the oil comprises about 5 to about 90 of the reaction mixture by weight. In some embodiments the short chain fatty acid esters can be about 10 to about 50 of the reaction mixture by weight. Non limiting examples of catalysts include base catalysts sodium methoxide acid catalysts including inorganic acids such as sulfuric acid and acidified clays organic acids such as methane sulfonic acid benzenesulfonic acid and toluenesulfonic acid and acidic resins such as Amberlyst 15. Metals such as sodium and magnesium and metal hydrides also are useful catalysts.

Another such chemical modification is hydroxylation which involves the addition of water to a double bond resulting in saturation and the incorporation of a hydroxyl moiety. The hydroxylation process provides a mechanism for converting one or more fatty acid constituents of a glycerolipid to a hydroxy fatty acid. Hydroxylation can be performed for example via the method reported in U.S. Pat. No. 5 576 027. Hydroxylated fatty acids including castor oil and its derivatives are useful as components in several industrial applications including food additives surfactants pigment wetting agents defoaming agents water proofing additives plasticizing agents cosmetic emulsifying and or deodorant agents as well as in electronics pharmaceuticals paints inks adhesives and lubricants. One example of how the hydroxylation of a glyceride may be performed is as follows fat may be heated preferably to about 30 50 C. combined with heptane and maintained at temperature for thirty minutes or more acetic acid may then be added to the mixture followed by an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid followed by an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution which is added in small increments to the mixture over one hour after the aqueous hydrogen peroxide the temperature may then be increased to at least about 60 C. and stirred for at least six hours after the stirring the mixture is allowed to settle and a lower aqueous layer formed by the reaction may be removed while the upper heptane layer formed by the reaction may be washed with hot water having a temperature of about 60 C. the washed heptane layer may then be neutralized with an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution to a pH of about 5 to 7 and then removed by distillation under vacuum the reaction product may then be dried under vacuum at 100 C. and the dried product steam deodorized under vacuum conditions and filtered at about 50 to 60 C. using diatomaceous earth.

Hydroxylated glycerolipids can be converted to estolides. Estolides consist of a glycerolipid in which a hydroxylated fatty acid constituent has been esterified to another fatty acid molecule. Conversion of hydroxylated glycerolipids to estolides can be carried out by warming a mixture of glycerolipids and fatty acids and contacting the mixture with a mineral acid as described by Isbell et al. 71 2 169 174 1994 . Estolides are useful in a variety of applications including without limitation those reported in the following U.S. Pat. No. 7 196 124 Elastomeric materials and floor coverings U.S. Pat. No. 5 458 795 Thickened oils for high temperature applications U.S. Pat. No. 5 451 332 Fluids for industrial applications U.S. Pat. No. 5 427 704 Fuel additives and U.S. Pat.

The generation of oil bearing microbial biomass for fuel and chemical products as described above results in the production of delipidated biomass meal. Delipidated meal is a byproduct of preparing algal oil and is useful as animal feed for farm animals e.g. ruminants poultry swine and aquaculture. The resulting meal although of reduced oil content still contains high quality proteins carbohydrates fiber ash residual oil and other nutrients appropriate for an animal feed. Because the cells are predominantly lysed by the oil separation process the delipidated meal is easily digestible by such animals. Delipidated meal can optionally be combined with other ingredients such as grain in an animal feed. Because delipidated meal has a powdery consistency it can be pressed into pellets using an extruder or expander or another type of machine which are commercially available.

The invention having been described in detail above is exemplified in the following examples which are offered to illustrate but not to limit the claimed invention.

For determination of total lipid in cultures 3 ml of culture was removed and subjected to analysis using an Ankom system Ankom Inc. Macedon N.Y. according to the manufacturer s protocol. Samples were subjected to solvent extraction with an Amkom XT10 extractor according to the manufacturer s protocol. Total lipid was determined as the difference in mass between acid hydrolyzed dried samples and solvent extracted dried samples. Percent oil dry cell weight measurements are shown in Table 2.

Microalgae samples from the strains listed in Table 22 of U.S. Patent Application Publication 20100151112 were genotyped. Genomic DNA was isolated from algal biomass as follows. Cells approximately 200 mg were centrifuged from liquid cultures 5 minutes at 14 000 g. Cells were then resuspended in sterile distilled water centrifuged 5 minutes at 14 000 g and the supernatant discarded. A single glass bead 2 mm in diameter was added to the biomass and tubes were placed at 80 C. for at least 15 minutes. Samples were removed and 150 l of grinding buffer 1 Sarkosyl 0.25 M Sucrose 50 mM NaCl 20 mM EDTA 100 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0 RNase A 0.5 ug ul was added.

Five l of total algal DNA prepared as described above was diluted 1 50 in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0. PCR reactions final volume 20 l were set up as follows. Ten l of 2 iProof HF master mix BIO RAD was added to 0.4 l primer SZ02613 5 TGTTGAAGAATGAGCCGGCGAC 3 SEQ ID NO 13 at 10 mM stock concentration . This primer sequence runs from position 567 588 in Gen Bank accession no. L43357 and is highly conserved in higher plants and algal plastid genomes. This was followed by the addition of 0.4 l primer SZ02615 5 CAGTGAGCTATTACGCACTC 3 SEQ ID NO 14 at 10 mM stock concentration . This primer sequence is complementary to position 1112 1093 in Gen Bank accession no. L43357 and is highly conserved in higher plants and algal plastid genomes. Next 5 l of diluted total DNA and 3.2 l dHO were added. PCR reactions were run as follows 98 C. 45 98 C. 8 53 C. 12 72 C. 20 for 35 cycles followed by 72 C. for 1 min and holding at 25 C. For purification of PCR products 20 l of 10 mM Tris pH 8.0 was added to each reaction followed by extraction with 40 l of Phenol Chloroform isoamyl alcohol 12 12 1 vortexing and centrifuging at 14 000 g for 5 minutes. PCR reactions were applied to S 400 columns GE Healthcare and centrifuged for 2 minutes at 3 000 g. Purified PCR products were subsequently TOPO cloned into PCR8 GW TOPO and positive clones selected for on LB Spec plates.

In total twelve strains were selected to have their 23S rRNA DNA sequenced and the sequences are listed in the Sequence Listing. A summary of the strains and Sequence Listing Numbers is included below. The sequences were analyzed for overall divergence from the UTEX 1435 SEQ ID NO 5 sequence. Two pairs emerged UTEX 329 UTEX 1533 and UTEX 329 UTEX 1440 as the most divergent. In both cases pairwise alignment resulted in 75.0 pairwise sequence identity. The percent sequence identity to UTEX 1435 is also included below.

Lipid samples from a subset of the above listed strains were analyzed for lipid profile using HPLC. Results are shown below in Table 3.

The gold pellet was washed once with 500 l of cold 100 ethanol pelleted by brief spinning in the microfuge and resuspended with 50 l of ice cold ethanol. After a brief 1 2 sec sonication 10 l of DNA coated particles were immediately transferred to the carrier membrane.

Methods and effects of expressing a heterologous exogenous gene in species including for example codon optimization and chromosomal recombination sites have been previously described in PCT Application No. PCT US2009 66142 hereby incorporated by reference for these teachings. This example demonstrates the generation of a transgenic strain derived from UTEX 1435 containing exogenous genes for the metabolism and transport of xylose. The resulting transgenic strain generated had the ability to grow on media containing xylose as the sole carbon source. As discussed above the ability to metabolize xylose is important because xylose a pentose is a significant component of cellulosic derived feedstocks. Xylose is the major sugar monomer component of hemicellulose which along with cellulose forms the major structural components of most plant matter.

Preliminary results showed that UTEX 1435 can convert small amounts of xylose to xylitol as indicated by analytical measurements of the sugar levels in liquid media over time. UTEX 1435 was cultured in the media and conditions as described in Example 1 above in 4 xylose with 0.25 glucose as carbon sources in the medium. Also included were a no cells added negative control and a 4 glucose condition as a positive control for growth and a negative control for xylitol production. Table 4 shows that no xylitol was produced in the negative control condition whereas xylose containing medium with cells produced detectable amounts of xylitol in the culture supernatant after 5 days in culture. There was robust growth for cells in the glucose only condition but no detectable level of xylitol was produced.

This result may indicate that xylose can be converted into xylitol via an endogenous aldo keto reductase enzymatic activity in . Enzymes belonging to this family of NAPDH dependent oxidoreductases reside within the confines of the plasma membrane and if such an enzyme is responsible for the conversion of xylose to xylitol then the xylose in the culture medium must be entering into the cell via an endogenous sugar transporter.

In organisms that can metabolize xylose xylose is converted into xylulose 5 phosphate which is further metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway. may be capable of taking up xylose from its surrounding but is deficient in its ability to efficiently convert xylose into xylulose 5 phosphate. The results shown in Table 4 above suggest that this may be the case. To test this hypothesis the present invention provides methods and reagents for expressing xylose isomerase to first convert xylose into xylulose and xylulokinase to convert the xylulose to xylulose 5 phosphate. An exemplary illustration of such transgenic microalgal cells is described below using UTEX 1435 .

A transgenic recipient strain of expressing the xylose isomerase XylA gene from sp. and the xylulokinase XYL3 gene from and the invertase gene from suc2 a selectable marker was generated using the methodology and transformations previously described in PCT Patent Publication Nos. WO 2010 063031 and WO 2010 063032 each of which is incorporated herein by reference for their teachings of these methods. Positive clones were selected on sucrose containing medium and plates. The primary amino acid sequence of the sp. XylA Gen Bank Accession No. CAB76571 hereby incorporated by reference is listed as SEQ ID NO 15. The primary amino acid sequence of XYL3 Gen Bank Accession No. CAA39066.1 hereby incorporated by reference is listed as SEQ ID NO 51. Relevant portions of the sp. XylA XYL3 transformation cassette are listed below. This cassette contained 5 and 3 KE858 homologous recombination targeting sequences for genomic integration and are listed as SEQ ID NOs 16 and 17. Also contained are 1 suc2 sucrose invertase gene under the control of the beta tubulin promoter and the nitrate reductase 3 UTR SEQ ID NO 18 2 XYL3 under the control of the EF1a promoter and 3 UTR and 3 sp. XylA under the control of the actin promoter and EF1a 3 UTR. Positive clones were selected on sucrose containing medium and plates and expression of the transgenes were confirmed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated against XylA or XYL3 in Western blots.

Once the XylA XYL3 recipient strain was generated and confirmed using Western blots the strain was then retransformed with one of two cassettes. The first cassette was an integrative transformation vector that carried a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418 and an additional phosphate pentose phosphate translocator gene XPT from with the plastid transit peptide replaced with a transit peptide from an orthologous gene belonging to the same translocator family from . The primary amino acid sequence including the replaced transit peptide SEQ ID NO 25 is listed in SEQ ID NO 24. An alternative plastid transit peptide SEQ ID NO 26 was also tried and was equally successful. The second cassette was an episomal non integrative transformation vector containing a gene conferring resistance to the antibiotic G418 and an additional phosphate pentose phosphate translocator gene XPT from with the plastid transit peptide replaced with a transit peptide from an orthologous gene belonging to the same translocator family from and the XYL2 gene a xylitol dehydrogenase. In yeast such as XylA can be inhibited to some extent by xylitol. The preliminary experiment described above examining culture supernatant with non transformed cells showed detectable low levels of xylitol in the medium indicative of an endogenous reductase activity generating xylitol directly from xylose. This second construct containing the XYL2 xylitol dehydrogenase provides methods for alleviating such xyitol inhibition on XylA. Relevant portions of each of these two vectors are listed as SEQ ID NO 32 and SEQ ID NO 23 respectively along with individual cassette components below. The XPT alone integrative cassette contained the 5 and 3 6S homologous recombination targeting sequence and a neomycin resistance gene under the control of the beta tubulin promoter and nitrate reductase 3 UTR and the XPT gene with the replaced transit peptide sequence as described above under the control of the actin promoter and EF1a 3 UTR. The episomal cassette contained a neomycin resistance gene under the control of Gdh promoter and nitrate reductase 3 UTR the XYL2 gene under the control of the actin promoter and EF1a 3 UTR and the XPT gene under the control of beta tubulin promoter and EF1a 3 UTR.

Of the many positive clones from the transformation two strains one from each transformation were selected for more detailed characterization. Both strains were grown on solid media plates containing 2 xylose as the sole carbon source. After 3 4 weeks of incubation growth was measured for these transgenic strains and growth was observed for both transgenic strains but not for the parental recipient strain containing only the XylA and XYL3 transgenes. Confirmation of these results was performed to test xylose consumption using a liquid media environment. Liquid cultures containing both transgenic strains XylA XYL3 XPT and XYL2 XylA XYL3 and XPT and the parental recipient strain XylA and XYL3 only were set up using 2 xylose as the sole carbon source. Growth measured by OD750 readings and xylose consumption measuring the amount of xylose remaining in the media were measured at various time points during culture. No growth or xylose consumption was observed in the parental recipient strain while both transgenic strains showed growth and xylose consumption. Table 5 summarizes the growth and xylose consumption results.

Four xylose specific transporters SUT1 GXS1 symporter and XLT1 SEQ ID NOs 37 39 41 and 43 respectively some of which transport xylose actively and some of which allow passive diffusion of xylose into the cell were expressed as transgenes in . The gene for each xylose transporter was codon optimized the codon optimized coding regions are shown at SEQ ID NOs 36 38 40 and 42 respectively to allow for maximal expression in and inserted into the genome of the microalgal cells under the control of the actin promoter and EF1a 3 UTR. Expression of each of the four genes was confirmed as was their insertion and localization to the cell membrane. Confirmation of localization to the cell membrane included fusing DNA sequences encoding a fluorescent protein in frame to the carboxyl terminus of each of the transporter transgenes and observing cells expressing the constructs utilizing fluorescence microscopy.

Micrographs of cells expressing each of the four transporters with a fluorescent protein fused to their carboxyl terminus showed that the transporters were expressed and localized to the cell membrane.

Although the expression of enzymes responsible for conversion of xylose to xylulose 5 phosphate did not appear to initially confer the ability to metabolize xylose in the cells the ability to grow on xylose was conferred by increasing the copy number of the transgenes. The copy number of the genes encoding these enzymes was increased using a selectable marker. The original parent cells had a copy number of one for all three transgenes suc2 XylA and XYL3 and did not appear to grow on xylose but after growth under selection wherein the ability to grow on sucrose was imparted by a gene suc2 adjacent to the genes encoding the xylose metabolism enzymes three independent isolates that were characterized had increased the copy number of all three transgenes by three to fifty fold. The isolates with increased copy number were assessed for growth on xylose. Isolate A which displayed the greatest increase in copy number 50 fold had acquired the ability to grow on xylose. The original parent was unable to grow on xylose as were the two isolates B and C that displayed only moderate increases in copy number 3 4 fold . The ability of Isolate A to grow on xylose demonstrates that the transgenes were expressed retain their enzymatic activity in a heterologous organism and can confer on that organism the ability to utilize xylose.

As demonstrated in the examples herein individual transgenes encoding xylose metabolism enzymes were successfully inserted into . To investigate the effect of combining these various transgenes in a single cell strains of containing certain combinations see the Genotypes in Table 6 of the transgenes discussed in Examples 4 6 were prepared and screened for xylose metabolism.

Ten independent transformants of each unique genotype were clonally purified and assessed for growth on solid media containing only 2.5 percent xylose as the sole carbon source. Potential positive clones were further tested in liquid culture containing xylose as the sole carbon source. Growth of the cells was monitored by measuring the optical density of the culture. At the end of the experiment the culture supernatant was analyzed for xylose content. Table 6 shows the final growth and xylose consumption of the ten best strains Strains D to M compared with negative controls Strains A B and C . Strains D to M are clearly capable of consuming xylose as all of the xylose in the culture media had disappeared by the end of the experiment. In contrast the same amount of xylose that was present at the beginning of the experiment was still detected at the end of the experiment in culture medium hosting the negative control strains A B and C. The disappearance of xylose was accompanied by increases in cell density indicating that carbon from xylose was being used to support cell growth. In contrast the negative controls did not increase in cell density throughout the course of the experiment and at the end of the experiment the culture media contained about the same amount of xylose that had been in the media at the beginning of the experiment indicating that xylose was not consumed at all or that the amount of xylose consumed was very small.

Multiple strains with unique genotypes showed clear increases in biomass using xylose as the sole carbon source. These results demonstrate that microalgae were engineered to grow on xylose via transformation with multiple transgenes or groups of transgenes that transported xylose into the cell biochemically converted xylose to xylulose 5 phosphate and delivered xylulose 5 phosphate to an endogenous central metabolic pathway.

Xylose metabolizing strains A M from Example 7 were evaluated for the ability to produce oil when grown using xylose as the sole carbon source. The xylose metabolizing stains were subjected to a lipid productivity assay together with negative control strains. Cells were first grown up in media containing glucose and then subjected to a lipid productivity phase using either glucose or xylose as the sole source of carbon. As sugar became depleted from the cultures more of the corresponding sugar was fed to the cells until consumption ceased. At this point the experiment was terminated and cells were analyzed for lipid content. Table 7 shows the results of the lipid analysis. All strains were normalized to Strain A s performance on glucose expressed as lipid as percent of dry cell weight. All engineered strains performed similarly to the parental non engineered control strains when glucose was fed to the cultures. The negative control strains A B C produced small amounts of lipid when cultured on xylose 6 8 percent of the amount normally made by Strain A in glucose . In contrast all ten xylose metabolizing stains were capable of producing significant amounts of lipid when cultured in xylose. The best strain L accumulated up to 60 percent of the amount of lipid normally made by Strain A when grown on glucose.

These results show that the inserted pathways can divert carbon from xylose and utilize it to produce a lipid.
