This invention was made with government support under N66001 12 C 4033 awarded by the Department of the Navy. The government has certain rights in the invention.

Gyroscopes are typically calibrated at the factory upon completion of manufacture. However recalibration is often required at later times. Maintaining gyroscope calibration is done using expensive instruments by building expensive and massive gimbals into inertial systems to allow rotation or by removing the gyroscope sensor and returning it to a factory or test facility for recalibration. There are numerous costs and or down time associated with conventional recalibration. In particular accurate bias and scale factor at mission time are generally realized either by using more accurate gyroscope sensors or by rotating the sensors. More accurate gyroscopes are generally more expensive and much larger and consume more power. Rotating the gyroscope sensor requires either costly gimbals which increase the system size or removal of the sensor or inertial measurement unit such that it can be recalibrated on a suitable test station.

Aspects and embodiments are directed to a calibration system and methods for gyroscopes that do not require the use of gimbals or rotary stages. The system and methods disclosed herein are widely applicable to symmetric and non symmetric gyroscopes including ring gyroscopes MEMS gyroscopes and others and may also be useful in a variety of other applications.

One embodiment is directed to a method of calibrating a gyroscope having an x axis and a y axis and including an oscillator loop and a feedback loop. The method may comprise applying off resonant voltage signals to the gyroscope with the oscillator loop and the feedback loop turned off and measuring feed forward terms determining a pick off relative phase angle between the x axis and the y axis configuring the gyroscope with the oscillator loop on the x axis and the y axis as a closed loop sensing channel exciting gyroscope sidebands using a plurality of equally spaced input frequencies and recording data as a function of time the data including the input frequencies an x axis drive voltage V a y axis drive voltage V an x axis pick off voltage V a y axis pick off voltage V and a phase reference voltage processing the data into a data table running a parameter estimation process using the data table to estimate parameters of the gyroscope and calculating a relative pick off magnitude between the x axis and the y axis a cross damping coefficient a cross stiffness coefficient and an input angular rate of the gyroscope based on the pick off relative phase angle and the estimated parameters of the gyroscope.

In one example in which the gyroscope is a ring gyroscope determining the pick off relative phase angle includes exciting the gyroscope ring with an off resonant frequency. In another example the method further comprises reconfiguring the gyroscope with the oscillator loop on the y axis and the x axis as the closed loop sensing channel and repeating the step of exciting the gyroscope sidebands and recording the data. In one example running the parameter estimation process includes estimating forcing signal coupling terms damping terms cross damping terms cross stiffness terms and a phase variation of the oscillator loop from 2.

According to another embodiment a method of calibrating a gyroscope comprises operating the gyroscope in a self oscillation loop to generate x axis and y axis drive signals adding forcing signals to the x axis and y axis drive signals to produce pick off x axis and y axis signals measuring the pick off x axis and y axis signals to produce measurement data determining a relative phase between the pick off x axis and y axis signals based on the measurement data and the relative phase estimating parameters of the gyroscope and based on the measurement data and the estimated parameters calculating estimated position signals to calibrate the gyroscope.

In one example the method further comprises removing feed forward noise from the pick off x axis and y axis signals. In another example the method further comprises adding side band signals to the pick off x axis and y axis signals. In another example operating the gyroscope in the self oscillation loop includes configuring the gyroscope with the self oscillation loop on the x axis and the y axis as a closed loop sensing channel. In another example operating gyroscope in the self oscillation loop includes applying off resonant voltage signals to the gyroscope and measuring feed forward terms. The method may further comprise exciting gyroscope sidebands using a plurality of input frequencies and recording the measurement data as a function of time the measurement data including the input frequencies an x axis drive voltage V a y axis drive voltage V an x axis pick off voltage V a y axis pick off voltage V and a phase reference voltage. In one example the plurality of input frequencies are equally spaced. The method may further comprise reversing the axes of the self oscillation loop and the closed loop sensing channel and repeating the step of exciting the gyroscope sidebands to produce second measurement data the second measurement data including a reversed x axis drive voltage a reversed y axis drive voltage a reversed x axis pick off voltage a reversed y axis pick off voltage V and a reversed phase reference voltage. In another example the method further comprises based on the measurement data and the estimated parameters determining an angular rate of the gyroscope. In one example estimating the parameters includes estimating coupling terms of the sideband forcing signals damping terms cross damping terms cross stiffness terms a phase variation of the oscillator loop from 2 and a magnitude of a ratio of the pick off x axis and y axis signals. The coupling terms of the sideband forcing signals may include forcing signal misalignments. In another example adding the sideband forcing signals includes modulating the pick off x axis and y axis signals.

Still other aspects embodiments and advantages of these exemplary aspects and embodiments are discussed in detail below. Embodiments disclosed herein may be combined with other embodiments in any manner consistent with at least one of the principles disclosed herein and references to an embodiment some embodiments an alternate embodiment various embodiments one embodiment or the like are not necessarily mutually exclusive and are intended to indicate that a particular feature structure or characteristic described may be included in at least one embodiment. The appearances of such terms herein are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.

Aspects and embodiments are directed to hardware and software configured to calibrate the bias and scale factor of a gyroscope for example a ring gyroscope or tuning fork gyroscope without rotating the gyroscope. is a graph illustrating the input and output characteristics of a gyroscope. In the baseband output voltage V of the gyroscope vertical axis is plotted as a function of the angular rate of rotation horizontal axis producing trace . The bias is the offset of trace on the vertical axis at the point at which trace crosses the vertical axis and the scale factor is the slope of trace i.e. the rate of change of V as a function of angular rate . Nonlinear scale factor terms are assumed to be small and compensated by one time factory calibration.

As discussed above gyroscopes are typically calibrated at the factory. However after factory calibration the gyroscopes may be in storage for many years whereas the missions in which the gyroscopes are used may last for minutes or several hours. Knowing calibration of the gyroscope after long periods of time may be of critical importance in inertial guidance applications particularly with strap down systems. As illustrated in the gyroscope sensor drift over years represented by trace is typically much greater than the drift over a short time period represented by trace . This is particularly true when the sensor or system is thermally controlled for the short time period represented by trace for example corresponding to the time of a mission in which the gyroscope is used e.g. mission time . For high performance sensors it is generally desirable to calibrate bias accounting for earth rate and to calibrate the scale factor. Although gyroscopes are further described by additional parameters such as misalignment and nonlinearities the bias and scale factor generally have the most variation over time and environment. Accordingly aspects and embodiments are directed to hardware and software algorithms configured to calibrate gyroscope bias separate bias from earth rate and scale factor without rotating the sensor. As discussed further below a technique according to certain embodiments adds forcing signals sidebands to the typical forces generated for gyroscope self oscillation. Parameter estimation yields the bias and scale factor parameters used in normal closed loop sensing and to calibrate the sensor as discussed in more detail below.

It is to be appreciated that embodiments of the methods and apparatuses discussed herein are not limited in application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The methods and apparatuses are capable of implementation in other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways. Examples of specific implementations are provided herein for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to be limiting. Also the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use herein of including comprising having containing involving and variations thereof is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as additional items.

In the above Equations the small angle approximation is used for sine and cosine . Equations 1 6 are written for an electrostatically driven and sensed gyroscope. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art similar equations may be written for other mechanizations such as ring gyroscopes driven and sensed by D Arsonval magnetic devices.

In Equations 1 and 2 the terms have been grouped to emphasize terms that are addressed in the parameter estimator discussed below. Equation 1 represents two second order resonators coupled lightly by cross stiffness quadrature cross damping bias and the desired angular rate. In normal operation the x axis is the self oscillator also called the drive or primary axis while the y axis also called the sense or secondary axis is run closed loop with high bandwidth e.g. about 100 Hz . The self oscillator is important because it keeps the electrical reference signal used for demodulation and remodulation phase locked with the mechanical resonance.

In one example of a MEMS based ring gyroscope having a quality factor of 30 000 the resonance peak 3 dB width corresponding to a 45 phase shift is 0.2 Hz while stiffness variation causes the resonant frequency to change 27 ppm C. or 0.4 Hz C. For such an example obtaining good bias stability may require control of phase shifts on the order of 10 microradians wad which implies impossible thermal control. Accordingly it is preferable that the gyroscope operation avoids sensitivity to operating about the resonant peak. In other words terms of the form ms bs k should be avoided. In the case of a ring gyroscope where drive and sense frequencies are very close to one another small changes in stiffness or resonant frequency results in large phase errors which cause large gyroscope errors.

According to one embodiment to avoid ms bs k terms feed forward errors are removed from the position signal rather than from the force rebalance. For the sense axis the force rebalance is generated from the corrected position signal. Therefore the drive force is given by 7 In Equation 7 s is the Laplace transform of d dt and H s is the feedback transfer function. H s may be implemented by demodulation compensation and remodulation.

With a tight secondary feedback loop V 0 and small angle approximations for the DC voltage to rebalance the sense axis the principal gyroscope output is given by 

Terms in Equation 8 can be grouped to represent the bias and scale factor shown in . In one example the drive x axis position signal pick off signal V and the x axis drive or forcing signal V are AC signals near the oscillator frequency. In a preferred embodiment the drive axis position is used as the reference signal and is given by cos t and the desired velocity signal is equal to sin t . To obtain the desired base band rate signal these signals may be multiplied by sin t because the operator i in Equation 8 represents a 90 degree phase shift.

For usual operation of the gyroscope the drive axis x for example is driven in a self oscillator loop which is described by the following. The transfer function output divided by input for the linear case for the Vpick off versus the Vdrive may be obtained From Equation 1 . In most examples it may be desirable to operate at the mechanical resonance where the phase shift is 2. Accordingly a feedback amplifier and gain control loop may be implemented to add an additional 2 phase and to maintain the x amplitude. Mathematically the resonant frequency may be determined by 

Unlike many other sensors e.g. pendulous accelerometers for the gyroscope determining the bias and scale factor does not require absolute knowledge of the proof mass ring positions. Rather only the x y ratio magnitude and phase is used. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the feed forward terms E and the forcing terms with misalignment B are complex quantities because of phase shifts in the electronics. According to certain embodiments the estimator only excites the gyroscope near its resonant frequency in order to avoid exciting adjacent eigenmodes. Accordingly the estimator may combine pick off misalignment with forcer misalignments and and as a result it may not be possible to determine independently. However as demonstrated below the angular rate calculation may be performed successfully using combined pick off and forcer angles. Independent knowledge of the forcer angles and and the pick off angle is not required. Additionally in certain embodiments due to the limited range of exciting frequencies the estimator may not detect the relative phase of the pick off signals. Where this term may be important it may be estimated by other methods as discussed further below.

Still referring again to the y axis loop is a force rebalance represented by block which is executed by in phase and quadrature demodulation and remodulation not shown in .

As discussed above the feed forward terms may be removed from the pick offs Vand V rather than from the force rebalance. By operating the primary axis in a self resonant oscillator loop by closing loop secondary and by adding side bands and demodulation any effects of stiffness changes k klinear and cubic softening are eliminated from the read out equations 3 and 4 . Accordingly the necessary parameters in equations 3 and 4 can be estimated even with variation in the stiffnesses by amplitude modulating the self drive torque signal V.

The parameter estimation and calculation of angular rate during missions may be done by software referred to herein as the estimator or estimator algorithms processes operating on the data that is extracted by the digital acquisition system DAQ in particular on measurements of V V Vand V. As a result the estimator may be largely insensitive to the exact implementation of the force rebalance loops. Thus in one example the forcing signals Vand Vfrom the sensor are provided to the DAQ for processing by the estimator undergo filtering modulation and optionally gain control and are returned as estimates of Vand V respectively as the oscillator drive and secondary force displacements as discussed below in Equations 11 through 19 . Additionally drive signals may be conditioned to eliminate feed forward leakages signals represented by etc.

According to certain embodiments the position signal V rather than the force signal V is modulated because the amplitude control and regeneration suppress the effect of the additional forces. Even when only a single side band is applied through modulation the closed loop results in many side bands as shown for example in . In certain examples because of their large amplitude only the first sidebands are used. Because the drive axis is operated in closed loop self oscillation modulating the pick off signals results in modulation of the drive signals. shows modulation of the oscillator pick off signal V. shows the resulting modulation of the oscillator forcing signal V.

According to one embodiment from Equation 1 above separating the damping cross coupling bfrom earth rate may be achieved by interchanging the roles of the x and y axes during calibration. Instead of the oscillator being x as shown in the y axis becomes the oscillator and the x axis is force rebalanced. This interchange may be accomplished by a set of switches provided on a switching circuit board coupled to the gyroscope.

In doing self calibration an important assumption is that the ratio of Coriolis mass mc over modal mass m is constant after factory calibration. This ratio is also called the Bryant factor. Typically it is expected that the Bryant factor remains constant since it depends primarily on mass and not stiffness. According to certain embodiments the estimator may be used to determine all mechanical and electrical parameters necessary to determine the gyroscope s bias and scale factor as discussed above. Table 1 below list the 23 parameters to be estimated according to one embodiment.

According to one embodiment using a rate table the gyroscope and sensor are calibrated at the factory to determine the Bryant factor sensor mounting plate misalignment and other errors such as nonlinearities in scale factor. With known input rate the estimator may determine the Bryant factor. It is assumed that changes in Bryant factor out of plane misalignments and the other errors are small and will remain at acceptable levels over the system life and mission. Periodically or before a mission the estimator may calibrate the gyroscope bias and scale factor without rotating the system a necessity for strap down and inertial stabilized systems. The estimator may remove earth rate from the estimated gyroscope bias as discussed above. After calibration the gyroscope is limited by its in run stability which usually requires thermal control. For example if the scale factor changes by 100 ppm C. then thermal control of 0.1 C. is required for 10 ppm scale factor stability.

Referring to there is illustrated a flow diagram of one example of an individual calibration sequence that may be performed on a gyroscope using the estimator discussed herein.

The sequence may begin at step which includes turning on the instrument and allowing it to stabilize. The calibration process may remove long term drift. Thereafter the gyroscope sensor operates at the level of its in run stability as discussed above.

At step the feed forward coefficients are determined. According to one embodiment in step with the oscillator and feedback loops turned off voltages are applied to the gyroscope the applied frequencies differing slightly from the resonant frequencies. The feed forward terms may be measured directly. In another example one or more potentiometers e.g. element in may be used to adjust the feed through terms to zero. The success of the trim may be determined from the residuals of the transfer function fits.

At step the pick off relative phase angle may be determined. In one example wherein the calibration process is applied to a ring gyroscope this parameter is determined by exciting the gyroscope ring with frequency slightly off the resonant frequency little ring motion off resonance . Assuming the x and y air gaps in the ring gyroscope are identical the relative magnitudes and phases may also be determined. In another example pick off relative phase angle may be determined by driving the ring to large amplitudes and comparing side lobes to the principal excitation peak a technique known as Trusov Shkel.

In one example the gyroscope is configured with the x axis as the oscillator and the y axis as the closed loop sensing channel. In this configuration at step the gyroscope side bands are excited at different frequencies. In one example for a gyroscope having a resonant half peak width of 0.25 Hz the side bands may be excited at frequencies equally spaced between 0.1 and 1.5 Hz. Step further includes recording the input frequencies the drive V V and V V pick off voltages and the phase reference voltage all as a function of time. The frequency of the applied side band is also recorded.

Step includes reversing the sensing and oscillator channels and repeating the side band excitation of step indicated by arrow .

In one embodiment step includes processing obtained data into a table for use by the estimator. The data may include a series of voltages representing the two drive and two pick off signals and the phase reference which is derived from the drive pick off versus time along with a recorded oscillation frequency. In one example this data may be sampled at high frequency i.e. taking many data samples per measurement cycle . Alternatively in another example the data may be demodulated or down mixed into analog and sampled at a lower rate. In certain examples the position signal from which the phase reference is derived may have extra side bands as shown in which could affect demodulation. From the carrier a digital phase locked loop PLL may be used to remove higher harmonics and amplitude modulation. The PLL frequency follows oscillator frequency modulation caused by both the stiffness variations with temperature or drive amplitude so that demodulation yields the desired side band transfer functions independent of oscillator frequency. The individual signals are multiplied by the reference signal and by its quadrature signal and low passed to obtain the signals versus the base band frequency. Each output signal may be divided into complex numbers in phase with the reference and in quadrature with the reference. As discussed above the phase relationships may be controlled to match those of the estimator. In addition to determining the drive and pick signals at sideband frequencies the transfer function between the drives and pick offs may be calculated.

Step may include running the estimator to determine the first 15 parameters listed in Table 1 above. Examples of the estimator algorithms which may be used in step are discussed further below. The estimator algorithms may use either the side band transfer functions or the side band drive and pick off voltages as discussed in more detail below.

Step may include using the relative phase angle measured in step and the parameter estimates obtained in step to calculate the relative pick off magnitude p p the cross damping b the cross stiffness k and the input angular rate based on b b k and kfrom Equation 4 .

After the calibration procedure is complete during normal operation of the gyroscope a step may include using the obtained parameters and terms to determine the angular rate of the gyroscope during a mission based on Equations 3 4 7 and 8 .

As discussed above in certain examples the estimator algorithms may use the side band transfer functions. For the case where the primary pick off is x and the secondary pick off is y these transfer functions may be defined as follows.

For the following mathematical derivation consider the nominal oscillator drive as sin t which is generated by the normal self oscillator loop as discussed above . Those skilled in the art will appreciate given the benefit of this disclose that the physical modulation is applied to the position pick off V as shown in . The nominal drive function is modulated so that the drive function is given by sin 1 sin sin 10 In Equation 10 m is the modulation index which typically may be in a range of approximately 2 20 . The drive signal passes through the sensor see whose transfer function is G s . The output signal is demodulated by multiplying by 2 sin t and filtering the higher frequency terms to obtain the demodulated output V t . The side band transfer function for sine demodulation is given by 

As discussed above in practical implementation when the secondary axis is run in closed loop there may be several side band signals on the x and y drive signals as shown in for example. In one embodiment all signals are referenced to the phase reference line in the example of which is nominally the oscillator position or velocity. As discussed above from the carrier a digital phase locked loop PLL removes higher harmonics and amplitude modulation. The PLL frequency follows oscillator frequency modulation caused by both the stiffness variations with temperature or drive amplitude so that demodulation yields the desired side band transfer functions independent of oscillator frequency. In processing the signals to base band maintaining phase and amplitude fidelity is crucial. Accordingly after multiplication to base band all signals are filtered by the same digital filters. The amplitude and phase real and imaginary parts may be extracted by least squares. Since the side band frequency is well known and recorded step linear least squares may be applied to make the processing time very rapid.

According to another embodiment the gyroscope system may be operated and calibrated with an open loop secondary. The drive signals might contain both sine and cosine terms. In this case the following relationships exist between the baseband drives and pick offs 13 14 In Equations 13 and 14 PDis the primary drive demodulated by 2 times the phase reference and PDis the primary drive demodulated by 2 times the quadrature reference. Gis the primary drive to primary pick off baseband transfer function demodulated by the phase reference. In this case the phase reference is defined as sin t .

Equations 13 and 14 assume no input on the secondary axis. In other words the implicit assumption is that the only contribution to the primary pick off is from the primary drive via the Gsensor transfer function. This being a linear problem the effects of additional coupling from the Gtransfer function are superimposed. That is the response on the primary pick off when both the primary drive and the secondary drive are excited is the sum of the responses GPD GSD. Additionally the sine and cosine demodulation is agnostic to the axes in question and therefore the same relationships apply to the Gtransfer function. Accordingly the response on the primary axis may be expressed as 15 16 

When the gyroscope is operated with the primary loop connected to the primary oscillator drive and secondary closed loop values are obtained for PPO PPO PD PD SD and SD . There are four unknowns in the problem stated by Equations 15 and 16 namely G G G and G. Accordingly two additional equations are needed along with an additional set of measurements. These may be obtained by inverting the drive using the primary as the force rebalance loop as discussed above. This process provides a new set of values PPO PPO PD PD SD SD which must also satisfy Equations 15 and 16 . Thus there are four equations to solve for the four unknowns. This can be written out in matrix form to provide Equation 17 

During each run of the gyroscope data may also be obtained from the secondary pick off and the same equations apply by changing the transfer function subscripts appropriately since the sin cos demodulation is axis agnostic 

According to one embodiment the estimator minimizes a quadratic function that includes the squares of differences between measured and calculated positions or measured and calculated transfer functions . For position data the estimator cost function is given by Equation 19 19 In Equation 19 of is the number of frequencies used to obtain the sideband data as discussed above subscript e indicates an estimated parameter based on assumed coefficients and subscript m indicates measured data. To control the fit and emphasize desired terms the individual terms can be weighted. The estimation is done in the frequency domain rather than the time domain for greatly reduced execution time. The estimation may also be done in the time domain by sweeping the input voltages over a range of frequencies. For the time domain version there are no discrete frequencies to sum over and the sum must be over all time instants in the data set which is part of the reason why computation time is so vast for the time domain .

In one embodiment the estimator algorithm uses an initial guess for the parameters listed in Table 1. Rough estimates for the damping constant b m b m and the forcer parameters B B with the other parameters assumed to be zero are sufficient for convergence. The estimator then calculates the normal transfer functions from these parameters and from the measured drive voltages according to Equation 2 . The estimator algorithm may then proceed to calculate the base band transfer functions from Equations 13 and 14 and then calculate the estimated position signals using Equations 15 19 . Well established minimizing algorithms may be used to iteratively adjust the parameters to minimize the function J in Equation 19 . After the data has converged effects of relative pick off phase shifts are removed to determine the physical cross damping b m and cross stiffness k m terms and to estimate the angular rate.

Thus aspects and embodiments provide a self calibration process that does not depend on the absolute value of a pick off or forcer constant and the associated electrical gains. Rather only the ratio magnitude and phase of the pick off constant is required. In most examples processing is done in the frequency domain to reduce computation time. Frequencies may be swept over only a small range to avoid coupling into other modes. By operating the oscillator at resonance by demodulating with the oscillation signal and by running the secondary closed loop sensitivity to the stiffness terms kx and ky and their sensitivity to ring displacement nonlinearity is eliminated and need not be estimated. As discussed above the estimator may determine the relative magnitude of the pick off Px Py however it may not be possible to estimate the relative angle between the pick offs for a small frequency sweep. Accordingly the relative angle may be determined by exciting the gyro ring with an AC signal rather than the forcers with a frequency that is slightly off the resonant frequency. The relative angle may then be used to determine the angular rate of the gyroscope see Equation 4 . Except for a weak dependence on the oscillator phase criterion the estimator does not depend on the specifics of the feedback electronics in either the oscillator or the closed loop sense axis. Calibration and demodulation may be done digitally. When calibrating the gyroscope at the factory the estimator may estimate the rate applied during calibration from the band bterms of Equation 1 . Because of small non linear terms and other effects this rate may differ from the actual angular rate earth rate or table rate . Accordingly an estimated fixed difference between the two rates may be applied to subsequent calibrations in the field.

As discussed above certain embodiments use an amplitude controlled oscillator add sidebands to the oscillating axis and use closed loop secondary axis control. However as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art given the benefit of this disclosure other embodiments may be implemented. For example in certain embodiments calibration may be performed without the self oscillator. In this case the drive frequency is swept without modulation to probe the gyroscope. This calibration may be very sensitive to variations in stiffness particularly with high quality factor gyroscopes. The secondary axis may be operated in closed or open loop. According to another embodiment the self oscillator may be run with modulation leaving the secondary loop open. In this case nonlinear stiffness terms may degrade performance of calibration. Alternatively the self oscillator may be operated with closed secondary loop with the modulation applied to the secondary output. In this configuration nonlinear stiffness terms again may degrade calibration performance. In another embodiment the position signal may be frequency modulated instead of amplitude modulated. This arrangement may provide a mechanism for handling nonlinear stiffness terms in the above mentioned arrangements.

Aspects and embodiments provide a calibration system and method that allows for determining the gyroscope bias better than earth rate and scale factor without rotating the instrument. As discussed above hardware associated with the gyroscope system may be provided to perform side band modulation and axis switching to eliminate the otherwise very large sensitivity to stiffness variation with motion amplitude time and temperature.

According to certain embodiments the calibration process is approached by breaking the parameter estimation problem into steps of a removing the feed forward noise from the pick off signals b applying the estimator to the side band modulated data and c determining the relative phase shift of the pick offs by varying the voltage applied to the gyroscope . As discussed above the side bands may be added to the normal oscillator signals and in particular may be added to the oscillator pick off V rather that at the forcing voltage V. Voltage versus time data may then be processed to obtain the side band transfer functions as discussed above. Demodulation techniques may be used to account for the amplitude and phase side bands on the reference phase signal.

According to certain embodiments the estimator may be augmented by applying Shkel Trusov and other techniques as discussed above to determine the pick off relative gain and phase and optionally with the inclusion of thermal control to improve in run stability. Improved knowledge of bias and scale factor is important for many commercial and military applications of gyroscope and inertial sensing systems. Aspects and embodiments of the calibration processes discussed herein may allow inexpensive receivers to be used in GPS denied environments such as urban canyons and anti jamming in military applications for example and may provide improved inertial navigation sensors.

It has been noted that the spring forces could in some cases contain cubic terms that is the spring forces in the x and y direction could be described as 20 21 While the linear auto stiffness terms are always positive the cubic terms can be positive or negative representing spring stiffening or softening respectively. It has been noted above that amplitude control in the oscillator loop closed loop control in the secondary loop and the side band demodulation remove the effects of the cubic stiffness.

Similarly the cross stiffness terms may include cubic terms that is 22 23 where kand kare cubic coefficients. Terms that include both x and y for example xy are neglected since with closed loop operation with either x or y would be very small. Unlike the auto stiffness terms the cross stiffness nonlinearities require special handling in the estimator. From Equation 10 consider that the electrical force input to the oscillator is written as 

With perfect feedback electronics the carrier phase should be zero. Non zero allows for phase shift in the oscillator electronics.

Demodulating xby 2 Cos t results in additional terms which appear as sideband transfer functions. cub cos cos Cos 3 Sin sin Sin 2 27 

While the cubic terms are linear in the side bands they do depend on the carrier amplitude squared therefore several drive amplitudes must be included in the self calibration if cubic terms are to be estimated. If these terms are not included in the estimator the estimator will attribute them to cross stiffness and cross damping with ensuing poor calibration of important closed loop parameters indicated in Equation 8 . Employing Equations 26 and 27 the cubic terms kand kshould be added to the estimator if the hardware indicates their inclusion.

According to some embodiments the functions and operations discussed for calibrating a gyroscope can be executed on computer systems and individually and or in combination. The computer systems and may include personal computing devices desktop computers laptop computers dedicated computing hardware systems etc.

The estimator algorithms processes may be implemented as specialized hardware or software executing in one or more of the computer systems . Components of computer system are illustrated in however those skilled in the art will appreciate that computer systems and may include similar components. As depicted the computer system includes at least one processor e.g. a single core or a multi core processor a memory a bus input output interfaces e.g. and storage . The processor which may include one or more microprocessors or other types of controllers can perform a series of instructions that manipulate data. As shown the processor is connected to other system components including a memory by an interconnection element e.g. the bus .

The memory and or storage may be used for storing programs and data during operation of the computer system . For example the memory may be a relatively high performance volatile random access memory such as a dynamic random access memory DRAM or static memory SRAM . In addition the memory may include any device for storing data such as a disk drive or other non volatile storage device such as flash memory solid state or phase change memory PCM . In further embodiments the functions and operations discussed with respect to processing the data obtained from the DAQ and estimating parameters of the gyroscope can be embodied in an application that is executed on the computer system from the memory and or the storage .

Computer system also includes one or more interfaces such as input devices output devices and combination input output devices. In some examples rather than being connected to the DAQ via the network the computer system is connected to the DAQ via the interfaces . The interfaces may receive input provide output or both. The storage may include a computer readable and computer writeable nonvolatile storage medium in which instructions are stored that define a program to be executed by the processor. The storage system also may include information that is recorded on or in the medium and this information may be processed by the application. A medium that can be used with various embodiments may include for example optical disk magnetic disk or flash memory SSD among others. Further aspects and embodiments are not to a particular memory system or storage system.

In some embodiments the computer system may include an operating system that manages at least a portion of the hardware components e.g. input output devices touch screens cameras etc. included in computer system . One or more processors or controllers such as processor may execute an operating system which may be among others a Windows based operating system e.g. Windows NT ME XP Vista 7 8 or RT available from the Microsoft Corporation an operating system available from Apple Computer e.g. MAC OS including System X one of many Linux based operating system distributions for example the Enterprise Linux operating system available from Red Hat Inc. a Solaris operating system available from Sun Microsystems or a UNIX operating systems available from various sources. Many other operating systems may be used including operating systems designed for personal computing devices e.g. iOS Android etc. and embodiments are not limited to any particular operating system.

The processor and operating system together define a computing platform on which applications may be executed. Further various embodiments of the estimator algorithms processes may be implemented as programmed or non programmed components or any combination thereof. Thus various embodiments are not limited to a specific programming language and any suitable programming language may be used.

Although the computer system is shown by way of example as one type of computer system upon which the estimator may be practiced aspects and embodiments are not limited to being implemented on the computer system shown in . Various aspects and functions may be practiced on one or more computers or similar devices having different architectures or components than that shown in .

Thus aspects and embodiments may provide methods for calibrating a gyroscope that do not require rotating the gyroscope and employ parameter estimation to yield the bias and scale factor parameters used in normal closed loop sensing and to perform the calibration. As discussed above the transfer functions which are fit in the estimator are those measured from the side band demodulated inputs to the sideband demodulated outputs . This effectively removes the large thermal sensitivity of mechanical stiffness and resonant frequency. The data is processed into a table of side band outputs versus inputs or side band transfer functions output divided by input for linear cases . In certain embodiments the parameters estimated include those listed above in Table 1 and as discussed above the techniques disclosed herein may advantageously eliminate the need to measure or estimate several redundant variables such as pick off misalignment and mechanical stiffness for example while providing good calibration of the gyroscope.

Having described above several aspects of at least one embodiment it is to be appreciated various alterations modifications and improvements will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations modifications and improvements are intended to be part of this disclosure and are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Accordingly the foregoing description and drawings are by way of example only and the scope of the invention should be determined from proper construction of the appended claims and their equivalents.
