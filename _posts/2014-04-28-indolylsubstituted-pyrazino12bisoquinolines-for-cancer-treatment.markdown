This invention relates to novel pharmaceutically useful compounds which compounds may be useful in the treatment of cancer. The invention also relates to synthetic methods for preparing the compounds.

Cancer is a class of diseases that affects people world wide. Generally cells in a benign tumor retain their differentiated features and do not divide in a completely uncontrolled manner. A benign tumor is usually localised and non metastatic.

In a malignant tumor cells become undifferentiated do not respond to the body s growth control signals and multiply in an uncontrolled manner. Malignant tumors are generally divided into two categories primary and secondary. Primary tumors arise directly from the tissue in which they are found. Secondary tumors may be originated from the primary tumors or may be originated elsewhere in the body and are capable of spreading to distant sites metastasizing or metastasis. The common routes for metastasis are direct growth into adjacent structures spread through the vascular or lymphatic systems or blood streams.

Tumor metastases are the major cause of mortality in cancer patients. There is compelling evidence that angiogenesis is clinically relevant to the progression and metastasis of cancer. Angiogenesis consists of several steps the basement membrane degradation endothelial cell proliferation and migration and capillary tubule formation. New capillary vessels recruited by tumors deliver nutrients and oxygen into a growing tumor and remove catabolites and carbon dioxide. Diseases associated with abnormal angiogenesis require or induce vascular growth. For example corneal angiogenesis involves three phases a pre vascular latent period active neovascularization and vascular maturation and regression. The identity and mechanism of various angiogenic factors including elements of the inflammatory response such as leukocytes platelets cytokines and eicosanoids or unidentified plasma constituents have yet to be revealed.

This activity is also required for metastasis. One of the important early events in the development of the metastatic phenotype is the induction of genes involved in angiogenesis such as VEGF and other proteins which are released from tumor cells and affect their microenvironment. Cancer cells produce the excess of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF bFGF basic fibroblast growth factor There are seven members of the VEGF family including VEGF A VEGF B VEGF C VEGF D VEGF E VEGF F and placental growth factor. VEGF act specifically through tyrosine kinase receptors VEGFR 1 VEGFR 2 and VEGFR 3. The key molecule is VEGF A also referred to below as VEGF induces angiogenesis by promoting proliferation sprouting migration and tube formation of endothelial cells. VEGF A is one of the most potent facilitators of angiogenesis in cancers. VEGF binds to VEGFR 1 and activates the signalling through PI3K Akt kinases and thus leads to increase in survival and migration. On the other hand it induces the PLC activity by activation of c src followed by interaction with VEGFR 2. It has been shown that VEGF expression is associated with metastatic capability in cancer. VEGF may induce disease progression by directly affecting the cell cycle components to accelerate cell proliferation. Metastasis is a very complex process which occurs through a series of sequential steps including the invasion of adjacent tissue intravasation transport through the circulatory system arrest and growth in a secondary site.

Clinical studies clearly show that tumor cells can undergo a period of dormancy followed by the rapid growth during the relapse. Homing of cancer cells to specific organs remains largely unknown. In carcinomas the initial step of metastatic dissemination includes the detachment of epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix and disruption of actin cytoskeleton to achieve the round shape. The movement of migrating cells in tissue microenvironments requires proteolytic remodelling of the extracellular matrixes ECM . The matrix metalloproteinases MMPs protein family members play an important role in ECM remodeling and cell invasion. The MMPs are zinc dependent endopeptidases that play multiple roles in biology of ECM such as release of cryptic fragments and neo epitopes from ECM macromolecules release of growth factors and modification of the cell ECM interface. Most MMPs are secreted proteins however six of them are membrane proteins. The major function of MMPs is degradation of structural components of the ECM and directly or indirectly migration of cells. Degradation of extracellular matrix not only promotes migration but also releases the essential growth factors from the matrix storage. Interestingly MMPs contribute to the vessel remodeling by degradation of type I collagen regulation of perivascular cells and VEGF processing. The changes of tissue architecture after release of MMPs are due to cleavage of E cadherins and desmogleins. The expression and interaction of MMPs and TIMPs appear to be involved in invasion and metastases capacity of various cancers.

Several different types of cancer affect the world wide population for example those described hereinafter. Prostate cancer PCa is one of the most prevalent cancers and a leading cause of cancer related death worldwide. Incidence of prostate cancer has significantly increased world wide Jemal A Siegel R Ward E at al. Cancer statistics 2006. CA a cancer journal for clinicians 56 106 130 2006 Yin M Bastacky S Chandran U Becich M J and Dhir R Prevalence of incidental prostate cancer in the general population a study of healthy organ donors The Journal of urology 179 892 895 discussion 895 2008 . Despite recent advances in early diagnosis and treatment PCa remains the second most lethal cancer in men in the Western World Jemal et al. ibid Yin et al. ibid .

Initially the majority of prostate cancers are responsive to androgen ablation therapy but most of the tumors eventually will progress to the androgen refractory state Gronberg H Prostate cancer epidemiology. Lancet 361 859 864 2003 . Once prostate cancer becomes hormone refractory cancer cells may rapidly gain the ability to invade and to metastasize to lymph nodes and distant organs Kalluri R Basement membranes structure assembly and role in tumour angiogenesis. Nature reviews 3 422 433 2003 .

Tumor metastases are the major cause of mortality in cancer patients. Approximately one third of treated patients will relapse and no curative treatment currently exists for metastatic disease Yin et al. ibid Gronberg H ibid Albertsen P C Hanley J A and Fine J 20 year outcomes following conservative management of clinically localized prostate cancer. Jama 293 2095 2101 2005 Society AC Cancer Facts Figures 2008. Atlanta Ga. American Cancer Society 2008 . The progression from hormone dependent to hormone refractory and metastatic prostate cancer is poorly understood. Given the high prevalence of the disease the aging of the population and the lack of effective treatment for cancer metastasis there is an urgent need to discover and develop novel therapeutic approaches.

Primary PCa is treated with hormonal therapy which is aimed to suppress the androgen production and block androgen receptor AR mediated proliferation and survival pathways. In advanced PCa androgen deprivation therapy ADT is the mainstay treatment. Surgical removal of the tumor and the use of hormone agonists or AR antagonists such as flutamide are the major types of ADT DeMarzo A M Nelson W G Isaacs W B and Epstein J I Pathological and molecular aspects of prostate cancer. Lancet 361 955 964 2003 .

Docetaxel that targets the mitotic spindle and cell proliferation cycle is being used in advanced PCas. However as a single agent Docetaxel has modest activity. Current treatment of advanced metastatic cancer benefits from antiangiogenic drugs. Avastin a VEGF inhibitor targets angiogenic pathways for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and has been tested in clinical trials Di Lorenzo G Figg W D Fossa S D et al Combination of Bevacizumab and Docetaxel in Docetaxel Pre treated Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer A Phase 2 Study. European Urology 54 1089 1096 2008 . When Avastin was used as a single agent or in combination with Docetaxel the response rate was greatly improved. However the side effects induced by Docetaxel and Avastin may be severe as the individual drug s toxicities are now combined to cause multiple adverse effects in particular myelosuppression and heart failure Friberg L E Henningsson A Maas H Nguyen L and Karlsson M O Model of chemotherapy induced myelosuppression with parameter consistency across drugs. J Clin Oncol 20 4713 4721 2002 . In addition the costs of these drugs are expensive.

Development of alternative treatments with minimal adverse effect and lower cost will therefore have great clinical and economical benefits.

The effective drug candidate for treatment of metastatic cancer should have the properties to target multiple cancer cell pathways including cell proliferation pathways apoptosis pathways and angiogenesis signalling. High bioavailability for treatment of aggressive forms of cancer is also important.

When there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of four of carbon atoms such groups may also be part cyclic. Such alkyl groups may also be saturated or when there is a sufficient number i.e. a minimum of two of carbon atoms be unsaturated forming for example a Calkenyl or a Calkynyl group . Unless otherwise specified Calkylene groups as defined herein refers to CH or CH CH i.e. linear non branched alkylene .

For the avoidance of doubt when a term such as Rto R is employed herein this will be understood by the skilled person to mean R R R R R R although Ris preferably not present i.e. it represents hydrogen R R R R R R R R Rand Rinclusively.

The present invention also embraces isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention which are identical to those recited herein but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature or the most abundant one found in nature .

Preferred rings that X Y Rand R when the latter two represent a Calkylene group linking X and Y may represent include 

Compounds of the invention may be made in accordance with techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art for example as described hereinafter.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of formula I which process comprises 

 I for compounds of formula I in which Rand Rare linked together reaction of a compound of formula I in which Rand Rboth represent hydrogen or a protected derivative thereof with a compound of formula II L R L II wherein Land Lindependently represent suitable leaving groups such as a sulfonate group e.g. OS O CF OS O CH OS O PhMe or a nonaflate chloro bromo or preferably iodo and Rrepresents Calkylene as hereinbefore defined in respect of the linkage of Rand R under standard reaction conditions for example in the presence of a suitable base such as NaH NaOH NaCO KCO KPO CsCO an alkoxide base such as t BuONa or t BuOK or the like or an amine base such as EtN pyridine tributylamine trimethylamine dimethylaminopyridine diisopropylamine and diisopropylethylamine or the like or mixtures of bases and an appropriate solvent such as toluene dichloromethane acetonitrile or a polar aprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran dioxane diethyl ether dimethylsulfoxide or dimethylformamide or mixtures thereof. Preferred base includes CsCOand preferred solvents include dimethylformamide. Such a reaction may take place at room temperature but is preferably at elevated temperature e.g. above 100 C. such as at about 150 C. ii compounds of formula I or protected derivatives thereof may also be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula III 

Equally the skilled person will appreciate that starting from a racemic form of a compound of formula III will enable the preparation of any of the diastereoisomers and or enantiomers of the compound of formula I e.g. by separation of diastereoisomers e.g. by chromatography such as HPLC and by separation of enantiomers e.g. by resolution 

Compounds mentioned herein e.g. those of formulae II IV VA VI and VII as well as certain other compounds of formula III are either commercially available are known in the literature or may be obtained either by analogy with the processes described herein or by conventional synthetic procedures in accordance with standard techniques from available starting materials using appropriate reagents and reaction conditions. In this respect the skilled person may refer to inter alia by B. M. Trost and I. Fleming Pergamon Press 1991.

The substituents R R R R R R R R R R R R R X and Y in final compounds of the invention or relevant intermediates may be modified one or more times after or during the processes described above by way of methods that are well known to those skilled in the art. Examples of such methods include substitutions reductions oxidations alkylations acylations hydrolyses esterifications etherifications halogenations or nitrations. Such reactions may result in the formation of a symmetric or asymmetric final compound of the invention or intermediate. The precursor groups can be changed to a different such group or to the groups defined in formula I at any time during the reaction sequence. In this respect the skilled person may also refer to by A. R. Katritzky O. Meth Cohn and C. W. Rees Pergamon Press 1995.

Compounds of the invention may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional techniques e.g. recrystallisations .

It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the processes described above and hereinafter the functional groups of intermediate compounds may need to be protected by protecting groups.

For instance amino groups may be protected with a Boc group by reaction in the presence of base e.g. NaOH or an amine base such as triethylamine dimethylaminopyridine or the like with BocO and a suitable solvent e.g. water or a polar aprotic solvent such as dioxane tetrahydrofuran diethyl ether or mixtures thereof . Standard deprotection reaction conditions include deprotection in the presence of acid e.g. in the presence of HCl in a solvent such as a polar aprotic solvent .

The protection and deprotection of functional groups may take place before or after a reaction in the above mentioned schemes.

Protecting groups may be removed in accordance with techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art and as described hereinafter. For example protected compounds intermediates described herein may be converted chemically to unprotected compounds using standard deprotection techniques. By protecting group we also include suitable alternative groups that are precursors to the actual group that it is desired to protect. For example instead of a standard amino protecting group a nitro or azido group may be employed to effectively serve as an amino protecting group which groups may be later converted having served the purpose of acting as a protecting group to the amino group for example under standard reduction conditions described herein. Protecting groups that may be mentioned include lactone protecting groups or derivatives thereof which may serve to protect both a hydroxy group and an carboxy group i.e. such that the cyclic moiety is formed between the two functional groups.

The type of chemistry involved will dictate the need and type of protecting groups as well as the sequence for accomplishing the synthesis.

The use of protecting groups is fully described in 3edition T. W. Greene P. G. M. Wutz Wiley Interscience 1999 .

In yet a further embodiment of the invention there is provided a synthetic form of a compound of the invention i.e. a compound of formula I or salt thereof which is characterised by virtue of the fact that it is made synthetically for example in accordance with the processes described herein. Such compounds are also referred to herein as compounds of the invention .

Compounds of the invention are indicated as pharmaceuticals. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention as hereinbefore but without any provisos where applicable for use as a pharmaceutical. There is also provided a synthetic form of a compound of the invention but without any provisos where applicable for use as a pharmaceutical.

For the avoidance of doubt although compounds of the invention may possess pharmacological activity as such certain pharmaceutically acceptable e.g. protected derivatives of compounds of the invention may exist or be prepared which may not possess such activity but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention. Such compounds which may possess some pharmacological activity provided that such activity is appreciably lower than that of the active compounds to which they are metabolised may therefore be described as prodrugs of compounds of the invention.

By prodrug of a compound of the invention we include compounds that form a compound of the invention in an experimentally detectable amount within a predetermined time e.g. about 1 hour following oral or parenteral administration. All prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention.

Furthermore certain compounds of the invention may possess no or minimal pharmacological activity as such but may be administered parenterally or orally and thereafter be metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention that possess pharmacological activity as such. Such compounds which also includes compounds that may possess some pharmacological activity but that activity is appreciably lower than that of the active compounds of the invention to which they are metabolised may also be described as prodrugs .

Thus the compounds of the invention are useful because they possess pharmacological activity and or are metabolised in the body following oral or parenteral administration to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity.

Compounds of the invention as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso s may be useful in the treatment of a cancer. By cancer we mean any disease that arises from an uncontrolled growth of cells e.g. uncontrolled division invasion e.g. direct growth into adjacent tissue or metastasis. By uncontrolled growth we include an increase in the number and or size of cancer cells also referred to herein as proliferation . By metastasis we mean the movement or migration e.g. invasiveness of cancer cells from a primary tumor site in the body of a subject to one or more other areas within the subject s body where the cells can then form secondary tumors . Thus in one embodiment the invention provides compounds and methods for inhibiting in whole or in part the formation of secondary tumors in a subject with cancer.

Advantageously the compounds of the invention may be capable of inhibiting the proliferation and or metastasis of cancer cells selectively.

By selectively we mean that the compounds of the invention may inhibit the proliferation and or metastasis of cancer cells to a greater extent than it modulates the function e.g. proliferation of non cancer cells. Preferably the compounds of the invention inhibit the proliferation and or metastasis of cancer cells only.

Compounds of the invention may be suitable for use in the treatment of any cancer type including all tumors non solid and solid tumors . The cancer type may include but is not limited to benign tumors such as hemangiomas hepatocellular adenoma cavernous haemangioma focal nodular hyperplasia acoustic neuromas neurofibroma bile duct adenoma bile duct cystanoma fibroma lipomas leiomyomas mesotheliomas teratomas myxomas nodular regenerative hyperplasia trachomas and pyogenic granulomas and malignant tumors such as leukemia myelodysplastic syndromes MDS prostate cancer breast cancer skin cancer bone cancer liver cancer lung cancer brain cancer cancer of the larynx bladder gall bladder ovary cervix pancreas rectum parathyroid thyroid esophagus adrenal neural tissue head and neck colon stomach bronchi kidneys basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma of both ulcerating and papillary type metastatic skin carcinoma osteo sarcoma Ewing s sarcoma veticulum cell sarcoma myeloma giant cell tumor small cell lung tumor non small cell lung tumor gallstones islet cell tumor primary brain tumor acute and chronic lymphocytic and granulocytic tumors hairy cell tumor adenoma hyperplasia medullary carcinoma pheochromocytoma mucosal neuronms intestinal ganglioneuromas hyperplastic corneal nerve tumor marfanoid habitus tumor Wilm s tumor seminoma ovarian tumor leiomyomater tumor cervical dysplasia and in situ carcinoma neuroblastoma retinoblastoma soft tissue sarcoma malignant carcinoid topical skin lesion mycosis fungoide rhabdomyosarcoma Kaposi s sarcoma osteogenic and other sarcoma malignant hypercalcemia renal cell tumor polycythermia vera adenocarcinoma glioblastoma multiforma leukemias lymphomas malignant melanomas epidermoid carcinomas and other carcinomas and sarcomas . Others that may be mentioned include cancers of the testis genitourinary tract glioblastoma neuroblastoma keratoacanthoma epidermoid carcinoma large cell carcinoma follicular carcinoma undifferentiated carcinoma papillary carcinoma seminona myeloid disorders lymphoid disorders hairy cells buccal cavity and pharynx oral lip tongue mouth small intestine colon rectum large intestine rectum brain and central nervous system Hodgkin s and leukaemia hematopoietic tumors of lymphoid lineage including leukemia acute iymphocitic leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia B cell lymphoma T cell lymphoma Hodgkin s lymphoma non Hodgkin s lymphoma hairy cell lymphoma and Burkett s lymphoma hematopoietic tumors of myeloid lineage including acute and chronic myelogenous leukemias myelodysplastic syndrome and promyelocytic leukemia tumors of mesenchymal origin including fibrosarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma tumors of the central and peripheral nervous system including astrocytoma neuroblastoma glioma and schwannomas and other tumors including melanoma seminoma teratocarcinoma osteosarcoma xeroderma pigmentosum keratoxanthoma thyroid follicular cancer and Kaposi s sarcoma.

In particular compounds of the invention may possess potent inhibitory activity on the growth and invasion of hormone refactory and aggressive human prostate tumors for example as may be shown in xenograft mouse models . It is particularly preferred therefore that the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of aggressive cancers such as prostate cancer.

Compounds of the invention may reduce the rate of cell proliferation when tested in an assay using a PC 3 cancer cell line e.g. obtained from ATCC . The compounds may thus possess a beneficial inhibitory effect on the ability of tumors of this type and of cancers generally to survive. The PC 3 cancer cell line has several properties that represent the hormone independent and invasive prostate cancer. For instance PC 3 cells lack functional androgen receptor AR signalling grow rapidly in culture medium and can form large and very aggressive tumors when implanted into nude mice. Hence the biological tests described hereinafter e.g. PC 3 xenograft mouse models provide a sound predication of the utility of the compounds tested by mimicking the gradual dissemination of prostate carcinoma cells in viva

Further it has been reported that even the widely used cancer drugs such as Avastin or Docetaxel alone or in combination had low inhibitory effect on PC 3 cells Petrylak DP Future directions in the treatment of androgen independent prostate cancer.

The compounds of the invention may target multiple cellular pathways that are associated with tumor growth angiogenesis and metastasis. The compounds of the invention may also affect other cancer pathways such as cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.

The compounds of the invention may therefore be VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors e.g. they may inhibit the expression of VEGF receptors including but not limited to VEGF and or VEGF receptor 2 as may be shown in a test described herein . This may occur selectively or may be one of a plurality of the mechanisms by which the compounds of the invention act to treat cancer. The VEGF signalling pathway is known to be linked to tumor vascularisation and invasion and hence compounds of the invention may possess anti cancer effects by inhibiting angiogenesis and may therefore be classed as anti angiogenesis agents . In another embodiment of the invention therefore the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of a disease in which the inhibition of angiogenesis and or VEGF is desired and or required.

The term inhibition may refer to any measurable reduction and or prevention which in the context of angiogenesis refers to the reduction and or prevention of angiogenesis e.g. the expression of VEGF receptors including but not limited to VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 . The inhibitory activity may be measured by comparing the angiogenesis inhibition in a sample containing a compound of the invention and a VEGF receptor a such as VEGF and or VEGF receptor 2 with an equivalent sample of in the absence of a compound of the invention. The measurable change may be objective e.g. measurable by some test or marker for example in an in vitro or in vivo assay or test such as one described hereinafter or otherwise another suitable assay or test known to those skilled in the art or subjective e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect .

Compounds of the invention are indicated both in the therapeutic and or prophylactic treatment of the above mentioned conditions.

According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of treatment of a disease e.g. cancer or another disease as mentioned herein which may be associated with or affected by angiogenesis and or VEGF e.g. an inhibition of the expression of VEGF and or VEGF receptor 2 is desired and or required which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention but without the proviso s as hereinbefore defined to a patient suffering from or susceptible to such a condition.

 Patients include mammalian including human patients. Hence the method of treatment discussed above may include the treatment of a human or animal body.

The term effective amount refers to an amount of a compound which confers a therapeutic effect on the treated patient. The effect may be objective e.g. measurable by some test or marker or subjective e.g. the subject gives an indication of or feels an effect .

Compounds of the invention may be administered orally intravenously subcutaneously buccally rectally dermally nasally tracheally bronchially sublingually by any other parenteral route or via inhalation in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form.

Compounds of the invention may be administered alone but are preferably administered by way of known pharmaceutical formulations including tablets capsules or elixirs for oral administration suppositories for rectal administration sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral or intramuscular administration and the like. The type of pharmaceutical formulation may be selected with due regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Such pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be chemically inert to the active compounds and may have no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use.

Such formulations may be prepared in accordance with standard and or accepted pharmaceutical practice. Otherwise the preparation of suitable formulations may be achieved non inventively by the skilled person using routine techniques and or in accordance with standard and or accepted pharmaceutical practice.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of the invention as hereinbefore defined but without the proviso s in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant diluent and or carrier.

Depending on e.g. potency and physical characteristics of the compound of the invention i.e. active ingredient pharmaceutical formulations that may be mentioned include those in which the active ingredient is present in at least 1 or at least 10 at least 30 or at least 50 by weight.

Depending on the disorder and the patient to be treated as well as the route of administration compounds of the invention may be administered at varying therapeutically effective doses to a patient in need thereof. However the dose administered to a mammal particularly a human in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a therapeutic response in the mammal over a reasonable timeframe. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selection of the exact dose and composition and the most appropriate delivery regimen will also be influenced by inter alia the pharmacological properties of the formulation the nature and severity of the condition being treated and the physical condition and mental acuity of the recipient as well as the potency of the specific compound the age condition body weight sex and response of the patient to be treated and the stage severity of the disease.

Administration may be continuous or intermittent e.g. by bolus injection . The dosage may also be determined by the timing and frequency of administration. In the case of oral or parenteral administration the dosage can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 10 g e.g. 1000 mg per day of a compound of the invention. For example the dose range may be between 1 mg kg and 1000 mg kg e.g. between 10 mg kg and 500 mg kg preferably between about 20 mg kg and 200 mg kg such as the does ranges employed in the mouse models described hereinafter.

In any event the medical practitioner or other skilled person will be able to determine routinely the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient. The above mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case there can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.

Compounds of the invention may have the advantage that they target multiple pathways involving tumor growth apoptosis angiogenesis and metastases. The compounds of the invention may also be effective angiogenesis inhibitors and or VEGF inhibitors i.e. they may for example selectively or as one mode of action inhibit angiogenesis and or VEGF e.g. they may inhibit the expression of VEGF and VEGF receptor 2 .

Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than be less toxic than be longer acting than be more potent than produce fewer side effects than be more easily absorbed than and or have a better pharmacokinetic profile e.g. higher oral bioavailability and or lower clearance than and or have other useful pharmacological physical or chemical properties over compounds known in the prior art whether for use in the above stated indications or otherwise.

For instance compounds of the invention may be well tolerated by the patient i.e. show less or no side effects e.g. weight loss or other toxic side effects for example as compared to other therapeutic agents. This may be the case even at high concentrations doses of the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention may also display good potency e.g. better potency than other therapeutic agents at a relatively or comparatively lower dose. Hence the compound of the invention may have a large therapeutic window.

The compounds of the invention may have advantages over other known chemotherapeutic agents e.g. Avastin Docetaxel and or Etoposide which includes better potency and better safety profile i.e. reduced side effects . Such comparative advantages may be shown in biological tests such as those described hereinafter.

PC 3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection Manassas V A and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 Fetal Bovine Serum. PC 3 cells at 1 10 per mouse were used. The mice were divided into three groups 6 mice per group . The first group allowed tumors to grow between 170 400 mmin size before starting the treatment. The second group allowed tumors to grow between 550 650 mmin size before starting the treatment. The third group allowed tumors to grow between 700 800 mmin size before starting the treatment. The tumor diameters were measured twice weekly using calipers. The tumor volumes were calculated using an equation of a b2 2 where a and b represent the length and width of the tumor respectively.

The treatment of the compound of Example 1 also referred to herein as Substance X or PBS containing 5 DMSO vehicle as Control was started when tumors reached the desired size as described above. In the first experimental setting Substance X was administered intravenously once every other day. In the second experimental setting Substance X was administrated orally once every other day. Tumor growth was assessed periodically as described in Results. The mice were sacrificed after treatment by euthanization via isofluorene inhalation. Lymph node liver lung spleen and femurs were removed from each mouse. Half of the tumor tissues were used for histology and immunohistochemical analysis. For histology analysis tissues were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained with hematoxylineosin H E or imunohistochemical stained with antibodies and analyzed under an optical microscope. The other half of the tissues were used for protein analysis and thus were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen. The body weights of the mice on the first and last day of the treatment were collected and compared. Tumor invasion and metastasis were examined in various tissues from the sacrificed mice.

For a comparison study mice with tumors at 190 250 mmin size were treated with the cytotoxic drug Etoposide Sigma at a dose of 20 mg kg via IV injection once every other day. The tumor size was measured as described in the Results. Three mice were treated with Etoposide or the vehicle as Control. The mice were sacrificed and the tissues were collected as described above.

For the assessment of toxicity of Substance X healthy mice were treated with Substance X by intravenous injection at a dose of 100 mg kg or 200 mg kg once every other day for 13 days. Body weight of each mouse was measured periodically from Day 1 to Day 13 of the treatment. Cage side observations including mortality moribundity food consumption and activities were performed once every other day. Blood samples were taken on Day 1 and Day 13 for measurement of blood cell counts. To assess toxicity of Substance X on mice with tumors mice bearing subcutaneous PC 3 tumors were treated with Substance X at a high dose of 200 mg kg once every other day for 19 days. Body weight was measured and cage side observations were performed once every other day. Lymph node liver lung spleen and femurs were removed from each mouse and were examined. Toxicity of Substance X was also assessed in tumor bearing mice treated with 80 mg kg of Substance X daily as described above.

Immunohistochemistry on tumor tissues was performed as previously described Wegiel B Bjartell A Ekberg J Gadaleanu V Brunhoff C and Persson J L A role for cyan AI in mediating the autocrine expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in prostate cancer. Oncogene 24 6385 6393 2005 by using antibodies to human CD 31 Dako Goistrup Denmark A S . Antirabbit peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies were applied. Diaminobenzidine colorimetric reagent solution Dako was used. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin Sigma St. Louis Mo. . The specimens were viewed with an Olympus BX5I microscope at a magnification of 20 or 40 . For analysis of tumor angiogenesis tumor sections stained with antibody against CD3I were examined and quantified. Regions of high vascular density within the tumors were examined. The number of CD31 positive pixels per microscopic field was recorded. At least two sections per tumor and three views per section were determined.

Basic safety study of Substance X was first performed on healthy mice without tumors to test if a high dose of 100 mg kg at once every other day regimen was safe. As shown in A there was no significant change in body weight throughout the 13 day treatment period with high dose of Substance X. The cage side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and daily activities or any observable toxic effect for 13 days. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected data not shown . These basic toxicity tests showed that Substance X is safe at a high dose in healthy mice.

The mice were treated with 200 mg kg of Substance X once every other day for a long period of time of 13 days. As shown in B the body weights of the tumor bearing mice were steady throughout the study period. The cage side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and daily activities or any observable toxic effect. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected data not shown .

We then tested the high dose of Substance X in PC 3 xenograft mice thereby mimicking its effect on prostate cancer patients. We generated mouse xenograft of human PC 3 tumors by subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells into nude mice. We further tested safety of the dose of 40 mg kg which generated significant anti tumor activity in the xenograft mouse model. The daily treatment of tumor bearing mice with this dose may suggest the safety of Substance X for cancer treatment. The body weights of tumor bearing mice treated with Substance X daily for 30 days remained constant throughout the period of treatment data not shown . The cage side observations showed no abnormality on food consumption and or daily activities or any other observable toxic effect. Analysis of livers and kidney was conducted and no abnormality in histology in these organs could be detected data not shown .

We created a prostate cancer xenograft mouse model to study the effect of Substance X on tumor growth and metastasis in viva Metastatic prostate cancer PC 3 cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse to create a xenograft mouse model. When the tumors were grown to 190 240 mmin size the mice were treated intravenously with Substance X at 20 mg kg or the vehicle as Control for 21 days. The tumors in the Control group treated with vehicle alone grew to exponentially large size after 21 days while tumor shrank in the mice treated with Substance X. This suggests a significant inhibitory effect of Substance X on tumor growth in xenograft mice in viva

Next we assessed the effect of Substance X on tumor growth and invasion in mice bearing larger tumors. We have previously found that PC 3 tumors grown into 400 mmin size could become metastatic and the tumor cells would invade into lymph node liver or lung. To test if Substance X is able to control aggressive tumor growth we allowed the tumor transplants to grow approximately 500 600 mmin size and then started to treat the mice with 40 mg kg Substance X or the solvent as Control by intravenous injection. While the large tumors in the Control group continued to grow rapidly the tumors in the Substance X treated mice did not grow but showed a slight decrease in size on day 20 .

We then tested the effect of Substance X on the large and invasive tumors for longer period of time. We divided the mice into two groups one group was treated with 40 mg kg Substance X by intravenous injection for 30 days while the other group was treated with Substance X by the same treatment regimen for 20 days. On day 21 the group 2 mice were treated with 40 mg kg Substance X by oral administration. The result showed that the tumor growth in Substance X treated mice was inhibited throughout the treatment period and the tumors shrank significantly at the end of the treatment. In contrast the tumors in the Control group grew exponentially and became metastasized. In the second treatment group the mice treated with Substance X by oral administration had slightly larger tumor size than the mice treated by continuous intravenous injection suggesting that Substance X is orally bioavailable yet the oral bioavailability is lower than intravenous injection. We performed histology and immunohistochemical analysis and no infiltration of tumor cells into secondary sites could be detected in any of these mice at the end of the study. In contrast tumors in the Control mice were found to have metastasized into lymph nodes data not shown .

We also treated the mice by oral administration of Substance X throughout the treatment period. As shown in Substance X given to the mice via oral administration was able to inhibit the tumor growth although the effect was not as strong as intravenous injection.

To compare the effect of Substance X with a cytotoxic drug widely used to treat invasive tumors we tested the effect of Etoposide at 20 mg kg by intravenous injection IV on PC 3 mice bearing tumors grown to approximately 250 mmin size. As shown in the tumors in the Control group grew to exponentially large size after 14 days. In contrast tumors in the Etoposide treatment group grew slowly. More importantly Substance X showed stronger inhibitory effect on tumors as compared to Etoposide.

We examined the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 the important angiogenic factors that can promote tumor vasculatures and are required for tumor invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on tumors dissected from Control mice or mice treated with Substance X. As compared to the Control the expression of VEGF and VEGFR2 was significantly down regulated in tumors treated with Substance X . This suggests that Substance X may be a VEGF inhibitor that targets VEGF signalling pathways.

We also characterized tumor histology by VEGF receptor 2 staining in mice treated with vehicle or Substance X. Side by side comparison of the sections containing the whole tumors from Control mice and Substance X treated mice clearly revealed differences in tumor size and morphology between the two groups . The size of the tumors from mice treated with Substance X appeared to be smaller than that from the Control mice. Interestingly there were large empty areas in tumors treated with Substance X suggesting an ongoing tumor reduction may be associated with the clearance of dead tumor cells. These results further confirmed that Substance X is capable of inhibiting growth in large and invasive tumors.

We then measured the expression of CD31 a protein expressed in tumor vasculatures and important for tumor invasion in tumors treated with Substance X by immunohistochemical analysis . We determined the extent of tumor vascularisation by quantifying CD31 expression and CD31 positive vessels in the tumors including the edge and the centre areas of the tumors. There was a statistically significant decrease in CD31 expression and the number of CD31 expressing vessels in tumors treated with Substance X as compared with that of the Control tumors . This result suggests that Substance X may inhibit tumor growth and invasion by preventing the vascularisation of aggressive PC 3 tumors.
