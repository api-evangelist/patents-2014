This application is continuation application pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 823 398 filed on Jun. 25 2010.

The United States Government has certain rights in this disclosure pursuant to contract number NNC08CA92C between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and United Technologies Corporation.

This invention relates generally to gas turbine engines and more particularly to a fuel injector and air swirler assembly that improves mixing of gaseous fuel and air a combustor embodying a plurality of radially and axially staged swirler assemblies.

Gas turbine engines such as those used to power modern commercial aircraft include a compressor for pressurizing a supply of air a combustor for burning a hydrocarbon fuel in the presence of the pressurized air and a turbine for extracting energy from the resultant combustion gases. In aircraft engine applications the compressor combustor and turbine are disposed about a central engine axis with the compressor disposed axially upstream of the combustor and the turbine disposed axially downstream of the combustor.

Combustion of the hydrocarbon fuel in air in gas turbine engines inevitably produces emissions such as oxides of nitrogen NOx carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons which are delivered into the atmosphere in the exhaust gases from the gas turbine engine. It is generally accepted that oxides of nitrogen are produced at high flame temperatures. One approach to lower NOx emissions is to lower flame temperature by operating the combustor under fuel lean conditions. However during operation of the combustor under fuel lean conditions combustion instability and flame out may occur if the fuel and air mixture becomes too fuel lean. Additionally during operation of the combustor under fuel lean conditions the lower flame temperatures could result in incomplete combustion and a consequent increase in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons emissions.

Another approach to lower the emissions of oxides of nitrogen carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons from a gas turbine engine is through staged combustion. In one arrangement for implementing staged combustion in a gas turbine engine is to provide a plurality of fuel injection nozzles and associated air swirler assemblies of which only a selected portion are operated at engine idle and under low power demands and all of which are operated at engine cruise and under high power demands.

In general it is desirable to rapidly mix the fuel and the air in an attempt to provide uniform fuel lean conditions and eliminate as many local pockets of combustion under near stoichiometric fuel air conditions to avoid pockets of high flame temperature conducive to NOx formation or of combustion under fuel rich conditions to avoid carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon resulting from incomplete combustion. Various designs of swirler assemblies have been developed for use in association fuel injection nozzles in an attempt to provide rapid fuel and air mixing. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5 966 937 discloses a fuel injector and a two pass air swirler disposed about the fuel injector the air swirler having an inner swirled air passage and an outer swirled air passage. The fuel is injected through the end of the fuel injector into the swirling airflow generated by the inner air swirler. U.S. Pat. No. 5 603 211 discloses a fuel injector and a three pass air disposed about the fuel injector the air swirler having an inner swirled air passage an intermediate swirled air passage and an outer swirled air passage. Again the fuel is injected through the end of the fuel injector into the swirling airflow generated by the inner air swirler.

There is a desire for an efficient low emission and stable combustor for use in gas turbine engines for powering supersonic cruise vehicles. It is contemplated that combustors in gas turbine engines for powering supersonic cruise vehicles will operate with pre vaporized that is gaseous jet fuel. While the aforementioned air swirlers have performed well in mixing liquid jet fuel and air in conventional gas turbine engines on commercial subsonic aircraft there is a desire for an air swirler assembly that provides rapid and efficient mixing of gaseous jet fuel with air.

In an aspect a swirler assembly is provided for a combustor having a fuel injector extending along a central longitudinal axis. The swirler assembly includes a body having a central opening for receiving the fuel injector and defining a unitary fuel and air mixing chamber having an open downstream end and extending about the downstream of a tip end of said fuel injector. The swirler body also defines a first inner air passage opening into an upstream end of the mixing chamber and disposed coaxially about the fuel injector and a second inner air passage opening into the upstream end of the mixing chamber downstream of the first inner air passage. The body also defines an outer air passage opening externally of the mixing chamber and disposed coaxially about the downstream open end of the mixing chamber. An air flow passing through the second inner air passage has a swirl imparted thereto that is counter directional to a swirl imparted to an air flow passing through the first inner air passage. In an embodiment the swirler body further includes a plurality of fuel injection ports extending through the swirler body at circumferentially spaced intervals and opening into the upstream end of the mixing chamber. In an embodiment an air flow passing through the outer air passage has a swirl imparted thereto that is co directional to a swirl imparted to an air flow passing through the first inner air passage.

In an aspect a fuel and air admission assembly is provided for a combustor. The fuel and air admission assembly includes a fuel injector extending along a central longitudinal axis and a swirler assembly having a body mounted on the fuel injector and defining a fuel and air mixing chamber having an open downstream end and extending about and downstream of a tip end of the fuel injector. The fuel injector includes a plurality of inner fuel ports opening into the mixing chamber and the swirler body has a plurality of outer fuel injection ports extending through the swirler body to open into the mixing chamber. A first portion of the fuel may be injected into an upstream region of the mixing chamber through the plurality of inner fuel ports and a second portion of fuel may be injected generally inwardly into the upstream end of the mixing chamber through the plurality of outer fuel ports. The swirler assembly may further include a first inner air passage opening into an upstream end of the mixing chamber and disposed coaxially about the fuel injector a second inner air passage opening into the upstream end of the mixing chamber and an outer air passage opening externally of the mixing chamber. An air flow passing through the second inner air passage has a swirl imparted thereto that is counter directional to a swirl imparted to an air flow passing through the first inner air passage and an air flow passing through the outer air passage has a swirl imparted thereto that is co directional to the swirl imparted to an air flow passing through the first inner air passage.

In an aspect a radially and axially staged combustor is provided. The combustor includes a circumferentially extending inner liner a circumferentially extending outer liner spaced radially outward from and circumscribing the inner liner and a radially and axially stepped annular bulkhead extending between an upstream end of the inner liner and an upstream end of the outer liner. The stepped bulkhead has a radially inwardmost first bulkhead segment a radially intermediate second bulkhead segment disposed axially downstream of the first bulkhead segment and a radially outermost third bulkhead segment disposed axially downstream of the second bulkhead segment. A plurality of first fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in the first bulkhead segment. A plurality of second fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in the second bulkhead segment. A plurality of third fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in the third bulkhead segment.

In an embodiment of the combustor the plurality of first fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the first bulkhead segment at equal circumferentially spaced intervals the plurality of second fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the second bulkhead segment in paired sets the paired sets disposed at equal circumferentially spaced intervals and the plurality of third fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the third bulkhead segment in paired sets the paired sets disposed at equal circumferentially spaced intervals. In an embodiment a first of each paired set of the second fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing counter clockwise swirl and a second of each paired set of the second fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing clockwise swirl. Similarly a first of each paired set of the third fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing counter clockwise swirl and a second of each paired set of the third fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing clockwise swirl.

Referring initially to an air swirler in accord with the disclosure is depicted in a first exemplary embodiment in in a second exemplary embodiment in and in a third exemplary embodiment in . In the first embodiment of the air swirler is shown in assembly with a fuel injector . In the second embodiment of the air swirler is shown in assembly with a fuel injector . Throughout the drawings like items are referred to with a common reference numeral. Additionally with reference to the drawings the terms forward and upstream refer to the generally leftward and the terms aft and downstream refer to the generally rightward direction of the viewer.

The air swirler has a body having a forward member commonly referred to as a bearing plate a central member and an aft member . The forward member includes a forward surface and an aft surface the aft surface including a generally concave curved surface section . The central member includes a forward surface including a generally convex curved surface section an interior surface and generally conical aft interior surface converging to an aft rim . The aft member includes a generally conical interior surface that faces in spaced relationship the aft exterior surface of the central member and converges to an aft rim that circumscribes in spaced relationship the aft rim of the central member . The interior surface of the central member is depicted in as a conical surface converging uniformly with the aft interior surface and is depicted in as a cylindrical surface forward of the conical aft interior surface . However the interior surface of the central member is not limited to the depicted configurations.

The forward member also has a central opening extending axially therethrough along a longitudinal axis. The central opening is sized to receive and closely accommodate a fuel injector. The body also defines a unitary fuel and air mixing chamber also referred to as a mixing cup coaxially about the same longitudinal axis and that is circumscribed by the interior surface and the aft interior surface of the central member . The mixing chamber has an open annular inlet end extending generally between the aft rim of the forward member and the forward end of the interior surface of the central member and an open outlet end circumscribed by an aft rim of central member . When the air swirler is embodied in the fuel and air admission assemblies as illustrated in respectively the mixing chamber extends about and downstream of a distal end of the fuel injector .

The aft surface of the forward member extends from a perimeter rim at the exterior surface of the body radially inward transitionally into the generally concave curved surface section and terminating at the aft rim . The forward surface of the central member extends radially inward from a perimeter rim at the exterior surface of the body transitioning into the generally convex curved surface section and extending to the forward end of the interior surface . The aft surface of the forward member and the forward surface of the central member generally cooperate to define an interior passage that opens into an upstream end of the mixing chamber through the annular inlet end of the mixing chamber extending generally between the aft rim of the forward member and the forward end of the interior surface of the central member .

Referring now in particular to plurality of first air inlets disposed at circumferentially intervals about the circumference of the exterior surface of the body along the aft perimeter rim of the forward member open into the interior passage . Additionally a plurality of second air inlets disposed at circumferentially intervals about the circumference of the exterior surface of the body along the forward perimeter rim of the central member open into the interior passage . A first supply of air also referred to herein as primary air is admitted to the swirler through the plurality of first air inlets to flow along the aft surface of the forward member . A second supply of air also referred to herein as secondary air is admitted to the swirler through the plurality of second air inlets to flow along the forward surface of the central member . Therefore in the first and second exemplary embodiments of the air swirler the interior passage embodies both a first inner air passage and a second inner air passage the second inner air passage being disposed about the first inner air passage .

A circumferential array of swirl vanes and are disposed in the inlet portions respectively of each of the first inner air passage and the second inner air passage . The circumferential array of swirl vanes impart a swirl to the primary air admitted through the plurality of first air inlets and flowing along the first inner air passage . The circumferential array of swirl vanes impart a swirl to the secondary air admitted through the plurality of second air inlets and flowing along the second inner air passage . The circumferential array of swirl vanes are twisted or otherwise constructed to impart a swirl to the primary air in a first rotational direction while the circumferential array of vanes are twisted or otherwise constructed to impart a swirl to the secondary air in a second rotational direction counter to the first rotational direction as illustrated in .

In this manner the secondary air flowing along the second inner air passage flows through the interior pass about the primary air flowing along the first inner air passage in counter rotation to the primary air. Thus if the primary air flowing through the interior pass is swirled to rotate in a clockwise direction the secondary air flowing through the interior pass is swirled to rotate in a counter clockwise direction. However if the primary air flowing through the interior pass is swirled to rotate in a counter clockwise direction then the secondary air flowing through the interior pass is swirled to rotate in a clockwise direction.

Additionally an outer air passage is formed in the body between the aft exterior surface of the central member and the facing interior surface of the aft member . A plurality of third air inlets disposed at circumferentially intervals about the circumference of the exterior surface of the body along the forward perimeter rim of the aft member open into the outer air passage . A circumferential array of swirl vanes is disposed in the inlet portion of the exterior air passage . The circumferential array of swirl vanes impart a swirl to a flow of tertiary air admitted through the plurality of third air inlets and flowing through the outer air passage . The tertiary air exits the outer air passage through the annular gap formed between the aft rim of the central member and the aft rim of aft member that circumscribes in spaced relationship the aft rim in a swirling flow about the fuel and air passing mixture flowing through the outlet of the mixing chamber . The circumferential array of vanes are twisted or otherwise constructed to impart a swirl to the tertiary air that is co directional in rotation with the primary air.

Referring now to in particular the first embodiment of the swirler is shown mounted to the fuel injector in the fuel and air admission assembly . The fuel injector has a distal end outlet through which a spray of fuel for example a gaseous fuel such as pre vaporized Jet A fuel is injected outwardly into the mixing chamber in a radially and axially diverging cone. The swirler and fuel injector are centrally disposed about a common longitudinal axis not shown . The fuel sprayed into the mixing chamber first encounters and mixes with the primary air flow passing along the first inner air passage . As the fuel is propelled further outwardly partially under its own momentum and partly due to centrifuge like effect of the swirling primary air the fuel and primary air encounters the counter swirling secondary air flow passing along the second inner air passage . The counter swirling secondary air decreases the radial momentum of the fuel and mixes with the fuel and primary air flow. In this manner the fuel is more rapidly and more uniformly mixed than with conventional prior art fuel and air admission assemblies wherein the fuel is introduced into a mixing chamber with air rotating in only one general direction.

To the extent heretofore described the described elements of the swirler are common to both the first embodiment of the swirler depicted in and the second embodiment of the swirler depicted in . However referring now to in particular the second embodiment of the swirler as depicted therein includes a plurality of fuel ports provided in the swirler body . The plurality of fuel ports are disposed at circumferentially spaced intervals about the circumference of the central member near the forward end thereof. Each fuel port opens at its inboard through an orifice that opens on the interior surface of the central member to the mixing chamber . Each fuel port and corresponding orifice may be aligned along a radial axis whereby the fuel injected into the mixing chamber is injected along an axis normal to the interior surface .

Referring now to in particular the second embodiment of the swirler is shown mounted to the fuel injector in the fuel and air admission assembly . The swirler and fuel injector are centrally disposed about a common longitudinal axis not shown . The fuel injector has a distal end nose cone that extends from the aft rim of the forward member into the mixing chamber . The exterior surface of the nose cone provides an aerodynamic surface along which the swirling primary air flows upon entering the mixing chamber from the first inner air passage . A plurality of fuel orifices is provided in the nose cone at circumferentially spaced intervals about the circumference of the aft portion of the nose cone . Each fuel orifice provides a path through which fuel for example a gaseous fuel such as pre vaporized Jet A fuel is injected outwardly into an upstream region of the mixing chamber . Each orifice may be aligned along an axis normal to the exterior surface of the nose cone whereby the fuel injected into the mixing chamber is injected along an axis normal to the exterior surface of the nose cone .

In the fuel and air admission assembly only a first portion of the fuel is admitted into the mixing chamber through the fuel injector by way of the orifices . A second portion of the fuel is admitted into the mixing chamber through the orifices associated with the plurality of fuel ports in the body of the swirler . As depicted in when the swirler is assembled on the fuel injector the orifices are position in relative axial alignment with the orifices in the fuel injector . Thus fuel is introduced into the upstream region of the mixing chamber simultaneously through both the orifices in the swirler and the orifices with the fuel introduced through the orifices being injected into the swirling primary air flow passing into the mixing chamber from the first inner air passage and the fuel introduced through the orifices being injected into the counter swirling secondary air flow passing into the mixing chamber from the second inner air passage .

The injection of fuel not only into the swirling primary air flow through a set of inner fuel injection holes formed by the plurality of orifices in the fuel injector but also simultaneously into the counter swirling secondary air flow in the upstream region of the mixing chamber through a set of outer fuel injection ports formed by the plurality of orifices in the body of the air swirler provides for a more distributed initial mixing of the fuel and air which leads to a higher mixing rate and resultant more uniform distribution of the fuel within the air within the mixing chamber when the counter rotating flows of mixed fuel and primary and mixed fuel and secondary turbulently interact at the interface therebetween as the flows pass aftward through the mixing chamber .

Additionally adjustment of the distribution of both fuel to be admitted between the inner orifices and the outer orifices as well as adjustment of the distribution of air to be admitted between the primary air and the secondary air flows to the mixing chamber provide the ability to optimize the relative distribution to achieve the fast mixing rate and the most uniform fuel lean distribution while maintaining a reasonable margin to avoid auto ignition issues. For example the air admitted into the upstream end of the mixing chamber may be split between the primary air flow and the secondary air flow in a ratio ranging from 9 parts primary air to 1 part secondary air to 1 part primary air to 9 parts secondary air. As the amount of secondary air flow to the primary air flow increases the shear interface between the primary and secondary air flows migrates radially outward within the interior passage . At high primary to secondary air flow ratios the shear interface will lie nearer to the radially inboard side of the interior passage . Conversely at low primary to secondary air flow ratios the shear interface will lie nearer to the radially outward side of the interior air passage .

Referring now in particular to there is depicted another embodiment of the sir swirler . In this embodiment the flow of secondary air is admitted into the mixing chamber through a plurality of second air inlets spaced axially downstream of the plurality first air inlets rather than being disposed axially adjacent to the plurality of first air inlets as in the embodiment depicted in . In the embodiment depicted in the plurality of second air inlets comprises a ring of circumferentially spaced air admission ports opening through the central member of the swirler body in a central axial span of the central member . Each of the second air inlets is oriented such that the secondary air passing therethrough is admitted into the mixing chamber in counter rotation as illustrated in to the flow of the primary air admitted through the plurality of first air inlets and passing through the mixing chamber in a rotating flow. Thus a high turbulence mixing zone is created at the shear interface between the counter rotating flows of primary air and secondary air in the mixing chamber downstream of the introduction of the secondary air through the plurality of second air inlets . The high turbulence at the shear interface enhances mixing of the fuel entrained in the primary air flow with the secondary air flow introduced into the central axial span of the mixing chamber .

The embodiments of the air swirler depicted in and the fuel and air admission assemblies and are well suited for use in connection with combustors for gas turbine engines such as for example aircraft engines. The fuel and air admission assembly is particularly well suited for use in connection with gas turbine engines for powering aircraft having supersonic cruise capability. The air swirler and the fuel and air admission assemblies and are also well suited for use in connection with gas turbine engine combustors such as low emission combustors. The embodiment of the air swirler depicted in is well suited for use in connection with gas turbine combustors burning gaseous fuel such as pre vaporized Jet A fuel. The embodiment of the air swirler depicted in is well suited for use in connection with gas turbine combustors burning liquid fuel such as Jet A fuel.

Referring now to there is depicted an exemplary embodiment of a fuel staging combustor for a gas turbine engine. The combustor includes a circumferentially extending inner liner a circumferentially extending outer liner spaced radially outward from and circumscribing the inner liner and a radially and axially stepped annular bulkhead extending between a foreward end of the inner liner and a foreward end of the outer liner thereby defining an annular combustion chamber . The inner liner and the outer liner may be of conventional materials and conventional construction for example single walled or double walled the particulars of the inner and outer liners not being germane to the invention.

The stepped bulkhead has a radially inwardmost first bulkhead segment a radially intermediate second bulkhead segment disposed axially downstream of the first bulkhead segment and a radially outermost third bulkhead segment disposed axially downstream of the second bulkhead segment . A plurality of first fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in a circumferential array in the first bulkhead segment . A plurality of second fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in a circumferential array in the second bulkhead segment . A plurality of third fuel and air admission assemblies are disposed in a circumferential array in the third bulkhead segment . In an embodiment each of the fuel and air admission assemblies may comprise an embodiment of the fuel and air admission assembly or an embodiment of the fuel and air admission assembly and may utilize an embodiment of the air swirler .

Thus in the combustor combustion within the combustion chamber is staged both radially and axially. A first portion of fuel and a first portion of air may admitted through the plurality of first fuel and air admission assemblies a second portion of fuel and a second portion of air may admitted through the plurality of second fuel and air admission assemblies and a third portion of fuel and a third portion of air may admitted through the plurality of third fuel and air admission assemblies . The relative distribution of the fuel and of the air may be selectively adjusted amongst the three sets of fuel and air admission assemblies to control the overall fuel air ratio of each the sets of fuel and air admission assemblies. For example the distribution of fuel or of air or of both fuel and air may be selectively adjusted to ensure that all three sets of fuel and air admission assemblies operate at a fuel lean fuel air ratio during engine operation at cruise for low NOx emission production and readjusted during engine operation at idle or low power to ensure that one set of the fuel and air admission assemblies for example the radially innermost set are operated at a near stoichiometric fuel air ratio or a slightly fuel rich fuel air ratio to ensure flame and ignition stability.

In an embodiment of the radially and axially staged combustor as depicted in the plurality of first fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the first bulkhead segment in a circumferential array and spaced apart at equally circumferentially spaced intervals the plurality of second fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the second bulkhead segment in paired sets A B with the paired sets disposed in a circumferential array and spaced apart at equal circumferentially spaced intervals and the plurality of third fuel and air admission assemblies are arranged in the third bulkhead segment in paired sets A B with the paired sets disposed in a circumferential array and spaced apart at equal circumferentially spaced intervals.

In the depicted embodiment a first A of each paired set of the second fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing counter clockwise swirl into the combustion chamber and a second B of each paired set of the second fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing clockwise swirl into the combustion chamber . Similarly a first A of each paired set of the third fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing counter clockwise swirl into the combustion chamber and a second B of each paired set of the third fuel and air admission assemblies admits a mixed flow of fuel and air with a prevailing clockwise swirl into the combustion chamber. In this embodiment the bulkhead includes a plurality of sectors of equal circumferential arc extent. Each sector includes a single first fuel and air admission assembly disposed in the first bulkhead segment a single paired set of second fuel and air admission assemblies disposed in the second bulkhead segment and a single paired set of third fuel and air admission assemblies in the third bulkhead segment . Although only three sectors are illustrated in it is to be understood that the plurality of sectors extend circumferentially around the entire circumferential extent of the stepped bulkhead . Those skilled in the art will understand that the actual number of sectors with five fuel and air admission assemblies arranged in each sector as hereinbefore described may vary with combustor application and gas turbine engine requirements.
