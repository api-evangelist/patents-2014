No. 8 720 892 issued May 13 2014 which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 101 717 filed May 5 2011 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 469 360 issued Jun. 25 2013 which in turn is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 384 732 filed Apr. 7 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 988 152 issued Aug. 2 2011. The entire disclosures of each of the foregoing applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein.

The technical field of this invention is shuffling machines for shuffling playing cards used in gaming.

Shuffling machines or shufflers are widely used in casinos card rooms and many other venues at which card games are played. Conventional shufflers are typically adapted to receive one or more decks of standard playing cards to be shuffled. The intended purpose of most shufflers is to shuffle the playing cards into what is believed to be a random order. Such a random order of the playing cards is desirable when playing various types of card games such as blackjack poker and the like. However in reality most shufflers have tendencies to shuffle or reorder the deck or decks in a manner which skilled card counters can perceive and use to their advantage versus the casino house or other player. Thus there is still a need for automated shufflers that function in a manner which more truly randomizes the ordering of a deck or decks of playing cards.

Other problems associated with at least some conventional shufflers include excessive size excessive weight excessive mechanical complexity and or electronic complexity. These complexities also may fail to achieve a suitable degree of shuffling reordering or recompiling into a truly random order from one shuffling process to another. Accordingly there is still a need for improved automated shuffling machines for playing cards that produce reordering of card decks in a manner which is closer to true randomness and which is more difficult for skilled card players to decipher to change the odds so as to be relatively favorable to the player versus unfavorable portions of a deck or decks of cards.

One casino game commonly called blackjack or 21 is known to be susceptible to card counting and casinos are routinely spending significant amounts of money trying to prevent card counters from taking advantage of non random sequences in the decks held within a dealing shoe that holds the decks being dealt. Poker has also grown in popularity and is played with a single deck which makes any knowledge of cards of potential significance to a player.

The card shuffler apparatus includes at least one card support or supporter a repositioner also referred to herein as a positioner an exciter a card receiver a controller and a housing . An overview of each of these components is provided immediately below followed by a more detailed individual description further below.

Still referring to the supporter functions to support the cards that are to be shuffled. More specifically the supporter supports the cards in a position substantially above the card receiver . The repositioner functions to reposition the supported cards relative to the card receiver . The exciter is configured to impart vibration to the supported cards. The card receiver is adapted to receive one or more cards dropped from the supporter . Preferably the card receiver is advantageously configured to receive only one card at a time from the supporter . The controller functions to control various operational aspects of the card shuffler apparatus . The housing can have one or more functions including but not limited to that of a chassis or frame to support one or more of the other components of the card shuffler apparatus .

During a typical use of the card shuffler apparatus at least one deck of playing cards can be placed into the housing so as to rest on the supporter preferably in an upstanding orientation. The repositioner is activated to move the supported cards to a first randomly selected position above the card receiver . The exciter is activated to produce a mechanical vibration. This vibration is of a frequency and amplitude sufficient to cause playing cards to dance or otherwise vibrate on the supporter . For example the vibration can give the cards an appearance of floating just above the supporter or the vibration may be almost or totally unperceivable by the naked eye.

One of the playing cards that is positioned substantially directly above the card receiver will preferably drop down into the card receiver during operation of the card shuffler apparatus . When a card has dropped into the card receiver the card receiver is blocked so that no other cards can enter the card receiver . After the first card has dropped into and is held within the card receiver the repositioner shifts or moves the supported cards to a second randomly selected position above the card receiver . After the supported cards are repositioned the card receiver is controlled to release the first card. For example the card receiver can be configured to help guide the card into a card collector . Releasing the first card from the card receiver unblocks the card receiver . More specifically when the first card is released from the card receiver the card receiver is now able to receive a second card.

Accordingly a second card drops into the card receiver from the supporter . The second card is held in the card receiver so that the card receiver is now blocked again preventing any other cards from entering the card receiver . After the second card drops into the card receiver the repositioner is again activated to move or shift the supported cards to a third randomly selected position substantially above the card receiver . The second card is then released from the card receiver thus allowing a third card to drop into the card receiver from the supporter . The second card is preferably placed onto the first card to begin forming a recompiled or shuffled array or stack of cards see . The third card is likewise preferably stacked on top of the second card. This operation can be continued as desired to randomly reorder the deck or decks of cards. In practice the card shuffler apparatus can be configured to repetitively perform steps of the operation very quickly.

As mentioned above with reference to the card shuffler apparatus includes a card support . The card support preferably includes a card rest . The card rest is adapted to support the playing cards to be shuffled in an orientation that is on edge. The card support can include a support surface . The support surface is preferably defined on the card rest . Playing cards that are to be shuffled can contact the support surface while being supported on the card support . More specifically the cards to be shuffled can be supported on the support surface . The support surface is preferably substantially flat and or straight as depicted. The card shuffler apparatus can be configured such that the support surface is in a substantially horizontal orientation during normal operation of the card shuffler apparatus .

The card support can include one or more edge guides also referred to herein as lateral supports . Preferably the card support includes a pair of edge guides between which the cards to be shuffled are positioned and advantageously supported such as at the ends laterally. The card support is preferably configured to support the cards in a substantially upstanding orientation. More specifically the card support is preferably configured to support playing cards oriented on edge. According to a preferred embodiment of the inventions cards to be shuffled are supported in an orientation substantially normal to the support surface and substantially normal to the one or more edge guides . It is to be understood however that the descriptions and depictions provided herein are not intended to limit the shape and or orientation of one or more components of the card support . For example it should be understood that the support surface need not be substantially flat and that the support surface need not be substantially horizontal. The lateral face and end of support surface may also vary in shape and orientation. The bottom of the support surface can have at least one of a number of possible shapes contours and or orientations.

One or more components of the card support can be designed and or configured to have at least one resonant frequency or a range of resonant frequencies. The resonant frequency can be selected to desirably effect imparting vibratory action to the cards supported by the card support . For example a resonant frequency can be selected to enhance vibration that is produced by the exciter and which is imparted to the playing cards such as via card rest .

With continued reference to one or more card apertures is preferably defined in the card rest as depicted. The one or more card apertures preferably pass through the support surface . The card aperture can be configured substantially in the manner of a slot through which at least one playing card can pass. Preferably the card aperture is configured to allow passage of only one card at a time. More specifically the width of the card aperture is greater than the thickness of a single playing card but less than twice the thickness of a single playing card. The card aperture as shown is preferably substantially straight. The card aperture has a width that is preferably substantially constant along its length.

The card aperture or apertures in the card rest can be configured in a manner wherein the card aperture is selectively operable. Such card aperture or apertures may be configured to be selectively opened and closed or blocked and unblocked according to at least one embodiment of the inventions. For example the card rest can be made up of two portions. The two portions of the card rest can be made to move together to substantially close or block the card aperture or apertures.

Conversely two portions of the card rest can be made to move away from each other to form a card aperture or apertures. Alternatively one or more gate elements such as described below can be included. Such a gate element or elements can be adapted to move relative to the card rest so as to selectively close or block the card aperture .

Preferably the card rest is adapted to support playing cards until the cards are released through one or more card apertures . In accordance with at least one preferred embodiment of the inventions the card rest is adapted to support playing cards on edge. For example the card rest can be adapted to support playing cards in a substantially upright or upstanding orientation. It is to be understood that when playing cards are supported on edge by the card rest the cards need not be truly vertical. For example in accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventions the card rest is adapted to support playing cards on edge wherein the cards are not truly vertical. For example the card rest can be adapted to support playing cards on edge in an oblique or leaning non vertical or acceptably tilted orientation which can vary dependent upon the specific construction of each card shuffler apparatus .

The card rest is preferably adapted to selectively impart a vibratory action to playing cards supported on the card rest . In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the inventions the card rest is adapted to selectively impart a vibratory action to the playing cards while the cards are supported on edge by the card rest . For example the card rest can be caused to vibrate which in turn can impart a vibratory action to playing cards supported thereon. Vibratory action can preferably be imparted to the card rest by the exciter which is described in greater detail below.

The preferred vibratory action imparted to playing cards by the card rest may cause the cards to have an appearance of dancing or floating on the card rest and or support surface . The vibratory action is operable at a range of frequencies such as in the order of 10 Hz to 100 000 Hz more preferably 100 Hz to 10 000 Hz even more preferably 1000 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The amplitude may be of varying amounts depending upon the dynamics of the card rest and how it is mounted.

The vibratory action of the card rest can have at least one of a number of possible types of motions or movements. For example the card rest can be caused to vibrate with a substantially random motion. Alternatively for example the card rest can be caused to vibrate with a substantially defined or substantially repetitive motion. Vibratory motion of the card rest can be of different types such as substantially two dimensional in nature. Alternatively vibratory motion of the card rest can be substantially three dimensional.

The positioner can include one or more positioner guides or face guides . The face guide is adapted to contact a face of playing cards supported on the card support . More specifically the face guide is adapted to contact and or engage a top side and or bottom side or face of playing cards supported on the card support . According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention the face guide is substantially parallel to the playing cards supported on the card support . Preferably the face guide is substantially perpendicular or normal to the edge guide . The face guide is preferably substantially perpendicular to the support surface . The face guide can be substantially in the form of a flat plate in one form of the inventions.

The face guide defines a contact surface or face . Preferably the face is substantially flat. The face is adapted to contact a flat side of the playing cards supported on the card support . More specifically the face is adapted to contact and or engage a top side and or bottom side or face of the playing cards supported on the card support . According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention the face is substantially parallel to the playing cards supported on the card support . The face is substantially perpendicular or normal to the edge guide as depicted. As shown the face guide is substantially perpendicular to the support surface .

The positioner can include a pair of face guides . The pair of face guides is preferably maintained in juxtaposed orientation relative to each other. More preferably the pair of face guides is preferably maintained in a substantially parallel juxtaposed orientation as shown. The pair of face guides is preferably maintained in a spaced apart relationship. More specifically each of the pair of face guides is preferably located on opposing sides of playing cards supported on the card rest . For example supported playing cards are preferably located between the pair of face guides of positioner .

The spacing between the pair of face guides is preferably variable. Such variable spacing between the face guides can facilitate keeping supported cards in an upstanding orientation as the number of supported cards changes. For example as the card shuffler apparatus shuffles playing cards the number of playing cards supported on the card rest will decrease. Thus as the number of supported playing cards decreases the face guides of the positioner may in controlled response move closer to each other to compensate for the decrease in the number of supported cards.

The positioner can include at least one actuator . The at least one actuator is preferably adapted to actuate or move at least one face guide of the positioner . According to a preferred embodiment of the inventions the at least one actuator is connected or linked to at least one face guide . For example the at least one actuator of the positioner can be a linear actuator as depicted. Preferably the positioner includes a pair of actuators as shown. More preferably the positioner includes a pair of face guides and a pair of actuators wherein each actuator is exclusively associated with one of the face guides as depicted. More specifically each of the face guides is individually movable or repositionable according to a preferred embodiment of the inventions. Most preferably each of the face guides is individually movable or repositionable by way of an associated actuator .

According to a preferred embodiment of the inventions the face guides of the positioner are adapted to reposition supported playing cards by pushing and or sliding the cards along the card rest and or the support surface . Such repositioning of supported cards is preferably performed while vibratory action is imparted to the cards by the exciter which is described in greater detail below. The face guides are adapted to reposition or move supported playing cards as well as being adapted to move relative to each other. By moving relative to each other the face guides are able to vary the spacing between each other to account for varying numbers of supported cards.

With continued reference to the card shuffler apparatus includes at least one exciter . The at least one exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action in playing cards supported by the card support . Preferably the at least one exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action to playing cards supported by the card rest . More preferably the at least one exciter is configured to impart vibratory action to playing cards supported on the support surface . In accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventions the at least one exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action to the card rest . For example imparting vibratory action to the card rest can be accomplished in a manner wherein vibratory action is in turn imparted from the card rest to playing cards supported thereon. Thus according to at least one embodiment of the inventions the at least one exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action to the playing cards by imparting vibratory action to the card rest which in turn imparts vibratory action to cards supported thereon.

The exciter is preferably adapted to create a mechanical vibration. The vibration created by the exciter can be at least one of a number of possible types of vibration. For example the vibration created by the exciter can be substantially two dimensional in nature. Alternatively the vibration created by the exciter can be substantially three dimensional in nature. As a further example the vibration created by the exciter can consist of substantially random vibratory motion. Alternatively vibratory motion of the exciter can be substantially regular and or repetitive in nature. The vibratory action created by the exciter can be of a relatively high frequency. The vibratory action created by the exciter may be of a relatively low amplitude. Preferably the vibratory action created by the exciter is of substantially high frequency and low amplitude. More preferably the vibratory action created by the exciter is of a frequency and or amplitude that causes supported cards to behave in a manner that is advantageous to the operation of the card shuffler apparatus as described herein.

The exciter is preferably connected to the card support . For example the exciter can be connected and or linked with the card rest as shown. The exciter is preferably connected with at least a portion of the card support so as to impart vibratory action from the exciter to playing cards supported on the card support . According to the exemplary embodiment of the inventions the exciter is connected to and or mounted directly on the card support . For example the exciter can be connected to and or mounted directly on the card rest as shown. According to an alternative embodiment of the inventions the exciter is substantially integrated with the card support .

The exciter can be configured to operate according to at least one of various possible manners of creating vibratory action both known and yet to be discovered. Such manners of creating vibratory action can include for example mechanical means electrical means and electro mechanical means among others. For example one way of creating vibratory action is by employing a rotary actuator not shown such as a rotary motor to rotate a weight that is eccentrically positioned relative to its axis of rotation. Another example of creating vibratory action is to subject a movable ferric object not shown to an electro magnetic field of dynamically alternating polarity to cause the ferric object to oscillate or vibrate. In accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventions the frequency and or the amplitude of the vibratory action created by the exciter is selectively adjustable.

Still referring to the card receiver is included in the card shuffler apparatus . The card receiver is adapted to receive at least one playing card from the card support . Preferably the card receiver is adapted to receive only one playing card at a time. For example the card receiver can be sized and or otherwise configured so that no more than one playing card at a time can be received into the card receiver . The card receiver includes a slot or card space into which one or more playing cards are received from the card support . The card space of the card receiver can have one of a number of possible specific configurations. The card receiver is adapted to receive and hold one or more playing cards in the card space . In some embodiments the card receiver is adapted to selectively retain one or more received playing cards within the card space .

The card receiver can include a card stop . The card stop preferably defines at least a portion of the card space and is within the intermediate or medial section. The handling of the dropped card or cards in the medial section can have a number of different configurations. For example the card stop can define a lower end of the card space . Placement or location of the card stop relative to the support surface can be of significance to the operation of the card shuffler apparatus . Specifically the card stop is preferably located to be a certain distance from the support surface wherein the distance is substantially equal to either a length or a width of playing cards being shuffled. More preferably when a playing card has been received into the card receiver from the card support an upper edge of the received playing card is substantially even or flush with the support surface . The significance of this aspect of the inventions becomes more clear in view of later descriptions which follow below with respect to the operation of the card shuffler apparatus .

The card receiver can include one or more guides. For example the card receiver can include a first guide portion and a second guide portion . The guide portions can define at least part of the card slot or card space into which a playing card is received from the card support . Preferably the card space is substantially straight as depicted. The card space is preferably substantially vertical in orientation as is also depicted. The card space is preferably substantially directly below the card aperture . According to an exemplary embodiment of the invention depicted in a playing card is dropped from the support surface through the card aperture and is received into the card space between the first guide portion and the second guide portion . The received playing card is preferably supported substantially upon the card stop such that a bottom edge of the received card rests upon the card stop and an opposite upper edge of the received card is substantially flush or even with the support surface .

As shown the card receiver preferably includes at least one receiver actuator . The at least one receiver actuator can be a linear actuator such as a linear solenoid for example. The at least one receiver actuator is preferably selectively controlled. The at least one receiver actuator can be adapted for selective control by the controller as is described in greater detail hereinbelow. The card receiver can include a link or linkage . The link can be connected to the receiver actuator as depicted. More specifically link can be operably connected to the receiver actuator for selective movement of the link . The link can be connected to at least one portion of the receiver guides such as the second guide portion as shown.

The link can include a bottom guide . The bottom guide is adapted to contact and or engage a received playing card that is retained in the card space . The receiver actuator along with the link and bottom guide can make up and or form portions of a release mechanism. The second guide portion can be included in such a release mechanism. Specifically the receiver actuator together with the link bottom guide and second guide portion can be configured to facilitate release of a playing card retained in the card space . For example according to an exemplary embodiment of the inventions the receiver actuator can be activated to move the link toward the first guide portion .

Movement of the link toward the first guide portion can cause the second guide portion to move away from the first guide portion while at the same time causing the bottom guide to push a lower end of the retained card away from the first guide portion and past the card stop . This operation is described hereinbelow in greater detail. Such an operation of the receiver actuator and the link in this manner can cause release of a retained playing card from the card space . A playing card released from the retained position in the card receiver can cause the card to fall into a card collector . Following release of a retained playing card the receiver actuator can be activated to return to the original position shown in . With the second guide portion and bottom guide in their original respective positions the card receiver is ready to receive another playing card from the card support .

The card receiver can include at least one card sensor . The at least one card sensor can be adapted to detect presence of a playing card that has dropped into the medial zone. More specifically in accordance with the exemplary card shuffler apparatus depicted in the at least one card sensor can be adapted to detect that a playing card is present and or is retained within the card space . Such detection of a playing card retained within the card space can facilitate operation of the card shuffler apparatus . For example a playing card can be allowed to drop from the card support and into the card space of the card receiver .

The card sensor is adapted to detect that a playing card is fully received into the medial section. The card sensor can send a signal to the controller in response to detecting that a playing card has been fully dropped onto the card stop and received into the card space . When the controller receives this signal from the card sensor the controller can in response activate the repositioner to reposition playing cards supported by the card support .

Although not preferred it is also possible that the card sensor can be employed to detect the absence of any playing card or cards from the stopped medial position in card space . This can be accomplished by configuring the controller to recognize that all cards have been shuffled when the card sensor or other sensors so indicate the presence or absence of playing cards in the card space or at other locations not believed to be preferable at this time.

It is noted that the card receiver is depicted as being separate and distinct from the card support and or other components of the card shuffler apparatus . However it is to be understood that one or more portions of the card receiver can be at least substantially integral with one or more portions of the card support . For example in accordance with at least one alternative embodiment of the inventions the first guide portion is integral and or connected with the card rest . Similarly the card aperture can be at least partially integrated with the card receiver according to at least one embodiment of the inventions.

With reference now to the card shuffler apparatus can include a controller . The controller can be at least a portion of a control system which can include at least one additional component such as but not limited to the actuator of the positioner the exciter the receiver actuator the card sensor and the user interface .

For example the user interface can include and or can be substantially in the form of a switch. Such a switch can be an on off switch a stop start switch or a power switch for example. The user interface can be adapted for other input commands. For example the user interface can be adapted to input and or select optional dimensions or other characteristics of playing cards to be shuffled. Specifically for example the user interface can be substantially in the form of a control panel having multiple command input parameters available to a user of the card shuffler apparatus .

In a further alternative version the need for controls may be eliminated or simplified to a great degree. The card shuffler apparatus may be constructed so as to sense when a card array is input and then merely automatically perform the shuffling process as a result of a sensor that detects cards placed within the input supports.

The controller can include an enclosure . The user interface can be mounted on or supported by the enclosure . A processor is preferably included as part of the controller . The processor can be a digital processor such as a microprocessor or the like. The processor is preferably contained within the enclosure . The controller preferably includes a computer readable memory . The computer readable memory is preferably housed within the enclosure . The processor and the computer readable memory are preferably linked for signal transmission.

More specifically the control system and or the card shuffler apparatus can include at least one communication link adapted to facilitate signal transmission between the controller and other components of the card shuffler apparatus and or control system . For example the controller can be linked for signal transmission with one or more of the positioner actuators the exciter the receiver actuator and the card sensor . The controller can be linked for signal transmission with an optional aperture actuator that is shown by dashed lines in . According to an alternative embodiment of the inventions the card shuffler apparatus and or the control system can include the aperture actuator to selectively open and close or block and unblock at least one card aperture shown in . The controller can include various electrical and or electronic components that are not shown such as but not limited to relays timers counters indicators switches sensors and electrical power sources.

The controller is preferably adapted to facilitate operation and or function of one or more components to which it is linked for signal transmission. For example the controller can be adapted to send on and off signals to the exciter . The controller can be adapted to send control signals to at least one actuator including but not limited to one or more positioner actuators receiver actuators and optional aperture actuators shown by dashed lines in . For example the controller is preferably adapted to control positioning and or activation of one or more actuators . The controller is preferably configured to receive and or process input commands and or data from the user interface . Preferably the controller is adapted to receive and or process signals generated by the card sensor . The controller is preferably adapted to generate and or determine random positions of the supported cards and to command the positioner to move the supported cards to the randomly generated positions.

With reference to the card shuffler apparatus includes at least one housing . The housing can function as a chassis or frame for one or more additional components of the card shuffler apparatus . More specifically one or more components of the card shuffler apparatus can be mounted on or supported by the housing . For example the housing is preferably adapted to support one or more of the card support the positioner or repositioner the exciter the card receiver and the controller . The housing can be adapted to function as an enclosure for one or more components of the card shuffler apparatus wherein the housing is adapted to substantially protect enclosed components from damage and or contamination. More specifically one or more components of the card shuffler apparatus can be enclosed within the housing to decrease likelihood of damage and or contamination. For example the housing is preferably adapted to enclose one or more of the card support the positioner the exciter the card receiver and the controller .

The housing can include one or more features to facilitate operation and or use of the card shuffler apparatus . For example the housing can include a card collector . The card collector is preferably adapted to catch and or collect playing cards released from the card receiver . The card collector can be configured to form a stack of collected playing cards. For example the card collector can be sloped or tilted to facilitate collection of playing cards into a substantially orderly stack. According to at least one embodiment of the inventions the card collector is adapted to vibrate. Such vibration of the card collector can facilitate collection of playing cards and or formation of an orderly stack of collected and shuffled playing cards. For example the exciter can be configured to impart vibratory action to the card collector .

The housing can have at least one opening . The at least one opening can serve one or more of a number of possible uses or purposes. For example the at least one opening can be adapted to provide for placing a deck of cards into the card support . The housing preferably has at least one other opening not shown proximate the card collector to facilitate retrieval of the shuffled cards from the card collector . Still other openings not shown in the housing can be provided for one or more of a number of purposes. For example at least one opening not shown can be provided in the housing to facilitate access to one or more components for repair and or maintenance.

The housing has a lower end and an opposite upper end . The lower end preferably includes and or forms a base for contacting or engaging a support surface such as a tabletop counter top or shelf not shown . Preferably the at least one opening is positioned near the upper end as shown to facilitate placement of playing cards into the card support . The card support is preferably proximate the upper end . The card collector is preferably proximate the lower end . The card receiver is preferably situated substantially between the card support and the card collector as depicted. According to at least one preferred embodiment of the inventions the housing is configured so that the support surface is substantially horizontal under normal operating conditions as shown.

The contact arm is advantageously formed in a convex shape as seen from the array of cards . This minimizes any potential wear or marking of the cards. It also applies a relatively light force automatically without precise control of a stepper motor. However precise control may not be necessary since friction between the cards is minimal and sufficiently low to allow individual cards to drop through the card aperture without sufficient impedance such that dropping due to gravity occurs. The vibratory action of the unshuffled card array further reduces any impedance against dropping since the coefficient of friction is typically lower in a dynamic or moving relationship versus the static coefficient of friction. Thus one advantage of the preferred shufflers is that the vibratory action has the cards effectively floating due to the vibratory excitation of the unshuffled card array .

The card shuffling machine has lateral supports which may also be referred to as edge guides that may be provided with flanges which can be constructed to slide within support channels . This construction allows the lateral supports to move with the unshuffled card array . The relative motion may in fact involve motion of the lateral supports and cards the cards relative to the lateral supports or both the lateral supports and cards to move relative to a fixed reference point and relative to the card slot or slots .

The card rest is as shown provided with two card slots formed in each card rest or rests . A pair of gate pieces is mounted to slide inwardly and outwardly upon the card rests using actuators not shown but similar to actuator or suitable alternatives thereof . When the gate pieces are controlled to slide inwardly the rounded corners of the playing cards on the bottom are engaged and supported on the gate pieces thus preventing them from dropping through slots . Thus the unshuffled card array may be lifted slightly and relative motion between the unshuffled card array and slots is performed and then the gate pieces are opened by moving them outwardly and cards may then drop through the slots .

This construction may be controlled or configured so that the gating action occurs independently for each slot relative to the other slot . Furthermore the cards can be simultaneously dropped and the guiding parts contained in the medial section of the card shuffling machine may appropriately accommodate the recompiling of the cards.

With reference now to a flow diagram depicts a sequence of operational steps that can be carried out by one or more components of the card shuffler apparatus according to at least one embodiment of the inventions. With reference to the sequence moves from a starting point to step wherein a plurality of playing cards is placed onto the card support . The step of placing the cards into the card shuffler apparatus according to step can be accomplished by a user of the card shuffler apparatus . The starting point can include turning the apparatus on or initializing the card shuffler apparatus . This can be accomplished by the user. For example the user can turn the card shuffler apparatus on or initialize the apparatus by manipulating the user interface .

The next step is to command the positioner to grip the supported cards. In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the inventions an optional aperture actuator shown by dashed lines in is commanded to close or block the card aperture shown in . This step of generating and transmitting command signals can be carried out by the controller . From step the sequence moves to a step that includes generating a start position of the supported cards relative to the card aperture and commanding the positioner to move the supported cards to the start position. The start position is preferably randomly determined. This step of generating the start position and commanding the positioner to move the supported cards can be accomplished by the controller .

The sequence moves next to a step of activating the exciter . More specifically the exciter is turned on or operated so as to impart vibrational action to the supported cards. The step of activating the exciter can be carried out by the controller . The step of activating the exciter can have other alternative positions in the sequence . For example the step of activating the exciter can be the first step of the sequence . Once the exciter is turned on the sequence moves to a step of commanding the positioner to release the supported cards. In accordance with an alternative embodiment of the inventions the optional aperture actuator shown by dashed lines in is commanded to open unblock the card aperture shown in . This step can be performed by the controller . From step the sequence moves to step during which a counter is initialized to unity. More specifically for example a variable n is set to a value of 1 according to this step which can be accomplished by the controller .

From the step the operational sequence moves to a query . The query asks whether the ncard is detected in the card receiver . More specifically the query asks whether the ncard has dropped into a fully received position within the card receiver . This query can be performed by the controller in conjunction with the card sensor . For example the card sensor looks for a card to drop into a fully received position within the card space . When the card sensor detects the presence of the card the card sensor transmits a signal to the controller by way of the respective communication link . The controller receives the signal from the card sensor as indication that the ncard has been fully received into the card receiver .

If the answer to the query is yes then the sequence proceeds to a step wherein the nposition is randomly generated and the positioner is commanded to move the supported cards to the nrandom position. This step can be performed by the controller for example. From this step the sequence moves to a step in accordance with which the card receiver is commanded to release the ncard. For example the ncard is released from a retained position in the card space and is allowed to drop into the card collector . This step of commanding the card receiver to release the ncard can be performed by the controller for example. From the step the sequence proceeds to a step wherein the counter is incrementally increased to the next value. Specifically the value of the variable n is increased by a value of one.

From the step the sequence returns to the query described above. As is described above if the answer to the query is yes then the steps and are repeated. For example the steps and of generating the nrandom position for the supported cards moving the supported cards to the nrandom position releasing the ncard from the card receiver and incrementing the counter continue as long as the card sensor continues to detect the ncard being fully received into a retained position within the card space . However if the answer to the query is no then the sequence proceeds to end point . For example if the controller does not receive a signal from the card sensor for a predetermined period of time i.e. the card sensor fails to detect the presence of a card being fully received into a retained position within the card space then the controller will assume that there are no additional cards to process and the controller will end the operational sequence .

Referring now to a series of elevational views of the card shuffler apparatus illustrates an operational sequence according to at least one embodiment of the inventions. With reference to the card shuffler apparatus is shown in a card loading mode or status. With the apparatus in the loading mode the face guides are positioned to receive a deck of cards through the loading opening . As shown the plurality of cards to be shuffled has been inserted through the loading opening and has been set on the card support . More specifically the plurality of cards to be shuffled has been placed on the support surface . According to an exemplary embodiment of the inventions when the card shuffler apparatus is in the loading mode the cards to be shuffled are not above the card aperture . More specifically when in the loading mode the face guides are offset relative to the card aperture as shown so that the card aperture is not below the supported cards .

Still referring to the receiver actuator is in a deactivated status. More specifically the receiver actuator is in a position wherein the link is in a withdrawn position. With the link in a withdrawn position the bottom guide is also withdrawn as shown. The second guide portion is in a card retention position wherein the first guide portion and the second guide portion together are configured to receive a card into the card space . Cards to be shuffled can be loaded by insertion of the cards through the loading opening and placement of the cards onto the support surface . A user of the card shuffler apparatus can start the operational sequence of the card shuffler apparatus after the cards are loaded into the card shuffler apparatus . Commencement of the operational sequence can be effected by manipulation of the user interface for example.

In response to commencement of the operational sequence the face guides are activated to grip the supported cards . Gripping of the supported cards by the face guides can be accomplished for example by causing the positioner actuators to cause the face guides to move and or exert a force toward each other thereby squeezing or trapping the cards therebetween. The exciter is activated in response to commencement of the operational sequence. Activation of the exciter preferably causes the exciter to impart vibratory action to the supported cards . For example as described above the exciter can be adapted to impart vibratory action to one or more components of the card shuffler apparatus such as the card support . In response to commencement of the operational sequence the controller can define a starting position of the cards relative to the card aperture . This starting position of the cards is preferably randomly selected or generated. The controller can then command the positioner actuator to cause the face guides to move the cards to the starting position while also maintaining a grip on the cards.

With reference now to it is seen that the cards have been moved to the starting position. The starting position places the cards above the card aperture . More specifically when the cards are in the starting position the cards are situated substantially above the card space . After the cards have been moved to the start position the positioner preferably transmits a signal to the controller to indicate that the movement is complete. The controller then preferably commands the positioner to release its grip on the cards . This can be accomplished for example by commanding one or more of the positioner actuators to move the face guides away from each other so that substantially little force is exerted on the cards by the face guides .

When the cards are released by the positioner the cards will come to rest substantially on the support surface . Preferably vibrational action of the support surface will be imparted to the cards supported thereon. Vibrational action is preferably imparted to the support surface by the exciter Impartation of vibrational action to the supported cards will preferably result in a first card dropping from the support surface through the card aperture into a retained position within the card space as shown. After dropping through the card aperture and into the card space a lower edge of the first card comes to rest substantially on the card stop . When the first card is resting substantially upon the card stop the first card has been substantially completely dropped and received into the medial card space .

With a lower edge of the first card resting substantially on the card stop an opposite upper edge of the first card is substantially flush or even with the support surface as shown. With an upper edge of the first card being substantially even or flush with the support surface the card receiver and or the card aperture is substantially blocked or closed so that no other cards can enter the card receiver . The card sensor preferably detects that the first card has dropped into a fully received position within the card space . In response to detecting presence of the first card the card sensor transmits a signal to the controller . The controller receives the signal from the card sensor and interprets the signal to indicate that the first card has been fully received into the medial card space . In response to recognizing that the first card has been received into the card space the controller randomly selects or generates a new position of the supported cards relative to the card aperture . The controller can then command the positioner to move the supported cards to a new randomly selected position.

Turning now to it is seen that the supported cards have been moved to the new randomly selected position relative to the card aperture . The positioner preferably transmits a signal to the controller to indicate that movement of the cards to the new randomly selected position is complete. The controller then commands the receiver actuator to activate. Activation of the receiver actuator causes the first card to be released and directed or guided from the card space as shown. The first card preferably drops from the card receiver into the card collector .

In some preferred versions of the invention the dropping of first card from the card rest into the card receiver causes the card aperture to be opened or unblocked. With the card aperture unblocked and as a result of vibrational action of the supported cards a second card begins dropping through the card aperture and into the card space as shown. Card sensor can advantageously detect the first card positioned in the card space and transmit a signal to the controller indicating that the first card is in the stopped position waiting to be directed or released or otherwise guided from the medial card space and into the card collector .

Turning now to it is seen that the second card has been fully received into the card receiver . More specifically it is seen from a study of that the second card has dropped through the card aperture and a lower edge of the second card has come to rest substantially on the card stop . With a lower edge of the second card resting substantially on the card stop an opposite upper edge of the second card is substantially flush or even with the support surface . With an upper edge of the second card being substantially flush or even with the support surface it is seen that the card aperture is substantially blocked or closed by the second card . More specifically with the second card being in a fully retained position within the card receiver the card receiver is blocked so that no additional cards can drop and enter into the medial card space .

Further study of shows that the first card has come to rest within the card collector after having been released from the card receiver . The card sensor preferably detects that the second card has dropped into a fully received position within the card space . In response to detecting presence of the second card the card sensor transmits a signal to the controller . The controller receives the signal from the card sensor and interprets the signal to indicate that the second card has been fully received into the card space . In response to recognizing that the second card has been received into the card space the controller randomly selects or generates a new position of the supported cards relative to the card aperture . The controller can then command the positioner to move the supported cards to the new randomly selected position.

With reference now to it is seen that the supported cards have been moved to the new randomly selected position relative to the card aperture . The positioner preferably transmits a signal to the controller to indicate that movement of the cards to the new randomly selected position is complete. The controller then commands the receiver actuator to activate. Activation of the receiver actuator causes the second card to be released from the card space as shown. The second card preferably drops from the card receiver into the card collector . Release of the second card from the card receiver causes the card aperture to be opened or unblocked. With the card aperture unblocked and as a result of vibrational action of the supported cards a third card begins dropping through the card aperture and into the card space as shown. The operational sequence described hereinabove can be continued as desired to shuffle a desired number of playing cards.

Turning now to it is seen that the above described operational sequence has continued to produce a stack of shuffled cards which are held in the card collector . The operational sequence continues with a retained card shown in a fully received position in the card space and a plurality of supported cards remaining to be shuffled. It is seen that the quantity of supported cards has been depleted as the result of continuation of the operational sequence of the card shuffler apparatus . It can also be seen that the face guides have been repositioned relative to each other. Specifically the face guides have moved closer to each other in response to depletion of the quantity of supported cards . In this manner the positioner facilitates maintaining the supported cards in a substantially upstanding orientation. Continued processing of the supported cards according to the operational sequence results in deposition of all cards in the card collector . More specifically upon completion of processing of all cards according to the operational sequence the shuffled cards can be retrieved from the card collector .

Turning now to an elevational view shows an apparatus according to another embodiment of the inventions. The apparatus preferably functions in a manner substantially similar to that of the card shuffler apparatus . However the apparatus includes alternative aspects and or configurations of various components. For example from a study of it is seen that the user interface can be mounted in a location relative to the housing which is different from that of the card shuffler apparatus shown in . The face guides of the apparatus can have a shape that is different from those of the card shuffler apparatus . For example the face guides of the apparatus can be configured to overlap the loading opening as is shown in . As a further example the controller can be located substantially within the housing as shown in .

With continued reference to the positioner can include a rotary actuator or motor a lead screw and a connector or follower . The rotary actuator can be for example a rotary electric motor such as a stepper motor or the like. The rotary actuator is preferably fixedly supported by the housing . The motor is configured to selectively drive or rotate the lead screw . Activation of the motor is preferably controlled by the controller . The connector is engaged with the externally threaded lead screw . A follower forming part of the rotary actuator is connected causing the lead screw to extend and retract the face guides . The motor can be selectively activated to rotate in a desired direction which in turn causes the lead screw to rotate. Rotation of the lead screw relative to the follower causes the follower and one or more of the face guides to move relative to the motor . In this manner the face guides can be positionally controlled.

The exciter can include a coil and vibrational follower . The vibrational follower is preferably ferro magnetic. The coil can be mounted on or supported by the housing . The vibrational follower can be mounted on or supported by the card rest . The vibrational follower can be substantially integral with the card rest . The coil can be subjected to intermittent direct current of a given polarity to cause vibrational movement of the vibrational follower . Alternatively the coil can be subjected to current of alternating polarity to cause vibrational movement of the vibrational follower . Such vibrational movement of the vibrational follower is preferably imparted to the card rest which in turn imparts vibrational action to playing cards supported thereon.

With continued reference to the card receiver can have a configuration that is substantially different from that of the card shuffler apparatus shown in . For example as shown in the card receiver can include a cam lobe element . The cam lobe element can have a cross sectional shape substantially in the form of an ellipse as shown. The cam lobe element can be rotationally supported by a shaft . The shaft is preferably rotatably supported by the housing . The shaft is preferably positioned in a manner to place the cam lobe element substantially adjacent to the card space into which a card is dropped from the card rest .

As shown in the cam lobe element is in a card retaining or card receiving position in which a card is retained within the card space . More specifically it is seen from a study of that the cam lobe element has a wider portion and a narrower portion because of its elliptical cross sectional shape. It is also seen that when in the card retaining position as shown the cam lobe element is rotationally oriented so that the narrower portion of the cam lobe element is substantially adjacent to the card space . Thus rotation of the cam lobe element for approximately one quarter of a turn can cause the wider portion of the cam lobe element to move into adjacency with the card space . Rotation of the cam lobe elements approximately one quarter of a turn will preferably cause release of the retained card from the card space . More specifically rotation of the cam lobe element will preferably cause the retained card to be pushed from its retained position in the card space and to fall into the card collector .

With reference to a method of shuffling a plurality of playing cards includes supporting the cards on an intake support surface . The method can include supporting the cards on a surface having at least one card aperture . The cards can be supported in a suitable orientation for example the cards can be supported substantially on edge and preferably upstanding.

Vibratory action is imparted to the cards. The vibratory action can be produced for example by an exciter which is described hereinabove with respect to the card shuffler apparatus . The method also includes allowing one or more cards to drop into a medial zone advantageously provided with a card receiver . For example one or more of the cards can be allowed to drop through the at least one card aperture in response to imparting the vibratory action to the cards.

In some methods at least one of the dropped cards is retained within the card receiver in response to allowing the at least one card to drop. Retaining at least one of the cards includes retaining at least one of the cards so that the retained card substantially blocks the card receiver and or the card aperture . The method includes repositioning the supported cards relative to the card receiver . Repositioning the cards preferably includes moving the supported cards to a randomly selected position relative to the card receiver . The method includes releasing the retained card from the card receiver in response to repositioning the supported cards. Repositioning of the supported cards can be accomplished substantially by the positioner or repositioner .

The method can include detecting that at least one card is being retained in the card receiver . For example this can include detecting that at least one card has been fully received into a retained position within the card receiver . The process of detecting can be accomplished substantially by way of the card sensor for example. Repositioning of the supported cards can be performed in response to detecting that at least one card is retained. Retaining the at least one card preferably includes holding the retained card in a position wherein an upper edge of the card is substantially flush or even with the support surface .

The method can include allowing a plurality of supported cards to sequentially drop into the card receiver according to a random sequence. The method can also include sequentially retaining each of the dropped cards according to the random sequence. The supported cards can be repositioned during retention of each of the plurality of cards. The method can include sequentially releasing each of the retained cards according to the random sequence.

The method can include collecting cards that are released through the card aperture . The process of collecting the cards can be accomplished by a card collector which is described hereinabove with respect to the card shuffler apparatus . The method can include forming a stack of the collected cards. The stack can be formed by the card collector according to at least one embodiment of the inventions. According to the method the process of allowing the cards to be released through the card aperture includes allowing the cards to drop through the card aperture .

The process of allowing the cards to be released through the card aperture can include substantially blocking and or unblocking the card aperture according to some preferred method.

Blocking and or unblocking the card aperture can also be accomplished for example by a gate system which can include employing movable gates to block and unblock the card aperture . The method can further include sensing whether the card aperture is blocked or unblocked. Selective control of whether the card aperture is blocked or unblocked can be accomplished at least in part by a controller and an optional aperture actuator which are described hereinabove with respect to the card shuffler apparatus .

According to at least one embodiment of the inventions the card shuffler apparatus depicted in can be used in the following manner A plurality of cards is selected and is placed onto the card rest . For example the plurality of cards can be substantially in the form of one or more decks of cards. Preferably the cards are placed onto the card support so as to be substantially supported on the support surface . The cards can be supported by the card rest in one or more of a variety of possible orientations wherein the cards are supported on the support surface substantially on edge. For example the cards can be supported in a substantially upright or upstanding orientation which includes but is not limited to a substantially vertical orientation.

The card shuffler apparatus can be turned on or otherwise activated so as to be in an operational mode. An operational mode of the card shuffler apparatus preferably includes imparting vibratory action to the cards . Imparting vibratory action to the cards can include but is not limited to imparting vibratory action to the card rest . According to a preferred embodiment of the inventions vibratory action is provided by the exciter . More preferably the exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action to the cards supported on the card rest . Additionally or alternatively the exciter is adapted to impart vibratory action to the card rest .

Preferably vibratory action imparted to the cards supported on the card rest results in an appearance of the cards dancing or floating on the card rest . For example vibratory action imparted to the cards preferably results in the cards bouncing substantially upward and downward while being substantially contained above the card rest . According to at least one embodiment of the inventions vibratory action imparted to the cards causes the cards to bounce on the card rest which in turn results in one or more of the cards falling or dropping through one or more of the card apertures only one card aperture is depicted . The card aperture can be controlled by a gate system according to at least one embodiment of the inventions. The gate system is preferably adapted to selectively block and or unblock one or more of the card apertures . Such a gate system can include means of employing at least one playing card to block the card aperture and or to block the card receiver .

As cards fall through the card aperture the cards supported on the card rest decrease in number. To compensate for the decreasing number of cards supported on the card rest the positioner can be employed to maintain the cards substantially on edge while also supported on the card rest . For example the positioner can include one or more face guides that are adapted to move inward toward the cards as the number of cards supported on the card rest decreases. In this manner the positioner can function to maintain the cards substantially on edge while being supported on the card rest .

The cards can be collected after they are released through the card aperture as described hereinabove. Collection of the cards after being released through the card aperture can be accomplished by a card collector which is described hereinabove with respect to the card shuffler apparatus . Operation of the card shuffler apparatus is preferably continued until a desired quantity of cards is either released from the card rest or collected and or stacked by the card collector . Shuffled cards can be retrieved from the card collector . In accordance with at least one embodiment of the inventions a plurality of cards can be fed or processed through the card shuffler apparatus more than once to increase the degree of shuffling.

The apparatuses described herein are intended for use with playing cards. In particular the apparatuses are especially appropriate for use with plastic playing cards.

The apparatuses according to this invention may be made using a variety of fabrication and molding techniques. The support actuations are advantageously stepper motors with a coded output for precise control.

The components that touch the cards are advantageously made from TEFLON or other polymer materials that prevent or reduce wear on cards. Also suitably coated components that have low friction surfaces of various types may be appropriate.
