The present application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 248 930 filed Apr. 9 2014 entitled FUEL SURGE ARRESTOR the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to fuel filling devices generally and more specifically to fuel filling devices for boating.

In boating and other activities using fuel powered crafts e.g. motorcycles cars etc. fuel tanks must be refilled on occasion. Often fuel tanks are refilled from fuel pumps such as those found on land at standard pumping stations and those found near the water at marine piers. The fuel pumps generally pump fuel out through a nozzle that can be positioned within a fuel fill receptacle of the craft.

A common occurrence when refueling boats and other crafts is a back surge or fuel surge sometimes referred to as a belch. The fuel surge is a surge of fuel and vapors that are expelled out of the fuel fill receptacle during refueling. In boating the fuel surge can be especially problematic because it can often result in spillage of fuel onto and over the side of the craft potentially into surrounding water. Fuel surge results in waste and more importantly can cause environmental problems. To combat these environmental problems many marine fuel filling stations supply boaters with supplies e.g. paper towels and dispersant sprays to clean up fuel spills however these supplies can end up resulting in further waste and additional environmental problems. In addition to the loss of fuel during a fuel surge loss of vapors can result in waste and environmental problems.

Statements containing the term embodiment should be understood not to limit the subject matter described herein or to limit the meaning or scope of the claims below. Embodiments of the present disclosure covered herein are defined by the claims below not this summary. This summary is a high level overview of various aspects of the disclosure and introduces some of the concepts that are further described in the Detailed Description section below. This summary is not intended to identify key or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used in isolation to determine the scope of the claimed subject matter. The subject matter should be understood by reference to appropriate portions of the entire specification of this disclosure any or all drawings and each claim.

A fuel surge arrestor is disclosed including a funnel and a vent which can be a unitary structure or separable structures. The funnel is shaped to fit within a fuel fill receptacle of a craft. The funnel can include nozzle opening for accepting a fuel fill nozzle. During a fuel surge expelled fuel is expelled into the funnel and allowed to flow back into the fuel fill receptacle. The vent extends from the top of the funnel and can include a plurality of baffles that enable airflow within the vent while deterring heavy vapors and liquids from exiting the vent. During a fuel surge expelled vapors can be lifted into the vent and blocked from exiting the vent by the baffles. Heavy vapors can then fall back into the fuel fill receptacle via the funnel.
