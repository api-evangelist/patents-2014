title: Telecommunications addressing system and method
abstract: A telecommunications addressing system/method allowing selection of a telephone instrument device (TID) using arbitrary identifiers is disclosed. The system/method allows a source TID (STD) to select a target TID (TTD) by the use of a Target Telephone Identifier (TTI) data string rather than a traditional numeric telephone identification (NTI). This TTI is then indexed within a TTI/NTI mapping server (TMS) that functions as a hierarchical repository of TTI/NTI mappings. STD/TTD communication is established by first performing a lookup of the STD-selected TTI within the TMS to identify the NTI of the TTD. Once the NTI of the STD has been identified by the TMS, communication between the STD and TTD is established using the NTI via the normal public switched telephone network (PSTN). TMS TTI lookup may be performed via STD TID web application and/or via PSTN infrastructure interface.

Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for identifying and targeting communication with a telecommunications device within a general public switched telephone network PSTN . While not limitive of the invention teachings the present invention may in some circumstances be advantageously applied to categories including U.S. Patent Classifications 370 352 379 88.17 379 90.01 379 201.05 379 201.07 379.218.011 370 265.09 379 900 and 455 550 .

With respect to conventional telecommunication devices operating within the public switched telephone network PSTN the use of numeric telephone numbers numeric telephone identifier NTI that uniquely address a target telecommunication device TTD is standardized. The specific format length and interpretation of these telephone numbers is often equipment dependent and often dependent on the country in which the TTD is located and or dependent on the country in which the source telecommunication device STD is located.

While most smartphone and other intelligent STDs have made attempts to simplify the association of a TTD with their respective NTI using software implementing telephone address books and the like this approach is insufficient to account for changes in TTD NTI associations due to external events phone numbers change area codes change changes in PBX extensions etc. . Other attempts to make TTD associations using an Internet address as in U.S. Pat. No. 7 382 871 for CALL SETUP USING A PACKET SWITCHED ADDRESS SUCH AS AN INTERNET ADDRESS OR THE LIKE issued to Michael J. Ure on Jun. 3 2008 or to integrate the STD into the Internet infrastructure as in U.S. Pat. No. 6 169 734 for INTERNET telephone SET issued to James E. Wilson on Jan. 2 2001 have proven unsuccessful in addressing a number of issues relating to the use of NTIs within the PSTN. These deficiencies have become more pronounced as the PSTN infrastructure increases with the use of wireless and mobile telephones smartphones tablet computers and telephone enabled personal computers laptops desktops etc. .

From the above discussion and an inspection of the prior art in the field it can be discerned that the use of NTIs within the PSTN suffers from the following disadvantages 

Accordingly the objectives of the present invention are among others to circumvent the deficiencies in the prior art and affect the following objectives 

While these objectives should not be understood to limit the teachings of the present invention in general these objectives are achieved in part or in whole by the disclosed invention that is discussed in the following sections. One skilled in the art will no doubt be able to select aspects of the present invention as disclosed to affect any combination of the objectives described above.

The present invention relates to a system method for choosing and controlling telephone identification by individuals and businesses. The disclosed system takes advantage of universal interactive programming languages such as Java J2ME PERL or any cellphone programming languages such as BREW and relational databases such as Oracle DB2 MySQL etc. the world wide web and or the existing public switched telephone network PSTN . Instead of using a conventional telephone number to identify a target telephone device TTD the present invention allows telephone subscribers to choose their own target telephone identifier TTI to describe the numeric telephone identifier NTI of the target telephone. This present invention does not replace the use of telephone numbers but rather serves as a layer of abstraction to the existing telephone numbers assigned by the telephone companies. The present invention permits telephone users to control this add on without any involvement of the telephone companies.

The objective of this technology is to let the telephone subscribers choose and maintain a more powerful and functionality enhanced TTI instead of a numeric telephone number provided by the telephone companies. The TTI may be chosen and controlled by the telephone users themselves. Provisions within this architecture provide for global TTI directories that may be browsed and searched in a similar fashion to that of web pages but with additional levels of security and functionality that are directed to improving the maintainability of the telephone directory infrastructure.

While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detailed preferred embodiment of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiment illustrated.

The numerous innovative teachings of the present application will be described with particular reference to the presently preferred embodiment wherein these innovative teachings are advantageously applied to the particular problems of a TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADDRESSING SYSTEM AND METHOD. However it should be understood that this embodiment is only one example of the many advantageous uses of the innovative teachings herein. In general statements made in the specification of the present application do not necessarily limit any of the various claimed inventions. Moreover some statements may apply to some inventive features but not to others.

The present invention will use the term telephone phone and their derivatives to broadly cover any communications device that may be configured to operate within the context of a public switched telephone network PSTN . This may include cellular telephones mobile telephones and conventional wired telephone landline VoIP phones etc. infrastructures.

The present invention will use the term telephone number NTI and their derivatives to broadly cover any identification methodology used within the a public switched telephone network PSTN to uniquely identify a telephone or telephone branch exchange. This use generally relates to numeric telephone numbers 0123456789 but is anticipated to cover other non numeric identifiers that may be used within a PSTN in the future.

The present invention will use the term source telephone identifier STI to generally reference a telephone identifier associated with a telephone call originator and target telephone identifier TTI to generally reference a telephone identifier associated with a telephone call recipient. However in many circumstances the term TTI may generally refer to any form of telephone identifier used to perform a lookup to resolve a numeric telephone identifier NTI conventional telephone company telephone number . For example the TTI NTI mapping database TMD referenced herein is generally used to match TTI identifiers to their respective NTI resolved PSTN telephone numbers. However the TMD may be used to resolve STIs if used by the telephone call receiver. Thus the term TTI may in some cases be synonymous with STI and be dependent on the discussion context.

The present invention will use the term target telephone identifier TTI and its derivatives to broadly cover any data string including but not limited to alphanumeric text strings binary data streams of fixed and or varying bit widths etc. that may be used as an identifier for the target telephone instrument device TTD . Within this context the term alphanumeric text string may include any combination of alpha and or numeric symbols selected from traditional character encoding tables such as ASCII EBCDIC BAUDOUT that are typically associated with 5 8 bit alphabetic numeric character encodings but may also include encoding methodologies such as UNICODE UCS 2 UTF 8 UTF 16 etc. that permit representation of more complex character sets associated with foreign languages that are not necessarily representable using traditional 5 8 bit character encodings.

The present invention may use a wide variety of methodologies to enter data associated with the TTI including but not limited to keyboard keypad entry and or voice recognition techniques. Additionally some preferred embodiments may incorporate telephonetic voice data entry to allow character by character entry of the TTI. Within this context of any of these data entry techniques the use of auto completion matching against previously entered or known TTI entries associated with a local and or remote cache is anticipated within the present invention scope.

The present invention may use a wide variety of methodologies to encode numeric telephone identifiers NTIs . While conventional telephone number strings incorporating conventional formats e.g. 555 123 4567 555 123 4567 555.123.4567 are anticipated the NTI within the context of the present invention may incorporate other features in some circumstances including but not limited to the following 

TTIs within the context of the present invention may incorporate any combination of letters digits and or symbols and may permit consumers to choose imaginative ways to identify themselves e.g. JohnLawyer NYLawyerone Jim53 TallJim . The TTI identifiers are not limited to any symbol length restriction such as is currently present in traditional telephone numbers.

While many preferred invention embodiments may implement call blocking functionality blocking outgoing calls from the STD to the TTD and or blocking incoming calls to the TTD from the STD the invention also anticipates situations where the call blocking incorporates an automatic transfer of the call to voicemail. This voicemail answering system may incorporate TTI indexed messages that are specific to the STD caller or TTD recipient.

While the present invention disclosure depicts a single TMS TMD server database structure the present invention is not limited to this configuration and may in some implementations be applied to scenarios having multiple TMS and or TMD elements. These configurations may provide for replicated TMD information or segmented TMD data depending on application. Multiple TMS servers may also be utilized to improve access time performance to the TMD data relative to a given STD TTD service request.

The general method steps described herein may be modified heavily depending on a number of factors with rearrangement and or addition deletion of steps anticipated by the scope of the present invention. Integration of the described methods and other preferred exemplary embodiment methods in conjunction with a variety of preferred exemplary embodiment systems described herein is anticipated by the overall scope of the present invention.

The present invention may utilize the term computer system computing device CD or its equivalent in describing various control systems used within the present invention. These synonymous terms should be given their widest possible interpretation in this context and are specifically anticipated to include mobile portable computing devices such as handheld computers tablet computers smartphones cellphones laptop computer and the like.

The present invention may permit a wide variety of cross information to be communicated between the STD and the TTD during telephone call initiation and or processing. This may include text messages photographs video clips sound recordings voice recordings etc. Thus cross information exchanges between the STD and TTD should be interpreted broadly within this context.

It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosed and or claimed embodiments. Further features and or variations may be provided in addition to those set forth herein. For example the disclosed embodiments may be directed to various combinations and subcombinations of the disclosed features and or combinations and subcombinations of several further features disclosed below in the detailed description.

An overview of a presently preferred exemplary system embodiment is generally illustrated in wherein the system incorporates a mapping server TMS that indexes an arbitrary user defined target telephone identifier TTI with an associated numeric telephone identification NTI telephone number . The TTI NTI mapping server TMS executes machine instructions on a computer system that are retrieved from a computer readable medium . A relational or hierarchical database TMD of TTI NTI mappings is utilized to allow a given TTI to serve as the lookup index for a resolved NTI telephone number or numbers associated with the TTI.

Within this framework a computer network connects a source telephone device STD typically executing machine instructions retrieved from a computer readable medium and the TMS that enables the STD to initiate requests for TTI NTI translation to the TMS . These TTI requests are then translated by the TMS to a resolved NTI or a tree of potential NTIs and returned to the STD for processing. Once the user has selected the desired TTI NTI mapping from the potential candidates returned by the TMS the STD initiates a telephone call via the public switched telephone network using internal software on the STD . The telephone call is then routed by the PSTN to the target telephone device TTD identified by the NTI. The call is continued and completed using the PSTN .

While the TTD need not be a web enabled smart telephone if it does possess this capability it will typically execute machine instructions read from a computer readable medium and may initiate requests to the TMS prior to or during the call completion to request the source telephone identifier STI of the STD and or its associated NTI. This information as returned by the TMS can be used to maintain a local cache of received caller information that may be used to return calls to the STD at a later time.

The TMD may incorporate additional mapping structures to associate initiated telephone calls from the STD to the TTD such that the internal TTIs associated with the STD and TTD are linked so that a locality of reference intersection of context can be defined between the STD and TTD . This permits subsequent TTI requests by the STD referencing TTDs that are related to the TTD to be positioned at the top of a search list presented to the STD .

It should be noted as detailed elsewhere herein that the STD and TTD represent arbitrary telecommunications devices and need not necessarily be mobile telephones. Land lines tablets and other like telecommunication devices are anticipated as being compatible with this TTI NTI mapping infrastructure.

A method associated with the system depicted in is generally illustrated by the flowchart in and comprises the following steps 

The exemplary system embodiment as generally illustrated in may be embodied in an alternate form as depicted in wherein the STD interfaces with the PSTN and the associated telephone company central office CCO using a transparent TTI interface that provides the PSTN with the TTI data stream identifying the TTD . This TTI is then indexed using the TMS by the telephone company central office CCO using request return communications with the TMS and the corresponding TMD to retrieve the TTI NTI mapping . Once the telephone company has resolved the NTI from the STD supplied TTI the call is routed to the STD . STD caller information may be requested of the STD and the returned TTI NTI information passed along to the TTD for use in a later return call to the STD .

This scenario also permits the CR to connect to connect to the TMD and retrieve CO info such as CO identifier picture logo GPS location GPS location translation etc. Thus information may be bi directionally transferred between the call originator CO and call recipient CR .

An alternate method associated with the alternate system depicted in is generally illustrated by the flowchart in and comprises the following steps 

The present invention anticipates a wide variety of system integration contexts but a preferred exemplary system application context is generally illustrated in wherein the STD and or TTD executes software read from a computer readable medium that may include a core operating system in addition to operating system application programming interface API supporting telephone dialing call processing functions. This API is used as the software application platform for a telephone user interface TUI application that embodies the present invention functionality with respect to interactions with the TTI NTI mapping server TMS and the PSTN.

Loading of the TUI on the STD and or TTD is typically accomplished by communication with the TMS over a computer network using a website interface to access a software application APP database storage APS to retrieve the particular software application components constituting the TUI . Control of this application downloading function within the TMS is typically governed by software executed within the TMS that is retrieved from a computer readable medium . While the TMS is generally illustrated in as the source for the TUI application software one skilled in the art will recognize that other APP servers may be utilized to accomplish this function apart from the TTI NTI mapping function normally performed by the TMS .

It should be noted that the TUI illustrated in is shown as implemented within the context of user application software that is loaded from a remote database but could equally be implemented as integrated telephone functionality within the OS API interface and or the core STD operating system .

The present invention permits an individual TTI subscriber to use web page registration of TTIs and enter a TTI associated NTI to enable defined classes or groups of individuals to make simple telephone calls using TTIs rather than initiating call processing using a traditional NTI.

A more sophisticated application where corporations are able to maintain their entire list of telephones in a universally structured way in directory tree like file folder directory tree on computer under their corporate TTI is also possible. For example suppose that Sony has a TTI called Sony under this TTI they list their entire list of Group Participant s TTIs. Callers will be able to browse search through a company s TTI list to reach a specific person or a department rather than go through the slow and annoying voice menus as currently used.

An originating caller will enter a TTI using QWERTY keys or numeric keypad for forming an alphanumeric TTI just as the text messages are written . When a TTI user dials a TTI the software on caller s telephone first makes a very quick and short connection to the global TTI server either thru Internet or any other network including the network used by the telephone companies to make call. Using the call receiver s TTI as the identifier the software retrieves the telephone number. Based on the comparison of caller s area code city code and country code and call receiver s area code city code and country software on the TMS concatenates appropriate prefixes to form the final dialing number string. Then software on the server sends the NTI to the caller s telephone and then the TTI software on caller s telephone dials the actual telephone number or if the telephone company has direct access to the TMS then the company can directly retrieve the telephone number associated with the name and dial the telephone number on caller s behalf without sending it to the caller s telephone and forcing the software on the caller s telephone to dial the number.

Currently corporations do use telephone numbers and assign it a name e.g. 1800flowers . However these names are tied to fixed telephone numbers i.e. 1800flowers 1 800 356 9377 . If this telephone number changes or if there is a need to add extra digit to the existing telephone number then the name 1800flowers cannot be used to refer to the new number. In this case the assignment of the name to the number is static. However by using the TTI technology no matter how many times the telephone number changes the new number can be assigned to the same TTI without changing the name. According to the teachings of the present invention the TTI mapping assignment is dynamic.

The present invention allows an individual or corporation to maintain their TTIs and assign one or more telephone numbers to their TTIs at will. This approach brings all the people of the world together in one global community. This can be done without obstructing the telephone companies current use of telephone numbers. Telephone companies will continue to use telephone numbers at the telephone exchange as dialing codes. However the public need not be tied to the standards defined by the telephone companies. Initially people will continue to make telephone calls using TTIs and telephone numbers. However the present invention makes it possible for explicit NTI usage to be phased out or to be used as a secondary more primitive method of initiating telephone calls.

The present invention permits the TMS Administrator or the telephone companies to change the actual telephone numbers associated with the TTIs with ease and without the need to bother the subscribers. They can directly make a mass update to the TTI database by computer software and make corrective changes to those telephone numbers that require changes. In other words telephone numbers associated with the TTIs can be changed by the telephone companies in case of area code change city code changes etc. Those TTI users can be informed of this change by software generated email or by text or voice message just as a simple notification rather than a massive public advisory. This does not require change of habit on the public s part. There are no missed calls wrong numbers etc. The public will seamlessly continue to dial the same TTIs which they used to dial before the mass update done by the telephone company and the global TTI server will simply provide the latest telephone number associated with the TTI.

When a TTI is displayed on a TTD the call recipient may assign the STD his her own nickname store this nickname on a TMS account and later use the nickname to dial the STD. When the call is made using the nickname the TTI server uses the nickname from caller s account to lookup the actual TTI then lookup the telephone number and then dial the TTI. For example Mr. John Smith has a TTI is Jsmithlovesfishing. He has distributed his TTI to all his friends and business associates as Jsmithlovesfishing. They dial his TTI as Jsmithlovesfishing. However his son Mark Smith whose TTI is MarquiMark need not dial Jsmithlovesfishing to call his father. Mark Smith can simply assign a nickname called Great Dad to TTI Jsmithlovesfishing under his TTI account MarquiMark. When Mark dials the TTI Great Dad the TTI server first checks his account s nickname section to fetch the TTI associated with Great Dad which is Jsmithlovesfishing then retrieves the telephone number associated with Jsmithlovesfishing. In case if TTI server not finding the nickname then it will assume that Great Dad is a TTI and dial Great Dad as a TTI. This example illustrates the recursive nature of TTI NTI mapping resolution.

Nicknames need not be globally unique as are TTIs. However they must be unique for all the TTIs assigned to a telephone number. Multiple subscribers each with different telephone number can give may provide the same nickname.

For example when calling a doctor the call originator need not dial the TTI provided by the doctor e.g. InternistInPrinceton . The call originator see the doctor as Primary Care Physician . The call originator remembers the doctor as Primary Care Physician . So the call originator has assigned the doctor a nickname called PCP and stored it in the caller s TTI account. When viewing the diary on their TTI account over the Internet it shows both the actual TTI i.e. InternistInPrinceton and the nickname PCP.

A telephone call receiver may assign their own nickname to a TTI either via telephone keypad or via an Internet website interface.

TTI users can turn on Do Not Disturb or Leave Message in his her TTI account. They can set these settings for everyone or for a caller with a specific TTI. When Do Not Disturb check box is on the software simply blocks all or a specific caller say a rude ex boyfriend. Similarly Leave Message could be turned on when the user is in a meeting and does not want to be disturbed. When a TTI of a caller is blocked then all the TTIs assigned to the their telephone number may be configured to be blocked.

Just as the call receiver may block specific callers they can also set different ring tones for different callers and for different TTI dialed by the caller. For example a doctor and lawyer who has two different TTIs for the same number can set one ring tone for those call him on his doctor TTI and a different one for those who call him on the same telephone using a lawyer TTI. The doctor may set a ring tone for family members when they call. So in short call receiver can set the tones depending on both who calls and what TTI they call. If a family member calls using doctor TTI then the ring tone assigned to the family member will ring even though call receiver has assigned a different ring tone to those who call him using the doctor TTI. The present invention anticipates that these caller specific ringtones need not always be strictly a jingle or other prerecorded song but rather can incorporate voice announcements such as Boss is calling or other vocalizations that are generated using a text to speech conversion software.

As generally illustrated in the present invention anticipates the following information will be included in many preferred embodiments 

After entering the TTI and password the user may be presented information as depicted in . Within this page subscribers enter the NTI to be assigned to their TTI. This page generally contains the basic information about the subscriber.

As with other general dialogs depicted herein row entries may be added with the ADD dialog button and removed with the DELETE dialog button. Similar approaches to the Blocked Names dialog may be applied to tabs sections listing of TTIs such as the OGM Ring Tones Group etc. dialogs.

The exemplary dialog screen of also generally illustrates that the menu interface may contain a wide variety of options to activate additional dialogs. Those illustrated include in this example include 

The exemplary dialog depicted in illustrates a methodology by which a STD user may accept requests from TTD users to modify their TTI trees and incorporate the TTI tree information of third parties. This functionality is described in further detail below.

The Group Participation dialog supports incorporation of TTI trees into other TTI trees under control of the TTI tree owner. This functionality may be generally described in three sections of the exemplary dialog illustrated in as described below.

This functionality allows the TTI users to enlist their TTI or link their TTI with other TTIs. For example John Doe having a personal TTI of JDOE may connect with a realtor for ReSel Realtors whose TTI is ReSel having a work TTI at ReSel of ReSelBroker1.

The objective of this grouping functionality is to permit showing the personal TTI JDOE in ReSel s directory tree and allow ReSel to include ReSelBroker1 in JDOE s personal directory tree.

This Request Sent section shows list of TTIs to whom the STD have sent requests authorizations to include a TTI in their TTI directory tree.

For example at work place a person may show their personal TTI along with their work telephone number. For example John Doe may desire to show their personal TTI JDOE along with their work TTI ReSelBroker1. ReSel Realtors cannot just list the TTI JDOE in their TTI directory. They will need John Doe s request authorization. So in the Request Sent section of John Doe s TTI profile John Doe will enter ReSelBroker1 signifying that JDOE is requesting to be listed with ReSelBroker1. John Doe can add a list of all TTIs in this dialog whom they have sent the request or authorized to list their TTI e.g. cubscoutsofIL golfloversofmiami etc. or they may selectively add or delete them see Add or Delete options available in this dialog .

At this time when ReSelBroker1 is Added via this dialog this is only a request authorization. This does not mean that JDOE will automatically appear along with ReSelBroker1 in ReSel s directory tree. For that to occur ReSel Realtors can either accept i.e. include or reject exclude the request authorization as detailed in the Request Received section .

However if John Doe deletes a TTI ReSelBroker1 from the Request Sent section then the ReSelBroker1 will be removed from the Request Sent section and John Doe s TTI JDOE will not be in ReSel Realtors Received Requests Authorizations Request Received section and it will also not appear in the directory tree of ReSelBroker1.

Referencing and the top portion of the dialog when a TTI ReSelBroker1 is entered here program on TMS sends a request on behalf of JDOE to ReSelBroker1 and puts the TTI JDOE in ReSelBroker1 s Request Received section . The software on the TMS will then populate the Request Received section of these people with the TTI JDOE and all the TTIs listed here will see JDOE appear in the Request Received section of their corresponding profile. It should be noted ReSelBroker1 itself will appear under the TTI ReSel creating a hierarchy of TTIs.

If the DELETE option is selected here the TMS deletes TTI ReSelBroker1 from JDOE s Request Sent list.

Software on TMS deletes TTI JDOE from the Request Received section or the Directory Tree section of ReSelBroker1 i.e. TMS software removes JDOE from Requests Received section if JDOE s request was not accepted by ReSelBroker1 and Directory Tree section if ReSelBroker1 had already accepted JDOE s request .

The exemplary dialog includes an ADD option or an empty Request Sent box to allow JDOE to enter new TTIs for adding additional TTIs to this list.

The Request Received section shows a list of TTIs of other people from whom the STD has received request authorization to include their TTI in the current TTI directory tree.

Just as John Doe requested ReSel Realtor to show their personal TTI in the Request Sent section ReSel Realtors may also want John Doe to show their work TTI ReSelBroker1 along with along with their personal TTI JDOE. So just as John Doe had sent them a request authorization now they have sent John Doe a request authorization to show work the TTI ReSelBroker1 along with John Doe s personal TTI. So now in the Request Received section ReSelBroker1 appears waiting to be accepted so that ReSelBroker1 will appear along under the personal TTI JDOE. Just because someone sends a request does not mean that the receiver of the request must associate their personal TTI along with their TTI. User options are provided to include or exclude each name in this waiting list. When the user selects INCLUDE ReSelBroker1 will show in the TTI directory Directory Tree section and if the user selects EXCLUDE ReSelBroker1 will be deleted from the Received Request section and will not be shown in John Doe s TTI directory.

Referencing and the Received Request Section the TTIs of other people on this section may be received by JDOE. JDOE cannot enter TTIs of other people in this section. So unlike Section there is no Add button in this section. TMS software populates this section when someone enters JDOE s name in their SENT TO section .

By selecting the INCLUDE option of this section JDOE can choose to add these names to his own directory tree. If JDOE selects INCLUDE then TMS software removes the name from this section and populates it in the DIRECTORY TREE section .

By selecting EXCLUDE options of this section JDOE can choose to deny the request of the sender. TMS software removes the TTIs from the Received Request section without populating it in the Directory Tree section of JDOE s profile.

This dialog area shows all the TTIs that have been accepted by the INCLUDE option in the Received Request section . These TTIs will be currently shown in the TTI directory tree section . This functionality will only allow the user to delete a TTI but not directly add to it. All the additions to this section will come through the Received Request section as explained above.

The Directory Tree section may also allow the subscriber to prioritize arrange and delete the hierarchy of all the TTIs in a tree org chart format. This section s functionality is similar to a typical file directory tree structure as depicted in a graphical user interface GUI such as MICROSOFT WINDOWS EXPLORER file directory structure. TTIs listed in section generally depict what is available for the CO to dial under the TTI JDOE in this example.

Some of the TTIs appearing in this section may show up in the directory tree form when the CO enters a TTI. This will give the CO options to scroll thru all the TTIs available for him to reach a given CR. However some of TTIs appearing in the hierarchy of this section will NOT show up in the CO STD. These TTIs may be hidden. In order to reach someone thru those hidden TTIs the CO may be required to input the entire TTI path e.g. jdoe jdvacationhome . This display and hidden feature of directory is necessary for big corporations where they want the public to be able to scroll thru the menu of available operators and receptionists but in order to reach a specific manager executive the caller will have to be specific as to who they want to reach. For example ReSel ReSelceo where ReSel is the TTI of ReSel Realtor and ReSelceo is TTI for the CEO. ReSel may not want to publicize the CEO s TTI to everyone. The TTI ReSelceo does not appear on the STD for the ReSel directory tree but it is still available to the CO.

Just like John Doe ReSel Realtors may process the requests authorizations of TTIs received from and sent to different people businesses. This Grouping of TTI functionality allows a very complex extremely powerful and global networking of people interest groups and business all over the world where not just the employee s within a company but also larger groups of people may choose to build a directory tree of their interest groups.

Referencing in the Directory Tree section this section shows all the TTIs which will appear on the CO s screen when they dial JDOE. If JDOE is the only entry here and there are no TTI entries or sub entries here then STD will directly proceed to get NTI and further proceed to initiate the call. However if there are more TTIs listed here in addition to JDOE as shown in the Directory Tree section then STD will display the directory tree and wait for CO to make selection. Only those TTIs from this section will be shown which have been enabled by the SHOW option.

Just as in the Received Request section John Doe cannot add TTIs here. These additions must come thru the Received Request Section .

TMS will always populate at least one TTI as a root TTI in this section i.e. the TTI of the TTI subscriber himself such as JDOE in this example .

Software on TMS or a Web browser may allow the user to manipulate and reorganize the hierarchy in this section in a manner similar to re organizing a directory tree in a MICROSOFT WINDOWS FILE SYSTEM.

The Directory Tree example shown in depicts a minimal profile and may be expanded for large organizations and corporations.

While the present invention may incorporate a wide variety of call interfaces an exemplary embodiment is generally illustrated in wherein the caller Jane Doe selects from one of several options to call the secretary of John Doe . Note that this configuration permits a number of dropdown lists to be associated with the target call receiver and that these lists may be dynamically updated based on the availability of the call recipient and or their telephone.

In addition to the TTI tag that may be associated with one or more NTIs the present invention anticipates that graphical icons including but not limited to photographs company logos and other graphical indicia may be used to identify the TTI graphically. Thus the tree structure in may optionally include a graphical hot spot for selection of a given TTI entry. In some preferred invention embodiments the TTI tree may be entirely described using graphical entries with the TTI textual description embedded within the graphical icon definition. This TTI graphical information may be maintained within the TMD and or the STD TTD infrastructure.

Furthermore it should be noted that any of the TTIs depicted may comprise just a NTI in some circumstances.

As generally indicated in scroll bars may be implemented within any of the dialogs described herein to provide a means of navigating displayed data structures that are larger than the screen display area.

As will be detailed elsewhere herein the present invention may incorporate conditional prioritization of TTI NTI pairings associated with a TTI. For example a TTI might reference John Doe but refer to a list of potential NTIs at which John Doe may be reached. This list may be rearranged or modified augmented reduced based on a string of conditional events known to or provided to the TMS. For example the contact for John Doe may require communication at the OFFICE DESK during morning hours as generally illustrated in but during the afternoon any calls should be routed to the FIELD office as generally depicted in . Note that in either of these circumstances the information below the main John Doe entry may be optionally hidden from view so that the call selection and routing occurs automatically and with no additional input or selection by the originating caller. This feature has significant benefits in reaching personnel who are highly mobile and have a variety of communication methods available to them.

A person who has chosen multiple TTIs for just one STD telephone number can also choose which TTI to use while calling someone. For example a person who is both a doctor and a lawyer who has two different TTIs for the same number can call one client using a doctor s TTI and another person using a lawyer s TTI from the same telephone. This interface is generally illustrated in wherein the example provided indicates a call from Jane Doe to the field office of John Smith and does so with the calling persona of Jane Doe being associated with her business function at FooBar Inc. Note that this masking of STD persona makes it possible for a caller to not only present different telephone personas based on transmitted TTIs to the receiving TTD it also permits persons who work at home to present a professional persona when communicating with business clients. This feature eliminates the need for a single person to carry multiple phones for multiple purposes. With this feature enabled there is no need for a person to carry separate phones for work and personal use.

The present invention anticipates that this feature may permit the identification of the calling persona to have multiple identification fields. These fields may include but are not limited to the following 

When the telephone line is busy or when call is not picked up then current telephone setups and answering machines allow only one Outgoing Message OGM as a generic message to the caller when the telephone is unanswered or as in the case of telephone setups in the corporations it allows the person a second OGM when the he she is on the telephone I am currently on the telephone . However TTI users can setup multiple OGM on the TTI account on the web page each of which can be played specifically when a person with a predetermined TTI calls. For example a TTI user may setup a first OGM when their husband calls a second OGM for the son a third OGM when the boss calls and wants to leave a message and a fourth OGM for the general public.

Incoming messages may be optionally forwarded to email address set on the TTI account as a voice file.

The TMS website maintains a log of STD STI and TTI calls automatically. Thus the next time when a user changes telephone equipment they simply download all or some of the frequently used TTIs from their TTI accounts. TTI users may also upload current dialing diary from their telephones to their TTI account on the TMS.

Software on the TMS or telephone exchange may keep a log of telephone calls. Telephone companies may provide the log of calls along with the telephone invoice. But they give only one log for one telephone number. However the present invention teaches this control is also in the hands of the TTI users and not the telephone company. Since the public will be able to structure multiple TTIs for one telephone number based on their personal needs they will also be able to see the separated call logs under each TTI even though these TTIs belong to the same telephone number.

TTI software may warn the caller if it is about to dial international number. A caller who frequently makes such telephone calls can deactivate the warning.

Under current telephone voice menu systems one company voice menu may say dial 1 for Accounting Department 2 for Sales while other company telephone voice menu may state dial 1 for Sales and 2 for Accounting . Using the TTI NTI mapping as taught by the present invention the originating caller dials only the company s TTI without adding a specific department or a person s name then in additional to voice menus they will be presented the list of departments or employees TTIs on the telephone screen. Instead of waiting for lengthy annoying and complicate voice menus currently in use the telephone interface software installed on these STDs allows the caller to search scroll or highlight the appropriate department business unit employee etc. then make a selection and initiate the telephone call.

The same list of TTIs may be accessed by the public via computers and viewed it in a tree format just as file directories are shown in Windows Explorer . Businesses often have whole list of complex departments in various locations each having multiple operators. Calling these companies to reach a particular department or an operator is often a very frustrating experience. Callers have to patiently listen to complex menus make appropriate selections only to find that the person or the department they are trying to reach is either closed unavailable or it is not the correct department. The use of graphical displays of TTIs in a hierarchical structure within the present invention eliminates this menu complexity and promotes a rapid access method to the communication infrastructure within a company.

Individuals and corporations with TTIs will be able to Sub Assign their work TTIs Fax Names etc. to their main TTI in Group Participation. In turn they can Sub Assign their individual TTIs to their employers TTI Tree. Individuals can list their work TTI under their personal TTI and vice versa.

The availability status of the people in the department is also shown if they have interfaced their TTI account with the scheduling programs such as MICROSOFT OUTLOOK or Lotus Notes. The availability status are further categorized and shown as currently busy on the telephone out of office in meeting do not disturb out for lunch be back in 10 minutes or all the blocked time in the outlook can be shown as unavailable .

When these corporate TTI trees are interfaced with the scheduling software such as MICROSOFT OUTLOOK or LOTUS NOTES then along with the TTIs caller can also see who is in the office which TTI is busy who is in meeting and who has do not disturb flag turned on next to their TTI. This will come handy when someone is trying to call a business where most of the operators are very busy. Instead of constantly listening to annoying message All operators are currently busy just by giving a glance on the screen a caller can see if most of the operators are busy and what would be the wait time.

Callers directly select the party operator they are trying to reach the one who is neither on the telephone or away for lunch or not in the office. By selecting the party caller s telephone can directly dial the appropriate TTI or Cyber Name .

Along with the TTI individuals and corporations can store their pictures logo drawings short movie clip GPS location GPS location translation a message etc. on their TTI account. This logo picture are displayed on the callers screen when they call receivers TTI is dialed by the software. Logos are also displayed when anyone searches for the company s TTI over the Internet.

As more and more companies and businesses register for the TTIs via the TMS they automatically become part of a global telephone directory which can be searched by the public on line.

TTIs such as Police Hospital Emergency may be reserved in some preferred embodiments. When a person dials these numbers then depending upon the local area code the nearest telephone number may be accessed by the system. Department or branches within the police hospitals etc. may be sub assigned to the Police hospital TTIs etc.

When a person is looking for used auto part in local junk yards. He logs into his TTI account on a computer. He browses the TTI website for junk yards in the area. He selects each junk yard on the list and requests a call trigger for selected junk yard. At this time the TTI web site sends the TTI of the selected junk yard to his cellphone via SMS text messaging or similar technology. Upon receiving this message from the web site the TTI software on the telephone equipment recognizes it as a legitimate TTI and initiates the telephone call. In this situation after looking up the TTI on the web site either through a computer or through her mobile telephone the person does not have to punch in the TTI of each junk yard he is trying to reach.

Similarly when Mr. A is searching for TTI of Panasonic s repair department on TTI website. When he finds the department and a specific individual from the telephone list then he need not go to his telephone and punch in the TTI to initiate the call. Instead upon selecting the TTI on the computer when he clicks the call initiate icon next to it the TTI web site sends the telephone number directly to his cellphone via SMS. This will come very handy when someone is shopping and comparing rates.

Those who are not Internet web savvy can continue to use telephone number instead of name. However telephone companies can ask them what name they would prefer for their number and open a TTI account for them for use just in case. At present the telephone companies assign all the telephone owners a telephone number. Similarly the telephone companies can assign TTIs too.

When a TTI subscriber chooses to sync up his MICROSOFT OUTLOOK calendar with TTI then he will need to download a software on his computer which will read his calendar event and update the his profile on TTI website. Thus when another Call Originator CO enters a Call Receiver CR TTI then the TTI software on CO s name will connect to the TTI website and pull out CR s profile as well as the calendar event. If CR is in a meeting then even before dialing the number the TTI software on caller s telephone will display that CR is in a meeting and whether to proceed with the call or not.

A TTI subscriber s TMD profile may also have features such as parental control where parents will be notified for certain restricted numbers. or caller will be allowed to call only those TTIs and telephone numbers which parents have listed in the subscriber s TTI profile.

When a children are given a TTI profile then this name could be used throughout their life permanently. Therefore in case of lost children they can always contact family anytime. Also when the profile is given to law enforcement they can keep permanent tracking on the use of the TTI.

Certain TTIs will be permanently blocked for internal use only and public will not be able to subscribe to them. However they can certainly use them. E.g. Police Hospital Fire. All the language translations of the word of these words TTIs will be blocked e.g. TTI for Police in English Polizia in Italian policie in Czech will all be permanently reserved for Internal Use Only .

There will be special method for these TTIs i.e. when someone dials a one of these TTIs the software on the server will send to the caller s smartphone the multiple telephone numbers of nearest Police Department based on the GPS location of the caller . In these cases system will not compare the caller s own telephone number area code country code to form a complete telephone number to dial. Instead the complete telephone number will be computed based on the GPS location. Also these telephone numbers will be Displayed and need not be hidden on the caller s telephone. So that for some reason if the caller wants to these numbers directly via another Non Smart Telephones then they can do so.

All TTIs may be configured to be case insensitive. E.g. Jim JIM and jim may be considered one and the same TTI.

The present invention anticipates that the TMS may initiate communication between two or more cooperating parties by sending messages to TIDs associated with a plurality of STDs and or TTDs. In this manner it is possible to generate conference calls between a plurality of parties under direction of the TMS. This TMS call initiation system may incorporate interfaces to MICROSOFT OUTLOOK or other calendaring software to determine when to initiate these calls.

This feature may be integrated with desktop laptop tablet computing devices to permit video or other data to be displayed during the telephone conversation. In some circumstances the computer network will have insufficient bandwidth to support full streaming video chat but will have sufficient bandwidth to support auxiliary data traffic to the display to augment a telephone call using a cellular telephone or other mobile communication device.

The present invention anticipates that a TTI may comprise one or more paths that operate similar to a traditional directory tree structure found in many file systems. This tree structure may be navigated using conventional UP BACK and DOWN EXPLORE tree navigation keystrokes mouse clicks within a variety of GUI displays that are well known in the art.

The present invention anticipates that a given TTI may have associated with it a shortcut graphical icon that may be displayed on the STD TTD during call initiation execution completion. In this manner the TMD may serve as a repository of validated icon information associated with a given STD of known characteristics.

For example current telephone caller ID features can be spoofed using technology that sends false caller ID information to the recipient of a telephone call. By acting as a trusted third party intermediary the TMS can generate trusted icons and or other graphical information such as trusted photos company logos receiver defined graphics etc. that are only known to the TMS within the TMD and not generally available to the public. This information can be used to define the user interface on the TTD and thus permit the TTD user to verify the identity of the STD caller.

The present invention anticipates alternate system embodiments that incorporate a methodology for telephone call recipients to reject unwanted calls by logging the call as a blocked call within the TTI NTI mapping database TMD . While this call blocking functionality may have many applications it can effectively be utilized to eliminate robocalls automated sales marketing calls that are generally prohibited by government agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission FTC .

The Federal Trade Commission FTC has challenged innovators to create solutions that will block illegal robocalls. The solutions sought by the FTC should block robocalls on landlines and mobile phones and may operate on a proprietary or non proprietary device or platform. The vast majority of telephone calls that deliver a prerecorded message trying to sell something to the recipient are illegal. As technology has advanced over the years so have the number of illegal robocalls.

Telephone companies typically have no incentive for blocking the robocalls. This is especially true on cellphones as more calls mean more airtime and more revenue for the telephone company. Thus telephone companies have been slow to implement technology that blocks robocalls.

An exemplary call blocking system is generally illustrated in wherein the system is substantially similar to that of with the exception that the TMD is augmented with a TTI NTI call blocking list listing TTIs that are call blocked by the TTD or by government or other similar legally mandated NTI e.g. Fraudsters etc. via control messages sent to the TMS . The embedded TMS software incorporates an additional TTI call blocking screening process that attempts to match a TTI translation request from the STD with the call blocked list provided by the TTD . If a match is not detected the resolved NTI is sent is sent to the STD . Otherwise if the TTI is matched to the call blocked list the TTI is not translated and the call is not completed. Within this context the STD return message may incorporate an error message and the TTD may be notified of the blocked call. In some circumstances the STD may not be notified of the rejected call but rather the call may just fail to be processed or initiated to the TTD .

Variants of this system configuration may also use a variety of other keys to activate the call blocking feature including but not limited to the following 

As indicated in an alternative system implementation of may be implemented with the TMS being integrated within the PSTN. The present invention also anticipates that the call blocking system depicted in can be implemented within the context of the PSTN as a parallel to the system configuration depicted in . The details of this implementation are identical to that presented in with the exception of the placement of the TMS as being PSTN integrated.

A method associated with the system depicted in is generally illustrated by the flowchart in and comprises the following steps 

Within this context a variety of optional activities are anticipated and may include informing the STD and or TTD of the blocked call. Note that blocked calls can be used in some circumstances to block calls while the TTD is determined to be scheduled for a meeting or other blocked activity present in a movie theater as determined by GPS etc. 

While the present invention anticipates that many methodologies may be employed to permit a user to create a TTI NTI mapping entry within the TMD an exemplary system configuration to accomplish this is generally depicted in . Here the system operates using a web based data entry application generally executed on a computing device running software read from a computer readable medium that interfaces with a user interface GUI generally a web browser or other GUI . This GUI may be augmented by data extraction applications that operate on user data to extract TTI NTI information for processing by the web application for storage in the TMD .

The user generally interacts with the GUI to define various TTI NTI associations and associated parameters and conditionals editing this information within this context as necessary. This results in an internal data structure representing TTI branch definition data . Once this process is completed the TTI branch definition data is processed by a TTI validation process that is further detailed in . If the validation process indicates an approved TTI the TTI NTI branch definition data is then stored in the TMD . An approval failure is generally followed by additional user edits within the web application .

Note that the system as illustrated may permit TTI definitions for NTIs not associated with telephones that are Internet enabled. For example it is possible using this system to define TTIs for conventional landline telephone PBXs etc. that are not capable of communicating with the TMS TMD as described herein.

An exemplary TTI validation process associated with this system is generally illustrated in wherein the method generally includes the following steps 

Here it can be seen that the TMS serves as an authentication gateway to ensure that TTI identifiers satisfy a host of constraints to make them unique reliable and secure. One skilled in the art will recognize that the list of validity checks detailed in is only exemplary of other types of validation that may occur during the TTI registration process.

The TTI may incorporate a hierarchical path structure as detailed in . Within this context a specified TTI mapping may incorporate a tree structure and be specified to incorporate any path along that tree structure. As detailed in the path Alpha Beta . . . Gamma Delta would point to the resulting NTI incorporating the telephone numbers 555 555 1111 . . . 555 555 9999. The present invention teaches that partial paths including only a portion of the full path may be used to specify the resulting NTI. For example use of Delta as the partial path would resolve to the first tree element matching that term or the full path Alpha Beta . . . Gamma Delta . Similarly specification of Beta would result in Alpha Beta with the path being truncated at that point indicating no terminal NTI elements but resolving to include the remaining tree elements . . . Gamma Delta as potential paths to follow.

This hierarchy may be used to define geographical or other relationships between various TTI atomic path elements. For example as generally illustrated in a geographic TTI path could be defined for John Doe located in Dallas Tex. to be World NorthAmerica U.S. Texas Dallas JohnDoe which would resolve to two potential TTI paths including Work 555 555 1111 and Home 555 555 9999 . This type of hierarchy can permit localization of individuals businesses etc. to a particular geographic region.

The present invention anticipates that the TTI trees depicted in may incorporate branches that are controlled and managed independently of the main TTI tree. As generally depicted in a TTI branch head at any level can reference one or more branch trees that may be independently maintained and controlled by separate entities such as companies or individuals. Thus changes within the individual TTI branches can be maintained by the individual owners of the branches and automatically updated within the overall TTI root NTI lookup structure.

Within any application interfacing with the TMS there is anticipated to be a mechanism for defining set of search paths associated with list of TTI trees from which a user may set their localized environment for TTI searching. For example as illustrated in a search path might be of the form US Texas Dallas US Texas Houston US Texas NorthTexas which would search these individual search paths to find the TTIs matching data entered in to a user dialog box. This search path methodology may incorporate a wide variety of other types of TTI groupings. For example it is possible to define a search path including the terms LinkedIn NewsGroup or Facebook Friends to incorporate potential telephone number information associated with a LINKEDIN NewsGroup group or to scour for information on your friends within FACEBOOK .

The present invention may in some preferred embodiments implement the use of Access Control Lists ACLs that permit modification of TTI entries to incorporate TTI links provided by parties other than the owner of the TTI hierarchy. In this fashion a TTI hierarchy can be managed by a TTI owner but the TTI owner may permit insertion of TTI information not managed by the TTI owner within the TTI hierarchy.

An example of this is generally illustrated in wherein the OFFICE TTI link and its associated hierarchy is managed and controlled by ACME Company and not JOHN DOE the owner of the TTI tree. The ability to modify the OFFICE link may be in many forms but many preferred forms may use an Access Control List ACL as indicated that associates a username password chain with a given TTI chain element as generally illustrated in . Each username password combination may be associated with an authorized access mode for example R read TTI W write TTI E call TTI D delete TTI . One skilled in the art will recognize that other forms of authorization access may be incorporated in this generalized ACL structure.

As generally depicted in the present invention anticipates that in some preferred embodiments the STD may define under password control an outgoing call blocked list that may be integrated in the STD and or the TMD . This call blocked list permits outgoing calls to be screened such that the outgoing TTI call request is first screened by the blocked call list before being matched against the TTI NTI mappings within the TMD . This feature permits parental or other controls for outgoing calls to limit the scope of calls that may be placed from the STD and may incorporate country area exchange blocking and a variety of phone number masking techniques to limit the scope of calls that may be placed from the STD .

It should be noted that while the system depicted in implements forward calling the system configuration may incorporate forward and or reverse calling methodologies as taught herein with or without the use of call queuing as taught herein.

As generally depicted in the present invention anticipates that in some preferred embodiments the TTD may define under password control an incoming call blocked list that may be integrated in the TTD and or the TMD . This call blocked list permits incoming calls to the TTD to be screened such that the incoming TTI call request is first screened by the blocked call list before being matched against the TTI NTI mappings within the TMD . This feature permits parental or other controls for incoming calls to limit the scope of calls that may be received by the TTD and may incorporate country area exchange blocking and a variety of phone number masking techniques to limit the scope of calls that may be received by the TTD .

In addition to call screening blocking the incoming call blocked list may incorporate a call PRIORITY associated with a given TTI or TTI chain such that as the call is received by the TTD it is automatically prioritized in the TTD call queue based on a queue priority as defined by the TTD within the call blocked list . Thus the TTD may prioritize incoming calls from a given STD TTI based on a fixed priority level or a priority level that varies based on a calculated value such as calendar events and other criterion. In some circumstances the priority level may be set to a value that completely blocks the incoming call as for example a parent who wishes to call block all calls for their daughter after 10 pm at night during school days etc.

It should be noted that while the system depicted in implements forward calling the system configuration may incorporate forward and or reverse calling methodologies as taught herein with or without the use of call queuing as taught herein.

The TTI NTI mappings may be directly populated within a TTI NTI Mapping Database TMD as generally illustrated in or in some preferred embodiments as generally illustrated in this database may be populated automatically by using a web crawler subsystem to scan web pages maintained within an enterprise computing environment . Within this context the TTI NTI Mapping Server TMS has augmented software functionality to operate as a web crawler to scan the Internet for web pages that contain metadata incorporating TTI NTI mappings. As this information is scanned from the web over the Internet and placed in the TTI NTI Mapping Database . One skilled in the art will recognize that a dedicated web crawler server could be used in this scenario and that the TTI NTI Mapping Server TMS could be operated as a separate computer in this configuration.

In this scenario the enterprise environment maintains a web server running web hosting software that services a web page database that could be as simple as a directory of HTML web pages supported by the server . Within these web pages metadata is stored which may or may not be visually depicted on the displayed web page. This metadata can incorporate TTI NTI mapping strings that may be directly populated in the TTI NTI Mapping Database TMD once detected in the metadata . These TTI NTI mapping strings may be configured to directly represent a hierarchical organizational directory structure within the enterprise . In some circumstances the organizational directory structure may be represented by internal documents such as MICROSOFT WORD documents and or MICROSOFT EXCEL spreadsheets or any other query of a database or data file format such as a sequential file incorporating insert update delete of TMD using SQL or any programming language such as C Visual Basic Java etc. . Traditional database update methodologies may also be used such as direct software interfaces using SQL Standard Query Language .

An exemplary TTI NTI directory mapping structure is generally illustrated in and comprises a TTI tree with constituent TTI branches subbranches a given TTI tree may have nested branches and subbranches to any depth and terminal NTI values . This diagram generally illustrates the fact that hierarchical TTI structures taught by the present invention are general tree structures and may be nested to any depth. Also illustrated is the use of NTI sequence modifiers x NNN to indicate selection of an extension once the main number has been dialed to indicate selection of DTMF keypad navigation options to indicate availability via e mail and www to indicate indirection to another web page incorporating TTI NTI metadata .

The TTI NTI Mapping Metadata Structure depicted in may result in a search results screen as generally illustrated in . Note that the telephone numbers have been hidden in this dialog as they are maintained by the TTI NTI database. Options to return to a previous directory level BACK or scroll up down or sideways in a manner similar to a WINDOWS file directory change a current directory entry EDIT and provide more details on the directory entry content DETAILS are also provided in this exemplary user interface.

The TTI NTI Mapping Metadata Structure depicted in can be represented in a wide variety of metadata formats but an exemplary format is generally illustrated in . Here the keywords tag content indicates that the metadata author description tag content is to be interpreted as data for the TTI NTI mapping database. The author tag content defines the top level TTI associated with the currently presented TTI tree which may be a branch or subbranch of some other metadata tree . The description tag content defines the hierarchical tree of TTI NTI maps which may be nested and eventually results in an atomic TTI NTI pairing. One skilled in the art will recognize that there are many possible syntaxes and grammars that may be used to define and interpret these exemplary metadata fields and that the specific grammar depicted here is only exemplary and is subject to wide variation based on application context.

Several metadata examples are provided in . The first example illustrates the use of personal names JohnDoe as the TTI indexing methodology. However the use of email addresses JDoe foobar.com or website addresses www.foobar.com are also anticipated as potential TTI indexing methodologies.

While many different syntaxes grammars may be utilized to implement the inclusion of TTI NTI mappings within website metadata an exemplary Extended Backus Naur Form EBNF grammar is illustrated in . One skilled in the art will recognize that this exemplary grammar can vary widely based on application context.

It is instructive to note that the EBNF provided in incorporates conditional structures that permit activation of a given NTI atom based on some conditional relation that may in some cases be determined by external activity such as availability of a cellular telephone indications from a MICROSOFT OUTLOOK GOOGLE OFFICE schedule that an individual is in a meeting or conditions based on calendar events use e mail after 5 pm only cellphone on weekends only vacation cabin telephone on holidays etc. . These conditional structures may create an intelligent reformation of the user interface displays presented in response to the realtime state of the TTD.

Within various implementations of TTI NTI metadata mapping a number of NTI atom variations are possible. Illustrative of just a few of these possibilities include those detailed in 

While the TTI NTI metadata mapping described above may be implemented using manual entry of TTI NTI data a more preferred methodology for many enterprise implementations is the use of automated metadata creation as generally illustrated in the flowchart of . Here an exemplary automated system is detailed that incorporates methodologies to extract TTI NTI data from enterprise organizational records employee names internal telephone numbers department names product lines etc. and using enterprise email addresses . The general steps to this metadata creation method include 

Note that this methodology anticipates the use of a web crawler to later scan the HTML metadata records and populate one or more global TTI NTI mapping databases. An exemplary web crawler search method is generally illustrated in and discussed in more detail below.

A detail of an exemplary metadata search method is provided in wherein the steps associated with collecting the TTI NTI mapping metadata include the following 

It should be noted that selection of the URL IP address can take several forms from sequentially accessing records in a master Internet domain name server DNS to retrieve pairings of domain name and IP address or by simply generating sequential IP addresses xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and using these to directly access nodes on the Internet for the purposes of collecting metadata.

This methodology may be implemented in a standalone fashion or integrated within conventional web crawler search engine scanning GOOGLE YAHOO etc. to consolidate conventional web searching functions with accumulation of TTI NTI mapping data.

A significant advantage to the use of web based mapping metadata to populate a more globally accessible TTI NTI mapping database is the fact that corporations and other enterprises which maintain localized telecommunications infrastructures can easily update their local information and then have it scraped and integrated into any number of global mapping databases that can then be accessed by a plethora of users on the Internet. Thus the individual enterprise is not responsible for maintenance of any number of TTI NTI mapping databases just for the localized copy that can be scanned by external web crawlers. Within this context search engine companies such as GOOGLE MICROSOFT BING YAHOO etc. can apply their sophisticated web crawling technology to index prioritize and serve the most commonly and closest search results of TTI NTI and the names associated with the TTI NTI.

This capability has significant advantages in dissemination of changes to the enterprise telecommunications infrastructure. As the NTIs within an enterprise may change with time as does their organizational structure the enterprise need only maintain this structure in ONE place and then it can be replicated using web crawlers to outside TTI NTI mapping databases for use by external users. One skilled in the art will recognize that an application to translate internal telephone web addresses within an enterprise into the metadata framework described herein would be application specific to an organization but within the capability of one of ordinary skill in the programming arts.

In some circumstance the present invention may be implemented using an automated methodology to create the TTI to NTI mapping database TMD . As generally illustrated in this can be implemented by the TMS executing a DNS extraction process and a telephone number scraper process . The DNS extraction process interacts with a DNS server over the Internet to gain access to a domain name database that details domain names as textual URL strings. These URLs are then used to access the corresponding websites associated with the URLs. The telephone number scraper process then scans the website for HTML files containing telephone numbers. Telephone numbers found using this process that meet contextual search parameters proximity to address info embedded metadata placement on banner footer of website etc. are then concatenated with the URL found by the DNS extraction process to yield a TTI NTI mapping database TMD entry.

A detail of an exemplary website telephone number search method is provided in wherein the steps associated with collecting the TTI NTI mapping information include the following 

This methodology may be implemented in a standalone fashion or integrated within conventional web crawler search engine scanning GOOGLE YAHOO etc. to consolidate conventional web searching functions with accumulation of TTI NTI mapping data.

In some circumstance the present invention may be implemented using an automated methodology to create the TTI to NTI mapping database TMD extracted from social media websites SMW . As generally illustrated in this can be implemented by the TMS executing a user profile extraction process and a telephone number scraper process . The user profile extraction process interacts with a social media website server SMS over the Internet to gain access to a social media website search database that details domain names and extraction methodologies for extracting information from a SMW. This information is then used to access the corresponding SMW associated with the SMW URLs. The telephone number scraper process then scans the SMW for user profile identifier UPI HTML files containing telephone numbers. Telephone numbers found using this process that meet contextual search parameters proximity to address info embedded metadata placement within specific areas of website etc. are then concatenated with the SMW UID found by the user profile extraction process to yield a TTI NTI mapping database TMD entry.

A detail of an exemplary social media telephone number search method is provided in wherein the steps associated with collecting the TTI NTI mapping information include the following 

This methodology may be implemented in a standalone fashion or integrated within conventional web crawler search engine scanning GOOGLE YAHOO etc. to consolidate conventional web searching functions with accumulation of TTI NTI mapping data. This process is generally applicable to all social media websites such as FACEBOOK MYSPACE LINKEDIN and the like.

The present invention anticipates that in some circumstances the STD and or TTD may cooperate with the TMS to maintain TTI NTI mapping database TMD information locally within the context of the STD TTD environment eliminating the need for TMS access during every telephone call initiated from the STD to the TTD.

An exemplary embodiment of such a system is generally illustrated in where the STD communicates with the TMS and TMD via the computer network . Here the STD maintains a local STD TTI NTI mapping cache which is accessed via a lookup request upon selection of a TID entry by the user. If the local cache lookup response indicates that the TTI has been found it is used to generate the TTI NTI translation and initiate the PSTN telephone call . Otherwise the STD initiates communication with the TMS to request a TTI NTI translation with the TMS response mapping used to initiate the telephone call . Any resulting TTI NTI mapping information received from the TMS is stored within the local STD cache for use later if needed. Note that this system anticipates that update messages from the TMS may be synchronously or asynchronously received by the STD to initiate cache updates when the TTI NTI mapping database TMD is changed.

A detail of an exemplary STD TTI NTI caching method is provided in wherein the steps associated with the method include the following 

This methodology may incorporate additional security password access restrictions as may be required for direct access to the TMS. The ability to locally cache the TTI NTI mappings most commonly used by the STD may in some circumstances result in improved telephone call placement performance. Since the TMS has knowledge of which STDs have requested TTI NTI mapping operations it may maintain a list of STDs that must be updated in response to any changes in the TTI NTI mapping database TMD .

The present invention anticipates that several embodiments of the present invention may be advantageously applied to automatically adjust TTI NTI mappings within the TMD in response to change orders generated by telephone companies telecommunication standards industries or other entities that have operational control over the PSTN. The purpose of this invention embodiment variant is to eliminate the need for customers or other telephone users to modify their telephone address books or other information that would normally incorporate a NTI.

An exemplary system embodying this concept is generally illustrated in wherein the TMS operational software TTI NTI mapping database TMD and related TTI NTI mappings operate as described above. This system is augmented with a TMS editing process that permits a remote telephone company server TCS executing control software read from a computer readable medium to initiate programmed edits to the TMD based on a set of TTI NTI mapping database change orders TCO . The TCOs may take many forms including but not limited to the following 

A detail of an exemplary automated telecom updating method is provided in wherein the steps associated with the method include the following 

This methodology may be implemented in a standalone fashion or integrated within conventional web crawler search engine scanning GOOGLE YAHOO etc. to consolidate conventional web searching functions with accumulation of TTI NTI mapping data.

In certain circumstances the present invention may incorporate reverse callback functionality as generally illustrated in and . In this configuration the responsibility of initiating the telephone call rests with the TTD rather than the STD as generally illustrated in .

As generally illustrated in the STD initiates a telephone call by making a request for TTI NTI lookup to the TMS . The TMS then sends the NTI of the STD to the TTD along with a request to the TTD to initiate a call to the STD . The initiated call is then routed to the STD and the call progresses until call completion .

This reverse callback feature may be advantageously utilized in many circumstances where the cost of call initiation completion is lower when initiated from the TTD rather than the STD . The present invention anticipates that in some preferred embodiments the TMS may incorporate cost analysis software to determine the optimal cost of call completion and automatically select between call originator CO STD and call receiver CR TTD origination of the telephone call.

This technique that permits the TTD to initiate the return call to the STD rather than the STD initiating the telephone call may have advantage in situations where the TTD doesn t want the STD to have knowledge of their true NTI. For example a person in witness protection might want the ability to be contacted but without any ability for the call originator to identify their telephone number or location. This might permit for example a celebrity to create a temporary TTI and permit access to their phone for a set period of time but not permit callers access to their real NTI that they use on a daily basis. Other applications to secure communications are anticipated using this reverse callback technology.

A detail of an exemplary reverse callback method is provided in wherein the steps associated with the method include the following 

It should be noted that TTD reverse callback in this context may be used by the TMS to force the TTD to dial more than one STD to initiate conference calls and the like.

The reverse callback methodology depicted in may also be used to implement collect calls in which the call receiver is prompted by the TMS to initiate the call from the TTD to the STD and thus make the TTD responsible for the calling charges. This is similar to telephone company collect calling but in this situation the telephone company is not involved in the transaction. Normally the STD is the CO and the TTD is the CR. But this role is reversed in this collect calling scenario where the TTD is the CO initiating the call and the STD is a call receiver CR who invites requests the TTD to initiate a call. Both STD and TTD device user interface displays may provide options to send and receive the request. The may be implemented by having a COLLECT CALL ACCEPT CALL menu option on the TUI display. When the STD user selects this option then the functionality shown in is initiated to make the collect call and when such a call is indicated on the TTD the TTD user may either select the COLLECT CALL ACCEPT CALL option or CANCEL to reject the collect call.

One skilled in the art will recognize that the method depicted in may be used in conjunction with the method in to provide for a telecommunications addressing method that selects between forward dialing STD to TTD and reverse dialing TTD to STD based on a goal of minimizing expected telephone call costs associated with the selected call completion technique. This method as depicted in generally comprises the following steps 

It should be noted that this optimized calling procedure may permit multiple STDs to communicate with multiple TTDs in conference calls and the like as was previously discussed in the call forward and call reverse cases discussed previously.

In any of the scenarios in which the present invention may be implemented the system method may incorporate methodologies to support queued addressing of the TTD. In this manner a TTD may manage a queue of incoming calls from various STDs and prioritize the order of the communications that occurs between the TTD and the STDs. Incoming calls from various STDs may be given priorities by the TTD based on TTIs and or NTIs associated with the incoming calls. Furthermore the STDs may be notified by the TMS of their priority queue index number of higher priority calls and estimated wait time for connection to the TTD.

An exemplary system embodiment of this as applied to forward call processing is generally illustrated in which generally parallels a corresponding parallel to the reverse callback system in is generally provided in . Here the TTD incorporates a call queue that is maintained to order incoming call requests from the TMS . The TTD prioritizes the incoming call request and returns the STD queue priority to the TMS . The TMS then returns the NTI along with this information to the STD and coordinates call initiation when the STD has been dequeued made active by the TTD . Information regarding the call queue wait time and other information regarding the status of the TTD may be communicated to the STD to permit optimum allocation of time and resources on the STD during the pendency of the telephone call request to the TTD . A similar system scenario is depicted in with the exception that the call initiation is done by the TTD rather than the STD .

Note that in both scenarios depicted in and the call between the STD to TTD or TTD to STD is not necessarily initiated until the STD request for communication has been dequeued for active service by the TTD . This means that there is no need to add to telephone congestion within the PSTN during the wait time for communications initiation. This can greatly reduce the susceptibility of the PSTN to overload failures during peak demand events natural disasters etc. and provide an orderly methodology of processing incoming calls to the TTD during periods of impulse demand.

These systems may as described herein also be integrated with calendaring software on the TTD and or STD to schedule a time for service of the STD initiated call by the TTD. Thus one potential response for the STD call initiation to the TTD is for the TTD and or STD to negotiate a time in the future to initiate the actual telephone call if at present the parties cannot agree on communicating.

A detail of an exemplary queued telecommunication addressing method is provided in wherein the steps associated with the method include the following 

One skilled in the art will recognize that information in the TMD relating to the TTIs of the STD and or TTD may be used within this process to prioritize the call within the TTD call processing queue. This information may for example be used to raise the priority of call processing for some incoming calls dynamically based on information held maintained by the TMD. This might have application in situations where calls are escalated within the technical support centers operated within the context of TTD call centers.

As mentioned previously this method may incorporate calendaring functions to schedule calls between the STD and TTD based on mutually agreeable times defined either by the users or automatically determined by the TMS after scanning calendar information provided by the STD and TTD.

As generally depicted in some preferred invention embodiments may utilize an incoming call queue prioritization user interface that permits TTD incoming calls to be displayed for inspection and review. This user interface may have many forms but in some preferred embodiments may incorporate a list of TTIs that are queued for communication with the TTD along with their TTI NTI information processing priority hold time etc. This information may be updated by the TTD user and used to select a given incoming STD call for processing immediately or optionally scheduled for processing later using a calendaring function. The calendaring function may operate to coordinate calendars on the STD and TTD to accommodate a mutually agreeable time it may select from meeting times proposed by the STD or it may select time slots available on the TTD and send this information back to the STD for confirmation of a fixed call initiation time.

This incoming call queue display function is a significant improvement over conventional call waiting technology implemented in current telephones for several reasons including but not limited to 

As generally depicted in some preferred invention embodiments may utilize an outgoing call queue status user interface that permits STD outgoing call status to be displayed. This user interface may have many forms but in some preferred embodiments may incorporate a list of TTIs that are queued for communication with the STD along with their TTI NTI information current queue priority hold time expected call initiation time etc.

This status display may permit the STD to leave a voicemail message in addition to their TTI NTI information as well as opt for alternate call processing by the TTD escalated call processing to the next administrative level within the TTI hierarchy . As with the TTD display this status display may permit a scheduled call initiation time to be determined by the STD as a request for STD to TTD communication to occur at a specific time or range of times in the future.

As generally illustrated in the present invention anticipates that the TMS may interface with a computing device desktop laptop tablet mobile device STD TTD etc. that incorporates some form of calendaring software . This TMS TTI Application Software I F interfaces with the calendaring software in realtime and reads status information regarding meetings out of office busy etc. on user schedules and updates TTI calendaring profiles within the TMD .

An exemplary user interface for the TTI application software is depicted in . As with call blocking and call restriction parental control functionality the TMS may check the call schedule before routing calls to Dr. John Howard . This check is generally performed for all call recipients. As depicted entries on this user interface page can be made directly by the account holder after logging in by using add delete options options buttons on the page or entries could be added deleted by remote software described in . One skilled in the art will recognize that this user interface could be integrated within application calendaring software rather than implemented as a separate application . The default option for call receivers is that they are available and will receive calls unless otherwise restricted or blocked.

Note that call forwarding in this context may be used to dynamically forward calls based on TTI. In the example depicted in STDs attempting to contact the TTI DRJH will be redirected to the TTI JHWKNDHM Dr. John Howard s weekend home during the period of the specified vacation. This methodology of dynamically redirecting calls can be used to time screen calls and or ensure that important calls are properly redirected to a TTD that may be accessed by the call receiver.

In some circumstances the present invention may be integrated as a plug in or add on to existing software within a computing device as generally illustrated in . Here a computing device desktop laptop tablet mobile device STD TTD etc. may incorporate host software that may comprise a web browser or other host software that has knowledge of TTI NTI data associated with the STD owner. This host software may be augmented with a plug in add on that has knowledge of the TTI and or password associated with the STD and may be used to interface the computing device to the TMS for the purposes of performing TTI NTI translations using the TMD .

The TMS receives the STD TTI and or password from the STD along with the TTI of the selected call recipient and sends this information to the TMS for translation against the TMD . Scheduling software within the TMS then directs call initiation between the STD and TTD if no scheduling conflict exists and the STD call processing is initiated.

This scenario illustrates that existing computing platforms having a wide variety of host applications can be augmented with TTI application software that can interface with the TMS and affect operation of the invention in a wide variety of application contexts.

The TMS in processing telephone calls between the STD and TTD may in some embodiments implement parental controls call restrictions functionality in which outgoing and or incoming calls associated with the STD and or TTD may be restricted to particular TTIs or TTI trees . An exemplary user interface dialog implementing this functionality is generally depicted in wherein outgoing calls may be blocked within a dialog definition as well as incoming calls may be blocked within a corresponding dialog definition . Entries may be added or removed from these restriction lists as necessary. This exemplary dialog permits specification of the call restrictions based on TTI and or NTI as desired. Note that the present invention anticipates that parental controls may permit only specific outgoing calls and or specific incoming calls. Other variations of this call permission blocking methodology may permit TTI trees of outgoing calls or TTI trees of incoming calls or the selection of TTI trees that may be specifically blocked.

Once the call restriction list is defined as indicated in this information is stored in the TMD and used by the TMS to determine if a given telephone call is to be processed completed.

The above described parental control call restriction system may operate in conjunction with a corresponding method as depicted in comprising the following steps 

As can be seen from this general procedure parental controls may be implemented to allow only specific outgoing calls from the STD telephone and or allow only specific incoming calls to the STD telephone. This general method summary may be augmented by the various elements described herein to produce a wide variety of invention embodiments consistent with this overall design description.

The present invention anticipates that in some preferred embodiments the location of one or more of the TIDs associated with a telephone call may be displayed on other TIDs associated with the telephone call. For example current mobile phones display the STD s phone number along with their phone location on the TTD s display. This location is based on where the STD phone number was registered with the telephone companies or the STD person s address registered with the phone company. This is often misleading because the STD s actual physical location at the time of placing call could be anywhere in the world. For example while the 732 area code is associated with central New Jersey a person who has a 732 area code phone number would show up as Somerset N.J. on the TTD s phone.

The present invention anticipates that GPS information associated with a TID may be used to provide other persons associated with the telephone call with information regarding the location of the other telephone call participants. The present invention anticipates that the STD will communicate their actual physical location to the TMS at the time the telephone call is initiated. This information about STD will be sent to the TTD along with other information such as the STD TTI a picture logo associated with the STD etc. Similarly the TTD may also communicate it s actual physical location to the TMS and the TMS may provide this information to the STD. In this manner both the STD and TTD will know each other actual physical location at the time of the telephone call.

This feature is extremely useful for parents who would want to keep track of where their children are located when they call them. This feature would also allow companies to keep physical track of their employees who travel as part of their work duties e.g. salesmen delivery men drivers etc. .

It is anticipated that in many preferred invention embodiments the TMS will contain a STD TTD user profile allowing the call location information to be blocked if this feature is disabled by the STD TTD user.

An exemplary system embodiment of the present invention implementing call location identification is generally illustrated in . Here the call processing generally mimics other system embodiments as depicted in and elsewhere herein . However in this preferred embodiment the STD transmits its GPS location to the TMS which then translates this information to a STD GPS text string via lookup in the TMD or some other database and transmits this STD GPS text string to the TTD for display. Similarly the TTD transmits its GPS location to the TMS which then translates this information to a TTD GPS text string via lookup in the TMD or some other database and transmits this TTD GPS text string to the STD for display.

Within this context the database lookup may incorporate a variety of GPS text mapping strings that are user defined or defined in terms of known geographical landmarks e.g. near Statue of Liberty NYC . Within this context the TMD may incorporate flags to indicate LOCATION BLOCKED for either the STD and or TTD to disable this call location identification feature. This GPS location blocking feature may also be in some instances enabled in the application software running on the STD or the TTD .

The present invention preferred exemplary call location identification method embodiment anticipates a wide variety of variations in the basic theme of implementation but can be generalized as depicted in as a telecommunications addressing method the method operating in conjunction with a telecommunications addressing system the system comprising 

This general method summary may be augmented by the various elements described herein to produce a wide variety of invention embodiments consistent with this overall design description.

An exemplary call location identification dialog screen is generally illustrated in . Here it can be seen that the caller originator CO TTI is indicated PSMT as well as the translated GPS location text string information 455 5th Avenue New York N.Y. in addition to a cross referenced user defined label associated with the GPS text string HOME . This ability to user define certain GPS locations with a variety of additional text identifiers is useful in many circumstances where the call receiver is unfamiliar with the specific GPS location identifiers and the caller wishes to impart additional information in the GPS text string display.

Note that while illustrates a typical TTD call receiver CR display a corresponding display may be associated with the STD call originator CO . With appropriate access controls contained in the TMD the TMS may manage which TIDs may receive GPS information depending on user access controls defined within the TMD.

The TMD may also incorporate distance modifiers defined by a given TID that may be associated with a given user defined GPS text strings. For example near may be associated with a distance of 100 yards making the display read near HOME if the TID was within this range but not precisely identified with the GPS location associated with HOME. The present invention anticipates that polygonal regions may be associated with these distance modifiers to define spatial regions that can be associated with a given GPS text string. For example a polygonal region may be associated with a park or other recreational facility and the resulting GPS text string might read within PARK to indicate this location state.

It should be note that the various STD TTD telephone user interface TUI can take many forms and incorporate many features. Exemplary TUI screens depicted in may also incorporate additional features as depicted in including but not limited to MUTE SPEAKER PHONE CONFERENCE CALL KEYPAD KEYBOARD and CALL RECORDING functions.

As generally illustrated in the present invention may also be implemented in a manner supporting reverse TTI lookup. In this configuration a STD may initiate a telephone call to a TTD using a conventional numeric telephone identifier NTI telephone number via a telephone call TTD NTI request to the TMS . This TTD NTI request is then used in a reverse lookup fashion within the TMD to determine a TTI tree map associated with the TTD NTI. This resolved TTD TTI is then returned to the STD to allow review of the various calling options possible that are associated with the TTD NTI originally submitted by the STD .

This has many useful applications in situations where a business or company has a main branch telephone number that may be widely distributed and published but also hundreds or thousands of telephone extensions associated with this main telephone number. By allowing the reverse lookup procedure the TMS allows the STD to inspect which of the various telephone extensions or other company branches are a best fit for the target of the telephone call. Once this returned TTD TTI list is inspected and a target TTI selected within this TTD TTI tree the telephone call can be completed using the other techniques taught by the present invention and discussed herein. Of significance to the TTD in this scenario is the possibility of reducing the number of telephone operators necessary to handle a large volume of incoming calls as the call routing in this scenario is handled automatically by the TMS in conjunction with the TMD .

A similar scenario may be utilized from the TTD perspective in which the TTD may receive a call having a particular STD CALLER ID telephone number. This STD NTI may be sent via a request to the TMS and a reverse lookup performed in order to obtain a returned TTI of the STD NTI . This allows the TTD to populate local information regarding remote callers from a trusted database the TMD without the TTD having any knowledge of the TTI NTI reverse mapping data or the capability of performing a reverse lookup of the TMD using information local to the TTD .

As generally illustrated in a preferred exemplary method embodiment implementing reverse TTD NTI lookup where the STD provides the NTI for reverse lookup comprises the following steps 

This technique also permits the STD to punch down into TTI trees associated with businesses and other entities in order to directly select the target telephone identifier TTI associated with the intended target of the telephone call thus eliminating the need for operators and other intervening parties during the telephone connection. This general method summary may be augmented by the various elements described herein to produce a wide variety of invention embodiments consistent with this overall design description.

As generally illustrated in a preferred exemplary method embodiment implementing reverse STD NTI lookup where the TTD provides the NTI for reverse lookup using CALLER ID data comprises the following steps 

This technique allows the TMS to serve as a gateway screening function for incoming calls to the TTD by displaying information associated with the STD that allows the TTD user to prioritize and or redirect the action to be associated with the STD call originator. This information is far more descriptive than that possible with conventional CALLER ID because in many cases only the telephone number is available with CALLER ID and as such other information associated with the STD caller is not available to the TDD user when using CALLER ID alone. This general method summary may be augmented by the various elements described herein to produce a wide variety of invention embodiments consistent with this overall design description.

The present invention anticipates that since the identity of the incoming caller can be known with some certainty by virtue of information obtained by the TTI NTI translation and information contained within the TMD as translated by the TMS it is possible for calls that are processed by voicemail or other automated greetings to be tailored to individual STDs and their associated TTIs.

This invention embodiment variation is depicted in where the STD initiates a request for telephone communication to the TTD using an associated TTI. Assuming that the call cannot be processed either because the TTD is unavailable or has blocked voicemailed the call the TMS may opt to utilize TTI NTI outgoing message OGM data within the TMD that is provided by the TTD and which may be specifically indexed to the STD to return an OGM to the STD . For example the STD TTI John Doe may be associated with an outgoing message stating Hello John Sorry I can t speak with you now but feel free to come by the office if you have time today. This OGM information may incorporate voice text data images video and the like to provide a full function multimedia feedback to the STD in response to a call that cannot be completed.

The call request to the TTD issued by the TMS may also be responded to by the TTD with a local OGM or TMD OGM index that is linked to OGM data stored in the TMD . Thus the present invention anticipates that OGM information may be stored either locally within the TTD or within the TMD or other ancillary database . The present invention also anticipates that OGM data may be resident on the Internet and referenced with hyperlinks or other like data references.

The present invention anticipates that the TTD may incorporate script substitutions within the OGM data stream to permit insertion of STD TTD TTI specific information or other information gathered from calendaring or other office productivity software. For example the OGM voice stream may be formed as I am sorry but I can t come to the phone right now. Please leave a message. Which would vocally substitute the STD caller s name for the token. Similarly other tokens including GPS location information I m currently at our field office scheduling conflicts I m in a scheduled meeting right now may also be automatically inserted into the returned OGM. Thus the OGM data stream is anticipated to incorporate a wide variety of state and context information in an attempt to formulate the OGM in an ergonomic and pleasant form for the STD call originator.

As generally illustrated in a preferred exemplary method embodiment implementing outgoing message OGM processing comprises the following steps 

This technique may also be modified slightly to permit ringtones unique to a given STD TTI to be issued to the TTD prior to actually connecting the STD TTD via a telephone call. This may permit the TTD sufficient time to STALL DECLINE the STD telephone connection. Note that step 7 in this method may incorporate default OGMs for voicemail and other user defined default call uncompleted information to be sent to the STD. This general method summary may be augmented by the various elements described herein to produce a wide variety of invention embodiments consistent with this overall design description.

An exemplary user interface dialog supporting OGM functionality is generally illustrated in . Here it can be seen that OGMs may be associated with individual TTIs or may be generalized to a standardized OGM for TTIs that do not match a specific pattern. Support for matching OGMs to TTI trees or branches is also anticipated as supported within this context.

Note that within some implementation of the incoming call queueing capability described herein there may be situations in which the incoming call is queued but not sent to voicemail. In these situations there may be a an introductory message that is conveyed to the STD much like a voicemail message but this message would provide additional information call queue time other options etc. . The difference between this and a normal telephone call sent to a call center would be that the telephone call would not yet be initiated between the STD and TTD but rather these messages would be delivered digitally or stored on the STD and thus bypass the normal PSTN infrastructure.

Note that this dialog may be utilized with slight modification to support individual RINGTONES that are associated with individual TTIs or TTI trees branches . While this dialog is not illustrated one skilled in the art would easily be able to duplicate modify the OGM dialog to implement this functionality.

As generally illustrated in the present invention may utilize multiple TTI NTI mapping servers in conjunction with one or more TMD data arrays to implement the functionality described herein on a national continental and or worldwide basis.

Similarly as depicted in the present invention anticipates that one or more TMS systems may have associated a number of TMD data stores that may be used to index individual TTI trees in support of TTI mapping on a national continental and or worldwide basis.

These multiplicative TMS TMD systems may operate in a coordinated fashion to ensure that TTI data is both secure and reliably accessed as well as providing the necessary bandwidth and data coherency to support operation of the telecommunications addressing system method on an enterprise worldwide basis. This architecture also permits various telecommunication providers telephone companies to individually support TTI NTI mapping functions for their customers and yet cooperate with other telecommunication providers who also support this functionality within their telecommunications networks.

The present invention preferred exemplary system embodiment anticipates a wide variety of variations in the basic theme of construction but can be generalized as a telecommunications addressing system comprising

In various alternate embodiments the present invention may be implemented as a computer program product for use with a computerized computing system. Those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that programs defining the functions defined by the present invention can be written in any appropriate programming language and delivered to a computer in many forms including but not limited to a information permanently stored on non writeable storage media e.g. read only memory devices such as ROMs or CD ROM disks b information alterably stored on writeable storage media e.g. floppy disks and hard drives and or c information conveyed to a computer through communication media such as a local area network a telephone network or a public network such as the Internet.

No. 09 211 928 the present invention scope is limited to computer readable media wherein the media is both tangible and non transitory.

A telecommunications addressing system method allowing selection of a telephone instrument device TID using arbitrary identifiers has been disclosed. The system method allows a source TID STD to select a target TID TTD by the use of a Target Telephone Identifier TTI data string rather than a traditional numeric telephone identification NTI . This TTI is then indexed within a TTI NTI mapping server TMS that functions as a hierarchical and or relational repository of TTI NTI mappings. STD TTD communication is established by first performing a lookup of the STD selected TTI within the TMS to identify the NTI of the TTD. Once the NTI of the STD has been identified by the TMS communication between the STD and TTD is established using the NTI via the normal public switched telephone network PSTN . TMS TTI lookup may be performed via STD TID web application and or via PSTN infrastructure interface.
