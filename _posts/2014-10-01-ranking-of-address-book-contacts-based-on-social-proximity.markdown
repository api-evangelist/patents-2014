This application is a continuation under 35 U.S.C. 120 of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 972 279 filed 17 Dec. 2010 which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present disclosure relates generally to a social network service and more particularly to ranking a user s address book contacts based on social graph information and observed interaction between the user and the address book contacts.

A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. The social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include a user s demographic information communication channel information and personal interest. The social networking system may also create and store a record of a user s relationship with other users in the social networking system e.g. social graph as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing or instant messaging to facilitate social interaction between users in the social networking system. For example a user of a social networking website can access an address book stored in the social networking website look up a contact in the address book and connect with the contact through email.

Particular embodiments relate to adjusting the displayed location or order of contacts in an address book based on social graph and communication history information. These and other features aspects and advantages of the disclosure are described in more detail below in the detailed description and in conjunction with the following figures.

The invention is now described in detail with reference to a few embodiments thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced without some or all of these specific details. In other instances well known process steps and or structures have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure. In addition while the disclosure is described in conjunction with the particular embodiments it should be understood that this description is not intended to limit the disclosure to the described embodiments. To the contrary the description is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.

A social networking system such as a social networking website enables its users to interact with it and with each other through the system. Typically to become a registered user of a social networking system an entity either human or non human registers for an account with the social networking system. Thereafter the registered user may log into the social networking system via an account by providing for example a correct login ID or username and password. As used herein a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over such a social network environment.

When a user registers for an account with a social networking system the social networking system may create and store a record often referred to as a user profile in connection with the user. The user profile may include information provided by the user and information gathered by various systems including the social networking system relating to activities or actions of the user. For example the user may provide his name contact information birth date gender marital status family status employment education background preferences interests and other demographical information to be included in his user profile. The user may identify other users of the social networking system that the user considers to be his friends. A list of the user s friends or first degree contacts may be included in the user s profile. Connections in social networking systems may be in both directions or may be in just one direction. For example if Bob and Joe are both users and connect with each another Bob and Joe are each connections of the other. If on the other hand Bob wishes to connect to Sam to view Sam s posted content items but Sam does not choose to connect to Bob a one way connection may be formed where Sam is Bob s connection but Bob is not Sam s connection. Some embodiments of a social networking system allow the connection to be indirect via one or more levels of connections e.g. friends of friends . Connections may be added explicitly by a user for example the user selecting a particular other user to be a friend or automatically created by the social networking system based on common characteristics of the users e.g. users who are alumni of the same educational institution . The user may identify or bookmark websites or web pages he visits frequently and these websites or web pages may be included in the user s profile.

The user may provide information relating to various aspects of the user such as contact information and interests at the time the user registers for an account or at a later time. The user may also update his or her profile information at any time. For example when the user moves or changes a phone number he may update his contact information. Additionally the user s interests may change as time passes and the user may update his interests in his profile from time to time. A user s activities on the social networking system such as frequency of accessing particular information on the system may also provide information that may be included in the user s profile. Again such information may be updated from time to time to reflect the user s most recent activities. Still further other users or so called friends or contacts of the user may also perform activities that affect or cause updates to a user s profile. For example a contact may add the user as a friend or remove the user as a friend . A contact may also write messages to the user s profile pages typically known as wall posts.

A social network system may maintain social graph information which can be generally defined by the relationships among groups of individuals and may include relationships ranging from casual acquaintances to close familial bonds. A social network may be represented using a graph structure. Each node of the graph corresponds to a member of the social network. Edges connecting two nodes represent a relationship between two users. In addition the degree of separation between any two nodes is defined as the minimum number of hops required to traverse the graph from one node to the other. A degree of separation between two users can be considered a measure of relatedness between the two users represented by the nodes in the graph.

A user may or may not wish to share his information with other users or third party applications or a user may wish to share his information only with specific users or third party applications. A user may control whether his information is shared with other users or third party applications through privacy settings associated with his user profile. For example a user may select a privacy setting for each user datum associated with the user. The privacy setting defines or identifies the set of entities e.g. other users connections of the user friends of friends or third party application that may have access to the user datum. The privacy setting may be specified on various levels of granularity such as by specifying particular entities in the social network e.g. other users predefined groups of the user s connections a particular type of connections all of the user s connections all first degree connections of the user s connections the entire social network or even the entire Internet e.g. to make the posted content item index able and searchable on the Internet . A user may choose a default privacy setting for all user data that is to be posted. Additionally a user may specifically exclude certain entities from viewing a user datum or a particular type of user data.

In addition to user profile information the social networking system may track or maintain other information on or outside the social networking system about the user. For example a geo social networking system is a social networking system hosts one or more location based services that record the user s location. For example users may access the geo social networking system using a special purpose client application hosted by a mobile device of the user. The client application may automatically access Global Positioning System GPS or other geo location functions supported by the mobile device and report the user s current location to the geo social networking system. In addition the client application may support geo social networking functionality that allows users to check in at various locations and communicate this location to other users. For example social network system may post information describing a user s check in to the user s profile page which may cause the information to be included in newsfeeds of other users of the social networking system. In other implementations the social networking system may add the information to such news feeds without posting it to a user profile page. The user may also add delete or update events that the user is associated with. For example a user may update a social event associated with a time and date that the user is planning to attend or make comments in his wall posts about a past event he attended.

Additionally social networking system may provide various communication channels for users to interact with each other. Thus users of a social networking system may interact with each other by sending and receiving content items of various types of media through the communication channels. In particular embodiments communication channels may include but are not limited to email instant messaging IM text voice or video chat and wall posts. A user of the social networking system may also interact through various communication channels outside the social networking system with another person a user or non user of the social networking system . Examples of those communication channels are phone call though public switched telephone network PSTN or the Internet e.g. VOIP or voice over internet protocol text voice or video chat SMS short message service text messaging instant messaging and email. To keep track of communication channel information a user of the social networking system may keep one or more address books. An address book may contain one or more contacts e.g. a person or a business identify and for each contact communication channel information for the contact e.g. a phone number a user ID for an IM service an email address a user ID for a social networking system home address etc. . A user of the social networking system may keep the one or more address books inside or outside the social networking system. For example the social networking system may maintain an address book for a user and the user can access the address book though the social networking system s web site or through a client application hosted by a client device . For example a user may keep an address book in a client application hosted by the user s personal computer e.g. Microsoft Outlook or keep an address book in a native address book application supported by the user s mobile phone. For example a user may keep an address book hosted over the Internet by a remote server i.e. the address book is hosted in the cloud and access the address book via a web browser on a client device . The social networking system and the client device may also include functionality that allows synchronization of address book contact information. For example a user may keep an address book in a client application hosted by the user s personal computer e.g. Microsoft Outlook or keep an address book in a native address book application supported by the user s mobile phone. For example a user may keep an address book hosted over the Internet by a remote server i.e. the address book is hosted in the cloud and access the address book via a web browser on a client device . In other implementations an address book database may be synchronized between the client device and the social network system.

In particular embodiments user profile database may store communication channel information and an address book of a user. The address book in one implementation may be a superset or a subset of the users of the social networking system that a user has established a friend or contact relationship. A user of client device may access this address book information using a special purpose or general purpose client application to view contact information. In particular embodiments the address book may contain one or more contacts e.g. a person or an business entity and communication channel information for each contact e.g. a phone number a user ID for an IM service an email address a user ID for a social networking system web addresss home address etc. . In particular embodiments a user may access the address book look up and connect to a contact through a communication channel. Ordinarily when a person looks up an address book the address book such as a native address book on a mobile phone often lists contacts by names alphabetically but the contacts listed first may not be the most relevant. For example when John looks up the address book in his mobile phone his college friend Andrew Adams may always come up first even though John has not contacted Andrew Adams for 6 months. In addition when a user selects another segment of an address book such as contacts with last names starting with D the same situation may occur that is a less relevant contact may be listed first simply because of the alphabetical sorting utilized by most address book applications. Particular embodiments below describe methods in improving listing by an address book by ranking contacts in the address book based on social proximity.

In particular embodiments the contact listing process may obtain social graph information for each contact in the contacts list . For example the contact listing process may access user profile database and determine a degree of separation in the social graph from the requesting user for each contact in the contacts list. In particular embodiments the contact listing process may assign a coefficient for each degree of separation. For example the contact listing process can assign a degree of separation coefficient of 1.0 for one degree of separation i.e. a contact is the requesting user s friend a coefficient of 0.5 for two degrees of separation i.e. a contact is the requesting user s friend s friend a coefficient of 0.33 for three degrees of separation etc. Other degree of separation coefficient values can be assigned for various degrees of separation. For example a coefficient of 0.5 can be assigned to contacts that are one degree separated from the requesting user while a coefficient of 0.33 can be assigned to contacts that are two degrees separated. In particular embodiments the contact listing process may assign a default degree of separation coefficient for a contact who is not part of the social network. For example the contact listing process can assign a degree of separation coefficient of 0.2 for a contact who is not part of the social networking system. Still further these coefficients can be adjusted or modified based on other attributes such as an affinity score between the requesting user and a contact. In one implementation an affinity score can be based the communication frequency between users and include on one or more of the following attributes 1 the number of days the users have communicated with each other over a given period of time 2 the number of comments made to wall posts of either user 3 the number of times each user has viewed the user profile of the other user 4 the number of pokes between users 5 the number of messages between the users 6 the number of wall posts between the users 7 the number of comments to wall posts shared between the users 8 the number of likes the users have in common 9 the number of photographs in which both users have been tagged and 9 the number of photos and or albums of one user the other user has viewed. A system for measuring user affinity is described more generally in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed on Aug. 11 2006 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

The contact listing process may also consider additional relationship attributes either to adjust an initial degree of separation coefficient score that is based on degrees of separation or to compute an additional affiliation or relationship coefficient score. For example the contact listing process may consider declared relationships between users in the social networking system e.g. married to sibling of in a relationship with etc. . For example the contact listing process may consider embedded social relationships in communications between a contact and the requesting user such as text strings reflecting social proximity e.g. Mom Dad in emails or SMS text messages . In other implementations the contact listing process may also consider whether the contact is an actual person or an entity such as an enterprise or organization . In particular embodiments the contact listing process may acquire declared social relationship information and embedded social relationships for each contact in the contacts list to compute an affiliation coefficient score for each contact . In particular embodiments the contact listing process may rank contacts in the contacts list by each contact s affiliation with the requesting user or how close in social relationship between each contact of the contacts list and the requesting user. For example the contact listing process can assign an affiliation coefficient of 1.0 if a contact in the contacts list is the user s parent wife husband or sibling or an affiliation coefficient of 0.7 if the contact in the contacts list is a friend of friend of the user and the contact and the user went to the same college at the same time or a default affiliation coefficient of 0.5 if a contact in the contacts list has no declared or embedded social relationship with the user or the contact has no known spatial and or temporal closeness to the user. A system for measuring user affinity is described more generally in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed on Aug. 11 2006 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.

In particular embodiments the contact listing process may access user profile database to compile communication history information between the requesting user and each contact in the contacts list in order to generate a communication history coefficient score . In particular embodiments a user s communication history may comprise frequency information for each communication channel in the inbound and or outbound directions with each contact in the user s address book as well as other individuals within and or outside the social network. For example a user s communication history can store information such as the number of emails instant messages texts etc sent received between one or more contacts social proximity groups e.g. family friends second degree friends etc. the number of text messages sent received between one or more contacts social proximity groups the number of phone calls sent received between one or more contacts social proximity groups and the like. In some implementations the client device such as a mobile device may be configured to periodically upload log data that can be processed by the social networking system to generate this information. In some implementations the communication history data may be raw or log data that is processed to yield these statistics. In other implementations a data mining process may periodically analyze the log data and maintain the above identified counts over various slide time intervals. In some implementations a local process executing on the client device can process this information and generate statistical data for use by the social networking system. In particular embodiments a connection between a user and another person may cause updates to the user s communication history accordingly. For example a user can look up a contact in the user s address book by accessing a client application hosted on the user s mobile phone call the contact by a phone number listed in the address book and the client application updates the user s communication history for the contact accordingly e.g. incrementing outbound call frequency for the contact social proximity group by 1 . For example a user may receive an SMS text message from a contact on a client application hosted by the user s mobile phone and the client application can update the user s communication history for the contact accordingly e.g. incrementing inbound SMS frequency for the contact by 1 .

In particular embodiments the contact listing process may generate a closeness coefficient for each contact in the contacts list based on the social graph information e.g. a degree of separation coefficient the social relationship information e.g. an affiliation coefficient and the communication history information e.g. a communication history coefficient . In particular embodiments the contact listing process may present the contacts list as sorted by closeness coefficients . In particular embodiments the contact listing process may store the closeness coefficients in user profile database .

In particular embodiments the contact listing process may generate a closeness coefficient for a contact by calculating a sum of the degree of separation coefficient the affiliation coefficient and a weighted average of the communication history coefficient . In the example of contact Andy in the contact listing process can calculate a closeness coefficient as follows closeness coefficient degree of separation affiliation coefficient weighted average of communication frequency coefficient 1.0 0.9 AVERAGE 0.6 1.0 0.0 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.5 0.8 0.4 2.17 Table show example closeness coefficients or social proximity scores as calculated by the method above. In other implementations closeness coefficients may also include a location based component that considers the physical proximity between a user and the contacts. In some implementations this can be based on a fixed location such as mailing or home addresses. In other implementations this can be based on current locations. Current locations can be based on user check ins to places in a geo social networking system. U.S. application Ser. No. which is incorporated by reference herein for all purposes discloses an example geo social networking system. In one implementation a weighted component score based on a function that varies with distance can be included in the computations discussed above. In this manner a contact that is currently in the same location or a nearby location may be upranked and presented more readily to the user.

As a user of the social networking system can keep one or more address books outside the social networking system in additional to the address book stored in user profile database it may be more efficient e.g. to reduce network traffic between the social networking system and a remote device to store a local copy of closeness coefficients with each address book outside the social networking system. In particular embodiments the contact listing process may store a local copy of closeness coefficients in a user s client device . In one embodiment the contact listing process may store a local copy of a table of closeness coefficients a table of communication channel weighting factors a table of degree of separation coefficients for one or more contacts and table of communication history for one or more contacts in a storage device of a user s client device e.g. a microSD flash memory card in a mobile phone . In particular embodiments the contact listing process may store a local copy of closeness coefficients in a server hosting a user s address book. In one embodiment the contact listing process may store a local copy of a table of closeness coefficients a table of communication channel weighting factors a table of degree of separation coefficients for one or more contacts and table of communication history for one or more contacts in a storage device e.g. a hard disk drive of a server hosting a user s address book or in a storage device linked to a server hosting a user s address book. In particular embodiments a connection between a user and another person may cause the contact listing process to update a local copy of closeness coefficients. For example a user may receive an SMS text message from a contact on a client application hosted by the user s mobile phone and the client application can cause the contact listing process to calculate and store the closeness coefficient for the contact locally. For example a server hosting a user s address book can facilitate a chat session between the user and a contact then cause the contact listing process to calculate and store the closeness coefficient for the contact locally. In particular embodiments the contact listing process may present contacts in a user s address book as sorted by locally stored closeness coefficients.

In particular embodiments the contact listing process may synchronize one or more local copies of closeness coefficients with the closeness coefficients stored in user profile database . For example the contact listing process can poll a local copy of closeness coefficients in a user s mobile phone every Monday at 3 AM determine changes in the local copy and changes in the closeness coefficients stored in user profile database and update the local copy and the closeness coefficients stored in user profile database if needed.
