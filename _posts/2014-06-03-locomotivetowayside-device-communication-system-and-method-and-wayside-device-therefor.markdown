This invention relates generally to vehicle systems and networks such as railway systems including trains travelling in a track or rail network and in particular to a locomotive to wayside device communication system and method for use in implementing a communications architecture in a vehicle network preferably a vehicle network of multiple trains operating in a railroad track network.

Vehicle systems and networks exist throughout the world and at any point in time a multitude of vehicles such as cars trucks buses trains and or the like are travelling throughout the system and network. With specific reference to trains travelling in a railroad track network the locomotives of such trains may be equipped with or operated using train control communication and management systems e.g. positive train control systems such as the I ETMS of Wabtec Corp. In order to effectively manage all of the trains information and data must be communicated and distributed over the network between the trains i.e. the locomotives a central control system e.g. central dispatch and various wayside devices e.g. wayside interface units WIUs radios track communication devices and other equipment positioned throughout the track network.

As is currently implemented in existing train control communication and management systems the wayside devices i.e. the data radios of such devices are configured to either passively respond to an inquiry from the train management computer on the locomotive or actively and continually transmit data to the train management computer.

When implemented in the above mentioned passive system the wayside device is in a sleep state awaiting an interrogation signal from the communication system of the train management computer on the locomotive. Based upon the location or position of the train with respect to the wayside device the locomotive will transmit such an interrogation signal which wakes up the wayside device such that it enters an active state. In this active state and based upon the nature and content of the interrogation signal the wayside device will transmit data associated with the track the environment a configurable device e.g. a switch the device itself or other specified information. Once the data is transmitted to the train management computer the wayside device again enters the sleep or passive mode until another interrogation signal is received. One example of a train control system operating in this passive implementation is shown and described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 996 461. In the active implementation the wayside device continually transmits the data to the network regardless of whether or not a train is in the area.

The passive implementation is normally used in areas where a continual power source is not available. Accordingly the wayside device is provided with one or more batteries to supply power to the device and facilitate the data collection and transmission functions. The active implementation can be used in areas that have a permanent power source available such that the wayside device is hardwired to a power source or system. If the battery powered wayside devices were to continually transmit the batteries would drain at a rapid rate and require replacement or require large infrastructure wind generators solar panels and or the like or some other replenishable power source to keep up with the power demands.

Accordingly there is a need in the art for more effective and efficient communication systems for distributing data and information over a large network such as a train network. There is also a need in the art for a locomotive to wayside device communication system and method that can be used in areas or environments where a permanent power source is not available or such use not desirable.

Preferably provided are locomotive to wayside device communication systems and methods and wayside devices therefor that are useful in connection with railway systems and the trains travelling therein. Preferably provided are locomotive to wayside device communication systems and methods and wayside devices therefor that facilitate the ability to manage and distribute data between locomotives and or trains travelling in a track or rail network and specified wayside devices.

As used herein the terms communication and communicate refer to the receipt transmission or transfer of one or more signals messages commands or other type of data. For one unit or device to be in communication with another unit or device means that the one unit or device is able to receive data from and or transmit data to the other unit or device. A communication may use a direct or indirect connection and may be wired and or wireless in nature. Additionally two units or devices may be in communication with each other even though the data transmitted may be modified processed routed etc. between the first and second unit or device. For example a first unit may be in communication with a second unit even though the first unit passively receives data and does not actively transmit data to the second unit. As another example a first unit may be in communication with a second unit if an intermediary unit processes data from one unit and transmits processed data to the second unit. It will be appreciated that numerous other arrangements are possible. Any known electronic communication protocols and or algorithms may be used such as for example TCP IP including HTTP and other protocols WLAN including 802.11 and other radio frequency based protocols and methods analog transmissions and or the like. In addition the communications may occur either wirelessly over a network or as transmissions that are distributed through and along the rails of a track in a track or rail network.

In particular and in one preferred and non limiting embodiment and as illustrated in Box these instructions include at least one of the following i an instruction to modify a current power level to high power level ii an instruction to modify the current power level to an increased power level iii an instruction to modify the current power level to a specified power level iv an instruction to incrementally modify the current power level to a higher power level v an instruction to modify a current reporting interval to high frequency reporting interval vi an instruction to modify the current reporting interval to an increased reporting interval vii an instruction to modify the current reporting interval to a specified reporting interval viii an instruction to incrementally modify the current reporting interval to a more frequent reporting interval ix an instruction to modify a current frequency to a different frequency x an instruction to modify the current frequency to a specified frequency xi an instruction to incrementally modify the current frequency to a different frequency xii an instruction to modify a current communication protocol to a different communication protocol xiii an instruction to modify the current communication protocol to a specified communication protocol or any combination thereof.

If in the determination step data and or a specific type set or content of data is received at least one action is implemented Step . In particular and in one preferred and non limiting embodiment and as illustrated in Box these actions include at least one of the following facilitate initiate and or implement a train control action e.g. braking of the train T based upon information and data received from the wayside device W such as the status of a switch or gate facilitate implement and or initiate a communication action e.g. contact another train T or central dispatch regarding the status of a wayside device W such as misaligned switch a broken gate a malfunctioning wayside device W etc. facilitate implement and or initiate a data management action e.g. populate the track database with updated status information for the wayside device W or any combination thereof.

Accordingly the present invention provides an innovative method for implementing and controlling communication with wayside devices W such as wayside radios in Positive Train Control systems. For example in one embodiment and as discussed above the wayside communication device may be transmitting at a pre defined or configurable power level and at a pre defined or specified reporting interval. For example in high traffic areas with commercial power available the wayside communication device may transmit at a maximum power at a frequent e.g. three second reporting interval. However in remote areas with battery power the wayside communication device may only be transmitting in the milliwatt power range and at a much less frequent e.g. one minute reporting interval. As also discussed the power level and the reporting interval as well as the frequency and the communication protocol may be configured at the wayside device W .

In one exemplary and non limiting embodiment and when the locomotive L approaches the wayside device W but cannot hear from it the on board computer will send a command via the on board communication device to increase the transmission power change the reporting interval change the frequency and or change the communication protocol. In addition and in one preferred and non limiting embodiment this command or instruction may start at a relatively low level or interval or frequency and gradually increase or be modified in subsequent commands until the on board computer receives data from the wayside communication device at a desired distance. Still further and in another embodiment the track database may also be populated with the desired power reporting interval frequency and or communication protocol for a group or set of wayside devises W or a specified wayside device W .

In this manner the present invention provides a unique and innovative system method and wayside device W that facilitate transmissions at variable levels intervals frequencies and or protocol. In one embodiment this reduces radio frequency congestion by not having every wayside device W transmit at maximum power and provides an opportunity to increase the power level or any of the other levels discussed above from a given wayside communication device in a situational manner such as in the instance where there is a variable amount of background noise to overcome. In particular the radio frequency network congestion and interference would be lower since each radio is only transmitting at the level necessary to hear it and no higher.

In addition another benefit of the present invention is that the provision of a variable reporting interval can further conserve energy by not having to respond at a current process of once every three seconds. Such an interval may be chosen for operation in signal territory but remote locations running from battery power will generally be monitored switch locations. Less frequent status reporting of switch status versus signal status can be implemented.

Another advantage of the present invention with respect to power usage and in one exemplary and non limiting embodiment a wayside device W or location may be mining on battery power with one train per day that runs at 30 miles per hour with locomotive communication for three minutes in advance of the wayside location. Assuming that each full power wayside transmission consumes five watts of battery power under existing systems such as wayside devices W reporting every three seconds and where a location would be interrogated the total power consumed per day may be about 300 watts. However by implementing the presently invented system method and wayside device W and by using a reporting interval of about one minute with a low power load consuming ten milliwatts of battery power per transmission and a high power mode consuming five watts the total power consumed in this example would be about 29.4 watts. Accordingly the present invention represents a power savings with respect to existing systems.
