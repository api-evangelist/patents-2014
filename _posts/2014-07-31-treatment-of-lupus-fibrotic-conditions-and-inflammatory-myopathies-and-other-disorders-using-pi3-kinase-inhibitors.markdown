Lupus is a group of conditions with similar underlying mechanisms involving autoimmunity. In these conditions antibodies created by the body to attack antigens e.g. viruses bacteria became unable to differentiate between antigens and healthy tissue. Thus the antibodies that should protect the body begin to attack the body s own healthy tissues. Triggers for lupus include viruses bacteria allergens both IgE and hypersensitivity hormones e.g. estrogens environmental stimulants e.g. ultraviolet light sunlight stress smoking trauma scratching burn coldness and certain medications.

Lupus is generally a chronic disease in which the signs and symptoms tend to come and go. Common signs or symptoms of lupus include for example joint pain and stiffness muscle aches pains or weakness fever with no known cause feeling very tired butterfly shaped rash across the nose and cheeks other skin rashes unusual weight loss or weight gain anemia trouble thinking memory problems and confusion kidney problems with no known cause chest pain when taking a deep breath sun or light sensitivity hair loss and purple or pale fingers or toes from cold or stress. Less common symptoms include blood clots seizures strokes sores in the mouth or nose severe headache dizzy spells seeing things or not being able to judge reality feeling sad and dry or irritated eyes. Lupus also increases the risk of developing various other diseases and or causes other diseases to occur earlier in life. Such diseases include heart disease osteoporosis and kidney disease. See e.g. Lupus Fact Sheet by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women s Health womenshealth.gov publications our publications fact sheet lupus.cfm accessed Jun. 18 2012 .

Types of lupus include for example systemic lupus erythematosus SLE cutaneous lupus erythematosus CLE CLE includes e.g. acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus ACLE subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus SCLE intermittent cutaneous lupus erythematosus and chronic cutaneous lupus drug induced lupus and neonatal lupus. About 70 of all cases of lupus are SLE. CLE can have symptoms that are limited to the skin or can be seen in those with SLE.

Lupus affects predominately young women. More than 90 of people with lupus are women between the ages of 15 and 45. African American Latina Asian and Native American women are at greater risk of developing lupus than are white women. Men are at higher risk for developing lupus before puberty and after age 50. For African American women between the ages of 15 and 64 the prevalence is one per 245 women. This prevalence rate for African American women makes lupus one of the most common chronic diseases of this population.

Fibrotic conditions include diseases that involve the formation and or deposition of fibrous tissue that builds up and or spreads over or replaces normal organ tissue. Fibrotic conditions occur when processes that normally contribute to wound healing go awry resulting in extra scar tissue that can be harmful. Fibrotic conditions can affect single organs or tissues or they can be systemic and affect multiple organs or tissues of the body. Examples of systemic fibrotic diseases include atherosclerosis scleroderma nephrogenic systemic fibrosis cystic fibrosis and chronic graft vs. host disease. Fibrotic conditions can affect almost any part of the body. For example fibrotic conditions can affect the lungs heart skin kidneys bone marrow liver and eyes.

Fibrotic conditions affect a large portion of the population atherosclerosis alone will affect about 25 of Americans in their lifetime. Fibrotic conditions have serious consequences for quality of life. Examples of serious consequences of fibrotic conditions include difficulty breathing kidney failure and blindness. Furthermore fibrotic conditions are often fatal. Indeed tissue fibrosis contributes to 45 percent of all deaths in developed countries.

Inflammatory myopathies are diseases that typically involve inflammation of the muscles and associated symptoms such as muscle weakness. The muscle weakness can be progressive and can lead to difficulty moving including difficulty walking breathing swallowing and talking. Inflammatory myopathies can be caused by allergic reactions other diseases exposure to a drug or toxin or exposure to an infectious agent or they can be idiopathic no known cause . Inflammatory myopathies include dermatomyositis polymyositis inclusion body myositis and immune mediated necrotizing myopathies. In some cases dermatomyositis involves predominantly skin symptoms without muscle symptoms or without noticeable muscle symptoms. Inflammatory myopathies can affect both adults and children e.g. juvenile dermatomyositis . Inflammatory myopathies can include symptoms that affect other organs or systems of the body such as the skin lungs heart eyes and gastrointestinal system. Although inflammatory myopathies are relatively rare their prevalence has likely been underestimated see e.g. Smoyer Tomic K. C. 2012 13 103 and they can cause serious and even fatal symptoms or complications.

Inflammatory skin conditions such as skin rashes including rashes caused by allergens or other diseases are commonplace. Skin rashes are frequently painful and or itchy pruritic and can be debilitating. Associated symptoms such as hay fever are likewise uncomfortable and can be debilitating. Allergic reactions can also have serious consequences such as anaphalaxis.

Accordingly the terms antagonist and inhibitors are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While antagonists can specifically interact with e.g. bind to the target compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition.

As used herein a phosphoinositide 3 kinase PI3K inhibitor or PI3K inhibitor refers to an inhibitor of any PI3K. PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3 OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family includes kinases with distinct substrate specificities expression patterns and modes of regulation see e.g. Katso et al. 200117 615 675 Foster F. M. et al. 2003116 3037 3040 . The class I PI3Ks e.g. p110 p110 p110 and p110 are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors to generate PIP3 which engages downstream mediators such as those in the Akt PDK1 pathway mTOR the Tec family kinases and the Rho family GTPases. The class II PI3Ks e.g. PI3K C2 PI3K C2 PI3K C2 and III PI3Ks e.g. Vps34 play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI 3 P and PI 3 4 P2. Specific exemplary PI3K inhibitors are disclosed herein.

The class I PI3Ks comprise a p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory adapter subunit. See e.g. Cantrell D. A. 2001 114 1439 1445. Four isoforms of the p110 subunit including PI3K alpha PI3K beta PI3K gamma and PI3K delta isoforms have been implicated in various biological functions. Class I PI3K is involved for example in insulin signaling and has been found to be mutated in solid tumors. Class I PI3K is involved for example in platelet activation and insulin signaling. Class I PI3K plays a role in mast cell activation innate immune function and immune cell trafficking chemokines . Class I PI3K is involved for example in B cell and T cell activation and function and in Fc receptor signaling in mast cells. In some embodiments provided herein the PI3K inhibitor is a class I PI3K inhibitor. In some such embodiments the PI3K inhibitor inhibits a PI3K alpha PI3K beta PI3K gamma or PI3K delta isoform or a combination thereof.

Downstream mediators of PI3K signal transduction include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR . Akt possesses a plckstrin homology PH domain that binds PIP3 leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family.

 Isomers are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. Stereoisomers are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space i.e. having a different stereochemical configuration. Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non superimposable mirror images of each other. A 1 1 mixture of a pair of enantiomers is a racemic mixture. The term . . is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms but which are not mirror images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog R S system. When a compound is a pure enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chiral carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated or depending on the direction dextro or levorotatory which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry as R or S . The present chemical entities pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers including racemic mixtures optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active R and S isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry and unless specified otherwise it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers.

 Enantiomeric purity as used herein refers to the relative amounts expressed as a percentage of the presence of a specific enantiomer relative to the other enantiomer. For example if a compound which can potentially have an R or an S isomeric configuration is present as a racemic mixture the enantiomeric purity is about 50 with respect to either the R or S isomer. If that compound has one isomeric form predominant over the other for example 80 S and 20 R the enantiomeric purity of the compound with respect to the S isomeric form is 80 . The enantiomeric purity of a compound can be determined in a number of ways known in the art including but not limited to chromatography using a chiral support polarimetric measurement of the rotation of polarized light nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using chiral shift reagents which include but are not limited to lanthanide containing chiral complexes or the Pirkle alcohol or derivatization of a compounds using a chiral compound such as Mosher s acid followed by chromatography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

 Moiety refers to a specific segment or functional group of a molecule. Chemical moieties are often recognized chemical entities embedded in or appended to a molecule.

 Tautomers are structurally distinct isomers that interconvert by tautomerization. Tautomerization is a form of isomerization and includes prototropic or proton shift tautomerization which is considered a subset of acid base chemistry. Prototropic tautomerization or proton shift tautomerization involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order often the interchange of a single bond with an adjacent double bond. Where tautomerization is possible e.g. in solution a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. An example of tautomerization is keto enol tautomerization. A specific example of keto enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane 2 4 dione and 4 hydroxypent 3 en 2 one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol keto tautomerization. A specific example of phenol keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin 4 ol and pyridin 4 1H one tautomers.

 Protecting group has the meaning conventionally associated with it in organic synthesis i.e. a group that selectively blocks one or more reactive sites in a multifunctional compound such that a chemical reaction can be carried out selectively on another unprotected reactive site and such that the group can readily be removed after the selective reaction is complete. A variety of protecting groups are disclosed for example in T. H. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Third Edition John Wiley Sons New York 1999 . For example a hydroxy protected form is where at least one of the hydroxy groups present in a compound is protected with a hydroxy protecting group. Likewise amines and other reactive groups can similarly be protected.

The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration the form in which the compound is administered the subject to be treated the body weight of the subject to be treated and the preference and experience of the attending physician.

Described below are non limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same.

In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration is used wherein the composition comprises a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration.

In some embodiments a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration is used wherein the composition comprises i an effective amount of a compound of the present invention and optionally ii an effective amount of a second agent and iii a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments the composition further contains iv an effective amount of a third agent.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms such as capsules cachets or tablets or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient such as but not limited to a binder a lubricant an inert diluent and or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water can be added e.g. 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions solutions and elixirs or aerosols or carriers such as starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example suitable carriers include powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations. If desired tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof.

Disintegrants can be used in the compositions to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient s from the dosage form. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient s can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums or mixtures thereof.

Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethylaureate agar or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.

When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the essential active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and if so desired emulsifying and or suspending agents together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various combinations thereof.

The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include but are not limited to hydrophilic surfactants lipophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. That is a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.

A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least 10 while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB value . Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic and have greater solubility in oils while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10 as well as anionic cationic or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly lipophilic i.e. hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.

Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include but are not limited to alkylammonium salts fusidic acid salts fatty acid derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides glyceride derivatives of amino acids oligopeptides and polypeptides lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins phospholipids and derivatives thereof lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof carnitine fatty acid ester salts salts of alkylsulfates fatty acid salts sodium docusate acylactylates mono and di acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono and di glycerides succinylated mono and di glycerides citric acid esters of mono and di glycerides and mixtures thereof.

Ionic surfactants can be the ionized forms of lecithin lysolecithin phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylglycerol phosphatidic acid phosphatidylserine lysophosphatidylcholine lysophosphatidylethanolamine lysophosphatidylglycerol lysophosphatidic acid lysophosphatidylserine PEG phosphatidylethanolamine PVP phosphatidylethanolamine lactylic esters of fatty acids stearoyl 2 lactylate stearoyl lactylate succinylated monoglycerides mono diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono diglycerides citric acid esters of mono diglycerides cholylsarcosine caproate caprylate caprate laurate myristate palmitate oleate ricinoleate linoleate linolenate stearate lauryl sulfate teracecyl sulfate docusate lauroyl carnitines palmitoyl carnitines myristoyl carnitines and salts and mixtures thereof.

Hydrophilic non ionic surfactants can include but not limited to alkylglucosides alkylmaltosides alkylthioglucosides lauryl macrogolglycerides polyoxyalkylene alkyl ethers such as polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers polyoxyalkylene alkylphenols such as polyethylene glycol alkyl phenols polyoxyalkylene alkyl phenol fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol fatty acids monoesters and polyethylene glycol fatty acids diesters polyethylene glycol glycerol fatty acid esters polyglycerol fatty acid esters polyoxyalkylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils fatty acids and sterols polyoxyethylene sterols derivatives and analogues thereof polyoxyethylated vitamins and derivatives thereof polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block copolymers and mixtures thereof polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters and hydrophilic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of triglycerides vegetable oils and hydrogenated vegetable oils. The polyol can be glycerol ethylene glycol polyethylene glycol sorbitol propylene glycol pentaerythritol or a saccharide.

Other hydrophilic non ionic surfactants include without limitation PEG 10 laurate PEG 12 laurate PEG 20 laurate PEG 32 laurate PEG 32 dilaurate PEG 12 oleate PEG 15 oleate PEG 20 oleate PEG 20 dioleate PEG 32 oleate PEG 200 oleate PEG 400 oleate PEG 15 stearate PEG 32 distearate PEG 40 stearate PEG 100 stearate PEG 20 dilaurate PEG 25 glyceryl trioleate PEG 32 dioleate PEG 20 glyceryl laurate PEG 30 glyceryl laurate PEG 20 glyceryl stearate PEG 20 glyceryl oleate PEG 30 glyceryl oleate PEG 30 glyceryl laurate PEG 40 glyceryl laurate PEG 40 palm kernel oil PEG 50 hydrogenated castor oil PEG 40 castor oil PEG 35 castor oil PEG 60 castor oil PEG 40 hydrogenated castor oil PEG 60 hydrogenated castor oil PEG 60 corn oil PEG 6 caprate caprylate glycerides PEG 8 caprate caprylate glycerides polyglyceryl 10 laurate PEG 30 cholesterol PEG 25 phytosterol PEG 30 soya sterol PEG 20 trioleate PEG 40 sorbitan oleate PEG 80 sorbitan laurate polysorbate 20 polysorbate 80 POE 9 lauryl ether POE 23 lauryl ether POE 10 oleyl ether POE 20 oleyl ether POE 20 stearyl ether tocopheryl PEG 100 succinate PEG 24 cholesterol polyglyceryl 10 oleate Tween 40 Tween 60 sucrose monostearate sucrose monolaurate sucrose monopalmitate PEG 10 100 nonyl phenol series PEG 15 100 octyl phenol series and poloxamers.

Suitable lipophilic surfactants include by way of example only fatty alcohols glycerol fatty acid esters acetylated glycerol fatty acid esters lower alcohol fatty acids esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters sorbitan fatty acid esters polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters sterols and sterol derivatives polyoxyethylated sterols and sterol derivatives polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers sugar esters sugar ethers lactic acid derivatives of mono and di glycerides hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of glycerides vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils fatty acids and sterols oil soluble vitamins vitamin derivatives and mixtures thereof. Within this group preferred lipophilic surfactants include glycerol fatty acid esters propylene glycol fatty acid esters and mixtures thereof or are hydrophobic transesterification products of a polyol with at least one member of the group consisting of vegetable oils hydrogenated vegetable oils and triglycerides.

In one embodiment the composition can include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non oral use e.g. compositions for injection. A solubilizer can also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and or other components such as surfactants or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion.

Examples of suitable solubilizers include but are not limited to the following alcohols and polyols such as ethanol isopropanol butanol benzyl alcohol ethylene glycol propylene glycol butanediols and isomers thereof glycerol pentaerythritol sorbitol mannitol transcutol dimethyl isosorbide polyethylene glycol polypropylene glycol polyvinylalcohol hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000 such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether glycofurol or methoxy PEG amides and other nitrogen containing compounds such as 2 pyrrolidone 2 piperidone .epsilon. caprolactam N alkylpyrrolidone N hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone N alkylpiperidone N alkylcaprolactam dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone esters such as ethyl propionate tributylcitrate acetyl triethylcitrate acetyl tributyl citrate triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate ethyl butyrate triacetin propylene glycol monoacetate propylene glycol diacetate caprolactone and isomers thereof valerolactone and isomers thereof butyrolactone and isomers thereof and other solubilizers known in the art such as dimethyl acetamide dimethyl isosorbide N methyl pyrrolidones monooctanoin diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and water. Mixtures of solubilizers can also be used. Examples include but not limited to triacetin triethylcitrate ethyl oleate ethyl caprylate dimethylacetamide N methylpyrrolidone N hydroxyethylpyrrolidone polyvinylpyrrolidone hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hydroxypropyl cyclodextrins ethanol polyethylene glycol 200 100 glycofurol transcutol propylene glycol and dimethyl isosorbide. Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol glycerol triacetin ethyl alcohol PEG 400 glycofurol and propylene glycol.

The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer can be limited to a bioacceptable amount which can be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances it can be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts for example to maximize the concentration of the drug with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a patient using conventional techniques such as distillation or evaporation. Thus if present the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10 25 50 100 or up to about 200 by weight based on the combined weight of the drug and other excipients. If desired very small amounts of solubilizer can also be used such as 5 2 1 or even less. Typically the solubilizer can be present in an amount of about 1 to about 100 more typically about 5 to about 25 by weight.

The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include without limitation detackifiers anti foaming agents buffering agents polymers antioxidants preservatives chelating agents viscomodulators tonicifiers flavorants colorants odorants opacifiers suspending agents binders fillers plasticizers lubricants and mixtures thereof.

In addition an acid or a base can be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing to enhance stability or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids amino acid esters ammonium hydroxide potassium hydroxide sodium hydroxide sodium hydrogen carbonate aluminum hydroxide calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide magnesium aluminum silicate synthetic aluminum silicate synthetic hydrocalcite magnesium aluminum hydroxide diisopropylethylamine ethanolamine ethylenediamine triethanolamine triethylamine triisopropanolamine trimethylamine tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane TRIS and the like. Also suitable are bases that are salts of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as acetic acid acrylic acid adipic acid alginic acid alkanesulfonic acid amino acids ascorbic acid benzoic acid boric acid butyric acid carbonic acid citric acid fatty acids formic acid fumaric acid gluconic acid hydroquinosulfonic acid isoascorbic acid lactic acid maleic acid oxalic acid para bromophenylsulfonic acid propionic acid p toluenesulfonic acid salicylic acid stearic acid succinic acid tannic acid tartaric acid thioglycolic acid toluenesulfonic acid uric acid and the like. Salts of polyprotic acids such as sodium phosphate disodium hydrogen phosphate and sodium dihydrogen phosphate can also be used.

The forms in which the compositions can be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions or emulsions with sesame oil corn oil cottonseed oil or peanut oil as well as elixirs mannitol dextrose or a sterile aqueous solution and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.

Aqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol glycerol propylene glycol liquid polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof cyclodextrin derivatives and vegetable oils can also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of a coating such as lecithin for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example parabens chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid thimerosal and the like.

Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above as required followed by filtered sterilization. Generally dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is a composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery.

Compositions can be formulated into preparations in solid semi solid or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration such as gels water soluble jellies creams lotions suspensions foams powders slurries ointments solutions oils pastes suppositories sprays emulsions saline solutions dimethylsulfoxide DMSO based solutions. In general carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast a solution formulation can provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area.

The pharmaceutical compositions also can comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients which are compounds that allow increased penetration of or assist in the delivery of therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation.

The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 023 252 4 992 445 and 5 001 139. Such patches can be constructed for continuous pulsatile or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.

Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable aqueous or organic solvents or mixtures thereof and powders. The liquid or solid compositions can contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions can be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask tert or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution suspension or powder compositions can be administered preferably orally or nasally from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.

Pharmaceutical compositions can also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual buccal rectal intraosseous intraocular intranasal epidural or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well known in the art. See e.g. See e.g. Anderson Philip O. Knoben James E. Troutman William G eds. Handbook of Clinical Drug Data Tenth Edition McGraw Hill 2002 Pratt and Taylor eds. Third Edition Churchill Livingston N.Y. 1990 Katzung ed. Ninth Edition McGraw Hill 20037ybg Goodman and Gilman eds. Tenth Edition McGraw Hill 200120th Ed. Lippincott Williams Wilkins 2000 Martindale Thirty Second Edition The Pharmaceutical Press London 1999 all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.

Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes intraduodenal routes parenteral injection including intravenous intraarterial subcutaneous intramuscular intravascular intraperitoneal or infusion topical e.g. transdermal application rectal administration via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also be administered intraadiposally or intrathecally.

The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated the severity of the disorder or condition the rate of administration the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day preferably about 1 to about 35 mg kg day in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g day preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g day. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range can be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses can be employed without causing any harmful side effect e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

In some embodiments a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically such administration will be by injection e.g. intravenous injection in order to introduce the agent quickly. However other routes can be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention can also be used for treatment of an acute condition.

In some embodiments a compound is administered in multiple doses. Dosing can be about once twice three times four times five times six times or more than six times per day. Dosing can be about once a month once every two weeks once a week or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6 10 14 28 days two months six months or one year. In some cases continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary.

Administration of the compound can continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments the compound is administered for more than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 14 or 28 days. In some embodiments the compound is administered for less than 28 14 7 6 5 4 3 2 or 1 day. In some embodiments the compound is administered chronically on an ongoing basis e.g. for the treatment of chronic effects.

An effective amount of a compound can be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities including rectal buccal intranasal and transdermal routes by intra arterial injection intravenously intraperitoneally parenterally intramuscularly subcutaneously orally topically or as an inhalant.

The compositions can also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent for example or an artery inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration can for example aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory compounds of the invention can slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound can be administered for example by local delivery from the struts of a stent from a stent graft from grafts or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix can be a polymeric matrix and can serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use include for example lactone based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide polycaprolactonglycolide polyorthoesters polyanhydrides polyaminoacids polysaccharides polyphosphazenes poly ether ester copolymers e.g. PEO PLLA polydimethylsiloxane poly ethylene vinylacetate acrylate based polymers or copolymers e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate polyvinyl pyrrolidinone fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices can be nondegrading or can degrade with time releasing the compound or compounds. A compound can be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip spin coating spray coating dip coating and or brush coating. A compound can be applied in a solvent and the solvent can be allowed to evaporate thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively a compound can be located in the body of the stent or graft for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents can be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent can be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments a compound can be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker can be used which degrades in vivo leading to the release of the compound. Any bio labile linkage can be used for such a purpose such as ester amide or anhydride linkages. A Compound can additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of a compounds via the pericard or via advential application of a formulation described herein can also be performed.

Reactions may be initiated by the addition of 10 M ATP with 0.5 Ci P ATP well and incubated at ambient temperature for a suitable time e.g. for 45 minutes. Equal volume of 25 TCA may be added to stop the reaction and precipitate the proteins. Precipitated proteins may be trapped onto glass fiber B filterplates and excess labeled ATP washed off using a Tomtec MACH III harvestor. Plates may be allowed to air dry prior to adding 30 L well of Packard Microscint 20 and plates may be counted using a Packard TopCount .

In one aspect a method of reducing a lupus associated symptom in a biological sample is disclosed. The method includes contacting the biological sample with a PI3K inhibitor e.g. as a single agent or in combination with another agent or therapeutic modality in an amount sufficient to decrease or inhibit lupus e.g. to decrease lupus associated symptoms . In one embodiment the method is carried out in vivo for example in a mammalian subject e.g. an animal model or as part of therapeutic protocol.

As used herein contacting can be direct e.g. by direct application of the PI3K inhibitor to a biological sample e.g. in vitro or indirect e.g. by administering the PI3K inhibitor to a subject e.g. by any known administration route e.g. orally such that the PI3K inhibitor reaches an affected biological sample within the body.

As used herein a biological sample includes for example a cell or group of cells e.g. PBMCs or plasmacytoid dendritic cell s a tissue or a fluid e.g. whole blood or serum that comes into contact with the PI3K inhibitor thereby resulting in a decrease or inhibition of lupus or lupus associated symptoms. In some embodiments the biological sample is present within or derived from a subject who has lupus or from a subject at risk for developing lupus. In some embodiments the biological sample can be contacted with the PI3K inhibitor outside the body and then introduced into the body of a subject e.g. into the body of the subject from whom the biological sample was derived or into the body of a different subject . In some embodiments the biological sample includes cells that express Toll like receptor 7 TLR7 and or Toll like receptor 9 TLR9 .

In some embodiments the cell is a plasmacytoid dendritic cell. In some embodiments contacting the plasmacytoid dendritic cell with a PI3K inhibitor ameliorates or prevents development of a CLE skin lesion.

Also disclosed herein are methods of treating or preventing lupus in a subject. The methods include administering a PI3K inhibitor e.g. as a single agent or in combination with another agent or therapeutic modality to a subject in need thereof in an amount sufficient to decrease lupus or a lupus associated symptom in the subject.

Type I interferons IFNs especially IFN have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as lupus. See e.g. Ohl K. and Tenbrock K. 2011 Article ID 432595 14 pages . In particular SLE patients frequently show enhanced levels of serum IFN and the IFN levels have been found to correlate with anti dsDNA production and disease activity. IFN therapy can lead to autoantibody production and an SLE like syndrome. Furthermore many of the symptoms of SLE resemble symptoms of patients with influenza or side effects of IFN therapy for example fever fatigue and leucopenia. Genetic association studies have most frequently identified genes that are components of the upstream or downstream pathways of type I interferon e.g. STAT4 and IRF5 as being associated with SLE. Additionally both adult and pediatric SLE PBMCs show significant upregulation of IFN regulated gene transcripts the interferon signature which is considered a biomarker for disease activity. See e.g. Id.

Although leucocytes produce IFN plasmacytoid dendritic cells PDCs or pDCs are the main producers they produce 100 200 times more IFN than any other cell type. It is thought that PDCs can produce such high amounts of IFN because they constitutively express Toll like receptor 7 TLR7 and Toll like receptor 9 TLR9 .

The formation of immune complexes is a hallmark of SLE. Causes of immune complex formation include increased apoptosis and defective clearance of apoptotic material as well as high occurrence of autoantibodies. Id. Immune complexes induce IFN production by pDCs Immune complexes are internalized after binding Fc gamma RIIa on the surface of pDCs and activate TLR9 and TLR7 in the endosomal compartment which induces IFN secretion. Id. Overproduction of IFNs in lupus creates a vicious cycle exerting wide effects that result in further enhanced synthesis of IFN. These effects are summarized in Ohl K. and Tenbrock K. 2011 Article ID 432595 14 pages .

In human lupus e.g. SLE and CLE plasmacytoid dendritic cells PDCs actively produce IFN in response to endogenous TLR ligands derived from chronic inflammation. This results in a type 1 IFN gene signature. Type 1 IFNs e.g. IFN modulate autoimmunity by promoting CD maturation T cell survival B cell differentiation immunoblogulin class switching and antibody production. See e.g. Ghoreishi M. and Dutz J. P. 2009 19 1029 1035.

Fibrosis of the lung also referred to herein as pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the formation of scar tissue within the lungs which results in a decreased function. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with shortness of breath which progresses to discomfort in the chest weakness and fatigue and ultimately to loss of appetite and rapid weight loss. Approximately 500 000 people in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide suffer from pulmonary fibrosis and 40 000 people in the U.S. die annually from the disease. Pulmonary fibrosis has a number of causes including radiation therapy but can also be due to smoking or hereditary factors Meltzer E B et al. 2008 3 8 .

Pulmonary fibrosis can occur as a secondary effect in disease processes such as asbestosis and silicosis and is known to be more prevalent in certain occupations such as coal miner ship workers and sand blasters where exposure to environmental pollutants is an occupational hazard Green F H et al. 2007 35 136 47 . Other factors that contribute to pulmonary fibrosis include cigarette smoking and autoimmune connective tissue disorders like rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma and systemic lupus erythematosus SLE Leslie K O et al. 2007 28 369 78 Swigris J J et al. 2008 133 271 80 and Antoniou K M et al. 2008 20 686 91 . Other connective tissue disorders such as sarcoidosis can include pulmonary fibrosis as part of the disease Paramothayan S et al. 2008 102 1 9 and infectious diseases of the lung can cause fibrosis as a long term consequence of infection particularly chronic infections.

In certain embodiments the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the bone marrow. In certain embodiments the fibrotic condition of the bone marrow is myelofibrosis e.g. primary myelofibrosis PMF myeloid metaplasia chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or primary myelofibrosis. In other embodiments bone marrow fibrosis is associated with a hematologic disorder chosen from one or more of hairy cell leukemia lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

In other embodiments the bone marrow fibrosis is associated with one or more myeloproliferative neoplasms MPN chosen from essential thrombocythemia ET polycythemia vera PV mastocytosis chronic eosinophilic leukemia chronic neutrophilic leukemia or other MPN.

In one embodiment the fibrotic condition is primary myelofibrosis. Primary myelofibrosis PMF also referred to in the literature as idiopathic myeloid metaplasia and Agnogenic myeloid metaplasia is a clonal disorder of multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells reviewed in Abdel Wahab O. et al. 2009 60 233 45 Varicchio L. et al. 2009 2 3 315 334 Agrawal M. et al. 2010 1 15 . The disease is characterized by anemia splenomegaly and extramedullary hematopoiesis and is marked by progressive marrow fibrosis and atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia. CD34 stem progenitor cells abnormally traffic in the peripheral blood and multi organ extramedullary erythropoiesis is a hallmark of the disease especially in the spleen and liver. The bone marrow structure is altered due to progressive fibrosis neoangiogenesis and increased bone deposits. A significant percentage of patients with PMF have gain of function mutations in genes that regulate hematopoiesis including Janus kinase 2 JAK2 50 e.g. JAK2 V617F or the thrombopoietin receptor MPL 5 10 resulting in abnormal megakaryocyte growth and differentiation. Studies have suggested that the clonal hematopoietic disorder leads to secondary proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive collagen deposition. Decreased bone marrow fibrosis can improve clinical signs and symptoms including anemia abnormal leukocyte counts and splenomegaly.

Bone marrow fibrosis can be observed in several other hematologic disorders including but not limited to hairy cell leukemia lymphoma and multiple myeloma. However each of these conditions is characterized by a constellation of clinical pathologic and molecular findings not characteristic of PMF see Abdel Wahab O. et al. 2009 supra at page 235 .

In other embodiments the bone marrow fibrosis can be secondary to non hematologic disorders including but not limited to solid tumor metastases to bone marrow autoimmune disorders systemic lupus erythematosus scleroderma mixed connective tissue disorder polymyositis and secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with vitamin D deficiency see Abdel Wahab O. et al. 2009 supra at page 235 . In most cases it is possible to distinguish between these disorders and PMF although in rare cases the presence of the JAK2V617F or MPLW515L K mutation can be used to demonstrate the presence of a clonal MPN and to exclude the possibility of reactive fibrosis.

The effect of PI3K inhibitors in myelofibrosis can be characterized in mouse models available in the art e.g. as described in Varicchio L. 2009 supra.

Monitoring a clinical improvement in a subject with bone marrow fibrosis can be evaluated by one or more of monitoring peripheral blood counts e.g. red blood cells white blood cells platelets wherein an increase in peripheral blood counts is indicative of an improved outcome. In some embodiments clinical improvement in a subject with bone marrow fibrosis can be evaluated by monitoring one or more of spleen size liver size and size of extramedullary hematopoiesis wherein a decrease in one or more of these parameters is indicative of an improved outcome.

In some embodiments the fibrotic condition is a fibrotic condition of the skin. In certain embodiments the fibrotic condition is chosen from one or more of skin fibrosis and or scarring scleroderma e.g. systemic scleroderma or keloid.

In some embodiments the fibrotic condition is scleroderma. is a group of diseases that involve hardening and tightening of the skin and or other connective tissues. is more common in women than in men and most commonly occurs between the ages of 30 and 50 years. may be localized e.g. affecting only the skin or systemic e.g. affecting other systems such as e.g. blood vessels and or internal organs . Common symptoms of scleroderma include Raynaud s phenomenon gastroesophageal reflux disease and skin changes e.g. swollen fingers and hands or thickened patches of skin .

Localized scleroderma localized cutaneous fibrosis includes morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea is typically characterized by oval shaped thickened patches of skin that are white in the middle with a purple border. Linear scleroderma is more common in children. Symptoms of linear scleroderma may appear mostly on one side of the body. In linear scleroderma bands or streaks of hardened skin may develop on one or both arms or legs or on the forehead. En coup de sabre frontal linear scleroderma or morphea en coup de sabre is a type of localized scleroderma typically characterized by linear lesions of the scalp or face.

Systemic scleroderma systemic sclerosis includes e.g. limited systemic sclerosis also known as limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis or CREST syndrome diffuse systemic sclerosis also known as diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis and systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma. CREST stands for the following complications that may accompany limited scleroderma calcinosis e.g. of the digits Raynaud s phenomenon esophageal dysfunction sclerodactyly and telangiectasias. Typically limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands arms and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See e.g. Denton C. P. et al. 2006 2 3 134 143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud s phenomenon whereas in the diffuse subtype onset of Raynaud s phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension severe bowel involvement and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis lung fibrosis and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs e.g. kidneys esophagus heart or lungs . Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.

In some embodiments the fibrotic condition is scleroderma. In some embodiments the scleroderma is localized e.g. morphea or linear scleroderma. In some embodiments the condition is a systemic sclerosis e.g. limited systemic sclerosis diffuse systemic sclerosis or systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.

Evaluating the effect of PI3K inhibitors such as Compound 292 in several fibrotic conditions in vivo can be performed for example using animal models. A number of models in which fibrosis is induced are available in the art. Administration of PI3K inhibitors such as Compound 292 can be readily used to evaluate whether fibrosis is ameliorated in such models. Examples of such models include but are not limited to the unilateral ureteral obstruction model of renal fibrosis see Chevalier et al. Ureteral Obstruction as a Model of Renal Interstitial Fibrosis and Obstructive Nephropathy 2009 75 1145 1152 the bleomycin induced model of pulmonary fibrosis see Moore and Hogaboam Murine Models of Pulmonary Fibrosis . 2008 294 L152 L160 a variety of liver biliary fibrosis models see Chuang et al. Animal Models of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis 2008 12 333 347 Omenetti A. et al. 2007 87 499 514 biliary duct ligated model a number of myelofibrosis mouse models as described in Varicchio L. 2009 supra. and the locally injected bleomycin induced model of scleroderma see e.g. Yamamoto et al. Animal Model of Sclerotic skin I Local Injection of Bleomycin Induce Sclerotic Skin Mimicking Scleroderma 112 456 462 1999 . Regardless of the model a PI3K inhibitor e.g. Compound 292 can be evaluated using at least three general types of paradigms 1 test whether the inhibitor can inhibit the fibrotic state 2 test whether the inhibitor can stop fibrotic progression once initiated and or 3 test whether the inhibitor can reverse the fibrotic state once initiated.

Disclosed herein are methods of treating inflammatory myopathies and skin conditions. The methods include administering a PI3K inhibitor e.g. as a single agent or in combination with one or more additional agents or therapeutic modalities to a subject in need thereof thereby treating the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition e.g. by ameliorating one or more symptoms associated with the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition . The PI3K inhibitor is administered in an amount sufficient to treat the inflammatory myopathy or the skin condition in the subject. An amount sufficient as used herein includes a therapeutically effective amount and or a prophylactically effective amount.

Interferons IFNs e.g. Type I interferons e.g. IFN have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy e.g. dermatomyositis as well as other autoimmune diseases. See e.g. Wong D. et al. 2012 7 1 e29161 doi 10.1371 journal.pone.0029161 Higgs B. W. et al. 2012 15 25 35. Furthermore various cytokines and chemokines e.g. IFN TNF IL 6 IL 8 IL 1 IL 10 TGF IL 17 IL 18 and IL 15 play a role in pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathy e.g. dermatomyositis . See e.g. Kao et al. 2011 13 225 232. For example the blood muscle and skin of patients with dermatomyositis is characterized by the presence of an IFN signature involving upregulation of IFN inducible genes. See e.g. Wong D. et al. 2012 7 1 e29161 Higgs B. W. et al. 2012 15 25 35. Type I IFN is the major contributor to the overexpression of IFN inducible genes in peripheral blood. Higgs B. W. et al.

Although leucocytes produce IFN plasmacytoid dendritic cells PDCs or pDCs are the main producers they produce 100 200 times more IFN than any other cell type. It is thought that PDCs can produce such high amounts of IFN because they constitutively express Toll like receptor 7 TLR7 and Toll like receptor 9 TLR9 . Plasmacytoid dendritic cells PDCs actively produce IFN in response to endogenous TLR ligands derived from chronic inflammation which can result in a type 1 IFN gene signature.

Experiments disclosed herein reveal in part that PI3 kinase inhibitors e.g. Compound 292 can effectively modulate e.g. inhibit or enhance production of cytokines chemokines e.g. IFN IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 and or TNF that are induced by various TLR ligands and are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies e.g. dermatomyositis . At least in part for this reason it is expected that PI3 kinase inhibitors e.g. PI3K inhibitors are effective in the treatment of inflammatory myopathies.

A subset of TLRs e.g. TLR7 TLR8 and TLR9 induce an immune response characterized by induction of IFN . As shown in PI3K inhibition by Compound 292 inhibits induction of IFN via TLR9. TLR9 is a nucleotide sensing TLR and functions as a receptor for viral and bacterial nucleic acids as well as cellular danger or stress signals e.g. acute phase reactants. In addition to the recognition of foreign nucleic acids TLR9 has been shown to recognize self nucleic acid complexes in inflammatory myopathies such as lupus. As stated above biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies e.g. lupus can include increased levels of TLR 9 signaling induced cytokines such as IFN . The potent inhibition of the TLR9 induced IFN signaling pathway by Compound 292 indicates Compound 292 can be used to prevent or treat disorders where the IFN or a TLR e.g. TLR9 signaling pathway is altered e.g. increased . Examples of such disorders include but are not limited to inflammatory myopathies lupus cutaneous lupus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma and dermatomyositis.

In other embodiments an altered level e.g. increased of TLR9 induced cytokines such as IFN can be used as a biomarker to select patients for treatment with Compound 292. For example a subject e.g. a patient suffering from an inflammatory myopathy e.g. lupus cutaneous lupus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma systemic scleroderma or dermatomyositis can be screened for expression of TLR 9 induced cytokine expression and or IFN based on the cytokine expression profile the subject selected or not selected for treatment with Compound 292. Other embodiments include screening a subject e.g. a patient diagnosed with lupus for expression of IFN if the subject expresses an increased level of IFN as compared to a reference value e.g. a reference standard the subject is then selected for treatment with Compound 292.

A gene signature characteristic of a type I interferon response commonly activated in rheumatic diseases can also be evaluated. Rheumatic diseases that can be evaluated can include but are not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus dermatomyositis polymyositis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic scleroderma e.g. as described in Higgs et al. Ann Rheum Dis 2011 70 2029 2036 . The gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more genes involved in a type I interferon induced response e.g. IFI6 RSAD2 STAT2 IFI44 LIPA IFI44L and IFI27 e.g. as described in Higgs et al 2011 supra .

In one embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more of the following IFN serum levels of high mobility group box protein 1 HMGB1 C3a or dsDNA e.g. as described in Ruan et al. 2010 185 4213 4222 . In an embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more of inflammatory cytokines e.g. type I IFNs type II IFNs IL 6 IL 1 TNF immunomodulatory cytokines e.g. IL 10 and TGF IL 21 IL 17 or IL 2 e.g. as described in Ohl et al. Biomedicine and Biotechnology 2011 Article ID 432595 .

Any combination of the aforementioned genes can be used to evaluate a subject. In one embodiment the levels e.g. expression of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen or more than fifteen of IFN type I IFNs type II IFNs TNF IL 1 IL 6 IL 1 IL 2 IL 8 IL 10 IL 13 IL 17 IL 21 GM CSF TGF IFI6 RSAD2 STAT2 IFI44 LIPA IFI44L or IFI27 can be evaluated. In another embodiment the levels e.g. expression of one or more of IFN TNF IL 6 or IL 8. In one embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of level e.g. expression of IL 17 for example one or more of IFN TNF IL 6 IL 8 or IL 17 can be evaluated.

The ICvalues for selected compounds were determined and are provided in Table 3. These data demonstrate that these compounds can serve as PI3K inhibitors.

Class I PI3 Ks can be either purchased p110 p85 p110 p85 p110 p85 from Upstate and p110 from Sigma or expressed as previously described Knight et al. 2004 . IC50 values are measured using either a standard TLC assay for lipid kinase activity described below or a high throughput membrane capture assay. Kinase reactions are performed by preparing a reaction mixture containing kinase inhibitor 2 DMSO final concentration buffer 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4 10 mM MgCl2 and freshly sonicated phosphatidylinositol 100 g ml . Reactions are initiated by the addition of ATP containing 10 Ci of 32P ATP to a final concentration 10 or 100 M and allowed to proceed for 5 minutes at room temperature. For TLC analysis reactions are then terminated by the addition of 105 l 1N HCl followed by 160 l CHCl3 MeOH 1 1 . The biphasic mixture is vortexed briefly centrifuged and the organic phase is transferred to a new tube using a gel loading pipette tip precoated with CHCl. This extract is spotted on TLC plates and developed for 3 4 hours in a 65 35 solution of n propanol 1M acetic acid. The TLC plates are then dried exposed to a phosphorimager screen Storm Amersham and quantitated. For each compound kinase activity is measured at 10 12 inhibitor concentrations representing two fold dilutions from the highest concentration tested typically 200 M . For compounds showing significant activity IC50 determinations are repeated two to four times and the reported value is the average of these independent measurements.

Other commercial kits or systems for assaying PI3 K activities are available. The commercially available kits or systems can be used to screen for inhibitors and or agonists of PI3 Ks including but not limited to PI 3 Kinase and . An exemplary system is PI 3 Kinase human HTRF Assay from Upstate. The assay can be carried out according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturer. Briefly the assay is a time resolved FRET assay that indirectly measures PIP3 product formed by the activity of a PI3 K. The kinase reaction is performed in a microtitre plate e.g. a 384 well microtitre plate . The total reaction volume is approximately 20 l per well. In the first step each well receives 2 l of test compound in 20 dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2 DMSO final concentration. Next approximately 14.5 l of a kinase PIP2 mixture diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 0.25 0.3 ug ml kinase and 10 uM PIP2. The plate is sealed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. To start the reaction 3.5 l of ATP diluted in 1 reaction buffer is added per well for a final concentration of 10 uM ATP. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 5 l of Stop Solution per well and then 5 l of Detection Mix is added per well. The plate is sealed incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and then read on an appropriate plate reader. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5.

The PI3K inhibitory activity of Compound 292 was tested in several assays described herein. Overall Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at lower doses compared to other PI3Ks e.g. at least 10 fold lower dose compared to PI3K PI3K or PI3K .

In one exemplary assay tested Compound 292 inhibited PI3K activity at lower doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 0.5 nM to 10 nM typically about 1 nM to 5 nM. For example Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 20 nM to 40 nM. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 70 nM to 90 nM. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 1500 nM to 2 M.

In another exemplary assay tested Compound 292 inhibited PI3K activity at lower doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 50 nM to 100 nM. For example Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 1 M to 5 M. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 2 M to 10 M. Compound 292 inhibits PI3K activity at higher doses e.g. an ICin the range of about 100 M to 200 M.

The functional cellular activities of Compound 292 were assessed. The results are shown in Table 5 below. Compound 292 suppressed murine B cell proliferation and human B cell proliferation at subnanomolar concentrations with an ECof 0.5 nM. Compound 292 suppressed human T cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations with an ECof 9.5 nM.

To determine PI3K isoform activity in vitro Compound 292 was assessed in PI3K and PI3K selective cell based assays. To assess the ability to inhibit the PI3K isoform AKT phosphorylation T308 was measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA in anti IgM antibody stimulated RAJI cells a human Burkitt s lymphoma cell line in the presence or absence of Compound 292. Compound 292 potently inhibited AKT phosphorylation with an ICvalue of 2.0 nM. To assess the ability to inhibit the PI3K isoform the murine macrophage like cell line RAW 264.7 was stimulated with C5a and the level of AKT phosphorylation T308 was measured by ELISA. Compound 292 inhibited PI3K in C5a activated RAW 264.7 cells with an ICvalue of 44.0 nM. Compound 292 is a potent inhibitor of both PI3K and PI3K in isoform selective cell based assays.

In one exemplary assay tested Compound 292 potently inhibited PI3K specific basophil activation in human whole blood with an ICof 78 nM.

The role of PI3Ks in TLR signaling is not clear from the literature. For TLR 9 induced cytokines PI3K inhibition has been called neutral suppressive and positive. Thus the literature suggests that PI3K inhibition may not be effective in inhibiting IFN via TLR9. The present example demonstrates that PI3K inhibition by Compound 292 inhibits induction of IFN via TLR9.

Human PBMCs were stimulated with CPG A. CPG A selectively activates PDCs inducing IFN production via TLR9. IFN is a PDC cell selective readout. Primary human PBMCs from two normal human donors were used as a source of PDC cells. 200 K cells per well were used. Cells were pretreated with the specified concentration of Compound 292 for 30 minutes. Then the cells were treated with the specified concentration of CPG A for 16 hours. RPMI 5 serum was employed.

Using methods analogous to those presented in Example 7 the effects of Compound 292 were investigated using CPG A and other TLR ligands including LPS PAM2CSK4 and R848 to induce release of cytokines including IFN IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 and TNF. These experiments were conducted using PBMCs.

Consistent with the results provided in the previous example Compound 292 blocked CPG A induced IFN . See which shows the results as percent inhibition all samples combined . Compound 292 also inhibited CPG A induced TNF see IL 6 see and IL 8 see . CPG A did not detectably induce IL 1.

PAM2CSK4 signals through TL2 TLR6 which plays a role in atherosclerosis colitis ischemic injury e.g. cardiac events and stroke. Compound 292 inhibited PAM2CSK4 induced TNF see IL 6 see IL 8 see and IL 1 see . PAM2CSK4 treatment did not detectably induce IFN production data not shown .

Compound 292 did not detectably affect R848 induced IFN TNF IL 6 or IL 8. Compound 292 slightly inhibited R848 induced IL 1.

Compound 292 enhanced the production of LPS induced TNF IL 6 and IL 1. Compound 292 did not detectably affect the production of LPS induced IL 8. LPS treatment did not detectably induce IFN production data not shown .

The results described above are summarized in Table 6. These results show that CPGA induced cytokines including IFN IL 6 IL 8 and TNF were inhibited by Compound 292. Similarly PAM2CSK4 induced cytokines including TNF IL 6 IL 8 and ILL were inhibited by Compound 292. R848 induced cytokines were not affected by Compound 292 to the extent that CPGA or PAM2CSK4 induced cytokines were. LPS induced IL 1 IL6 and TNF were increased by Compound 292 whereas LPS induced IL 8 was not affected.

A subset of TLRs e.g. TLR7 TLR8 and TLR9 can induce an immune response characterized by induction of IFN . As shown in Example 6 PI3K inhibition by Compound 292 inhibits induction of IFN via TLR9. TLR9 is a nucleotide sensing TLR and functions as a receptor for viral and bacterial nucleic acids as well as cellular danger or stress signals e.g. acute phase reactants. In addition to the recognition of foreign nucleic acids TLR9 has been shown to recognize self nucleic acid complexes in inflammatory myopathies such as lupus. As stated above biological concomitants of inflammatory myopathies e.g. lupus can include increased levels of TLR 9 signaling induced cytokines such as IFN . The potent inhibition of the TLR9 induced IFN signaling pathway by Compound 292 indicates that Compound 292 can be used to prevent or treat disorders where the IFN or a TLR e.g. TLR9 signaling pathway is altered e.g. increased . Examples of such disorders include but are not limited to inflammatory myopathies lupus cutaneous lupus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma and dermatomyositis.

In other embodiments an altered level e.g. increased of TLR 9 induced cytokines such as IFN can be used as a biomarker to select a patient for treatment with Compound 292. For example a subject e.g. a patient suffering from an inflammatory myopathy e.g. lupus cutaneous lupus rheumatoid arthritis scleroderma systemic scleroderma or dermatomyositis can be screened for the level e.g. expression of TLR 9 induced cytokine expression and or IFN . Based on the cytokine expression profile the subject can be selected or not selected for treatment with Compound 292. Other embodiments include screening a subject e.g. a patient diagnosed with lupus for the level e.g. expression of IFN if the subject expresses an increased level of IFN as compared to a reference value e.g. a reference standard the subject is then selected for treatment with Compound 292.

A gene signature characteristic of a type I interferon response commonly activated in rheumatic diseases can also be evaluated. Rheumatic diseases evaluated can include but are not limited to systemic lupus erythematosus dermatomyositis polymyositis rheumatoid arthritis and systemic scleroderma e.g. as described in Higgs et al. 2011 70 2029 2036 . The gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more genes involved in a type I interferon induced response e.g. one or more of IFI6 RSAD2 STAT2 IFI44 LIPA IFI44L or IFI27 e.g. as described in Higgs et al 2011 supra .

In one embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more of type I IFNs TNF IL 1 IL 10 IL 13 IL 17 or GM CSF e.g. as described in Higgs et al. 2012 15 25 35 . In an embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more of IFN serum levels of high mobility group box protein 1 HMGB1 C3a or dsDNA e.g. as described in Ruan et al. 2010 185 4213 4222 . In an embodiment the gene signature can include analysis of the level e.g. expression of one or more of inflammatory cytokines e.g. type I IFNs type II IFNs IL 6 IL 1 TNF immunomodulatory cytokines e.g. IL 10 and TGF IL 21 IL 17 or IL 2 e.g. as described in Ohl et al. 2011 Article ID 432595 .

Any combination of the aforementioned genes can be used to evaluate a subject. In one exemplary embodiment the level e.g. expression of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen or more than fifteen of the following genes IFN type I IFNs type II IFNs TNF IL 1 IL 6 IL 1 IL 2 IL 8 IL 10 IL 13 IL 17 IL 21 GM CSF TGF IFI6 RSAD2 STAT2 IFI44 LIPA IFI44L or IFI27 can be evaluated. In another embodiment the level e.g. expression of one or more of the following IFN TNF IL 6 or IL 8 can be evaluated. In yet another embodiment the gene signature can further include analysis of IL 17 for example the level e.g. expression of one or more of IFN TNF IL 6 IL 8 or IL 17 can be evaluated.

Starting at age 23 weeks and then every week thereafter urine from each animal was tested for proteinuria using Clinitech Multistick test strips Bayer Animals were observed daily for significant clinical signs morbidity and mortality Animals were bled via orbital sinus on days 0 49 98 and 140 mouse age 23 30 37 and 43 weeks for Anti dsDNA ELISA Alpha Diagnostics . Mice were terminated at age 43 weeks day 140 .

All dose solutions were prepared to deliver in 10 ml kg 0.3 ml 30 g mouse . The oral solutions of Compound 292 were formulated in 5 NMP 10 Solutol HS 15 85 PEG400.

Body weights were measured and recorded prior to study initiation for randomization on the first day of dosing prior to dosing and weekly throughout the study. Body weights were also recorded at scheduled termination points and as needed if test subjects appeared to decrease in weight by visual inspection. The animals were observed daily for significant clinical signs morbidity and mortality.

Urine from each animal was tested weekly beginning at mouse age 23 weeks for proteinuria using Clinitech Multistick test strips Bayer .

At necropsy animals were anesthetized with isoflorane and bled via cardiac puncture for serum for clinical chemistry analysis and plasma for Anti dsDNA ELISA and PK . Terminal urine was collected and assessed. Spleens and kidneys paired were collected weighed and placed in 10 NBF. Serum obtained at necropsy was sent to Antech Diagnostics for analysis. Terminal plasma samples were split with half being used for Anti dsDNA ELISA and the other half being shipped to the sponsor.

For animals found to be moribund or dead as an adverse affect of disease induction prior to the scheduled necropsy the time of death or sacrifice was noted and the terminal data were carried through to study termination.

Anti dsDNA IgG analysis was performed on days 0 49 98 and 140 mouse age 23 30 37 and 43 weeks . Anti dsDNA IgG levels were determined using an Anti dsDNA IgG ELISA Kit Alpha Diagnostic kit 5120 lot 90903K4 following manufacturer s instructions.

Histopathologic evaluation was performed on kidneys. Kidneys from all surviving animals were examined microscopically by a board certified veterinary pathologist and observations were entered into a computer assisted data retrieval system. Kidney sections were stained with Masson s Trichrome or Hematoxylin and Eosin. To maintain blinding of the analysis slides were labeled with the animal number with no reference to treatment group.

Kidneys were scored according to the following system developed by Chan O Madaio M P Shlomchik M J. The roles of B cells in MRL lpr murine lupus. 1997 815 75 82 modified to suit the lesion severity.

These 4 scores were summed to obtain a total kidney score and then the summed score as well as each individual parameter was compared across groups to determine significant differences with p 0.05.

Clinical and histopathology data for each mouse were entered into Microsoft Excel and the means for each group were determined with percent change from disease controls calculated by comparing values for treated and control animals. For mice that died or were euthanized prior to study termination terminal data were carried through to study termination for the purpose of analysis. One of 12 vehicle treated disease control mice died prior to study termination. All other mice survived to study termination.

A compound s efficacy in treating scleroderma can be tested using animal models. An exemplary animal model is a mouse model for scleroderma induced by repeated local injections of bleomycin BLM described for example in Yamamoto et al. Animal Model of Sclerotic skin I Local Injection of Bleomycin Induce Sclerotic Skin Mimicking 112 456 462 1999 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. This mouse model provides dermal sclerosis that closely resembles systemic sclerosis both histologically and biochemically. The sclerotic changes observed in the model include but are not limited to thickened and homogenous collagen bundles and cellular filtrates gradual increase in number of mast cells degranulation of mast cells elevated histamine release increase in hydroxyproline in skin presence of anti nuclear antibody in serum and strong expression of transforming growth factor 2 mRNA. Therefore efficacy of a compound in treating scleroderma can be assessed by monitoring the lessening of one or more of these changes.

Briefly the following exemplary procedures can be used to generate the mouse model for scleroderma Specific pathogen free female BALB C mice and C3H mice of 6 weeks old weighing about 20 g are purchased and maintained with food and water ad libitum. BLM is dissolved in PBS at differing concentrations and sterilized with filtration. Aliquots of each concentration of BLM or PBS are injected subcutaneously into the shaved back of the mice daily for 1 4 weeks with a needle. Alternatively mice are injected every other day.

Histolopathological and biochemical changes induced can be assessed using any methods commonly practiced in the field. For example histopathological changes can be assessed using a standard avidine biotin peroxidase technique with anti L3T4 monoclonal antibody anti Lyt2 monoclonal antibody anti mouse pan tissue fixed macrophage antibody anti stem cell factor monoclonal antibody anti transforming growth factor polyclonal antibody and anti decorin antibody. Cytokine expression of cellular infiltrates can be assessed by using several anti cytokine antibodies. Hydroxyproline level can be assessed by hydrolyzing skin pieces with hydrochloric acid neutralizing with sodium hydroxide and colorimetrically assessing the hydrolates at 560 nm with p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. Pepsin resistant collagen can be assessed by treating collagen sample extracted from biopsied tissues and analyzing by polyacrylamide stacking gel electrophoresis. Mast cells can be identified by toluidine blue and cells containing matachromatic granules can be counted under high magnification of a light microscope. Serum levels of various cytokines can be assessed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and mRNA levels of the cytokines can be assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Autoantibodies in serum can be detected using 3T3 fibroblasts as the substrate for the screening.

Effects of Compound 292 on treating inflammation was investigated in a 28 day semi therapeutic mouse EAE model.

EAE was induced in 60 mice using Hooke Kit MOG CFA Emulsion PTX Hooke Laboratories Lawrence Mass. catalog number EK 0110 lot number 0104 per manufacturer s recommended protocol except that pertussis toxin was diluted with phosphate buffered saline to achieve 1.4 and 1.3 solution starting from the 1.5 solution in the kit . This was done to optimize disease severity for this particular study.

Mice were injected subcutaneously at two sites in the back with the emulsion component of the kit containing MOG . One site of injection was in the area of the upper back approximately 1 cm caudal of the neck line. The second site was in the area of the lower back approximately 2 cm cranial of the base of the tail. Injection volume was 0.1 mL at each site. Within 2 hours of the injection of emulsion and then again 24 hours after the injection of emulsion the pertussis toxin component of the kit was administered intraperitoneally. Volume of each injection was 0.1 mL.

EAE was induced in 60 mices which were divided into six groups with 10 mice in each group Group 1 Vehicle p.o. QD 5 mL kg negative control Group 2 FTY720 3 mg kg p.o. QD 5 mL kg positive control Group 3 Compound 292 0.3 mg kg p.o. QD 5 mL kg Group 4 Compound 292 1 mg kg p.o. QD 5 mL kg Group 5 Compound 292 3 mg kg p.o. QD 5 mL kg and Group 6 Compound 292 10 mg kg p.o. QD 5 mL kg. Vehicle for Group 2 FTY720 was water and 2 ethanol. Vehicle for all other groups was water 0.5 CMC low viscosity and 0.05 Tween80. Mice were dosed at the same time every day 1 hour. The last day of dosing was Day 27 after immunization.

Readouts were EAE scores and changes in body weight. Mice were scored daily from Day 7 to Day 28 and body weights were measured three times week Monday Wednesday and Friday starting on Day 1.

On Day 27 plasma was isolated from mice in Groups 3 through 6. Three mice from each group were bled at 30 minutes and 1 hour after the last dose of Compound 292. Plasma was isolated from another 3 in these groups at 4 hours and from another 3 mice in these groups at 6 hours after the last dose of Compound 292. On Day 28 plasma was isolated from three mice in each of Groups 3 through 6 at trough. Blood was collected into EDTA tubes. The blood was placed at 4 C. after collection and then centrifuged within 20 minutes of collection to separate plasma. Approximately 100 L of plasma was collected from each sample and stored at 80 C immediately after collection.

On Day 28 serum was isolated from all the mice in the study and from the na ve mice. Blood was collected into Gel Clot Activator tubes left at room temperature for 15 30 minutes and then centrifuged for 5 minutes to separate serum. At least 100 L of serum was collected from each sample and stored at 80 C. immediately after collection.

After the last collection of blood on Day 28 mice in Groups 1 2 3 and 6 and the 3 na ve mice were sacrificed and immediately perfused with PBS. Spines were collected in buffered formalin for histological analysis.

At the end of the study 3 luxol fast blue LFB stained sections and 3 H E sections from lumbar thoracic and cervical spinal cord of all mice in Groups 1 2 3 and 6 and the 3 na ve mice were prepared and analyzed.

Inflammatory foci were counted in each H E stained section. Each group of approximately 20 cells was counted as one focus. Foci larger than 20 cells were counted based on an estimate of how many foci of 20 cells were present.

The demyelination score represents an estimate of demyelinated area for each section as follows. For LFB stained slides the demyelinated area was estimated based on intensity of blue staining of myelin. For H E stained sections demyelinated area was estimated by looking for interruption of normal structure pallor and vacuolation consistent with edema and demyelination and dilated axons.

EAE development was evaluated by comparing incidence time to EAE onset MMS and EAE scores at the end of the study between the compound treated groups and the vehicle treated group negative control Table 8 .

This was significantly higher in the 1 mg kg group compared to the vehicle group p 0.0477 . The body weights of the 0.1 and 10 mg kg groups were higher than the average relative body weights of the vehicle group but the difference did not reach statistical significance p 0.2153 and p 0.2109 for the 0.1 and 10 mg kg groups respectively . The body weight of the mice treated with 3 mg kg of Compound 292 was lower than for the vehicle treated group but the difference did not reach statistical significance p 0.1076 .

Histological analysis was performed on mice treated with 0.3 and 10 mg kg. Inflammation was found in the spinal cords of the mice treated with Compound 292. There were 2.9 1.5 and 5.2 3.2 average SD inflammatory foci per section in the groups treated with 0.3 and 10 mg kg respectively. The 10 mg kg group had significantly more inflammatory foci than the vehicle group p 0.0396 . The group treated with 0.3 mg kg was not significantly different from the vehicle group p 0.5000 . Demyelination was found in most sections in both 0.3 and 10 mg kg treated groups.

In the LFB sections demyelination scores were 1.2 0.7 and 1.6 0.8 average per section SD for the 0.3 and 10 mg kg treated mice respectively. These were not significantly different from the vehicle treated mice p 0.3931 and 0.8466 respectively .

In the H E sections demyelination scores were 1.5 0.5 and 1.9 0.8 average per section SD in the 0.3 and 10 mg kg treated mice respectively. These were not significantly different from the vehicle treated mice p 1.000 and 0.4443 respectively .

The number of apoptotic cells was lower in the Compound 292 treated groups than in the vehicle treated group. There were 1.7 0.9 and 2.2 1.0 average per section SD apoptotic cells in the 0.3 and 10 mg kg treated groups respectively. This was significantly less than in the vehicle group for the 0.3 mg kg treated group p 0.0076 and close to significantly less for the 10 mg kg treated group p 0.0699 . The number of apoptotic cells found in histological sections is a sensitive measure of damage in the spinal cords and it suggests that there may be some reduction in overall EAE pathology in the Compound 292 treated mice. This is consistent with a small reduction in the severity of the clinical scores at the end of the study compared to the vehicle treated mice.

Collectively these results indicate that in this study Compound 292 was efficacious in reducing EAE when dosed semi therapeutically at 1 mg kg p.o. QD. There was a trend toward disease inhibition for 0.1 and 10 mg kg treatment groups but this inhibition did not reach statistical significance. Mice dosed with 3 mg kg developed somewhat more severe EAE compared to the vehicle treated mice but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

A study was conducted to evaluate the potential efficacy of Compound 292 1 3 or 10 mg kg administered daily QD by the oral PO route for 21 days d21 41 in female SCID mice with CD4 inflammatory bowel disease. In this murine model female C.B 17 SCID mice are injected intraperitoneally IP with CD45RBcells a subset of CD4 T cells obtained from normal BALB c mice to induce spontaneous chronic inflammation in the large intestine. Gross and histopathologic changes resulting from this treatment resemble those occurring in Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis in humans. See Leach et al. Inflammatory Bowel Disease in C.B 17 scid Mice Reconstituted with the CD45RBSubset of CD4 T Cells 1996 148 5 1503 1515.

On study day 0 Balb C mice were terminated and spleens were obtained for CD45RBcell isolation per the SCID IBD cell separation protocol. SCID mice were weighed and received intraperitoneal IP injections of the sorted cells approx. 4 10cells ml 100 l mouse injections . On study day 21 mice were weighed and randomized by body weight loss into treatment groups and daily QD oral PO dosing was initiated. Dosing continued through study day 41 and mice were terminated on day 42.

For each animal the entire colon proximal and distal was trimmed into 8 equally spaced pieces for processing and embedding. Sections were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin H E . For each H E stained section submucosal edema was quantitated by measuring the distance from the muscularis mucosa to the internal border of the outer muscle layer in a non tangential area thought to most represent the severity of this change. Mucosal thickness was also measured in a non tangential area of the section that best represented the overall mucosal thickness. This parameter is indicative of gland elongation and mucosal hyperplasia. In order to incorporate this parameter into the summed score a hyperplasia score was derived from the measurement as follows 

The extent of inflammation foamy macrophage lymphocyte and PMN infiltrate was assigned severity scores according to the following criteria 

The parameters reflecting epithelial cell loss damage were scored individually using a percent area involved scoring method 

Parameters that were scored using percent involvement included 1 Colon glandular epithelial loss this includes crypt epithelial as well as remaining gland epithelial loss and 2 Colon Erosion this reflects loss of surface epithelium and generally is associated with mucosal hemorrhage reflective of the bleeding seen clinically and at necropsy .

The 4 important scored parameters inflammation glandular epithelial loss erosion hyperplasia were ultimately summed to arrive at a sum of histopathology scores which indicates the overall damage and would have a maximum score of 20.

Inflammatory cell infiltrates in the colonic mucosa were evaluated for approximate of neutrophils in the total infiltrate using the criteria below. The approximate of total was then multiplied by the 0 5 inflammation score in an attempt to semiquantify relative PMN infiltration across sections and animals.

This value was then multiplied by the inflammation score in an attempt to semiquantify relative PMN infiltration across sections and animals.
