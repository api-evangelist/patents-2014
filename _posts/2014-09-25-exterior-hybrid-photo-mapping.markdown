title: Exterior hybrid photo mapping
abstract: Embodiments disclosed pertain to the use of user equipment (UE) for the generation of a 3D exterior envelope of a structure based on captured images and a measurement set associated with each captured image. In some embodiments, a sequence of exterior images of a structure is captured and a corresponding measurement set comprising Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, wireless measurements (including Global Navigation Satellite (GNSS) measurements) and/or other non-wireless sensor measurements may be obtained concurrently. A closed-loop trajectory of the UE in global coordinates may be determined and a 3D structural envelope of the structure may be obtained based on the closed loop trajectory and feature points in a subset of images selected from the sequence of exterior images of the structure.
