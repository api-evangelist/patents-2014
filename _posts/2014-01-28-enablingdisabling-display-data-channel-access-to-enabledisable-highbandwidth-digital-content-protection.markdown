title: Enabling/disabling display data channel access to enable/disable high-bandwidth digital content protection
abstract: A switcher device comprises a multiplexer coupled in-between at least one input and output cards. The multiplexer detects the presence of an event signal from an activated sink. In response to the detection of the event signal, the switch dynamically switches to a closed position in order to enable the at least one source to authenticate with the input card and the output card to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. In response to the non-detection of the event signal, the switch switches dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from authenticating with the input card, therefore the output card also does not attempt to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption.

The present invention relates generally to High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection. More particularly the invention relates a method apparatus and system for enabling and or disabling Display Data Channel DDC access to enable and or disable High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection.

As the digital distribution of television movies and music expands content providers are growing increasingly concerned about the simplicity with which content pirates can copy and share copy protected material. Various digital rights management DRM schemes have been developed to ensure that television shows movies and music can only be viewed by authorized parties i.e. paying consumers . The Content Scrambling System CSS used to encrypt DVDs and Apple s Fairplay technology are two widely known examples of DRM schemes. One DRM scheme to protect digital content as it is transmitted over cables between devices is known as High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP . HDCP is a specified method developed by Digital Content Protection L.L.C. for protecting copyrighted digital content as it travels across connection interfaces and protocols such as DisplayPort DP Digital Video Interface DVI High Definition Multimedia Interface HDMI Giga bit Video Interface GVIF Digital Light Interface DLI Unified Display Interface UDI Internet Protocol IP Wireless Home Digital Interface WHDI Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP and Universal Serial Bus USB . The HDMI specification defines an interface for carrying digital audiovisual content from a source such as a DVD player to a sink or display device such as a television TV . As designed by the Digital Content Protection L.L.C. when the source and sink display are HDCP compliant HDCP protected content is displayed but the HDCP protected content cannot be copied and shared. When the source is HDCP compliant and the sink display is not HDCP compliant the copy protected material cannot be displayed copied and or shared. When the source is HDCP compliant and the sink display is not HDCP compliant a non copy protected material can be displayed copied and or shared.

HDCP is designed to prevent copying and sharing of copy protected material. There are issues with interoperability when the material itself is non copy protected. For example when an HDCP compliant source such as a laptop is connected to an HDCP compliant sink display device non HDCP protected content cannot for example be copied shared and replayed at a later time even though the non HDCP protected content can be displayed on the sink display device. Many HDCP compliant sources such as laptops choose to enable disable content encryption based on the downstream display s HDCP capabilities. These devices do not care if the real time video content is actually copy protected or non copy protected and will leave content encryption enabled as soon as the device sees an HDCP compliant sink display. In the academic field for example a university instructor may want students to copy and share content material that is not copy protected e.g. the professor s PowerPoint presentation . Even though the content is non copy protected the students will not be able to copy replay or share the content because the source and sink display devices are HDCP compliant.

Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to correct interoperability issues related to HDCP. The present invention provides a system apparatus and method for enabling disabling Display Data Channel access to enable disable HDCP.

It is to be understood that both the general and detailed descriptions that follow are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention.

Principles of the invention provide a system apparatus and method for enabling disabling Display Data Channel access to enable disable a security protocol such as HDCP. For example in a first aspect of the invention a system for enabling disabling Display Data Channel DDC access to enable disable a security protocol comprises at least one source at least one sink and a switcher device communicatively coupled in between the at least one source and the at least one sink. The switcher device comprises a multiplexer coupled in between at least one input and output cards and configured to transmit an audiovisual signal from the at least one input card to a first and at least a second output card via a physical connection. The multiplexer is configured to dynamically switch between the first and at least second output card based on a user control signal that activates one of the at least one sinks. Each of the output cards is coupled to the at least one sink. The input card comprises an integrated circuit that includes a security protocol enabled receiver and a switch coupled in between the security protocol enabled receiver and an Extended Display Identification Data EDID memory. The input card is configured to detect the presence of an event signal from at least one user interfaced device. In response to the detection of the event signal the switch dynamically switches to a closed position in order to enable the at least one source to authenticate with the input card and the output card to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. In response to the non detection of the event signal the switch switches dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from authenticating with the input card therefore the output card also does not attempt to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption.

In a second aspect of the invention a switcher device comprises a multiplexer coupled in between at least one input and output cards and configured to transmit an audiovisual data signal from the at least one input card to a first and at least a second output card. The multiplexer is configured to dynamically switch between the first and at least second output card based on a user control signal that activates one of at least one sinks. Each of the output cards is coupled to the at least one sink. The input card comprises an integrated circuit that includes a High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP enabled receiver and a switch coupled in between the HDCP enabled receiver and an Extended Display Identification Data EDID memory. The at least one input card is configured to detect the presence of an event signal from the at least one user interface device. In response to the detection of the event signal the switch is configured to dynamically switch to a closed position in order to enable the at least one source configured to authenticate with the input card and the output card configured to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. In response to the non detection of the event signal the switch is configured to dynamically switch to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card therefore the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption.

In a third aspect of the invention a method for enabling disabling Display Data Channel DDC access to enable disable High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection comprises detecting a user control signal to activate one of at least one sinks. The method further comprises in response to the detection of the user control signal enabling the selected at least one sink for receiving audiovisual signal and detecting an event signal. In response to the detection of the event signal switching the switch dynamically to a closed position for enabling the at least one source to authenticate with the input card and enabling the output card to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. The method further comprises permitting the transmission of audiovisual signal from the at least one source to the enabled at least one sink upon successful authentication and disabling control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to record since the audiovisual signal contains copy protected content. In response to the non detection of the event signal switching the switch dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card therefore the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. The method further comprises permitting the transmission of the audiovisual signal to be displayed from the at least one source to the enabled at least one sink and enabling control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to be recorded since the audiovisual signal contains non copy protected content.

In a fourth aspect of the invention an integrated circuit comprises an enabled High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection HDCP receiver an Extended Display Identification Data EDID memory and a switch coupled in between the security protocol enabled receiver and the EDID memory. The integrated circuit is configured to detect the presence of an event signal from at least one user interface device. In response to the detection of the event signal the switch is configured to dynamically switch to a closed position in order to enable the at least one source configured to authenticate with the input card and the output card configured to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. In response to the non detection of the event signal the switch is configured to dynamically switch to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card therefore the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption.

In a fifth aspect of the invention a computer program product for enabling and disabling a security protocol the computer program product comprises a computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code embodied therewith. The computer readable program code comprises computer readable program code configured to detect a user control signal to activate one of at least one sinks in response to the detection of the user control signal enabling the selected at least one sink for receiving audiovisual signal detect an event signal wherein in response to the detection of the event signal switching the switcher dynamically to a closed position for enabling the at least one source to authenticate with the input card and enabling the output card to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption permit the transmission of audiovisual signal from the at least one source to the enabled at least one sink upon successful authentication and disable control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to be recorded since the audiovisual signal contains copy protected content wherein in response to the non detection of the event signal switch the switch dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card therefore the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption permit the transmission of the audiovisual signal to be displayed from the at least one source to the enabled at least one sink and enable control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to record since the audiovisual signal contains non copy protected content.

The present invention seeks to overcome or at least ameliorate one or more of several problems including but not limited to the ability to view copy and share non copy protected content on source and sink display devices that are HDCP compliant.

The foregoing will be apparent from the following more particular description of example embodiments of the invention as illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to the same parts throughout the different views. The drawings are not necessarily to scale emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating embodiments of the present invention.

Authorized device An HDCP device that is permitted access to HDCP content.

Upstream Term used as an adjective to refer to being towards the source of the HDCP content stream. The antonym of downstream defined above.

There are three facets of the content protection system. First there is the authentication protocol through which the HDCP transmitter verifies that a given HDCP receiver is licensed to receive HDCP content . Second the legitimacy of the HDCP receiver determined encrypted HDCP content is transmitted between the two devices based on shared secrets established during the authentication protocol. The use of such shared secrets prevents eavesdropping devices from utilizing the content. Finally in the event that legitimate devices are compromised to permit unauthorized use of HDCP content renewability allows an HDCP transmitter to identify such compromised devices and prevent the transmission of HDCP content .

The HDCP authentication protocol is an exchange between an HDCP transmitter and an HDCP receiver that affirms to the HDCP transmitter that the HDCP receiver is authorized to receive HDCP content . That affirmation is in the form of the HDCP receiver demonstrating knowledge of a set of secret device keys . Each HDCP device is provided with a unique set of secret device keys referred to as the Device Private Keys from Digital Content Protection LLC. DCP . The communication exchange which allows for the receiver to demonstrate knowledge of such secret device keys also provides for both HDCP devices to generate a shared secret value that cannot be determined by eavesdropping on that exchange. By having that shared secret information embedded into the demonstration of authorization the shared secret can then be used as a symmetric key to encrypt HDCP content intended only for the authorized device. Thus a communication path is established between the HDCP transmitter and HDCP receiver that only authorized devices can access.

Device manufacturers typically purchase HDCP chips from a DCP licensed silicon vendor. These chips usually also provide Transition Minimized Differential Signaling TMDS encoders or decoders and other HDMI specific features. Every transmitter will have at least one HDCP transmitter chip and every receiver will have at least one HDCP receiver chip. The HDCP transmitters and receivers frequently require a microprocessor to implement the authentication state machines. Transmitters are HDMI transmitters.

Keys Each HDCP transmitter and receiver has forty unique 56 bit private keys. These keys are provided by DCP to licensed HDCP chip vendors who pre load the keys onto the chips before selling them to device manufacturers. These keys must never leave the chip and may not be read by any other device.

KSVs Each HDCP chip also has a public 40 bit value known as the Key Selection Vector KSV . Each KSV consists of twenty binary 1s and twenty binary 0s. The KSVs and keys of all licensed HDCP devices are mathematically related according to a cryptographic key exchange protocol similar to Blom s scheme. In this scheme any two licensed devices can swap KSVs and use them along with their private keys to come up with a shared secret key. This shared key can be used to encrypt and decrypt the TMDS stream. The KSV can also be used to uniquely identify a transmitter or receiver.

HDCP cipher Each chip must implement the HDCP cipher. The cipher accepts a seed value and uses it to generate a deterministic pseudo random stream of data. All HDCP cipher implementations should generate the same output stream given the same seed value. This publicly defined cipher is used during both authentication and encryption.

Registers Each HDCP receiver provides a series of pre defined Digital Display Channel DDC accessible registers. All of the HDCP communications between the source and sink display occurs by the source reading from and writing to these registers.

Part 1 The source authenticates with the sink display connected to its output. If successful encryption is enabled and audiovisual A V content transmission begins.

Part 2 This part is used if the downstream device is a repeater . The repeater authenticates with the devices connected to its output s and passes the HDCP tree topology information up to the source . The source is the root and sinks displays are the leaves while repeaters make up the branches of the tree.

Part 3 The source performs periodic checks with the sink display to ensure that encryption is in sync. HDCP also supports a key revocation mechanism that is designed to prevent content from being transmitted to known hacked devices. If any part of authentication fails or any revoked devices are found in the HDCP tree the transmitter must stop sending protected content and authentication starts over at Part 1. Authentication encryption and revocation are described in detail in the following sections.

Part 1 of authentication is a key exchange protocol. The transmitter and receiver calculate a common secret session key to be used for encryption. If they cannot come up with the same key value authentication fails and the receiver will not be able to decrypt the content . The session key is derived from each device s private key according to the following protocol 

First the transmitter generates a random number An and sends it to the receiver . This value will be used later in the protocol. The devices then exchange KSVs. The receiver also sends its REPEATER bit a flag that indicates whether or not it is part of a repeater. Now each device has the other device s Key Selection Vector KSV . Each device uses the other device s Key Selection Vector to select twenty of its own keys. The forty bits in the KSV correspond to the indexes of each of the forty private keys. For every set bit in the received KSV the local private key at that index is selected. All KSVs have twenty set bits so twenty keys are selected. The devices then each add up their selected keys to come up with the sums Km and Km for the transmitter and receiver respectively . For authentication to succeed Km and Km must match. Each device tells the other which of its own unique secret keys to select and they both come up with the same sum. That may seem counter intuitive but it is the aforementioned mathematical relationship between the keys and the KSVs that accounts for this behavior. The source must determine whether Km and Km match. However they are secret values so they cannot be transmitted over the interface cable or physical connection for the DDC. Each device feeds Km or Km the random number An and the REPEATER bit into their respective HDCP cipher engines in order for the transmitter to verify that the values match without sending them across the cable for everyone to see. The resulting data stream is split into three values 

R0 R0 This return value may be shared between the devices and is used to verify that authentication was successful.

M0 M This value is also kept private and is used in Part 2 of authentication if the downstream device is a repeater .

The receiver sends R0 to the transmitter which compares it against its own R0 value. If they match that proves that the sums Km and Km matched and authentication is successful. Furthermore the session keys Ks and K match so the receiver will be able to decrypt the content encrypted by the transmitter. If Part 1 of authentication was successful the transmitter may begin sending encrypted content . If the downstream device is a repeater the repeater must authenticate with its own downstream device according to the same protocol. The transmitter then starts a 5 second timer to allow for the repeater to perform Part 2 of authentication. If Part 2 fails or times out authentication fails and the transmitter must stop transmitting the protected content .

Part 2 of authentication only occurs if the downstream device is a repeater . The purpose of Part 2 is to inform the source of all downstream devices and the HDCP tree depth. The source uses this information to ensure that the tree topology maximums have not been exceeded and to ensure that none of the downstream devices have been revoked by DCP. The repeater first assembles a list of the KSVs of all downstream devices as well as the device count and the tree depth. The repeater then passes this information up to the source . To ensure that this information hasn t been tampered with during transmission each device takes this list appends its secret value M0 M0 from Part 1 and calculates a SHA 1 hash of the whole thing. The transmitter reads the hash result from the receiver and compares it against its own. If they match Part 2 of authentication is successful.

All HDCP devices are considered authenticated after successful completion of Authentication Parts 1 and 2. Part 3 is simply a link integrity check to ensure that encryption is in sync between all transmitter receiver pairs in the tree. To support link integrity checks the return values Ri and Ri roll over to a new value every 128 frames. Recall that the initial Ri values R0 and R0 were generated during Part 1 of authentication. Every two seconds the transmitter compares the receiver s Ri value against its own Ri value to see if they match. If they do not encryption is out of sync and the receiver cannot correctly decrypt the content . The user will see a scrambled or snowy image on the screen. In this case the transmitter must restart authentication from the beginning.

The transmitter uses the HDCP cipher engine to encrypt the content . The session key Ks from Authentication Part 1 is used as the seed value and the cipher output stream is simply XORed with the audiovisual content. The transmitter then sends the XOR output to the receiver as the encrypted data stream. To decrypt the data the HDCP receiver seeds its own cipher engine with its matching value Ks . Since Ks equals Ks the cipher output matches that of the transmitter . The receiver then XORs its cipher output stream with the encrypted data and the output is the decrypted audiovisual content .

The HDCP designers recognized that despite their best efforts private device keys could possibly be compromised. If such a compromise were discovered the designers wanted a method by which they could prevent content from being sent to the compromised units. To this end HDCP sources are required to manage System Renewability Messages SRMs . SRMs carry a list of revoked KSVs that may be provided with the audiovisual content. For instance a SRM could be stored on an HD DVD or may be transmitted with a cable television signal. If presented with an SRM the HDCP source must check all the downstream KSVs obtained during Parts 1 and 2 against the KSVs listed in the SRM. If there are any matches the HDCP source must stop transmitting the protected content. SRMs are only supported by the HDCP source neither repeaters nor sink displays handle SRMs.

HDCP eliminates the possibility of intercepting digital data midstream between the source to the sink display because of the authentication process as described above. However in some situation when the source and the sink display are HDCP compliant non HDCP content cannot be recorded and shared. This is an issue for example in a university setting where instructors want students to have the ability to copy and share non HDCP content. More specifically the use of laptops during a university lecture by instructors and students has become common particularly when wireless networks allow free campus internet access. The instructors may show a PowerPoint presentation of the lecture and want students to view record and or copy the presentation. Additionally some university professors are aware of the needs of disabled students who require laptops to take notes and or copy the presentation.

With HDCP compliant source and sink display devices students will not be able to copy and or record presentation. As will be explained below the present invention discloses system apparatus and method for allowing the non copy protected content to be recorded and or shared when the source that is HDCP compliant and a sink display that is HDCP compliant or not . The present invention discloses that the source does not recognize the sink display to be HDCP compliant when the sink display itself is HDCP compliant. As a result the authentication process never occurs and hence failure of authentication is not possible. The HDCP compliant source proceeds to transmit the non HDCP content to the HDCP compliant sink display even though the sink display is HDCP compliant.

Some sinks displays may include an HDCP compliant receiver. Other sinks displays may not include an HDCP compliant receiver. The source determines via the authentication process what content can be viewed recorded and shared based on sinks displays that support HDCP and sinks displays that do not support HDCP. The output of the source is connected to an input of a switcher device through its HDCP protected interfaces. It should be understood that the switcher device could be any device or apparatus that is capable of enabling connecting disabling disconnecting an I2C signal used in DDC communication such as a relay FET switch I2C buffer mux and digital logic.

The output of the switcher device is connected to the input of the sink display via another interface . The interface for the input and the output of the switcher device may be an HDMI cable that carries a variety of signals such as Transition Minimized Differential Signaling TMDS Digital Display Channel DDC Hot Plug Detect HPD and 5 volt.

When an HDCP source more specifically source detects an HPD signal from an HDCP compliant sink display more specifically sink display the source will transmit the HDCP content to the sink display after the authentication process is successful.

The audiovisual data is encoded into three data channels. These channels and a TMDS clock are carried over four differential pairs from the source to the sink display . The DDC is a communications interface similar to I2C. This interface provides two way communication in a master slave relationship. The upstream device is the DDC master and the downstream device is the DDC slave. The sink display indicates its presence to the source with the HPD signal. The sink display can toggle the HPD signal to reset the HDMI connection and thus the HDCP session . Though not specifically defined by HDMI many devices support a feature known as RxSense. There is no RxSense wire but rather sources can detect that a sink display has terminated the TMDS differential pairs. Similarly to HPD this signal can be used to detect the presence of a sink display . The HDCP transmitter is the HDCP Device most upstream and receives the HDCP content from an upstream content control function .

The switcher device is a fully modular and expandable matrix switcher offering low latency digital video and audio switching and HD lossless multi room signal distribution for all types of A V sources. The switcher device may be a CRESTRON DIGITAL MEDIA SWITCHER available from Crestron Electronics Inc. of Rockleigh N.J. The CRESTRON DIGITAL MEDIA SWITCHER is a field configurable to handle but not limited to 8 16 or 32 audiovisual sources of virtually any type. The outputs are also field configurable to provide but not limited to 8 16 or 32 room outputs and or HDMI outputs in a single chassis. The switcher device includes a multiplexer coupled in between the at least one input card collectively and at least one output card collectively .

The multiplexer transmits an audiovisual data signal from the at least one input card to a first and at least a second output card . The multiplexer dynamically switches between the first and at least second output cards based on a user control signal that activates one of the at least one sinks displays . Each of the output cards is coupled to the at least one sink display via interface cable physical connection . The switcher further includes a processing unit coupled to the multiplexer . The processing unit includes at least one transceiver for bidirectional communications with user interface devices e.g. in part to receive the user control signal and event signal . The user interface device transmits the user control signal from a touch panel display via a control system . An end user may also transmit the user control signal from a wireless device . Software tools may be loaded onto the wireless device and or touch panel to assist the end user in selecting a desired sink display . In response to the user activating the desired sink or display the end user device transmits the user control signal to the switcher . A user interface device may be a display device such as but not limited to a graphical user interface GUI touch panel mobile device tablet projector desktop computer and laptop.

In response to the non detection of the event signal the switch switches dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card . Therefore the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. Since the source does not detect the HDCP capability of the input card authentication never occurs or more specifically an attempt to authenticate never happened therefore a failed authentication never occurred.

More specifically when the source fails authentication or changes the resolution of the multimedia data or changes the resolution of the sink the reestablishment and encoding decoding of the HDCP become unstable such that the sink cannot display the multimedia data normally. The source uses a hot plug detect signal of the HDMI interface to identify the coupling state between the sink and the source . When the hot plug detect signal is a logic high level pulse signal the source and the sink are in a coupled state. In the conventional art in order to solve the problem that the sink does not function normally it may be required to disconnect and connect the HDMI connector again or restart the source to enable the source to read the EDID again and reestablish the HDCP.

Continuing on to the operation typically the source initially authenticates with the input card . Once that authentication is successful the output card then authenticates with the sink . In one embodiment when the input card does not detect the event signal the switch switches dynamically to an open position in order to disable the source from initiating authentication with the input card . As a result the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with sink for security protocol encryption. The non copy protected content is still transmitted to the sink display even though the source and the sink display are HDCP compliant. Moreover the end user can copy and or share the non copy protected content. Without in part the switch and its placement thereof the non copy protected content will not be able to be shared and or recorded when the source and the sink display are HDCP compliant.

Typically if an end user wants to switch between watching copy protected content HDCP required or watching recording non copy protected content such as a PowerPoint in a lecture scenario the end user installs two different AV distribution switcher infrastructure. One AV switcher supports HDCP and another AV switcher does not support HDCP. When the customer wants to watch copy protected content the end user physically plugs into the HDCP supported AV switcher and when the end user wants to watch record lectures the end user plugs into a different system. The present disclosure allows a single AN switcher system to be used so that the end user does not need to physically change the cable positioning. Moreover the present disclosure saves resources and complexities because separate systems do not need to be setup.

It should be understood that there may be more than one source and sink display connected to the system . It should also be understood that there may be more than one input card collectively with similar electrical connections and physical layouts.

The following is a pseudo code representation of the operation in accordance with an illustrative embodiment of the present invention.

Wait until hot plug signal goes away based on measurements such as sync measurements and sync detect.

In step the system e.g. or apparatus e.g. detects an event signal from at least one user interface device . In response to the detection of the event signal the switch switches dynamically to a closed position for enabling the at least one source to authenticate with the input card and enabling the output card to authenticate with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption in step . The system e.g. or apparatus e.g. permits the transmission of audiovisual signal or HDCP content from the at least one source to the enabled at least one sink upon successful authentication between the at least one source and the activated at least one sink in step . In step the system e.g. or apparatus e.g. disables control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to record the audiovisual signal that contains copy protected content e.g. HDCP content from being able to be recorded and shared.

In response to the system e.g. or apparatus e.g. not detecting the event signal the switch switches dynamically to an open position in order to disable the at least one source from initiating an authentication with the input card in step . To this end the output card also does not attempt to initiate an authentication with the at least one sink for security protocol encryption. In step the system e.g. or apparatus e.g. permits transmission of the audiovisual signal e.g. HDCP content to be displayed from the at least one source onto the activated at least one sink . In step the system e.g. or apparatus e.g. enables control of the enabled at least one sink from being able to record since the audiovisual signal contains non copy protected content.

Any process descriptions or blocks in flow charts should be understood as representing modules segments or portions of code that include one or more executable instructions for implementing specific logical functions or steps in the process. Alternate implementations are included within the scope of the preferred embodiment of the present invention in which functions may be executed out of order from that shown or discussed including substantial concurrence or reverse order depending on the functionality involved as would be understood by those reasonably skilled in the art of the present invention. Also steps disclosed as separate may be performed concurrently or combined and a step shown as discrete may be performed as two or more steps. Furthermore numerical values and disclosures of specific hardware are illustrative rather than limiting. Moreover while the preferred embodiment has been disclosed in the context of DVI the invention can be implemented for use with another suitable interface that uses HDCP such as HDMI or any substantially DVI like interference. Therefore the present invention should be construed as limited only by the appended claims.

To solve the aforementioned problems the present invention is a unique method apparatus and system for enabling and or disabling dynamic Display Identification Data to enable and or disable High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection without an authentication process.

It is to be understood that both the general and detailed descriptions above are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention. It should be understood that the invention can be implemented in a DVI or HDMI capable set top box. While the invention has been disclosed for use with HDCP it can be used with any other security protocol that satisfies the following two attributes. The first attribute is that the security protocol is tied to the video content being transmitted that is if the video attributes change the security protocol must be renegotiated. The second attribute is that the security protocol offers a way to determine or detect whether the remote device is capable of supporting the security protocol.

At least a portion of the input card e.g. of the present invention may be implemented in an integrated circuit. In forming integrated circuits a plurality of identical die is typically fabricated in a repeated pattern on a surface of a semiconductor wafer. Each die includes a device described herein and may include other structures and or circuits. The individual die are cut or diced from the wafer then packaged as an integrated circuit. One skilled in the art would know how to dice wafers and package die to produce integrated circuits. Integrated circuits so manufactured are considered part of this invention.

In this description various functions and operations may be described as being performed by or caused by software code to simplify description. However those skilled in the art will recognize what is meant by such expressions is that the functions result from execution of the code by a processor such as a microprocessor. Alternatively or in combination the functions and operations can be implemented using special purpose circuitry with or without software instructions such as using Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC or Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA . Embodiments can be implemented using hardwired circuitry without software instructions or in combination with software instructions. Thus the techniques are limited neither to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

While some embodiments can be implemented in fully functioning computers and computer systems various embodiments are capable of being distributed as a computing product in a variety of forms and are capable of being applied regardless of the particular type of machine or computer readable media used to actually effect the distribution.

At least some aspects disclosed can be embodied at least in part in software. That is the techniques may be carried out in a computer system or other data processing system in response to its processor such as a microprocessor executing sequences of instructions contained in a memory such as ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory cache or a remote storage device.

Routines executed to implement the embodiments may be implemented as part of an operating system middleware service delivery platform SDK Software Development Kit component web services or other specific application component program object module or sequence of instructions referred to as computer programs. Invocation interfaces to these routines can be exposed to a software development community as an API Application Programming Interface . The computer programs typically comprise one or more instructions set at various times in various memory and storage devices in a computer and that when read and executed by one or more processors in a computer cause the computer to perform operations necessary to execute elements involving the various aspects.

A machine readable medium can be used to store software and data which when executed by a data processing system causes the system to perform various methods. The executable software and data may be stored in various places including for example ROM volatile RAM non volatile memory and or cache. Portions of this software and or data may be stored in any one of these storage devices. Further the data and instructions can be obtained from centralized servers or peer to peer networks. Different portions of the data and instructions can be obtained from different centralized servers and or peer to peer networks at different times and in different communication sessions or in a same communication session. The data and instructions can be obtained in their entirety prior to the execution of the applications. Alternatively portions of the data and instructions can be obtained dynamically just in time when needed for execution. Thus it is not required that the data and instructions be on a machine readable medium in entirety at a particular instance of time.

Examples of computer readable media include but are not limited to recordable and non recordable type media such as volatile and non volatile memory devices read only memory ROM random access memory RAM flash memory devices floppy and other removable disks magnetic disk storage media optical storage media e.g. Compact Disk Read Only Memory CD ROMS Digital Versatile Disks DVDs etc. among others. The instructions may be embodied in digital and analog communication links for electrical optical acoustical or other forms of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc.

In general a machine readable medium includes any mechanism that provides i.e. stores and or transmits information in a form accessible by a machine e.g. a computer network device personal digital assistant manufacturing tool any device with a set of one or more processors etc. .

In various embodiments hardwired circuitry may be used in combination with software instructions to implement the techniques. Thus the techniques are neither limited to any specific combination of hardware circuitry and software nor to any particular source for the instructions executed by the data processing system.

Although some of the drawings illustrate a number of operations in a particular order operations which are not order dependent may be reordered and other operations may be combined or broken out. While some reordering or other groupings are specifically mentioned others will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art and so do not present an exhaustive list of alternatives. Moreover it should be recognized that the stages could be implemented in hardware firmware software or any combination thereof.

Although illustrative embodiments of the present invention have been described herein with reference to the accompanying drawings it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments and that various other changes and modifications may be made therein by one skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the appended claims.
