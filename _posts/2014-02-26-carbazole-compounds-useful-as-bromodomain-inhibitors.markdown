This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 769 996 filed Feb. 27 2013 the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The invention relates to compounds pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds and to their use in therapy.

The genomes of eukaryotic organisms are highly organized within the nucleus of the cell. The long strands of duplex DNA are wrapped around an octomer of histone proteins to form a nucleosome. This basic unit is then further compressed by the aggregation and folding of nucleosomes to form a highly condensed chromatin structure. A range of different states of condensation are possible and the tightness of this structure varies during the cell cycle being most compact during the process of cell division. There has been appreciation recently that chromatin templates form a fundamentally important set of gene control mechanisms referred to as epigenetic regulation. By conferring a wide range of specific chemical modifications to histones and DNA such as acetylation methylation phosphorylation ubiquitinylation and SUMOylation epigenetic regulators modulate the structure function and accessibility of our genome thereby exerting a huge impact in gene expression.

Histone acetylation is most usually associated with the activation of gene transcription as the modification loosens the interaction of the DNA and the histone octomer by changing the electrostatics. In addition to this physical change specific proteins bind to acetylated lysine residues within histones to read the epigenetic code. Bromodomains are small 110 amino acid distinct domains within proteins that bind to acetylated lysine resides commonly but not exclusively in the context of histones. There is a family of around 50 proteins known to contain bromodomains and they have a range of functions within the cell. The BET family of bromodomain containing proteins comprises 4 proteins BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRD T which contain tandem bromodomains capable of binding to two acetylated lysine residues in close proximity increasing tile specificity of the interaction.

BRD2 and BRD3 are reported to associate with histones along actively transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation Leroy et al Mol. Cell. 2008 30 1 51 60 while BRD4 appears to be involved in the recruitment of the pTEF 13 complex to inducible genes resulting in phosphorylation of RNA polymerase and increased transcriptional output Hargreaves et al Cell 2009 138 1 1294145 . All family members have been reported to have some function in controlling or executing aspects of the cell cycle and have been shown to remain in complex with chromosomes during cell division suggesting a role in the maintenance of epigenetic memory. In addition some viruses make use of these proteins to tether their genomes to the host cell chromatin as part of the process of viral replication You et al Cell 2004 117 3 349 60 .

Small molecule BET inhibitors that are reported to be in development include GSK 525762 A OTX 015 as well as others from the University of Oxford and Constellation Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Hundreds of epigenetic effectors have been identified many of which are chromatin binding proteins or chromatin modifying enzymes. These proteins have been associated with a variety of disorders such as neurodegenerative disorders metabolic diseases inflammation and cancer. Thus these compounds which inhibit the binding of a bromodomain with its cognate acetylated proteins promise new approaches in the treatment of a range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases or conditions and in the treatment of various types of cancer.

In addition to apoptosis defects found in tumors defects in the ability to eliminate self reactive cells of the immune system due to apoptosis resistance are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune diseases are characterized in that the cells of the immune system produce antibodies against its own organs and molecules or directly attack tissues resulting in the destruction of the latter. A failure of those self reactive cells to undergo apoptosis leads to the manifestation of the disease. Defects in apoptosis regulation have been identified in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Examples of suitable aqueous and non aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include water ethanol polyols such as glycerol propylene glycol polyethylene glycol and the like and suitable mixtures thereof vegetable oils such as olive oil and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained for example by the use of coating materials such as lecithin by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants.

These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives wetting agents emulsifying agents and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms upon the subject compounds may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents for example paraben chlorobutanol phenol sorbic acid and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars sodium chloride and the like into the compositions. In addition prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

In some cases in order to prolong the effect of a drug it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material having poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which in turn may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsuled matrices of the subject compounds in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide polyglycolide. Depending on the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly orthoesters and poly anhydrides . Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissue.

When the compounds of the present invention are administered as pharmaceuticals to humans and animals they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition containing for example 0.1 to 99 more preferably 10 to 30 of active ingredient in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Regardless of the route of administration selected the compounds of the present invention which may be used in a suitable hydrated form and or the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art.

Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient composition and mode of administration without being toxic to the patient.

The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the particular compound of the present invention employed or the ester salt or amide thereof the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed the rate and extent of absorption the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors well known in the medical arts.

A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example the physician or veterinarian could start doses of the compounds of the invention employed in the pharmaceutical composition at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.

In general a suitable daily dose of a compound of the invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally oral intravenous intracerebroventricular and subcutaneous doses of the compounds of this invention for a patient will range from about 0.01 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.

If desired the effective daily dose of the active compound may be administered as two three four five six or more sub doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day optionally in unit dosage forms. In certain aspects of the invention dosing is one administration per day.

While it is possible for a compound of the present invention to be administered alone it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation composition .

The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also in the description of the synthetic methods described below it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions including choice of solvent reaction atmosphere reaction temperature duration of the experiment and work up procedures are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used.

Compounds of Formula I may be prepared by reference to the methods illustrated in the following Schemes. As shown therein the end product is a compound having the same structural formula as Formula I . It will be understood that any compound of Formula I may be produced by the schemes by the suitable selection of reagents with appropriate substitution. Solvents temperatures pressures and other reaction conditions may readily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Starting materials are commercially available or readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. Constituents of compounds are as defined herein or elsewhere in the specification.

Synthesis of the carbazole core of compounds of Formula I can be accomplished using a variety of methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art and have been recently reviewed in the literature Tetrahedron 2012 6099 6121 Chemical Reviews 2002 102 4303 4427. A few examples of alternate synthesis of carbazoles of Formula I are summarized in Schemes 1 3 below.

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of Formula I using a Fischer indolization reaction to form the carbazole core.

As shown in Scheme 1 a general procedure for the preparation of the compounds of the invention involves starting with the substituted aniline 1. The R and A substituents are defined previously in the text or a functional group that can be converted to the desired final substituent. The substituent X is a leaving group such as a halogen or OH that can be easily converted to a leaving group such as a triflate. The Y is a boronic acid boronic ester or stannane. The aniline is converted to the corresponding hydrazine typically using aqueous sodium nitrate and concentrated HCl. The product hydrazine hydrochloride is then condensed with the substituted cyclohexanone 3 using a variety of Fischer Indolization conditions known in the literature. For example the use of acetic acid at reflux to furnish the Fischer indole product the tetrandrocarbazole 4 which in cases is generated as a mixture of regioisomers. The regioisomers can separated or carried forward as a mixture in subsequent reactions and separated as a later intermediate.

The tetrandrocarbazole 4 can then be converted to the carbazole 5 using a variety of methods known in the literature for example with the use of oxidizing agent such as DDQ. A Suzuki or Stille reaction between carbazole 5 where X halogen and the aromatic heterocycle A where Y Boronic acid ester or stannane using a suitable Pd catalyst such as PdCl dppf then gives carbazole 7. The Suzuki or Stille partners could be switched such that the carbazole 5 could be the organometallic partner where X boronic acid boronic ester or stannane and the aromatic heterocycle A where Y halide is the halogen containing partner.

In the final step the products of the invention were prepared in a displacement reaction between the carbazole 7 and an the alkylating or acylating agent 8 where X is a leaving group such as an halide or mesylate or triflate or acid chloride or sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate and a catalyst such as 18 crown 6. Alternatively the carbazole nitrogen can be substituted under Mitsunobu conditions using triphenylphosphine and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate DIAD using alkylating agent 8 where X is OH .

An alternative synthesis of carbazole 7 is shown in Scheme 2. As shown in Scheme 2 a Suzuki reaction between the starting substituted aniline 1 where X halogen and the aromatic heterocycle A where Y Boronic acid or ester using a suitable Pd catalyst such as PdCl dppf gives the substituted aniline 10. The Suzuki partners could be switched such that the aniline 1 could be the boronic acid partner where X boronic acid or boronic ester and the aromatic heterocycle A where Y halide is the halogen containing partner. The resulting aniline 10 can then undergo a Buchwald N arylation reaction with a suitably substituted phenyl 11 where X halogen to give the diphenyl aniline 12. The aniline 12 can then undergo a Pd catalyzed cyclization to give the carbazole 7 under a variety of conditions such as heating with pivalic acid in air in the presence of Pd Ac . The carbazole 7 can then be further used as discussed in Scheme 1.

Another alternative synthesis of the carbazole core is the use of the Cadogan reaction as shown in Scheme 3. A Suzuki reaction between the nitrobenzene 14 where Y boronic acid or ester and the substituted phenyl halide 13 where X and Xare different halides where the Xis more reactive one ie. X iodide gives the biphenyl 15. The nitro biphenyl intermediate 15 undergoes a reductive cyclization Cadogan reaction in the presence of PhP to give the carbazole 5. The intermediate carbazole 5 can then be further elaborated as outline in Scheme 1.

The invention is further defined in the following Examples. It should be understood that the Examples are given by way of illustration only. From the above discussion and the Examples one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of the invention and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof can make various changes and modifications to adapt the invention to various uses and conditions. As a result the invention is not limited by the illustrative examples set forth hereinbelow but rather is defined by the claims appended hereto.

Each of the recombinant vectors were co transformed into BL21 STAR DE3 together with a plasmid encoding BirA under chloramphenicol selection. The transformed cells were cultured at 37 C. in 2.5 L Thomson Ultra Yield shaker flasks containing 1 L M9 CAS medium Teknova supplemented with 40 g ml kanamycin 35 g ml chloramphenicol and 100 M biotin. At a cell density corresponding to an OD600 nm 0.6 the cultures were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and incubated in the shaker for an additional 20 hours at 20 C. The cell pellets were harvested by sedimentation and lysed by sonication in buffer containing 0.1 mg ml lysozyme. Each sample was clarified by sedimentation and the supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap affinity column. The column was washed and then eluted with an imidazole gradient. The peak protein fractions containing the bromodomain protein were pooled and incubated for 18 hours at 4 C. with purified His TVMV protease 1 15 mass ratio of TVMV BRD4 protein . The sample was exchanged into low imidazole buffer and passed through a HisTrap column to capture the cleaved His tag and His TVMV enzyme. The protein in the HisTrap column flow through was further purified and exchanged into the final storage buffer PBS pH 7.0 5 Glycerol 1 mM DTT by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. To improve purity the BRD4 1 477 and BRD4 44 460 proteins were subjected to an additional cation exchange chromatography purification step prior to size exclusion chromatography. Essentially quantitative mono biotinylation 226 Da of each protein was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis on the final sample. The purified samples were divided into aliquots flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C.

The binding of compounds to bromodomain BRD4 44 168 BRD4 333 460 and BRD4 1 477 or 44 460 was assessed using a time resolved fluorescent resonance energy transfer binding assay 1 that measures the binding of a fluorescently labeled probe molecule to the bromodomain protein. The bromodomain protein fluorescent probe molecule either a biotinylated histone peptide or a fluorescently labeled small molecule and dose responsed test compound are incubated together to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. In the absence of a test compound the bromodomain and small molecule are bound resulting in a high fluorescent signal. In the presence of a sufficient concentration of inhibitor this intercation is disrupted resulting in a lost of fluorescent resonance energy transfer.

All assay components were dissolved in buffer composition 20 mM Hepes pH 7.5 150 mM NaCl 5 mM DTT 0.005 Tween 20 and 100 ug ml BSA for BRD4 1 477 and 44 460 . The final concentrations of the bromodomain proteins are 1.6 nM BRD4 44 168 1 nM BRD4 333 460 and 1 nM BRD4 1 477 or 44 460 and the fluorescent probe molecule is 100 nM 50 nM and 7.5 nM respectively. All proteins were biotinylated. A streptavidin labeled with terbium cryptate Cisbio SA Tb was used as detection and pre mixed with the bromodomain protein at a final concentration of 0.2 nM. In some instances for BRD4 44 460 anti His terbium cryptate was used as a detection. 7.5 nl of dose responsed test compound or dmso vehicle 0.0375 was pre spotted in a black Corning 384 well plate and 10 ul each of bromodomain detection reagent and fluorescent small molecule solution were added to the plate and the reaction incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were then read on EnVision plate reader ex 340 nm acceptor Em 520 nm and donor Em 615 nm LANCE D400 mirror . Time resolved fluorescence intensity measurements were made at both emissions and the ratio of acceptor donor was calculated and used for data analysis. All data was normalized to 16 high vehicle wells and 8 low reference control wells and then a four parameter curve fit was applied 1 1010 Where a is the minimum b is the Hill slope c is the IC and d is the maximum.

The effect of compound binding on the thermal stability of the bromodomains was measured using a BioRad CFX real time PCR instrument by monitoring the fluorescence enhancement of an external probe SYPRO orange as it binds preferentially to the unfolded protein. The unfolding reactions were carried out in a 384 well plate in a 4 uL volume with 2 8 uM of bromodomain protein 1 2 v v DMSO in buffer containing 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 500 mM NaCl. SYPRO orange dye was added at a dilution of 1 500. Compound concentrations ranged from 1.6 100 uM. Unfolding reactions were monitored by first equilibrating the instrument at 25 C. for 2.4 sec followed by ramping the temperature in 0.5 C. increments from 25 to 95 C. with 60 s equilibration prior to a read at each temperature. Excitation and emission filters for the SYPRO orange dye were set to FRET with the excitation range from 450 490 nm and the emission range from 560 580 nm. The midpoint temperature was determined by calculating the inflection point using the second derivative. The observed temperature shifts were recorded as the difference between the midpoint between a reference well containing protein with dmso but no ligand and a well containing protein with compound.

The thermal shift assay is a biophysical technique that compares the change in unfolding transition temperature of a protein obtained in the presence and absence of a ligand 1 . Typically a fluorescent dye is used to monitor the protein unfolding as the protein is heated. During the unfolding process hydrophobic regions of the protein are exposed resulting in an increase in the dye binding and an increase in fluorescence intensity. The midpoint of the protein unfolding transition is defined as the Tm. A ligand that binds to the protein causes an increase in the protein thermal stability thus increasing the Tm proportionally to both the ligand concentration and its binding affinity.

Tumor cells in complete RPMI growth media Gibco 11875 085 supplemented with 10 FBS were harvested and plated into 384 black clear bottom PDL cell culture plates in 30 ul media with 10 000 cells per well. After compound treatment at 37C for 4 hrs cells were fixed in 4 Formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes and subsequently permeabilized. After washing and blocking the plates were then incubated with anti myc primary antibody 1 1000 Cell Signaling Technology 5605 at RT overnight. The following day cells were washed and blocked before adding secondary antibody Alexa 488 Goat anti Rabbit 1 2000 Invitrogen A11034 at RT in the dark for 1 hr. Cells were subsequently washed and scanned on the Cellomics ArrayScan with 10 objective lens.

Tumor cells were plated at certain seeding densities in 384 well black clear bottom Matrix plates at 40 ul per well and incubated overnight at 37 C. in 5 CO2 before assaying. On the next day one set of cell plates T0 plates were used to determine time zero cell density and 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl 2H tetrazolium from the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non Radioactive Cell proliferation Kit Promega G5440 was added at 4 l well into T0 plates followed by incubation at 37 C. in 5 CO2 for three hours. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured on an Envision reader Perkin Elmer Boston Mass. . On the same day the remaining cell plates T72 plates were treated with compounds at 37 C. in 5 CO2. After 72 hours 4 ul MTS reagents were then added onto those cell plates. The plates were further incubated at 37 C. in 5 CO2 for three hours and the absorbance values at A490 were measured on an Envision reader.

All rodents were obtained from Jackson Laboratory. Bar Harbor Me. and maintained in an ammonia free environment in a defined and pathogen free colony. All mice were quarantined approximately 1 week prior to their use for tumor propagation and drug efficacy testing. Mice were fed food and water ad libitum. The animal care program of Bristol Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute is fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care AAALAC . All experiments were performed in accordance with Bristol Myers Squibb BMS animal test methods and guidelines.

Tumor xenografts were grown and maintained subcutaneously SC in NSG NOD scid IL2 receptor gamma chain knockout mice Jackson Lab . Tumors were propagated as subcutaneous transplants using tumor fragments obtained from donor mice.

The required numbers of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given bilateral subcutaneous implants of two tumor fragments 20 mg with a 13 gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to the pre determined size window tumors outside the range were excluded and animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. There were typically 6 8 mice per treatment and control groups consisting of 10 12 tumors. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment Wt and then again following the last treatment dose Wt . The difference in body weight Wt Wt provides a measure of treatment related toxicity.

Tumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week until the tumors reached a predetermined target size of 0.5 gm or 1 gm depending on the tumor type. Tumor weights mg were estimated from the formula Tumor weight length width 2

Tumor response criteria are expressed in terms of tumor growth inhibition TGI . Tumor growth delay is defined as the difference in time days required for the treated tumors T to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group C . For this purpose the tumor weight of a group is expressed as medium tumor weight MTW .

Activity is defined as the achievement of durable tumor growth inhibition of 50 or greater i.e. TGI 50 for a period equivalent to at least 1 tumor volume doubling time and drug treatment must be for a period equivalent to at least 2 tumor volume doubling time.

Tumor response was also expressed in terms of tumor growth delay and expressed as log cell kill LCK value defined as the difference in time days required for the treated tumors T to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group C .

Whenever possible antitumor activity was determined at a range of dose levels up to the maximum tolerated dose MTD which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity i.e. more than one death occurred. When death occurred the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound s antitumor efficacy.

Potential drug toxicity interaction affecting treatment tolerability is an important consideration in combination chemotherapy trials. Interpretation of combination therapeutic results must be based on comparison of antitumor activity of the best possible response for the single agents versus the combination at comparably tolerated doses. Therefore therapeutic synergism was defined as a therapeutic effect achieved with a tolerated regimen of the combined agents that exceeded the optimal effect achieved at any tolerated dose of monotherapy. Statistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan s generalized Wilcoxon test. Statistical significance was declared at P
