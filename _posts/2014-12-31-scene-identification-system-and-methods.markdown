This application claims priority to and is a non provisional application of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 922 188 filed Dec. 31 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Certain embodiments relate to the field of monitoring systems and devices. Certain aspects are directed to authentication of a scene by insertion of authentication information into the video signal and subsequent verification of the inserted information.

Video surveillance systems play an important role in many different areas such as crime prevention business management and traffic monitoring. Surveillance systems can be found almost everywhere such as banks casinos airports military installations and stores. Due to better resolution and output quality there is a growing trend of replacing analog cameras by digital cameras in the surveillance field. In a digital video surveillance system network or IP based cameras are used instead of traditional analog cameras which capture images and convert to digital formats right away and transmit the video data to a network based video recorder NVR or video viewing station over a network typically over Ethernet under IP protocol.

Although these network or IP based surveillance systems are gaining popularity there are some shortcomings. One issue concerns security. Because video data from the IP based cameras is sent over a shared network hackers can access the cameras by connecting to the shared network and acquire the sensitive video data or replace video images sent from the camera to the NVR or viewing station. One possible scenario is where a hacker replaces video images sent from the camera to the NVR or viewing station which is generally known as spoofing. Other scenarios include the covert viewing of the video stream or snooping. 

Certain embodiments of a device or system described herein provides for high security delivery of real time video e.g. high definition 1080p and control data over an IP network. Embodiments of the invention provide methods and systems that may be used in discriminating genuine images or video from compromised or fraudulent images or videos. In certain embodiments methods are provided to generate authentication information that is processed concurrently with the images or videos and is used in validation of transmitted images or videos. In certain aspects the data provided by the system device contains an authentication signature or unique identifier. The authentication signature or unique identifier can be used to validate and verify the veracity of the data being gathered and transmitted as well as ensure the data is being securely transmitted. The system device can be configured to meet various encryption and data validation standards e.g. United States Government standards. In certain aspects the system device transmits secured data to one or more end user. In other aspects the system device is configured to inhibit spoofing and or snooping of the data transmission. In one embodiment the authentication signature is encrypted prior to transmission from the authentication information transmitter. The authentication signature is then decoded at the security gateway and processed. In other embodiments the authentication signature is transmitted unencrypted. The authentication signature can then be encrypted once received by the security gateway.

In a further aspect the system device is programmed to provide encryption and Public Key Infrastructure PKI support combined with secure boot secure clock and a tamper proof enclosure capable of zeroizing memory the tamper proof enclosure can be used for the authentication information transmitter the imaging device and or the security gateway. In cryptography zeroization is the practice of erasing critical security parameters CSPs electronically stored data cryptographic seed keys and shared secrets from a cryptographic module to prevent their disclosure if the equipment is captured or compromised which is typically accomplished by altering or deleting the contents to prevent recovery of the data.

The device can include a high bandwidth gigabit network interface that supports the ability to communicate unicast or multicast over existing TCP IP backbones using category cables or optional small form factor pluggable SFP based multi mode or single mode fiber optic connections. Certain embodiments can also support a second network input port for securing existing unsecured IP devices.

In certain aspects the device system can deliver video at full frame rate for up to two simultaneous and individually configurable streams.

Other objects features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description. It should be understood however that the detailed description and the specific examples while indicating specific embodiments of the invention are given by way of illustration only since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.

Embodiments of a monitoring system are illustrated in . The system comprises an authentication information transmitter a monitoring device and a security gateway. In certain aspects the system will be in communication with a client. The monitoring device will be employed to monitor a location or area of interest. An area of interest or location refers to any region where viewing or monitoring is desired. The location or area of interest can be all or part of a room a hallway an entrance a gate an area inside of a building an area outside a building and the like that can be monitored by a monitoring device. In certain aspects the monitoring device comprises an imaging device. An imaging device may include any combination of hardware software firmware detector s image processing systems etc. capable of capturing some form of image e.g. a digital image of the environment within its field of view. An imaging device can be an optical device video camera a thermal infrared imager or any other imaging device. In certain aspects the imaging device is a camera. In certain aspects the imaging device will comprise a detector for non visual authentication signals.

The monitoring device will be configured such that authentication information transmitted by the authentication information transmitter can be gathered or detected by the imaging device concurrently with monitoring a location or area of interest. An image can be a video and may include audio from an area of interest. Data transmitted by a monitoring device can include an image and additional information including but not limited to a device identifier time location etc. The image and additional information can uniquely identify a particular area of interest from a particular spatial position at a particular time or during a particular time period. An image is received by an imaging device which may include sensors such as photoelectric conversion elements e.g. CCDs and can be converted into an image signal. An image signal including authentication information can be converted to a digital signal by an ADC Analog to Digital Converter .

Authentication information can be generated by the authentication information transmitter. illustrates an embodiment of an authentication information transmitter that is configured to provide a position via a global positioning system or firmware encoded coordinates a secure real time clock function time coding function a validation function and one or more signal sources. In certain aspects all or part of the authentication information provided by the device is unpredictable produced by the signal source and presented in the view of or detected by the imaging device and serves to authenticate a particular scene or image. The authentication signal can be directly transmitted to the imaging device or reflected from a surface that is in view of the imaging device e.g. a reflector or reflecting surface. Authentication information can take the form of unpredictable visual and or non visual signals. Visual signals refer to any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be perceived by the human eye. Non visual signal refers to any portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that can be detected by a sensor and not the human eye including the infrared IR and ultraviolet UV portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 760 nm is detected by the human eye and perceived as visible light. Non visual wavelengths include near infrared longer than 760 nm to shorter than 1 mm and ultraviolet longer than 10 nm to shorter than 380 nm . In certain aspects the imaging device has a second detector for non visual signals that are integrated with the image alternatively the imagining device can image electromagnetic radiation within and outside the visible spectrum.

The authentication information transmitter illustrated in can be used to implement a time coded signaling scheme where the codes generated are based off a seed key paired fingerprint that is then passed through cryptography by the transmitter device such that the time coded signal is encrypted to protect it further and prevent someone from sitting and studying the code to reverse engineer it.

In certain aspects the authentication information transmitter s signal source can be comprised of a plurality of light sources. In a further aspect the light sources can be arranged in an ordered array with the same or variable frequencies. The light sources can be light emitting diodes LED or other tunable electromagnetic generating devices. In certain aspects the light source is capable of generating frequencies needed to achieve the coded signal can be modulated to create a signal and the signal generated is detectable by the imaging device or an auxiliary detector. The light sources are configured to generate a number of image device detectable unpredictable patterns or signals having a range of wavelengths from 10 nm to 1 mm. In certain aspects the authentication information can comprise both visual and non visual signals. In certain aspects the unpredictable information comprise pattern wavelength or both pattern and wavelength. The unpredictable information can vary over time or vary in discrete time limited periods. In certain aspects a light source can comprise high power LEDs 700 mA . In certain aspects optics are added to the LED s to focus the beam pattern of the light. The lenses themselves are commercially available. The active transmitter device can support single LED or multiple LED arrays that can be organized or purposefully placed in an unorganized pattern to aid the receiver side finding locating algorithm. In certain aspects a tube shroud can be placed in front of the LEDs to further focus the light beam pattern for one example see .

The image including the authentication information for an area of interest is transmitted to a security gateway for further processing. In certain aspects the imaging device processes image s received which include authentication information from the authentication information transmitter. Processing by the imaging device can include the subtraction of the authentication information. Image subtraction and fill process includes the extraction and translation of the authentication information i.e. image subtraction into metadata that is the authentication information stripped out of the picture and then sent on to the gateway as other than the encoded video stream. The image is filled so that the client sees just the image without the authentication information. The authentication information can be reviewed or reversed by using information provided by metadata.

In further reference to the security gateway receives the signal from the monitoring device via an input interface. The input interface can be wired and or a wireless interface. The security gateway is configured to process the image via various processing modules. The processing can include one or more of validating the image coding the image performing image subtraction and fill encoding an image and encrypting an image. In certain embodiments the processing occurs in order of i image processing ii video encoding iii decrypt authentication iv fingerprint validation and alerting v image subtraction and fill vi metadata creation and encryption. The processed image is transmitted via an interface to a client that displays an image analyzes an image stores an image etc. In certain aspects a replay attack i.e. the looping or replay of an image or video captured at one time and played at a later time in place of the image or video representing the latter time can be averted by confirmation of time coding of the image or video i.e. using a detection algorithm . The time component would not agree if a previously recorded image or video is transmitted at a later time the client decoder would identify the bogus transmission because the time code would be off as would the authentication signal for the current time. In other aspects the presence or absence of other components of an authentication can also be used to identify suspect data. For example an image set is time coded and didn t include the light source information. In this case a skilled attacker could generate a loop of video with the time data that was spoofed and just keep the timing going while the imagery was stale. Insertion of a light signal which also has its own time component would detect such an attack and would avoid such vulnerability.

In certain aspects the detection algorithm is post encoding. Post encoding aspects can result in a more simplified deployment e.g. more integration ready with a wider array of off the shelf cameras and encoders . In certain aspects the authentication signal is encrypted and the receiver implements decryption into its processing chain.

The authentication information transmitter will also have a tamper response mechanism that will detect attempts to open the device and in response to those intrusions will delete the critical security parameters in the device seed keys encryption keys etc. . In addition to the time based codes that will be sent for authentication the device will also implement other messages for maintenance purposes and resynchronization purposes. These will allow for things like device health low battery messages voltage messages re pairing and resynchronization.

In certain aspects the data is secured or the connection between the monitoring device and security gateway is secured. The authentication signal can provide security between the monitoring device and the security gateway wherein confirmation of the authentication signal verifies the security of the data or modification thereof indicates potential compromise of the data. Another component of security is in the expected answer at the security gateway. In certain aspects each component is programmed with a checkpoint such that the next time a signal will be agreed to or confirmed by both the transmitting and receiving components via a portion of the previous transmission. Additional methods of protecting data integrity can include monitoring the presence of any signal e.g. video loss . Interruptions in that signal can indicate possible tampering.

The image processor generates a video signal that is composed of a brightness signal and color difference signal by means of conventional signal processing techniques color separation gamma correction etc. . The video signal is transmitted to a compressor. The compressor compresses the video signal by a compression process employing discrete cosine transform DCT e.g. MPEG2 JPEG etc. and thereby generates a coded video signal. The coded video signal is buffered in a buffer transmitted by an interface I F and transferred to the controller via the LAN.

The receive side detection algorithm can be configured to integrate with moving cameras pan tilt zoom PTZ by comprising an algorithm to find the authentication information transmitter in a scene then track that object through a moving scene.

The receiver side can be configured to allow for multiple authentication information transmitters to be supported such that one could place them in quadrants of the PTZ camera field of view so that no matter the physical orientation of the camera there should be at least one transmitter input to the camera for authentication.

In certain aspects the authentication information transmitter input can be combined with a reference image for the scene such that an attacker could not take the video signal that included authentication data and overlay just the authentication data onto a new video scene.
