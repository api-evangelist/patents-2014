title: Method for assembly of a microbial fuel cell
abstract: An anode/cathode system is disclosed for use in a Benthic microbial fuel cell. Carbon cloth forms at least a portion of the anode and is disposed on one side of a water oxygen impermeable layer, which can be weighted around a periphery thereof to hold the anode against a water-sediment interface. Carbon cloth flaps or strands can be attached to the other side of the impermeable layer to form the cathode. The anode and cathode can be divided into sections with each section having an electrical lead coupled thereto. The system is deployed onto the seafloor with the anode side in contact with the water-sediment interface.

This application is a divisional of co pending prior U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 227 698 filed on 8 Sep. 2011 and claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 121 of the prior application s filing date.

This patent application is co pending with the following related U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 227 698 by the same inventor Frank J. McNeilly.

The present invention relates generally to a benthic microbial fuel cell and more particularly relates to a readily deployable microbial fuel cell which may be towed into position by cable for deployment on a sea bottom without the need for divers.

A simple Benthic microbial fuel cell BMFC system consists of an anode a cathode and an intermediate electrical circuit. Both the anode and cathode are typically made from carbon or graphite. The anode electrode is buried in the marine sediment to a depth sufficient to sustain anaerobic microbial activity. This step is time consuming and costly. A cathode is also located in the ocean water usually immediately above the buried anode. Electrical wires connect the anode and cathode to an intermediate electrical circuit that may boost the voltage and store electrical energy or operate an underwater electrical device. The BMFC system generates electrical power by oxidizing sediment organic matter and simultaneously reducing oxygen dissolved in the overlying water as discussed below e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 6 913 854. This process generates a sustainable voltage gradient that can be used to generate electrical power.

Prior art microbial fuel cells have disadvantages. Previous systems required divers to install graphite plates in the marine sediment. As noted above this is a costly and time consuming process. In addition the graphite plate electrodes are delicate and difficult to handle during an undersea deployment.

The following U.S. Patents describe various prior art systems that may be related to the above and or other microbial fuel cells

The above discussed prior art does not address solutions provided by the present invention which teaches a more easily deployed microbial fuel cell configuration.

Consequently those skilled in the art will appreciate the present invention that addresses the above described and other problems.

Another object of the present invention is provide a microbial fuel cell that may be deployed at a water sediment interface utilizing a cable without the need for burying the anode under the seabed.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a microbial fuel cell which does not require divers during deployment on the ocean floor.

Accordingly the present invention comprises a microbial fuel cell assembly which electrically interacts with an underwater surface. One embodiment of the invention may comprise elements such as for example a flexible anode electrode that may comprise a plurality of anode sections and a corresponding plurality of anode electrical conductors which are connected to the plurality of anode sections. A plurality of anodes and cathodes are provided as a redundancy in case part of the overall BMFC is damaged the BMFC will continue to operate.

The invention may further comprise a flexible cathode electrode which may comprise a plurality of cathode sections. A plurality of cathode electrical conductors may then be connected to the plurality of cathode sections.

The flexible anode electrode is attached to one side of an oxygen impermeable separation layer and the flexible cathode electrode is attached to an opposite side of the oxygen impermeable separation layer.

In a presently preferred embodiment the flexible anode electrode and the flexible cathode electrode comprise carbon fiber cloth. The flexible cathode electrode may comprise a plurality of flaps or other area of increasing elements.

The microbial fuel cell assembly may comprise weighted portions on a periphery of the oxygen impermeable separation layer which holds the microbial fuel cell against the underwater surface such as the ocean floor seabed or the like. The weighted periphery provides an oxygen impermeable separation enclosure for the anode while pressed against the sea floor. For purposes of the present invention terms such as ocean floor seabed underwater surface lake bed and the like are essentially interchangeable.

The microbial fuel cell assembly may comprise a plurality of spikes mounted on the flexible anode electrode side of the oxygen impermeable separation layer to secure the assembly on the ocean bed in an anode downwardly facing configuration.

In a presently preferred embodiment the flexible anode electrode the flexible cathode electrode and the oxygen impermeable separation layer are wrapped around a cylinder which is heavy enough to sink to the seabed for deployment to the seabed without the need for divers.

In another embodiment a method for assembly of the microbial fuel cell may comprise steps such as for example forming a flexible anode electrode utilizing a plurality of anode sections and forming a flexible cathode electrode utilizing a plurality of cathode sections. The method further comprises attaching the flexible anode electrode to one side of the oxygen impermeable separation layer and attaching the flexible cathode electrode to an opposite side of the oxygen impermeable separation layer.

Other steps may comprise deploying the microbial fuel cell onto the underwater surface whereby the flexible anode electrode contacts the underwater surface.

In one embodiment the method may comprise forming the flexible anode electrode and the flexible cathode electrode utilizing carbon fiber cloth. The method may further comprise forming the flexible cathode electrode utilizing a plurality of flaps or other flexible members such as strands or ropes to increase the surface area.

The method may comprise mounting weighted portions on a periphery of the oxygen impermeable separation layer to hold the microbial fuel cell onto the sea bottom and or mounting a plurality of spikes on the flexible anode electrode side of the oxygen impermeable separation layer.

In a presently preferred embodiment the method may comprise wrapping the flexible anode electrode the flexible cathode electrode and the oxygen impermeable separation layer around a deployment cylinder which is rolled on the seabed to deploy the microbial fuel cell.

In yet another embodiment the microbial fuel cell assembly may comprise a flexible anode electrode and a flexible cathode electrode which are attached to opposite sides of an oxygen impermeable separation layer. The cathode anode and separation layer are then mounted onto the deployment cylinder. In one embodiment the flexible anode electrode is positioned more radially exterior on the deployment cylinder than the flexible cathode electrode so that as the microbial fuel cell is unwrapped from the deployment cylinder on the seabed the anode electrode will then face the seabed.

At least one cable is connected to the deployment cylinder to lower the deployment cylinder to the underwater surface. Weighted portions which may be positioned on a periphery of the oxygen impermeable separation layer and or at other positions are of sufficient weight to hold the flexible anode electrode against the underwater surface. The weight of the deployment cylinder aids in pressing the anode and weighted periphery of the oxygen impermeable separation layer against the sea floor to ensure intimate contact.

The present invention provides a microbial fuel cell which greatly improves the ease of deployment as compared to prior art designs. In one embodiment the present invention provides the ability to simply roll the dual electrode out onto the ocean floor without the need for divers. This configuration and method of deployment significantly reduces deployment costs time and the ability to use the microbial fuel cell at greater depths.

Referring now to the drawings and more particularly to and there is shown the side and top of one embodiment of microbial fuel cell .

A one piece dual anode cathode electrode configuration in accord with one possible embodiment of microbial fuel cell comprises three basic components anode which may comprise a plurality of anode sections cathode which may comprise a plurality of cathode sections and separation layer .

Anode may comprise a carbon cloth base layer that will make direct contact with the marine sediment top . In one possible preferred embodiment carbon cloth layer is segmented into multiple anode sections . If anode is segmented as shown the anode sections of anode can then be connected to a plurality of corresponding electrical conductor wires that will lead back to the BMFC electrical circuit not shown .

Microbial fuel cell further preferably comprises heavy rubberized material separation layer which adheres to the carbon cloth anode electrode . Separation layer is impermeable and may preferably be used to serve at least three purposes.

Separation layer preferably provides weight to hold the electrically conductive carbon cloth anode pressed down on the marine sediment. Separation layer forms a barrier to stop or effectively prevent oxygen from passing from the carbon cloth anode to the surrounding ocean water. Separation layer preferably also provides a barrier to any marine burrowing life that could perforate the anode structure.

In a preferred embodiment barrier or separation layer may be lined around the circumference with a thicker heavy duty lining that is weighted and or may comprise other types of weights positioned as desired to keep microbial fuel cell on sea floor beneath water surface .

The upper portion during operation at the seabed of the dual electrode configuration of microbial fuel cell as shown in and is cathode electrode layer . Cathode electrode layer may preferably be formed utilizing an array of flexible carbon cloth flaps which may be organized in sections to provide cathode electrode sections .

When cathode electrode of this embodiment is arranged in cathode electrode sections the groups of the carbon cloth flaps are then segmented into separate conductor circuits and wired separately as indicated by wires which connect to the BMFC control circuit. Each anode electrode section and corresponding cathode electrode section are then preferably wired separately and effectively provide separate power supplies.

Providing a plurality of anode sections and cathode sections in segments of carbon cloth conductors ensures that if one section of the electrodes is damaged or compromised the other sections will be able to continue operating and the electric circuit will not be compromised. In addition separating large electrodes into segments reduces the overall electrode resistance which has a large impact on low voltage electrical energy storage systems.

In one embodiment spikes may be located at each corner of the dual electrode to anchor microbial fuel cell in the marine sediment .

In one embodiment providing louvers or flaps as shown in the figures for cathode provides a large surface area to facilitate the oxygen reduction process of microbial fuel cell . In a preferred embodiment carbon fiber cloth is selected because of the high electrical conductivity and flexibility thereof. In an alternative embodiment cathode and or anode may comprise carbon fiber cloth of a more fibrous texture with loose strands as opposed to a tight woven texture. The loose strands may provide increased surface area for both electrodes thereby increasing the reduction and oxidation processes.

During deployment cylindrical spool would be lowered to sea floor utilizing cables which may connect to a central portion of each end of cylindrical spool . If desired a latching mechanism not shown may be utilized to permit release of the layers of microbial fuel cell from cylindrical spool . In another embodiment one set of spikes may be longer and or driven into sea bottom utilizing the weight of weighted and or flooded cylindrical spool for deployment purposes.

A ship would slowly pull the assembly forward while the dual electrode microbial fuel cell is unrolled from the spool. Weighted cylindrical spool would then press anode into the sediment as the spool is rolled along the sea floor . Once the microbial fuel cell has completely unrolled from cylindrical spool then cylindrical spool will be raised back to the ship.

It will be understood that many additional changes in the details materials steps and arrangement of parts which have been herein described and illustrated in order to explain the nature of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art within the principle and scope of the invention as expressed in the appended claims.
