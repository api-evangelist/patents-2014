In other instances well known machines structures and method steps have not been described in particular detail in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the present inventions. Unless otherwise indicated like parts and method steps are referred to with like reference numerals.

A network is a collection of links and nodes e.g. multiple computers and or other devices connected together arranged so that information may be passed from one part of the network to another over multiple links and through various nodes. Examples of networks include the Internet the public switched telephone network the global Telex network computer networks e.g. an intranet an extranet a local area network or a wide area network wired networks and wireless networks.

The Internet is a worldwide network of computers and computer networks arranged to allow the easy and robust exchange of information between computer users. Hundreds of millions of people around the world have access to computers connected to the Internet via Internet Service Providers ISPs . Content providers place multimedia information e.g. text graphics audio video animation and other forms of data at specific locations on the Internet referred to as websites. The combination of all the websites and their corresponding web pages on the Internet is generally known as the World Wide Web WWW or simply the Web.

Users of computer networks such as corporate networks or the Internet routinely send electronic messages to each other. Electronic messages may contain for example text images links and attachments. Electronic mail or email is one of the most widely used methods of communication over the Internet due to the variety of data that may be transmitted the large number of available recipients speed low cost and convenience.

Another method of electronic communication includes social media. Social media such as Facebook Twitter YouTube Tumblr Snapchat etc. provide means for businesses to advertise their product while users of the social media may discover the products or services provided by a business and post comments including general sentiment about their user experience with the business. The business may then review these comments and adjust their business strategy accordingly.

Applicant has determined however that presently existing methods and systems for monitoring and analyzing social media provides no means to identify specific issues within the social media that are common to experiences with the business common to the industry vertical associated with the business and or common to social sentiment overall.

As a non limiting example the disclosed system may be configured to create one or more data tables within data storage for a grouping of data such as the data described herein. Each of these data tables may contain one or more data records and each of the data records may comprise one or more data fields including a unique identifier for the record and additional details about the record.

A non limiting example may include data fields within a data record associated with a business account and or website account entity account . Each entity account may be populated with additional entity account data such as a unique identifier user ID business ID etc. and details about the account such as a business name username password first name last name physical address email address phone number industry vertical social media account information etc.

The server s may be configured to work in conjunction with data storage to store data. As non limiting examples the previously described user interface s may be used to receive input stored in data storage as the entity account data which may include an industry vertical data associated with each entity account social media account data associated with each entity account the industry vertical data and or social media account data multiple concepts associated with each entity account that may be stored in a concept dictionary reflecting customer sentiment concepts reflecting one or more specific issues from negative sentiment and or concepts reflecting recommended remedies for the specific actionable issue s .

This aggregated information may then be made available for any future analysis of customer sentiment specific issues and recommended remedies related to the appropriate industry vertical. As non limiting examples if multiple entities all associate their business with a restaurant industry vertical then concepts phrases and or keywords such as food poisoning bad table location etc. may be associated with the restaurant vertical while entities that associate their business with an auto repair shop industry vertical may be associated with concepts phrases and or keywords such as mechanic engine trouble or overcharged parts and labor costs. 

As seen in entity account data received from the example user interface may further comprise social media account data . The social media account associated with the social media account data may comprise a social media account outlet for a business or a social media outlet for a customer. As non limiting examples social media account data may comprise a social media type e.g. Facebook Twitter Yelp etc. authentication information allowing the user to access one or more social media accounts e.g. username password API access information for each social media account e.g. a URL for the API API documentation links password information for accessing the API etc. .

As a non limiting example this social media account data may be used to access and review content within the entity s social media account s in order to identify concepts related to customer sentiment specific issues related to negative sentiment and recommended remedies to the specific issues .

The server s may be configured to identify within social media specific instances of concepts related to customer sentiment specific issues related to negative customer sentiment and recommended remedies to the specific issues . These concepts may comprise any collection aggregation and or combination of tokens keywords phrases associated concepts and or any other concept properties and or attributes and the relationships between them.

One non limiting example approach to accomplish this may include defining a conceptual ontology for the keywords and or phrases described herein. An ontology may be a representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts and may include reason about and define the properties and or attributes of the concepts.

Attributes of concepts may be used to describe the relationships between concepts. These relationships may describe the semantics concepts. As a non limiting example a relationship may be an attribute whose value is another concept in the ontology or similar to another concept in the ontology such as is part of same as is superclass of is subclass of made in etc. The relationships between the individual and class concepts may be used to calculate the most closely related results in response to the received information which established the individual concept

The server s may be configured to receive generate store and or analyze concepts and relationships related to customer sentiment about an entity s product and or service. After receiving input the server s may be configured to identify define relationships between and store the received concepts. For example the input may include a text string generated by an entity content within the admin s social media accounts a plurality of crowd sourcing techniques and or any combination of artificial intelligence machine learning and fuzzy logic as described herein.

The server s may then be configured to split the text string in this example into tokens and define concepts based on this tokenized input. The tokenized input may be analyzed to determine whether the concepts represent a positive or negative sentiment a specific issue and or a recommended remedy for the specific issue .

As non limiting examples the defined concept s may comprise or be defined by keywords and or phrases indicating a customer s positive sentiment e.g. great service delicious meal running great prompt service etc. negative sentiment e.g. food poisoning long wait frequent breakdowns no show etc. or any other sentiment e.g. don t care not important etc. .

Other concepts may comprise or be defined by keywords and or phrases indicating a specific issue caused by negative customer sentiment e.g. never returning wouldn t recommend etc. and or any possible recommended remedies for the specific issue e.g. solution fix what I ve done in these situations what I would recommend etc. .

The server s may be configured to identify relationships between the concepts related to customer sentiment specific issues related to negative sentiment and recommended remedies to the specific issues . For example where a specific issue has been identified the server s may identify relationships between the specific issue the negative sentiment that triggered the specific issue and any recommended remedies for the specific issue as found in the content text string s . These relationships may be reflected in reports created for the admin as described herein. In some embodiments the server s may be configured to store these concepts and their relationships in data storage

As a non limiting example the server s may be configured to crawl social media to identify a thread representing a negative customer sentiment and may analyze concepts phrases and or keywords within this thread to determine how users resolved specific problems. The server s may be configured to create an association between the concepts keywords and or phrases from the negative sentiment and the concepts keywords and or phrases associated with the recommended remedy . In some embodiments these concepts and their relationships may be stored within the concept dictionary .

Several different methods may be employed to populate the concept dictionary with concepts identify the accuracy of the relationship between these stored concepts and continue to improve the accuracy of these identified relationships. The dictionary of concepts and relationships may be seeded by any means of data creation aggregation known in the art. For example in some embodiments the dictionary of concepts and relationships may have been aggregated by a data aggregation service and may be purchased and integrated into data storage .

In some embodiments the database may be populated via an automated web or social media crawler used in combination with fuzzy logic and other intelligent learning software logic to identify the concepts to be stored in the concept dictionary . Crawling also known as spidering may comprise the process of visiting one or more web pages or one or more social media accounts associated with each of the admin accounts as described herein and reading the content to identify keywords within the content and or identify an overall social sentiment towards a product or service. One or more web crawler modules not shown may visit read the selected content identify some or all keywords and or social sentiment analyze them to identify concepts and or store them as part of the aggregation within the concept dictionary .

As previously noted other non limiting examples of concept aggregation may include the concept dictionary being populated by an admin a plurality of crowd sourcing techniques and or any combination of artificial intelligence machine learning and fuzzy logic.

Crowd sourcing techniques and or any combination of artificial intelligence machine learning and fuzzy logic may also be used to seed and refine the concept dictionary . For example as social media content is continually crawled and or as the concept dictionary becomes increasingly populated the software module s running on the server s may improve the accuracy of the relationships between the concepts by analyzing the concepts and their relationships to identify concepts suspected of being associated with negative sentiment specific issues and or recommended remedies .

In this example the server s may be configured to display these suspect concepts to the entit ies associated with the entity account s or other system users to confirm these concepts and relationships. Based on input received from the user in response to the displayed suspect concepts the system may then use machine learning to improve the accuracy the relationships between concepts.

As a non limiting example an entity may monitor resolutions of a specific actionable issue related to specific keywords in social media and or stored in the concept dictionary and identify which recommended remedy was the most effective. The concept keywords around this remedy may then be confirmed with the users and flagged in the software module s and or the database identifying it as the most effective remedy which may become a high ranked recommended remedy as described below.

The server s may be configured to monitor one or more social media accounts associated with one or more entities Step . illustrates that this may further include the steps of the server s identifying social media account data associated in the database with one or more entity accounts Step connecting to the social media account s associated with the social media account data Step crawling content within the social media account s Step and identifying one or more negative concepts within the content Step .

In some embodiments the server s may utilize an API to connect to the social media account s Step . The API may be accessed using the social media account data . An RPC may be sent to the API and the API may then return the requested information such as content from the entity s social media account s to the server s for analysis. The server s may crawl the content from the social media account s Step using any crawling techniques known in the art such as that previously described.

The server s may then analyze the crawled returned content to identify one or more negative concepts Step . In some embodiments the customer sentiment the specific issue s and the recommended remedy to each of the specific issue s may be identified by comparing the concepts phrases and or keywords within the content additional concepts phrases and or keywords within the content and or with the concepts phrases and or keywords stored in the concept dictionary and may determine concepts that share enough attributes to identify within the posted feedback one or more concepts phrases and or keywords associated with one or more instances of negative customer sentiment specific issues and or recommended remedies .

In some embodiments the identified concept may be saved in data storage and flagged appropriately in order to refine improve the artificial intelligence used to determine negative customer sentiment specific issues and or recommended remedies . In some embodiments the server s may be configured to limit the analysis of the posted feedback to a specific industry in order to identify relevant concepts phrases and or keywords specific to that industry vertical. In some embodiments the server s may be configured to scan the content to determine keywords indicating an associated vertical and limit the search of associated concepts in the concept dictionary accordingly.

The server s may be configured to identify within one or more social media accounts one or more reports of a specific issue Step . illustrates that this may further include the steps of the server s determining whether the social media content and or data storage comprises at least one additional instance of the negative concept phrase and or keyword Step and flagging each instance of the negative concept phrase and or keyword as a specific issue common to the social media account s Step .

The software running on the server s may be configured to identify common issues throughout the negative customer sentiment and or specific issues within the content of the social media account s and in some embodiments may be stored in data storage . Common issues may comprise specific issues that appear more than once within the content of the social media account s and or within data storage . As a non limiting example to determine common issues the server s may be configured to identify a single concept phrase and or keyword within the social media content and or within the stored records.

The server s may then be configured to analyze the concept phrase and or keyword to determine if it was been associated with a positive or a negative sentiment and determine for concepts identified as negative concepts whether the social media content and or the database comprises at least one additional instance of the negative concept. If so the software running on the server s may be configured to flag each instance of the negative concept phrase or keyword as the common issue which in some embodiments may be stored within the concept dictionary in data storage .

In these embodiments the server s may be configured to flag the data records for the concept s by updating one or more data fields within the data record to indicate that the specific issue related with the concept is an issue common to a specific entity account common to all entity accounts associated with a specific industry and or common to the entire body of entity accounts throughout data storage .

Once common issues have been identified as common to specific entity accounts specific industry verticals and or as common to the entire body of negative sentiment throughout the social media content and or data storage the servers s may then be configured to monitor social media for specific instances of the common issue s by monitoring the content within each of the social media accounts for each of the entity accounts . The server s may then be configured to crawl possibly at regular intervals the content of the social media accounts and identify within the crawled content at least one instance of the common issue reflected in the content of the social media accounts.

The server s may be configured to identify one or more recommended remedies for the report s of the specific issue Step . illustrates that this may further include the steps of the server s searching the social media for each instance of the specific issue Step and the recommended remedy for each instance of the specific issue Step . The server s may search the recommended remedy by identifying within the social media content a remedy related concept phrase and or keyword Step . The server s may use the identified remedy related concept phrase and or keyword to search the social media content for the recommended remedy Step .

In some embodiments the server s may be configured to store in association with the specific issue the remedy related concept phrase and or keyword in data storage possibly within the concept dictionary . In these embodiments when the server s search the social media content for the remedy related concept phrase and or keyword they may also search the remedy related concepts stored in data storage in association with the specific issue Step .

As with the method steps for identifying common issues and instances of specific actionable issues in social media content the server s may be configured to analyze the social media content specifically concepts phrases and or keywords within the same threads of social media content to identify recommended remedies associated with specific instances of the specific issue s . The server s may analyze concepts phrases and or keywords within threads of the posted feedback that track identified instances of specific issues and determine how users resolved specific problems. The server s may create and store in some embodiments an association between the concepts phrases and or keywords from the negative sentiment and the concepts phrases and or keywords associated with the recommended remedy .

As noted above the recommended remedies may be populated analyzed and flagged within the concept dictionary by receiving input from an admin a plurality of crowd sourcing techniques and or a plurality of artificial intelligence machine learning and or fuzzy logic as described herein. As with the steps identifying common issues the server s may be configured to limit the analysis of the social media content to a specific industry in order to identify relevant concepts phrases and or keywords specific to that industry as previously described.

As specific instances of issues are identified within the social media content the server s may be further configured to crawl the social media content to determine if there is a recommended remedy in association with the negative sentiment and or common issue and the system may analyze the recommended remedies to determine rank the most effective or frequent recommended remedies .

Once identified the server s may be configured to analyze concepts phrases and or keywords that identify the best solution s to the identified instance of the specific issue s . The server s may be further configured to monitor suspect recommended remedies and apply the crowd sourcing techniques and or any combination of artificial intelligence machine learning and fuzzy logic to refine the recommended remedies over time.

In some embodiments one or more business partners of other products which may include productivity apps may be used to populate the concept dictionary with recommended remedies . As a non limiting example a partnership may exist with Open Table for reservations. Invoicing options and or other online solutions may also be included to fix the identified problems.

The server s may be configured to report to an entity associated with one or more social media accounts the specific issue and or the one or more recommended remedies Step .

The server s may be configured to generate and transmit to a client computer operated by the user a report including any combination of instances of common issues and or recommended remedies found in the entity s social media content. The generated report may be sent as non limiting examples via email SMS an alert on a web page and or user interface accessible only to the entity via the business website s an individual message sent to the entity via their social media accounts etc.

In some embodiments a pre determined threshold may be set within the entity account settings allowing the entity to determine a specific number of instances of common issues that must be found within the entity s social media content before a report is generated and sent to the entity.

In some embodiments the data generated for the report may be analyzed and ranked so that the common issues determined to be the most critical and or the recommended remedies determined to be the most effective are listed first.
