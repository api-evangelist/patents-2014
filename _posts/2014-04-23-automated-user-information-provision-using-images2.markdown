This application is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 117 210 filed on May 27 2011 entitled Automated User Information Provision Using Images the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to online and or mobile payments and more particularly to using images to automate the provision of user information to a user information form that may be used in making online and or mobile payments.

More and more consumers are purchasing items and services over electronic networks such as for example the Internet. Consumers routinely purchase products and services from merchants and individuals alike. The transactions may take place directly between a conventional or on line merchant or retailer and the consumer and payment is typically made by entering user information such as user financial information e.g. credit card information. Transactions may also take place with the aid of an on line or mobile payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. Such payment service providers can make transactions easier and safer for the parties involved. Purchasing with the assistance of a payment service provider from the convenience of virtually anywhere using a mobile device is one main reason why on line and mobile purchases are growing very quickly.

As mentioned above online and or mobile payments typically require that a user provide a variety of user information. For example users may be required to sign up for an account with a payment service provider by providing a name an address financial information and or a variety of other information known in the art in order to make a payment. In another example payments may simply require user to provide a variety of financial information. Conventionally users are provided forms in which they must manually key in such information using an input device on a computer system. The process of manually keying in user information to forms is time consuming and error prone which can lead to user dissatisfaction.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

In one embodiment the present disclosure provides a system and method for automatically providing user information to a user information form using an image of user documentation. A user information form is received by a user device over a network from a device of a requesting entity such as a payment service provider device or a payee device. In response to receiving the user information form the user device requests a user information image of user documentation. A user may use a camera on the user device to take the user information image of the user documentation and that user information image may then be analyzed by the user device using a variety of techniques including Optical Character Recognition OCR to determine whether it includes user information requested in request sections of the user information form. If the requested user information is included in the user information image the user device automatically enters the requested user information into the request sections of the user information form and displays it on a display of the user device. A user may edit and or confirm the user information in the request sections of the user information form and then send the user information form over the network to the requesting entity device.

Referring now to and a method for automatically providing user information to a user information form using an image is illustrated. In the embodiment of the method described below a requesting entity is requesting user information from the user to open up a payer account and that requesting entity may be a payment service provider such as for example PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. that assists in the making of payments from the user to a payee by transferring funds from a user account to a payee account of the payee. However the requesting entity may also be a payee requesting user information from the user to make a payment. These embodiments are meant to be merely exemplary and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of modifications may be made to the system discussed below without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

The method begins at block where a user information form is received and a user information image is requested. In an embodiment a user having a user device including a display screen illustrated in may access a user information form over a network e.g. the Internet by connecting to a payment service provider device of a payment service provider or a payee device of a payee. In the illustrated embodiment the user is attempting to sign up for an account with a payment service provider and the payment service provider is providing the user information form which the user device is displaying on the display for the user to enter user information into a plurality of request sections that includes a name request section a birth date request section a plurality of mailing address request sections and a plurality of payment information request sections . However the illustrated user information form and request sections and are meant to be merely exemplary and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of different request sections requesting different user information will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore one of skill in the art will recognize that a user information form from a payee or other requesting entity may include the same or similar request sections and may include different request section without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. While the user device is illustrated and described below as a mobile device such as for example a mobile phone or computer one of skill in the art will recognize that the automatic providing of user information to the user information form using an image may be performed on a desktop computer on other computing systems connected to a network and or using a variety of other devices known in the art.

At block of the method the user device may detect the receipt of the user information form with the plurality of request sections and . In one embodiment the user information form may provide metadata to the user device that details the user information being requested in the request sections and . In another embodiment the user device may analyze the user information form to determine what user information is being requested. For example the user device may analyze the user information form and determine that the request section is positioned adjacent the word name and thus the request section is requesting a user name the request section is positioned adjacent the words birth date and thus the request section is requesting a user birth day etc.

Upon detecting the receipt of the user information form the user device requests at least one user information image from the user. For example as illustrated in upon detecting the receipt of the user information form the user device may display a manual fill in option and an automated fill in using images option and the user may then select the automated fill in using images option such that the user device displays a user information image request screen on the display illustrated in . The user information image request screen includes a plurality of user documentation types including a Drivers License documentation type a Passport documentation type a Credit Card documentation type a Debit Card documentation type and a check documentation type . While a plurality of user documentation types have been illustrated those user documentation types are meant to be merely exemplary and one of skill in the art will recognize that a variety of other user documentation types will fall within the scope of the present disclosure. The user information image request screen also includes an image frame .

In an embodiment the user may select one of the user documentation types e.g. the Drivers License documentation type selected in bold in to indicate the type of documentation the user is going to provide an image of. In another embodiment the user device may determine e.g. from the analysis of the user information form and the request sections and that an image of a particular user documentation type should be provided and that image may be requested by highlighting the appropriate user documentation type e.g. the Drivers License documentation type highlighted in bold in . In another embodiment the user information request screen may not display the user documentation types.

Referring now to the method may proceed to block where the user device receives a user information image. In an embodiment as illustrated in a user may take an image of user documentation using a camera not illustrated on the user device by positioning the user documentation and the user device such that the user documentation is positioned in the image frame on the user information image request screen as illustrated in and activating the camera. Taking the image of the user documentation results in a user information image which in the illustrated embodiment is a user Drivers License image. The user documentation and the corresponding user information image include a plurality of user information such as for example a user name a user address a user birth date and a variety of other user information know in the art. The taking of the user information image by the user provides the user information image to the user device .

In another embodiment block of the method may include the user device requesting an additional or different image of user documentation. For example in the embodiment illustrated in either the user has selected one of the user documentation types e.g. the Credit Card documentation type selected in bold in to indicate the type of documentation the user is going to provide an image of or the user device has determined e.g. from the analysis of the user information form and the request sections and that an image of a particular user documentation type should be provided and that image has been requested by highlighting the appropriate user documentation type e.g. the Credit Card documentation type highlighted in bold in . The user may then take an image of the front and the back of the user documentation using a camera not illustrated on the user device by positioning the user documentation and the user device such that the user documentation is positioned in the image frame on the user information image request screen and activating the camera. Taking the images of the user documentation results in a first user information image and a second user information image which in the illustrated embodiment are user Credit Card images. The user documentation and the corresponding user information images and include a plurality of user information such as for example a user name a user credit card number a user credit card expiration date a user credit card security code and a variety of other user information know in the art. The taking of the user information images and by the user provides the user information images and to the user device .

While examples of user documentation and user information images and above include a driver s license and credit card one of skill in the art will recognize that other user documentations types e.g. the passport documentation type debit card documentation type and check documentation type may be substituted in the system described below without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.

Referring now to and the method proceeds to block where the user information image is analyzed and determined to include requested user information. The user device may use a variety of techniques to determine whether the user information image includes user information that is requested on the user information form. In an embodiment the user device may determine a type of user documentation included in the user information image . For example the user device may determine that the user information image of includes a drivers license documentation type because it was received in response to a request by the user device for a drivers license documentation type e.g. the highlighted Drivers License documentation type in bold in or it was received following an selection by the user to provide a driver s license documentation type e.g. the Drivers License documentation type selected in bold in . In another example the user device may use a variety of optical image and character recognition techniques known in the art to analyze the user information image compare the user information image to a database of user documentations types and recognize that the user information image includes a driver s license documentation type.

Furthermore the user device may determine the state of issue of the driver s license using a variety of techniques. For example the user device may use a location sensor not illustrated included in the user device to determine the location of the user device and use that location as the state of issue of the driver s license. In another example in performing optical image and character recognition techniques to analyze the user information image and comparing the user information image to a database of user documentations types the user device may recognize that the user information image includes a driver s license documentation type issued in Texas e.g. from the word TEXAS included in the user information image from the layout and or images on the user information image and or from a variety of other indicators known in the art. 

The user device may also use optical character recognition OCR techniques to analyze the user information image and detect the user name user address and user birth date included in the user information image . In one embodiment the user device may be operable to use only the OCR techniques on the user information image without the need for the other techniques discussed above to detect the user name user address and user birth date included in the user information image . However in another embodiment the user device may increase the accuracy of detecting user information on the user information image by using other information retrieved during the method e.g. user documentation type location of issue of the user documentation type etc. to access a database e.g. over a network of user documentation types to determine what sections of the user information image include particular user information. For example the user device may use the techniques discussed above and determine that the user information image includes a driver s license documentation type that is issued in Texas. By accessing a database of driver s licenses the user device may determine that Texas driver s licenses include a user name located above a user address both of which are positioned in a lower left corner of the driver s license along with a user birth date positioned mid way down the left side of the driver s license and adjacent the characters DOB .

In another embodiment the user device may determine that the user information images and of include a credit card documentation type because they were received in response to a request by the user device for a credit card documentation type e.g. the highlighted Credit Card documentation type in bold in or were received following an selection by the of the user to provide a credit card documentation type e.g. the Credit Card documentation type selected in bold in . In another example the user device may use a variety of optical image and character recognition techniques known in the art to analyze the user information images and compare the user information image to a database of user documentations types and recognize that the user information images and include a credit card documentation type.

Furthermore in performing optical image and character recognition techniques to analyze the user information images and and comparing the user information images and to a database of user documentations types the user device may recognize that the user information images and includes a credit card documentation type issued by a particular credit card company e.g. from the word VISA included in the user information image from the layout and or images on the user information images and and or from a variety of other indicators known in the art. 

The user device may also use optical character recognition OCR techniques to analyze the user information images and detect the user name credit card number and credit card expiration date included in the user information image along with the credit card security code in the user information image . In one embodiment the user device may be operable to use only the OCR techniques on the user information images and without the need for the other techniques discussed above to detect the user name credit card number credit card expiration date and credit card security code included in the user information images and . However in another embodiment the user device may increase the accuracy of detecting user information on the user information images and by using other information retrieved during the method e.g. user documentation type issuer of the user documentation type etc. to access a database e.g. over a network of user documentation types to determine what sections of the user information images and include particular user information. For example the user device may use the techniques as discussed above and determine that the user information images and includes a credit card documentation type that is issued by Visa . By accessing a database of credit cards the user device may determine that Visa credit cards or all credit cards include a user name positioned in the lower left corner of the front side a credit card number positioned across the middle of the front side a credit card expiration date positioned in the lower right corner of the front side and a credit card security code positioned in the far right corner of a box on the back side.

In an embodiment the user device may determine that the user information images and includes requested user information by accessing a memory not illustrated in the user device to retrieve collaborating user information. For example the memory of the user device may include a variety of collaborating user information such as for example a user name user birth date user address user financial information and or a variety of other user information know in the art. The user device may accesses this collaborating information and compare it to the user information detected in the user information images and to help to determine if the user information detected in the user information images and is the requested user information determined from the user information form .

Referring now to and the method proceeds to block where requested user information is automatically entered into the user information form and the user information form is displayed. As discussed above the user device analyzes the user information form received in block of the method to determine what user information is being requested in the plurality of request sections and . The user device may then determine if the user information detected in the user information images and in block of the method corresponds to the user information requested in the user information form and if so automatically enter the appropriate user information detected in the user information images and into the request sections and of the user information form .

For example the user device may retrieve the user name and or the user name detected in the user information images and and provide a user name e.g. Jane Elizabeth Doe in the name request section of the user information form . The user device may also retrieve the user birth date detected in the user information image and provide a user birth date e.g. 03 14 1975 in the birth date request section of the user information form . The user device may also retrieve the user address detected in the user information image and provide a user address e.g. 710 Colorado St. 6B Austin Tex. 78701 in the plurality of mailing address request sections of the user information form . The user device may also retrieve the credit card number the credit card expiration date and credit card security code from the user information images and and provide user payment information e.g. 1234 4567 7890 9876 07 2013 969 in the plurality of payment information request sections of the user information form .

The user device may then display an account information confirmation screen illustrated in that includes the user information form with the requested information provided in the request sections and . In an embodiment the request sections and are editable such that a user may edit any of the information provided in the request sections and to correct that user information if necessary. If one or more request sections are not filled in such as if the information image s does not include all the information requested in the sections the user may enter the requested information manually such as by using a keypad keyboard or by a copy and paste.

The method then proceeds to block where the user information form including the requested user information in the request sections and is sent to a requesting entity. The user may use the user device to send the user information form illustrated in over the network to the payment service provider device the payee device and or other requesting entity device. In an embodiment the user device may delete any user information images and provided by the user after automatically providing the requested user information into the request sections and of the user information form and display a notification on the display of the user device that the user information images have been deleted.

Thus a system and method for automatically providing user information on a user information form using images has been described that allows a user to quickly and easily provide their information on a form. When a user device of the user detects a user information form the user device request an image of user documentation. Upon the receipt of such an image the user device analyzes the image to detect user information and automatically provides that user information into the appropriate portions of the user information form. Such systems and methods allow a user to automatically provide their information on a form by simply taking an image of documentation that they already carry around with them and saves the time and user effort necessary to manually key that user information into the user information form.
