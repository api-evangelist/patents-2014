title: Determining accuracies with which types of user identifying information identify online system users
abstract: An online system matches a user with a user of a third party system by comparing user identifying information maintained by the online system with user identifying information maintained by the third party system. To determine how accurately different types of user identifying information identify an online system user, types of user identifying information maintained by the online system are compared to types of user identifying information maintained by the third party system. A score is associated with various online system users based on the number of types of user identifying information associated with the user by the online system matching types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. Based on the scores associated with different users, a measure of accuracy in identifying an online system user is determined for each type of user identifying information.

This disclosure relates generally to identifying users of an online system and more particularly to identifying accuracies with which different types of user identifying information identify online system users.

Users interact with content provided by a variety of online systems and multiple online systems may exchange limited information associated with a user to allow each online system to provide a user with more personalized content. Providing more personalized content enhances user interaction with an online system increasing the amount of user interaction with the online system. Different online systems maintain user identifying information associated with each user user identifying information associated with a user including different types of user identifying information.

To retrieve information associated with a user from an additional online system an online system communicates one or more types of user identifying information associated with the user by the online system to the additional online system. The additional online system compares the received type of user identifying information to user identifying information associated with users of the additional online system an identifies a user of the additional online system associated with types of user identifying information matching the received types of user identifying information. However different online systems may use different types of user identifying information to identify specific user so an online system may be unable to accurately identify a user based on user identifying information received from an additional online system.

An online system determines a measure of accuracy with which different types of user identifying information identify a user of an entity such as the online system. For example the online system determines an accuracy with which a type of user identifying information received by the online system identifies a specific user of the online system. To determine a measure of accuracy of different types of user identifying information associated with a user the online system identifies users from a pair of sources e.g. the online system and a third party system two third party systems and obtains user identifying information associated with each user by the sources. For example the online system obtains user identifying information from the online system associated with a set of online system users and obtains user identifying information from a third party system associated with a set of third party system users. The user identifying information includes multiple types of user identifying information. Example types of user identifying information include a name a date of birth an e mail a gender a location an online system user identifier and a phone number.

For each of the identified users the online system compares user identifying information associated with a user by a source to user identifying information associated with a user by another source. Based on the types of user identifying information associated with the user by the source matching the types of user identifying information associated with a user of the other source the online system determines a score associated with the user of the source. For example the score associated with a user of the source is a number of different types of user identifying information maintained by the source matching types of user identifying information associated with a user of the other source. As a specific example if a date of birth a gender and a location associated with a user of the source match a date of birth a gender and a location associated with a user of the other source the online system determines score of three is associated with the user of the source.

The online system determines measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information or different combinations of types of user identifying information. A measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information provides an indication of a likelihood the type of user identifying information identifying a particular user of a source. For example if a source is the online system an email address has a high measure of accuracy as it is capable of uniquely identifying a user of the online system while a date of birth has a low measure of accuracy as it is unable to uniquely identify a particular user of the online system. In some embodiments the determined measures of accuracy are based on the scores associated with users of the source having types of user identifying information matching user identifying information associated with users of the other source. For example in some embodiments the measure of accuracy of a type of user identifying information is an average score associated with users of a source associated with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a user of another source. Alternatively the measure of accuracy of a type of user identifying information is a number of users of a source with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a user of another source and associated with at least a threshold score. Similarly measures of accuracy may be determined for various sets that each include different of types of user identifying information.

The online system stores a ranking of types of user identifying information based at least in part on the measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information. In some embodiments the ranking includes types of user identifying information as well as sets of user identifying information. Alternatively a ranking for individual types of user identifying information is maintained while a separate ranking for sets of types of user identifying information is also maintained. For example types of user identifying information with higher measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information more likely to identify a particular user have higher positions in the ranking while types of user identifying information with lower measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information less likely to identify a particular user have lower positions in the ranking. The online system may receive a request from a source or other entity including a specified measure accuracy for identifying a particular user of another entity. Based at least in part on the ranking the online system identifies one or more types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information associated a measure of accuracy equaling or exceeding the specified measure of accuracy and communicates information describing the identified one or more types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information to the requesting source or other entity

The figures depict various embodiments for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles described herein.

The client devices are one or more computing devices capable of receiving user input as well as transmitting and or receiving data via the network . In one embodiment a client device is a conventional computer system such as a desktop or a laptop computer. Alternatively a client device may be a device having computer functionality such as a personal digital assistant PDA a mobile telephone a smartphone or another suitable device. A client device is configured to communicate via the network . In one embodiment a client device executes an application allowing a user of the client device to interact with the online system . For example a client device executes a browser application to enable interaction between the client device and the online system via the network . In another embodiment a client device interacts with the online system through an application programming interface API running on a native operating system of the client device such as IOS or ANDROID .

The client devices are configured to communicate via the network which may comprise any combination of local area and or wide area networks using both wired and or wireless communication systems. In one embodiment the network uses standard communications technologies and or protocols. For example the network includes communication links using technologies such as Ethernet 802.11 worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX 3G 4G code division multiple access CDMA digital subscriber line DSL etc. Examples of networking protocols used for communicating via the network include multiprotocol label switching MPLS transmission control protocol Internet protocol TCP IP hypertext transport protocol HTTP simple mail transfer protocol SMTP and file transfer protocol FTP . Data exchanged over the network may be represented using any suitable format such as hypertext markup language HTML or extensible markup language XML . In some embodiments all or some of the communication links of the network may be encrypted using any suitable technique or techniques.

One or more third party systems may be coupled to the network for communicating with the online system which is further described below in conjunction with . In some embodiments one or more third party systems may be directly coupled to each other and or to the online system . In one embodiment a third party system is an application provider communicating information describing applications for execution by a client device or communicating data to client devices for use by an application executing on the client device. In other embodiments a third party system provides content or other information for presentation via a client device . A third party system may also communicate information to the online system such as advertisements content or information about an application provided by the third party system .

Each user of the online system is associated with a user profile which is stored in the user profile store . A user profile includes declarative information about the user that was explicitly shared by the user and may also include profile information inferred by the online system . In one embodiment a user profile includes multiple data fields each describing one or more attributes of the corresponding online system user. Examples of information stored in a user profile include biographic demographic and other types of descriptive information such as work experience educational history gender hobbies or preferences location and the like. A user profile may also store other information provided by the user for example images or videos. In certain embodiments images of users may be tagged with information identifying the online system users displayed in an image. A user profile in the user profile store may also maintain references to actions by the corresponding user performed on content items in the content store and stored in the action log .

While user profiles in the user profile store are frequently associated with individuals allowing individuals to interact with each other via the online system user profiles may also be stored for entities such as businesses or organizations. This allows an entity to establish a presence on the online system for connecting and exchanging content with other online system users. The entity may post information about itself about its products or provide other information to users of the online system using a brand page associated with the entity s user profile. Other users of the online system may connect to the brand page to receive information posted to the brand page or to receive information from the brand page. A user profile associated with the brand page may include information about the entity itself providing users with background or informational data about the entity.

The content store stores objects that each represent various types of content. Examples of content represented by an object include a page post a status update a photograph a video a link a shared content item a gaming application achievement a check in event at a local business a brand page or any other type of content. Online system users may create objects stored by the content store such as status updates photos tagged by users to be associated with other objects in the online system events groups or applications. In some embodiments objects are received from third party applications or third party applications separate from the online system . In one embodiment objects in the content store represent single pieces of content or content items. Hence online system users are encouraged to communicate with each other by posting text and content items of various types of media to the online system through various communication channels. This increases the amount of interaction of users with each other and increases the frequency with which users interact within the online system .

The action logger receives communications about user actions internal to and or external to the online system populating the action log with information about user actions. Examples of actions include adding a connection to another user sending a message to another user uploading an image reading a message from another user viewing content associated with another user and attending an event posted by another user. In addition a number of actions may involve an object and one or more particular users so these actions are associated with those users as well and stored in the action log .

The action log may be used by the online system to track user actions on the online system as well as actions on third party systems that communicate information to the online system . Users may interact with various objects on the online system and information describing these interactions is stored in the action log . Examples of interactions with objects include commenting on posts sharing links checking in to physical locations via a mobile device accessing content items and any other suitable interactions. Additional examples of interactions with objects on the online system that are included in the action log include commenting on a photo album communicating with a user establishing a connection with an object joining an event joining a group creating an event authorizing an application using an application expressing a preference for an object liking the object and engaging in a transaction. Additionally the action log may record a user s interactions with advertisements on the online system as well as with other applications operating on the online system . In some embodiments data from the action log is used to infer interests or preferences of a user augmenting the interests included in the user s user profile and allowing a more complete understanding of user preferences.

The action log may also store user actions taken on a third party system such as an external website and communicated to the online system . For example an e commerce website may recognize a user of an online system through a social plug in enabling the e commerce website to identify the user of the online system . Because users of the online system are uniquely identifiable e commerce websites such as in the preceding example may communicate information about a user s actions outside of the online system to the online system for association with the user. Hence the action log may record information about actions users perform on a third party system including webpage viewing histories advertisements that were engaged purchases made and other patterns from shopping and buying.

In one embodiment the edge store stores information describing connections between users and other objects on the online system as edges. Some edges may be defined by users allowing users to specify their relationships with other users. For example users may generate edges with other users that parallel the users real life relationships such as friends co workers partners and so forth. Other edges are generated when users interact with objects in the online system such as expressing interest in a page on the online system sharing a link with other users of the online system and commenting on posts made by other users of the online system .

In one embodiment an edge may include various features each representing characteristics of interactions between users interactions between users and objects or interactions between objects. For example features included in an edge describe rate of interaction between two users how recently two users have interacted with each other the rate or amount of information retrieved by one user about an object or the number and types of comments posted by a user about an object. The features may also represent information describing a particular object or user. For example a feature may represent the level of interest that a user has in a particular topic the rate at which the user logs into the online system or information describing demographic information about a user. Each feature may be associated with a source object or user a target object or user and a feature value. A feature may be specified as an expression based on values describing the source object or user the target object or user or interactions between the source object or user and target object or user hence an edge may be represented as one or more feature expressions.

The edge store also stores information about edges such as affinity scores for objects interests and other users. Affinity scores or affinities may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object or another user in the online system based on the actions performed by the user. A user s affinity may be computed by the online system over time to approximate a user s interest in an object a topic or another user in the online system based on actions performed by the user. Computation of affinity is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed on Dec. 23 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 254 filed on Nov. 30 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 689 969 filed on Nov. 30 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 690 088 filed on Nov. 30 2012 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Multiple interactions between a user and a specific object may be stored as a single edge in the edge store in one embodiment. Alternatively each interaction between a user and a specific object is stored as a separate edge. In some embodiments connections between users may be stored in the user profile store or the user profile store may access the edge store to determine connections between users.

The identification accuracy determination module determines a measure of accuracy with which different types of user identifying information identify a user of an entity such as the online system . For example the identification accuracy determination module determines an accuracy with which user identifying information maintained by a third party system matching types of user identifying information associated users maintained by the online system accurately identify an online system user. As another example the identification accuracy determination module determines an accuracy with which user identifying information maintained by a third party system matching types of user identifying information identifying users maintained by an additional third party system accurately identify a user of the additional third party system .

To determine measures of accuracy of different types of user identifying information identifying a user the identification accuracy determination module identifies users from a pair of sources e.g. the online system and a third party system two third party systems and obtains user identifying information associated with each user by the sources. For example the accuracy determination module obtains user identifying information from the online system associated with a set of online system users and obtains user identifying information from a third party system associated with a set of third party system users. The user identifying information includes multiple types of user identifying information. Example types of user identifying information include a name a date of birth an e mail a gender a location an online system user identifier and a phone number. For each of the users the identification accuracy determination module compares user identifying information associated with a user by a source to user identifying information associated with a user by another source. In some embodiments based on the types of user identifying information associated with the user by the source matching the types of user identifying information associated with a user of the other source the identification accuracy determination module determines a score associated with the user of the source. For example the score associated with a user of the source is a number of different types of user identifying information maintained by the source matching types of user identifying information associated with a user of the other source. As a specific example if a date of birth a gender and a location associated with a user of the source match a date of birth a gender and a location associated with a user of the other source the accuracy determination module associates a score of three with the user of the source.

In other embodiments different types of user identifying information are associated with different weights and the score associated with a user is based at least in part on the weights associated with types of user identifying information associated with the user by a source matching types of user identifying information associated with a user of the other source. For example a phone number is associated with a higher weight than a gender as a phone number associated with a particular user is more likely to identify the particular user than the gender associated with the particular user. Weights associated with types of user identifying information may be modified based on values associated with the type of user identifying information in some embodiments. For example if user identifying information maintained by a source and including a name having a value of Jones and a location having a value of Chicago matches user identifying information maintained by the other source having a matching name value and location value a weight associated with the name value is lower than if the matching values included a name having a value of Jones and a location of Shanghai. This allows the weights associated with types of user identifying information to account for matches between other types of user identifying information.

Based on the scores associated with users of the source having types of user identifying information matching user identifying information associated with users of the other source the identification accuracy determination module determines measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information or different combinations of types of user identifying information. A measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information provides an indication of a likelihood of the type of information identifying a particular user of a source. For example an online system user identifier has a high measure of accuracy as it is capable of uniquely identifying a user of the online system while a date of birth has a low measure of accuracy as it is unable to uniquely identify a particular user of the online system . In some embodiments the measure of accuracy of a type of user identifying information is an average score associated with users of a source associated with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a user of another source. Alternatively the measure of accuracy of a type of user identifying information is a number of users of a source with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a user of another source and associated with at least a threshold score. Similarly measures of accuracy may be determined for various sets of types of user identifying information allowing the identification accuracy determination module to evaluate the ability of different combinations of types of user identifying information to identify a particular user of a source such as the online system.

The identification accuracy determination module stores a ranking of types of user identifying information based at least in part on the measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information. In some embodiments the ranking includes types of user identifying information as well as sets of user identifying information. Alternatively a ranking for individual types of user identifying information is maintained while a separate ranking for sets of types of user identifying information is also maintained. For example types of user identifying information with higher measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information more likely to identify a particular user have higher positions in the ranking while types of user identifying information with lower measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information less likely to identify a particular user have lower positions in the ranking. The identification accuracy determination module may receive a request from a source or other entity including a specified measure of accuracy for identifying a particular user of another entity. Based at least in part on the ranking the identification accuracy determination module identifies one or more types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information associated a measure of accuracy equaling or exceeding the specified measure of accuracy and communicates information describing the identified one or more types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information to the requesting source or other entity. Determining measures of accuracy associated with types of user identifying information is further described below in conjunction with .

The web server links the online system via the network to the one or more client devices as well as to the one or more third party systems . The web server serves web pages as well as other content such as JAVA FLASH XML and so forth. The web server may receive and route messages between the online system and the client device for example instant messages queued messages e.g. email text messages short message service SMS messages or messages sent using any other suitable messaging technique. A user may send a request to the web server to upload information e.g. images or videos that are stored in the content store . Additionally the web server may provide application programming interface API functionality to send data directly to native client device operating systems such as IOS ANDROID WEBOS or BlackberryOS.

In the example of a third party system sends user identifying information associated with multiple users of the third party system to the online system . In some embodiments the third party system obfuscates the user identifying information and sends the obfuscated user identifying information to the online system . For example the third party system sends a hash of the user identifying information associated with various users of the third party system . Additionally the online system retrieves user identifying information associated with multiple users of the online system . However in other embodiments the third party system and the online system each send user identifying information associated with users of the respective systems to another third party system such as a third party auditor. User identifying information associated with users of the online system or associated with users of the third party system includes various types of user identifying information. Example types of user identifying information include an online system identifier or a third party system identifier an e mail address a name a phone number a location a gender and a date of birth.

For each user of the online system associated with retrieved user identifying information the online system compares user identifying information associated with a user of the online system by the online system to received user identifying information associated with users of the third party system . Based on the comparison the online system identifies online system users associated with user identifying information including one or more types of user identifying information matching a type of user identifying information included in user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . For example the online system identifies an online system user associated with a name and a location that match a name and location associated with a third party system user by the third party system or identifies an online system user associated with an email address matching an email address that matches an email address associated with a third party system user by the third party system .

A score is determined for each online system user identified as associated with at least one type of user identifying information by the online system matching a type of user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system by the third party system . In one embodiment the score associated with an identified user is based on a number of types of user identifying information associated with the user by the online system that match types of user identifying information associated with a user by the third party system . For example a score associated with a user is a sum of the types of user identifying information associated with the user by the online system matching types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user by the third party system . As a specific example a score of 7 is determined for an online system user associated with 7 types of user identifying information matching types of user identifying associated with a third party system user by the third party system .

In some embodiments weights are associated with different types of user identifying information the online system determines and a score associated with an identified online system user based on the weights associated with types of user identifying information associated with the identified online system user that match types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user by the third party system . For example the online system combines weights associated with types of user identifying information associated with an online system user that match types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user to determine the score associated with the identified online system user. Alternatively a score determined for an identified online system user is a value based at least in part on a number or a percentage of types of user identifying information associated with the identified online system user matching types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. However in various embodiments any suitable method may be used to determine a score associated with an online system user identified as having one or more types of user identifying information matching types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user.

Based on the determined scores the online system determines a measure of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information. Additionally the online system may determine measures of accuracy associated with sets of types of user identifying information with each set including multiple types of user identifying information. A measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information represents a likelihood of the type of user identifying information identifying a specific user of the online system or of the third party system . For example a type of user identifying information associated with a measure of accuracy of 0.97 has a 97 likelihood of identifying a specific user of the online system if received by the online system . Similarly a measure of accuracy associated with a set of types of user identifying information indicates the likelihood of identifying a specific user of the online system when the online system receives the types of user identifying information in the set. While describes measures of accuracy with respect to identifying users of the online system for purposes of illustration in other embodiments the measures of accuracy are based on identification of a user by the third party system or by another third party system that receives the type of user identifying information.

A measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information is determined based on scores associated with identified users having the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . For example a measure of accuracy associated with an email address type of user identifying information is based on scores associated with identified users associated with user identifying information including an email address matching an email address included in user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . As another example a measure of accuracy associated with a set of name and location is based on scores associated with identified users associated with user identifying information including both a name and a location matching a name and a location included in user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . In one embodiment a measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information is an average of the scores associated with identified users associated with user identifying information including the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information included in user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . Alternatively the measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information is based on a number of identified users associated with user identifying information including the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information included in user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system and associated with at least a threshold score. For example a measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information is a ratio of a total number of online system users associated with the type of user identifying information that matches the type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user and also associated with at least a threshold score to a total number of online system users associated with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user.

Based on the measures of accuracy associated with types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information the online system ranks the types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information. In some embodiments the ranking includes types of user identifying information as well as sets of user identifying information. Alternatively individual types of user identifying information are ranked while sets of types of user identifying information are separately ranked . For example types of user identifying information with higher measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information more likely to identify a particular user have higher positions in the ranking while types of user identifying information with lower measures of accuracy i.e. types of user identifying information less likely to identify a particular user have lower positions in the ranking. The online system stores the ranking allowing the online system to maintain information describing the likelihoods of different types of user identifying information identifying a specific online system user.

The third party system may leverage the ranking of types of user identifying information to determine types of user identifying information capable of identifying an online system user with a specified accuracy. In one embodiment the third party system requests a specified measure of accuracy for identifying online system users from the online system . For example the third party system requests a 95 measure of accuracy in identifying online system users. From the ranking of types of user identifying information the online system identifies one or more types of user identifying information associated with at least the threshold measure of accuracy. In the preceding example the online system identifies types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information associated with at least a 95 measure of accuracy. The identified types of user identifying information or sets of types of user identifying information may be communicated to the third party system allowing the third party system to specify an identified type of user identifying information or set of types of user identifying information for use to identify online system users.

Alternatively the third party system communicates to the online system an indication of types of user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system matching types of user identifying information maintained by the online system or by another third party system . In some embodiments the indication includes a request for a measure of the capability of the types of user identifying information in the indication to identify specific users of the online system or of the additional third party system . The online system accesses the ranking of types of user identifying information and identifies sets of types of user identifying information including the user identifying information included in the indication. From the identified sets of types of user identifying information the online system identifies a maximum measure of accuracy associated with the identified sets of types of user identifying information. The online system communicates information to the third party system based on the identified maximum measure of accuracy allowing the third party system to receive information form the online system describing the ability of the types of user identifying information included in the indication to identify specific users of the additional third party system or of the online system . For example if the indication from the third party system includes location and phone number as types of user identifying information the online system retrieves from the ranking a set of types of user identifying information including location and phone number and associated with a maximum measure of accuracy relative to measure of accuracy associated with other sets of user identifying information in the ranking including location and phone number. The information communicated to the third party system may be the identified maximum measure of accuracy or may be a value based on the identified maximum measure of accuracy. For example the online system compares the identified maximum measure of accuracy to a threshold measure of accuracy and communicates a value to the third party system based on the comparison. A value may be communicated to the third party system if the identified maximum measure of accuracy exceeds or equals the threshold measure of accuracy while a different value may be communicated to the third party system if the identified maximum measure of accuracy is less than the threshold measure of accuracy. In various embodiments the threshold measure of accuracy is included in the indication received from the third party system or the threshold measure of accuracy is maintained by the online system .

While shows an example where the online system determines the measure of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information in other embodiments an additional third party system may determine the measures of accuracy. For example the online system and the third party system each communicate user identifying information associated with online system users and third party system users respectively to the additional third party system . As described above the additional third party system identifies online system users associated with one or more types of user identifying information matching one or more types of user identifying information associated with third party system users. The additional third party system determines scores associated with each identified user based on the types of user identifying information associated with an identified user by the online system matching user identifying information associated with a user of the third party system . Based on the scores the additional third party system determines measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information and ranks the types of user identifying information based on the measures of accuracy as described above. The additional third party system may communicate the ranking to the third party system or may identify types of user identifying information that identify an online system user with at least a specified measure of accuracy in response to a request from the third party system including the specified measure of accuracy. Similarly the online system may receive types of user identifying information from a third party system and from an additional third party system and rank types of user identifying information as described above based on third party system users associated with one or more types of user identifying information matching types or user identifying information associated with users of the additional third party system .

In alternate embodiments the method described in conjunction with may be substantially similar except the online system determines measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information and subsequently determines scores based on the determined measure of accuracy. Additionally while shows the third party system requesting a specified measure of accuracy for identifying online system users from the online system in alternate embodiments the online system determines a specified measure of accuracy using the provided user identifying information. This may be useful provide the online system with greater flexibility as to what types of user identifying information are identified by the online system .

Different types of user identifying information associated with various online users are compared to user identifying information associated with third party system users and the online system maintains information identifying types of user identifying information associated with an online system user that matches types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. In the example of the information includes a value of 1 associated with a type of user identifying information associated with an online system user that matches the corresponding type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user and includes a value of 0 associated with a type of user identifying information associated with the online system user that does not match the corresponding type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. The information shown in the example of includes various online system user identifiers and associates values with types of user identifying information associated with an online system user identifier . For example comparing user identifying information associated with an online system user associated with an online system user identifier of 1234 has a name A a gender C and a location D matching a name A a gender C and a location D associated with a third party system user hence a value of 1 is associated with the name A the gender C and the location D associated with the user having online system user identifier 1234. As another example in the user associated with online system user identifier 3423 has a name A a date of birth B a gender C a location D an email E and a phone number F matching the corresponding types of user identifying information associated with a third party system user so the information includes a value of 1 associated with each of the preceding types of user identifying information .

From the values associated with different types of user identifying information the online system determines a score associated with each online system user associated with a type of user identifying information matching a corresponding type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. In the example of the score associated with a user is a sum of the values associated with types of user identifying information associated with the user. As an example in the score associated with the user having online system user identifier of 1234 is 3 while the score associated with the user having online system user identifier of 3423 is associated with a score of 6. However in other embodiments the score associated with a user may be determined based on the values associated with types of user identifying information associated with the user via any suitable method.

Based on the scores associated with each user the online system determines a ranking of different types of user identifying information . The ranking is based on measures of accuracy associated with different types of user identifying information associated with online system users. A measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information describes a likelihood of identifying a specific online system user if the type of user identifying information is provided to the online system . For example a measure of accuracy associated with a type of user identifying information is a ratio of a total number of online system users associated with the type of user identifying information that matches the type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user and also associated with at least a threshold score to a total number of online system users associated with the type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user. As a specific example if online system are associated with a type of user identifying information matching the type of user identifying information associated with a third party system user and 70 of the online system users associated with the matching type of user identifying information are associated with at least a threshold score the measure of accuracy of the type of user identifying information is 70 72 or 97 . In the example of the ranking includes sets including multiple types of user identifying information allowing the ranking to describe the likelihood of identifying a specific online system user if a combination of the types of user identifying information included in the set is received by the online system .
