This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 904 255 filed 14 Nov. 2013 and entitled DEFENSE AGAINST COUNTERFEITING ATTACKS USING ANTIFUSES which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under Grant CCF 1116102 awarded by the National Science Foundation and Grant D11AP00292 awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency. The United States government has certain rights in the invention.

Antifuses are one time programmable OTP two terminal interconnect devices. An antifuse has high initial resistance e.g. open circuit condition until a programming signal changes it irreversibly to a low resistance condition. It has been extensively employed as an economical and convenient solution in complex logic integrated circuits ICs for improved functionality and flexibility and thus widely used in non volatile memories and OTP secure field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . For example antifuse based FPGAs offer higher security stemming primarily from their non volatility. It secures a design due to piracy and difficulty in determining the state of an antifuse that protects against direct physical attack. While many existing antifuse based FPGAs provide desired security there exist limitations and challenges relating to high leakage power increasing security requirements e.g. against potential attack in the form of reprogramming and scalability to advanced technology nodes. For instance many mission critical applications e.g. military and aerospace require devices with high programming speed low power tolerance to radiation and harsh environment and high resistance to attacks.

As an example an antifuse apparatus can include a cantilever extending from a first electrode portion to terminate in a distal end. A second electrode portion can be spaced apart from the cantilever by an air gap. In response to a program voltage across the first and second electrode portions the cantilever can be adapted to move from an unprogrammed condition corresponding to an open circuit condition where the cantilever is spaced apart from the second electrode portion to at least one permanent programmed condition corresponding to a short circuit condition between the first and second electrode portions where the cantilever engages the second electrode portion.

As another example a system can include an arrangement of logic blocks. A matrix of interconnects can extend between the logic blocks at least some of the interconnects intersecting with each other interconnects in the matrix to define intersections. A plurality of nanoelectromechanical antifuses can be implemented at some of the intersections to provide a one time programmable connection or open circuit between respective interconnects depending on the state of the nanoelectromechanical antifuse at each respective intersection. In some examples the system can be a field programmable gate array and other examples it can be a memory device.

This disclosure relates to a nanoelectromechanical NEMS antifuse and to systems that can utilize such antifuses. The NEMS antifuses can serve as interconnect building blocks for making secure integrated circuits such as one time programmable OTP memory cells and OTP field programmable gate arrays FPGAs . As disclosed herein the NEMS antifuse is based on electrostatically actuated nanocantilevers such as can be fabricated from silicon carbide SiC . The NEMS antifuse can include two or more terminals according to the desired function to be employed. For example a two terminal antifuse can provide an OTP connection between a pair of interconnects in an integrated circuit. As another example a three terminal antifuse can provide an OTP connection to set a state of a memory cell while also providing another terminal to read the state value of the cell. As compared to metal metal antifuses NEMS antifuses can exhibit very low programming voltage high current density abrupt switching small footprints and long term stability. Thus NEMS antifuses provide new opportunities for designing low power high security and harsh environment operable logic circuits and systems.

The cantilever can extend along a central axis in its unprogrammed condition shown in and have a contact surface that is substantially planar. The contact surface is located opposite a corresponding surface of the second electrode portion . The contact surface cantilever thus can be spaced apart from the surface by an air gap demonstrated at in its unprogrammed condition. In the example of the first electrode portion can correspond to a source terminal and the second electrode portion can correspond to a gate terminal of the two terminal antifuse apparatus .

The cantilever can be adapted to move from its unprogrammed condition corresponding to an open circuit where the air gap spaces apart the cantilever from the gate electrode portion . The resistance between the gate and source terminals in the unprogrammed condition can be greater than about 10 G . In response to applying a program voltage demonstrated at Vto the gate electrode electrostatic forces can generate between the gate electrode portion and the cantilever to cause the cantilever to move out of its axis and into permanent contact with the surface of the gate electrode portion as shown in . That is a corresponding end portion of the cantilever remains in contact with the gate electrode portion after the program voltage Vhas been removed. The cantilever remains in contact with the gate electrode portion because the adhesion force between the surface and the surface exceeds the mechanical restoring force.

As an example the adhesion force between two contact surfaces and is proportional to the contact area e.g. a first order equation can be given by Fa Ha Area 6 pi d where Ha pi are constants and d is the distance between two surfaces . The restoring force of the cantilever depends on the spring constant k which depends on the cantilever dimensions length width and thickness for a given material and the beam displacement. The NEMS AF device is thus designed to have a large contact area and a thickness that sufficient to create adhesion force that exceeds the restoring force. This is in sharp contrast to typical NEMS logic switches where there usually is a very small contact area to reduce the adhesion force.

The apparatus can also include control block that is configured to control the application of the program voltage Vto the electrode portion for programming the antifuse apparatus from its open circuit condition to its closed short circuit condition . The control block can activate the gate voltage to provide a pull in voltage V that is sufficient to create an electrostatic force to urge the distal end portion of the cantilever into permanent contact with the gate electrode portion .

By way of example a SiC NEMS antifuse can be fabricated starting with an Si wafer that has a layer e.g. about 500 nm thermally grown of SiO. A layer of polycrystalline SiC poly SiC can be deposited using LPCVD or another deposition technique. A mask e.g. applied via sputtering PMMA can be employed to define the pattern with wafer scale electron beam lithography EBL . The pattern can be transferred to the SiC layer using reactive ion etching. The suspended cantilever can then be released via an etching of the patterned SiO e.g. etching with vapor HF to provide the OTP NEMS antifuse apparatus .

Referring back to in the device operation the movable cantilever can be grounded at its clamping point via the source electrode to provide a voltage potential reference with respect to the program electrode . To understand the operation of the NEMS apparatus the apparatus can be modeled as a parallel plate capacitor with one plate fixed and the other attached to a spring. The capacitance of this parallel plate Ccan be expressed as follows 

When the program voltage Vis applied between the two plates the total force acting on the movable plate can be expressed as follows 

The behavior of the apparatus can be understood by its electrostatic coupling via the air gap capacitor. As the applied gate voltage Vincreases to the pull in voltage Vor beyond the NEMS antifuse is programmed. The pull in voltage Vcan be expressed as follows 8 27 3 

After programming the total force acting on the cantilever is F F 0 where Fis the contact adhesion force and F kis the mechanical restoring force when the contact is made. The switching time can be estimated by square root over 27 2 4 

As mentioned above prior to programming the NEMS antifuse operates as an open switch e.g. having high resistance of about 10 G . During programming as shown in the current through the NEMS antifuse between gate and source electrodes and increases abruptly when V V e.g. V 4.3V demonstrating instantaneous programming via NEMS contact. In the current in graph is plotted in a logarithmic scale and in graph as a linear scale. As Vsweeps back to 0V demonstrated by arrows pointing to left of V the antifuse stays connected with on state current I 1 A which represents a current measurement compliance that can be set manually. If sweeping Vagain after the programming cycle the I V curves and shows resistive behavior.

Additionally the NEMS antifuse device constructed as disclosed herein exhibits low leakage current. The NEMS antifuse device also exhibits long term stability. For instance it has been determined that the connection of this already programmed device after 24 months of inactivity had an Rof about 20 k .

As mentioned one key to antifuse based security is that once an antifuse is programmed the programmed state cannot change under potential attacks i.e. the antifuse is an OTP device . One potential attack an antifuse may encounter is reprogramming. For instance since conventional antifuses that have two states open circuit or conductive ON there exists an opportunity for hardware attackers to reprogram one or more unprogrammed antifuses which can compromise the circuitry implementing the antifuses. The NEMS antifuse design in addresses this issue by introducing a third state e.g. having an open circuit unprogrammed state a programmed short circuit state and a programmed open circuit state . Thus the example NEMS antifuse can increase hardware security since it can include one unprogrammed state and two different programmed states. In particular the NEMS antifuse provides one programmed state that provides a permanently short circuit between the interconnects and another programmed state that provides a permanent open circuit between a pair of interconnects. As demonstrated in the example of the antifuse includes two gates for programming in both directions. Thus if a given antifuse in an IC should remain open e.g. unprogrammed the given antifuse can be programmed to permanently connect to the electrode on the other side to provide a permanently open circuit. This can prevent reprogramming attacks for the given antifuse since the programmed open circuit condition is connection is irreversible.

It is understood that each of the antifuses in the example of can be implemented according to any of the examples shown and described herein e.g. antifuses and . For example an interface circuit can be configured to supply a program voltage across a given antifuse . Such interface circuitry can be implemented as part of the logic block or at separate circuitry in the system not shown . It is understood that the logic block can be implemented in a variety of configurations depending upon the implementation of the system . For example an FPGA the logic blocks can be implemented as including buffers register cells R cells as well as combinatory cells C cells .

The reading of the programmed state of the cell can be similar to as disclosed with respect to . For instance a read sweep voltage VD1 can be applied across the drain electrode and source electrode to determine the state of the cell. Depending on the dimensions of the respective contact areas and the thickness of the cantilever the cell can also be used to implement a one time or multiple time programmable nonvolatile memory for regular or harsh environment applications depending on choice of materials. For instance SiC beams can be used for harsh environment application. In this case the gate electrode G can be used for active pull off after the cantilever encounters stiction to the top electrode s and .

It will be appreciated that a NEMS antifuse has the intrinsic advantage of near zero leakage or off state current due to the air gaps in the device structure. For example the measured off state current can as low as 10 fA or lower which is the noise floor of the measurement system. This indicates that the ultimate leakage or off state current is well below this level. The programming voltage can be further adjusted to a desired level such as by scaling the actuation gaps between the gate electrode and the cantilever. The active area for NEMS antifuses is estimated by including the actuation gaps G and cantilever beam width but no connecting pads which are only needed for accessing individual devices in the characterization stage. For large network of antifuses the pads can be eliminated to achieve large scale integration. The device volume is calculated by multiplying the active area and the SiC film thickness.

In view of the foregoing the NEMS antifuse provides robust antifuse structure. The NEMS antifuse can as interconnect building blocks for secure OTP FPGAs as well as OTP memory devices. The NEMS antifuses can have very low programming voltage high current density abrupt switching small footprints and long term stability. NEMS antifuses can also offer significant improvement in power consumption relative to other antifuse based systems e.g. metal metal antifuse FPGA circuitry . NEMS antifuses further will facilitate designing low power high security and harsh environment operable logic circuits and systems.

It is of course not possible to describe every conceivable combination of components or methods but one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that many further combinations and permutations are possible. Accordingly the invention is intended to embrace all such alterations modifications and variations that fall within the scope of this application including the appended claims.
