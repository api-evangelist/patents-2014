This application is a non provisional application that claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61 828 138 filed May 28 2013 and is incorporated by reference.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The present invention is directed to gaming devices networked gaming systems and methods and more particularly to electronic locks adapted to be retrofit for existing mechanical locks for gaming devices kiosks vending machines or other equipment which use this type of lock.

Security is a very important in many environments including casino venues. Typically many casinos employ a wide variety of surveillance cameras to monitor the activity of both casino patrons and employees. Furthermore a variety of security devices are utilized to restrict access to and from certain areas of the casino.

Additionally various security measures are used to protect the internal spaces within gaming devices such as slot machines and kiosks found on the casino floor. Traditionally mechanical locks have been used to restrict access to the interior space s of a gaming device. Commonly the mechanical lock may be unlocked by inserting a key into the lock. Once unlocked the bolt of the mechanical lock is rotated to free a latch for opening the door to the interior of the gaming device. For example to provide maintenance remove a cashbox or restock the gaming device with printable ticket coupons a casino attendant is required to use one or more mechanical keys to open a particular door remove a container and close and lock the door with the key. This can be a cumbersome and time extensive task especially when a casino employee needs to access more than one gaming device.

In some casino venues which may have thousands of gaming devices typically a universal key is used to unlock a mechanical lock to release the latch to open the door of the gaming devices. Alternatively every gaming device has a unique key. Further components within the gaming device such as the coin hopper or bill box may be secured by an additional mechanical lock requiring additional keys to unlock the lock. Therefore the number of keys needed to access the various gaming devices and compartments within the gaming devices can easily grow to a large number of keys. Additionally in the case of a lost key or security breach the gaming devices must be re keyed or the locks themselves replaced. The task of re keying devices can become very expensive and very time consuming. For example if a casino employee loses their key s or perhaps is summarily discharged and does not return their key s the locks must be replaced or re keyed and new keys issued to the employees.

The gaming device door lock is typically mounted on the side of an upright gaming device cabinet chassis and beneath the arm rest for a slant type gaming device. These locks are relatively small and are typically tumbler pin locks that receive a tubular key or are cam locks of the type to receive a typical blade key which when the proper key is inserted release the lock bolt for rotation to free a latch to open the door.

When an attendant opens a gaming device door there may not be a record to indicate the identity of the attendant the time of the opening and the nature of the required access. Gaming devices typically include within the device a retained written machine entry access log known by the acronym as the MEAL ticket for attendants gaining access to record the event e.g. maintenance event operational fault or the like. However if the attendant fails to record the event the access event may not be recorded. Of course security cameras may capture the attendant to make sure the access is authorized or to investigate an unauthorized access event.

It has been known to provide new electronically activated locks in lieu of the traditional mechanical locks such as disclosed in now abandoned DiMichele U.S. Pub App U.S. 2008 0207314 filed Feb. 23 2007 titled Automated Locking System and DiMichele and U.S. Pub App U.S. 2008 0207335 both filed Feb. 23 2007 and titled Automated Locking System the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. These disclosures describe a new locking mechanism controlled by a processor such as to control a solenoid or electric motor to move a bolt. Authentication is required to control the lock. Mattice et al U.S. Pat. No. 7 758 428 filed Apr. 2 2001 and titled Method and Apparatus for Controlling Access to Areas of Gaming Machines the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference also discloses a solenoid lock for controlling access to a gaming machine compartment which includes a keyed manual override.

A drawback to these prior electronic locks is that they are unsuitable for replacing the known standard mechanical lock s on gaming machines thus requiring extensive conversion for existing gaming machines to accept these locks. This increases the expense for converting to electronic locks for a casino enterprise. The expense is not only related to the mechanical re fitting of the gaming device to receive the locks but also the expense of removing the gaming device from play for conversion period.

Such mechanical locks can also be found on kiosks in a casino provided for cashing out printed gaming vouchers.

Outside of the casino environment mechanical locks of the type described may be found on furniture such as file cabinets or mail boxes.

It would be advantageous if an electronic lock could be provided which is adapted to be mounted and assume the footprint of existing mechanical locks thus minimizing the expense of converting the gaming and other equipment to different electronic locks. This expense is not only related to the mechanical re fitting of the device to receive the prior art electronic locks but also the expense of removing the device from service during the conversion period.

It would be advantageous if an electronic lock could be provided which is simple and has few moving parts contributing to reliability.

It would be advantageous to provide for a battery back up for an electronic lock to permit operation in the event of a power failure.

It would be advantageous to provide for an external override for electronic locks in the event of an unrecoverable fault.

It would be advantageous if an electronic could be provided according to the above mentioned features which could be used to replace similar locks to vending machines kiosks gang mailboxes or other equipment.

Briefly and in general terms various embodiments are directed to a system and electronic lock adapted to replace exiting mechanical locks for gaming devices and similar devices. According to one embodiment an electronic lock is provided for replacing a mechanical lock for a gaming device having a cabinet including a door locked by the mechanical lock closed to secure an interior space of the cabinet the mechanical lock having an exterior profile to be received through and secured in an opening in one of the cabinet and door and a rotatable foot to in a locked position engage structure to lock the door closed and in an unlocked position disengage said structure to unlock the door. The electronic lock includes a barrel having an exterior profile corresponding to the exterior profile of the mechanical lock to be received and secured in the opening to replace the prior mechanical lock and a lock bolt axially disposed within the barrel for axial rotation and having one end adapted to receive the foot. A cylindrical sleeve is disposed about the barrel and has at one end an operator. The sleeve mounted to the bolt for rotation therewith and for axial displacement along the bolt from a retained to a released position. A motor is disposed between at least one of the bolt and sleeve to rotate at one end a cam. At least one tang is disposed between said bolt and sleeve and includes a follower engaging the cam. The cam in a first position causes the tang to capture the sleeve in the retained position and in a second position to release the sleeve for axial displacement from the retained position to a released position. The barrel includes at one end a head having a pocket to receive and nest the operator when the sleeve is in the retained position to prevent rotation of the sleeve bolt and foot for unlocking the door. A controller is adapted to receive commands through the network for controlling the motor to rotate the cam between the first and second positions. When the electronic lock is in a locked condition and upon the controller receiving an unlock command the motor is energized to rotate the cam causing the tang to release the sleeve for axial displacement from the retained position. A spring may bias the sleeve in this condition to spring axially to the released position where the operator moves from the pocket for rotation of the sleeve bolt and foot to unlock the lock. Sensors may be provided to sense the position of the cam. In an embodiment the tang may be biased follow the cam and toward a retained position whereupon the motor may be rotated through a full 360 of rotation such that during the rotation when the tang disengages the sleeve the bias for the sleeve causes the sleeve to be released for axial displacement. When the lock is unlocked any latch may be manipulated to unlatch the door and open the space. When in an unlocked position the attendant rotates the operator sleeve and bolt to align the operator with the pocket and the operator and sleeve are moved axially until the tang recaptures the sleeve in the retained position.

In a further embodiment the pocket and head may have an asymmetric cross section to prevent rotation of the operator when nested in the pocket.

In an embodiment sensors such as Hall effect may sense the position of the rotor as well as a fault condition.

In an embodiment prior to issuance of an unlocking command the gaming device system network authorizes the attendant though various techniques such as biometric identification fingerprint iris scan voice print facial identification PIN a portable identification instrument such as a magnetic card or wireless device.

In an embodiment the electronic lock controller may include a wireless receiver receiver transceiver adapted to receive wireless commands from the network and or a portable device.

In an embodiment the system network is adapted to store event data such as gaming machine number time and date the identity and authorization for the attendant seeking access and requesting the open command and the nature of the event.

As can be appreciated re keying the gaming devices on a casino floor which may include thousands of gaming devices can be seen as a daunting task. Often the locks are replaced to in effect re key the door lock. Further replacing the mechanical locks with different electronic lock structures would also be a time consuming and expensive task. It is desirable to provide an electronic lock which can replace a mechanical lock and substantially match the old mechanical lock footprint for the gaming device .

Referring to B the gaming device hardware for the gaming device according to the prior art is shown. The hardware is described herein inasmuch as the electronic lock may interface with the gaming device hardware or with the network through the hardware. The hardware includes base game integrated circuit board EGM Processor Board connected through serial bus line to game monitoring unit GMU such as a Bally MC300 or ACSC NT and player interface integrated I O circuit board PIB connected to the player tracking module PTM over bus lines . The PTM provides for communication between one or more gaming devices and the casino system over the network such as the type as hereinafter described. Inasmuch as gaming devices may be manufactured by different entities mounting like PTMs at each gaming device provides for communication to the system in one or more common message protocols. Gaming voucher ticket printer for printing player cash out tickets is connected to PIB and GMU over bus lines . EGM Processor Board PIB and GMU connect to Ethernet switch over bus lines . Ethernet switch connects to a slot management system and a casino management system SMS SDS CMS and CMP B network over bus line . Ethernet switch may also connect to a server based gaming server or a downloadable gaming server. GMU also may connect to the network over bus line . Speakers to produce sounds related to the game or according to the present invention connect through audio mixer and bus lines to EGM Processor Board and PIB .

Peripherals connect through bus to EGM Processor Board . The peripherals include but are not limited to the following and may include individual processing capability bill voucher acceptor to validate and accept currency and ticket vouchers the player interfaces such a buttons primary and secondary game displays and any secondary or tertiary displays with without touch screen functionality monitors and lights. The peripherals may include the displays as hereinafter described with reference to the various embodiments of the present invention as herein described or their equivalents. For example the bill voucher acceptor is typically connected to the game input output board of the EGM processing board which is in turn connected to a conventional central processing unit CPU board such as an Intel Pentium microprocessor mounted on a gaming motherboard. The I O board may be connected to CPU processor board by a serial connection such as RS 232 or USB or may be attached to the processor by a bus such as but not limited to an ISA bus. The gaming motherboard may be mounted with other conventional components such as are found on conventional personal computer motherboards and loaded with a game program which may include a gaming machine operating system OS such as a Bally Alpha OS. EGM processor board executes a game program that causes the gaming terminal to display and play a game. The various components and included devices may be installed with conventionally and or commercially available components devices and circuitry into a conventional and or commercially available gaming terminal cabinet . The electronic lock according to the one or more embodiments of the present invention may also be considered a peripheral and connected to the bus .

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button or a touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide a display of randomly selected indicia on one or more displays such as the primary game display as shown in . In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming terminal for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of EGM Processor Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any secondary display s .

Predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from EGM Processor Board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments the game program is stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. In an alternative embodiment the game programs are stored in a remote storage device. In an embodiment the remote storage device is housed in a remote server such as a downloadable gaming server. The gaming machine may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming terminal are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game program and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to the card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PID includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player tracking module and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus player tracking display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive player tracking display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and cause the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the player tracking display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

PTMs are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming terminal . The system components include the player tacking module e.g. Bally iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the PTM processing board and game monitoring unit GMU . The GMU and PTM can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming terminal processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The high level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

The electronic lock according to the embodiments of the present invention may be communicatively coupled to the GMU and or PTM for communication with the network and one or more servers. Additionally the prior art gaming devices typically include a battery back up to maintain certain functions in the event of a power loss such as the various meters or other electronic devices as desired or as mandated by jurisdictional regulations.

Referring now to an example of the architecture for casino gaming system hosting a number of gaming devices is illustrated. The gaming machines are connected via a network to a network bridge which is used for networking routing and polling gaming machines including slot machines. The network bridge connects to a back end system . Optionally the gaming machines may connect to the network via a network rack which provides for a fewer number of connections to the back end system . Both network bridge and network rack may be classified as middleware and facilitate communications between the back end system and the gaming machines . The network bridges and network rack may comprise data repositories for storing network performance data. Such performance data may be based on network traffic and other network related information. Optionally the network bridge and the network rack may be interchangeable components. For example in one embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise only network bridges and no network racks. Alternatively in another embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise only network racks and no network bridges. Additionally in an alternative embodiment a casino gaming system may comprise any combination of one or more network bridges and one or more network racks.

Alternately gaming terminals may provide a game with an accumulation style feature game as one of a set of multiple primary games selected for play by a random number generator as described above. A gaming system of the type described above also allows a plurality of games in accordance with the various embodiments of the invention to be linked under the control of a group game server not shown for cooperative or competitive play in a particular area carousel casino or between casinos located in geographically separate areas. For example one or more examples of group games under control of a group game server are disclosed in U.S. Published Application 2008 0139305 entitled Networked System and Method for Group Gaming filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The gaming system among other functionalities such as slot accounting i.e. monitoring the amount wagered drop awards paid and other casino services includes the player tracking CMS CMP server and or data warehouse storing player account data. This data includes personal data for players enrolled in the casino players club sometimes referred to as a loyalty club. An example of the personal data is the player s name address SSN birth date spouse s name and perhaps personal preferences such as types of games preferences regarding promotions and the like. As is known in the industry and according to the prior art at enrolment the player is assigned a created account in the player tracking CMS CMP server and is issued a player tracking card having a machine readable magnetic stripe.

When a player plays a gaming terminal he she inserts their player tracking card into the card reader which communicates data to the CMS CMP server to accumulate loyalty points based upon the wagers wins of the player. For example a player may accumulate one loyalty point for each 5 wagered.

The system may also include electronic transfer of funds functionality. For example a player having accumulated 100 at a gaming terminal may decide to cash out to play another gaming terminal. The player for example using the PTM to initiate communication with the system for example server to upload the value from the gaming terminal into an electronic account associated with the player s account. The player may choose to upload all or a portion of the funds the player s established electronic account. The system would prompt the player to enter their PIN or obtain biometrical confirmation as to the player s identity and upload the chosen amount to their account. When the player moves to another gaming terminal he she inserts their player loyalty card into the card reader to access their account. A prompt provides for the player to request funds from their account. Entering their PIN or biometric identifier the player can input the desired amount which is downloaded to their gaming terminal for play.

All or portions of the present invention may also be implemented or promoted by or through a system as suggested in . At is the gaming system which may be hosted at a casino property enterprise across several casino enterprises or by a third party host. As described above the gaming system has a network communication bus providing for communication between the gaming devices and various servers. Through a secure network firewall the various servers are in communication with a cloud computing storage service which may be hosted by the casino enterprise a licensed third party or if permitted by gaming regulators an unlicensed provider. The cloud service provides various applications which can be accessed and delivered to for example personal computers portable computing devices such as computer tablets personal digital assistants PDAs and cellular devices such as telephones and smart phones. As but an example the cloud service may store and host an eWallet application casino or player centric applications such as downloadable or accessible applications including games promotional material or applications directed to and or affecting a casino customers interaction with a casino enterprise such as accessing the players casino account establishing casino credit or the like providing bonuses to players through system wide bonusing SMB or specific bonsuing or comps to players or other applications. The cloud service includes security provide for secure communication with the cloud service between the player users and the cloud service and between the cloud service and the gaming system . Security applications may be through encryption the use of personal identification numbers PINS or other devices and systems. As suggested in the cloud service stores player user data retrieved from players users and from the gaming system . The cloud serve may also store casino employee attendant information such as identity information including name employee number a unique stored PIN for the attendant and any stored biometric identification such as fingerprint iris scan voiceprint facial image palm print or the like.

The players users may access the cloud service and the applications and data provided thereby through the Internet or through broadband wireless cellular communication systems and any intervening sort range wireless communication such as WiFi. The players users may access the applications and data through various social media offerings such as Facebook Twitter Yelp MySpace or LinkedIn or the like.

As but an example a player user may have a player account with a casino enterprise. That account may include data such as the player s credit level their rating and their available comps. At their smart phone the player user sends a request to the cloud service perhaps through a previously downloaded application to request the status of their available comps such as how many comp points they have and what may be available through redemption of those points e.g. lodging cash back meals or merchandise . The application for the request may present casino promotions graphics or other advertising to the player user. The application to support such a request would typically require the player user to enter a PIN. The cloud service forwards the inquiry to the appropriate server which in turn confirms the PIN and retrieves the requested information from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . Alternatively the data may be stored in the cloud service and routinely updated from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . In this instance the request would be responded to from data residing with the cloud service . The information is formatted by the cloud server application and delivered to the player user. The delivery may be formatted based upon the player user s device operating system OS display size or the like.

The cloud service may also host game applications to provide virtual instances of games for free promotional or where permitted P2P Pay to Play supported gaming. Third party developers may also have access to placing applications with the cloud service through for example a national operations center Bally NOC . A game software manufacturer such as Bally Gaming Inc. may also provide game applications on its own or on behalf of the casino enterprise.

Other media such as advertising notices such as an upcoming tournament may also be provided to the cloud service . When a player user accesses the cloud service certain media may be delivered to the player user in a manner formatted for their application and device.

As will be described below a casino enterprise may host employee attendant identification and authorization data as well as machine entry and access data in the cloud service . However regulations may prevent external hosting of such data.

The foregoing describes various features with respect to an example of an existing environment for the embodiments of the present invention. The details of the electronic lock and system will now be described.

Turning to the structure of the electronic lock according to the present invention is shown. To replace a mechanical lock and provide additional functionality as hereinafter described the lock includes a threaded barrel which may be manufactured from brass or steel and has at one end a cap . The barrel is sized and shaped to mimic the profile of a prior art mechanical lock. Accordingly the outer shape of the barrel is adapted to be received through the bore which previously passed the mechanical lock to replace the same. The barrel axially passes for rotation a lock bolt shown in exploded view . The bolt includes a threaded one end that mounts with a first nut a foot of the type provided on the replaced mechanical lock. The foot is adapted to interact with the existing latch mechanism to release the same to unlatch the door of the gaming device . Rotation of the bolt between a locked and an unlocked position respectively rotates the foot to with or without a latching mechanism depending upon the implementation enable the gaming device door to be opened to gain access to the secure space within. Opposite the cap the barrel has an enlarged head defining an axially disposed pocket .

With particular reference to the additional components for the lock will be described. An operator is secured at one end to a cylindrical sleeve configured to axially slide over the exterior of the surface and to rotate with the bolt and within the barrel . For example the sleeve may be splined over the bolt . Fasteners may secure the sleeve to the operator . A coil spring is provided to bias the sleeve and operator toward a released position to the left in . At least one and preferably a pair of diametrically opposed tangs are coupled along a hub for radial inward and outward motion relative to the bolt . The tangs are secured between the bolt and sleeve as by securing by fasteners the hub at an end of the bolt opposite the foot . shows the tangs and their hub . Diametrically opposed slots in the bolt accommodate the tangs . A spring urges the tangs to spread apart about their hub to capture the sleeve as described below.

When in a locked position as shown in the operator is nested in the pocket lof the head and cannot be accessed for turning for rotation of the bolt and foot . In this position the tangs are in a spread position such that engage and abut an annular shoulder inside of the sleeve proximate the operator preventing the operator and sleeve from being pulled from the barrel for manipulation as shown in . The spring maintains the engagement of the tangs with the annular shoulder to hold the sleeve in a retained position. When the tangs are radially withdrawn pivoting about the hub they move free of the shoulder whereupon the spring urges the sleeve and operator to spring outwardly from the barrel and pocket to an released unlocking position as indicated in C and B. B show partial section views where the sleeve in the retained position shows a section view of the sleeve urged to the released position. In this position the operator may be rotated as shown in which in turn rotates the bolt and the attached foot to an unlocked position for unlatching the gaming device door. As described below in this position the spring is urging the tangs outwardly to slide along the inside surface of the sleeve . When the operator is rotated back to a locking position and is urged against the bias of the spring to push the sleeve into the barrel eventually the tangs snap outwardly under the bias of spring to re engage the shoulder to retain the sleeve in a retained and locked position. D show absent the barrel the sleeve in the retained and released positions respectively.

To free the tangs from the shoulder based upon an opening command from a source as hereinafter described a small motor is provided as illustrated in . The motor is preferably a small DC motor but may by any other type. The motor is disposed between the bolt and sleeve as being disposed in the annulus of the cylindrical bolt as shown in . At one end the motor has a driven shaft which mounts an annular cam having a cylindrical surface to receive followers on the tangs . Upon receiving power from a controller as described below the motor rotates the cam which urges the tangs to be withdrawn against the bias of the spring to disengage the shoulder of the sleeve whereupon the sleeve under the bias of the spring is urged outwardly from the barrel to un nest the operator from the pocket of the head pocket . In an embodiment upon an unlock command a controller associated with the motor commands the motor to rotate the cam through one full 360 revolution from a locked or home position. During this revolution at approximately 180 from the home position the tangs have fully disengaged the shoulder and the sleeve pops outwardly to the released position to cause the operator to be freed from the constraint of the pocket of the head for rotation. In this position the operator may be rotated to an unlocked position shown in which rotates the sleeve and bolt to move the foot to release the latch. The rotation of the cam for the remaining 180 returns the cam back to home. The tangs are restrained against spreading radially outward by the inside surface of the sleeve . When the operator is returned to a locked position and pushed inward against the bias of the spring when the shoulder clears the tangs they spring radially outward under the bias of the spring to re engage the shoulder to capture the sleeve in the retained and locked position. In this position the operator is inaccessible to rotate the bolt and foot .

To control the operation of the motor the controller is provided. is a circuit diagram for an embodiment of the controller . The controller may be integrally provided with the motor to reside within the bolt or may be disposed elsewhere. A harness G is provided to couple the controller and motor to power and data signal sources as described herein. The controller is provided with power by a power connection and alternatively from a USB connector . A switch provides the power through a regulator to the controller microcontroller . Power from the regulator is also provided paid of field effect transistors and motor connectors . A pair of Hall Effect sensors are provided to determine the position of the rotation of the motor shaft and cam to confirm full rotation for release of the tangs and return to the home position. One or more magnets on the reverse side of the cam interacts with the sensors to provide position data to the microcontroller . A serial port coupled to the controller through a transceiver provides a source for command signals from any one of various sources such as the network or a connected portable device. In an embodiment a wireless connection may provide for providing wireless control signals to the microcontroller .

The controller may be in communication with the network through the GMU and or PTM or may be in communication with a wireless network such as Bluetooth or other near field network. Thus unlocking commands may be sent to one or more gaming device electronic locks remotely. Additionally or alternatively the PTM or a separate circuit in the gaming device may locally issue the unlocking command.

To provide for release of the electronic lock for only authorized personnel in one embodiment the electronic lock and system includes a requirement for authentication for operation. Authentication may require an issued attendant employee card to enable commands for unlocking the electronic lock to gain access to the gaming device . For example a casino operator or attendant inserts an identification card into the card reader of the gaming device . Typically the identification card has a magnetic stripe to hold an identifying data specific to the attendant. Alternatively the identification card may be a smart card or electronic button having integrated circuits for storage and processing of user data. Optionally or additionally the system may require additional or alternate authentication of the user. In one example embodiment the casino attendant must enter a password PIN at for example the PTM . The password may be in addition to the use of a card. The read card and entered password if required may be sent through the network to the back end system to verify and authenticate the user e.g. casino attendant . One or more servers and data structures may store authentication data associated with each authorized attendant including their card number and PIN. Additionally in an optional embodiment the authentication process may incorporate biometrics. For example the casino attendant may be required to submit a fingerprint sample or other biometric type sample in addition to using an identification card and or PIN. The PTM would be configured for example to read the biometric feature and for this purpose may include a camera iris or fingerprint scanner The one or more servers and data structures may store records of previously obtained employee biometric data such as fingerprint samples partial fingerprint samples iris scans etc. as described below. At the time an employee such as casino attendant wishes to open a gaming device an additional biometric sample is obtained. The additional obtained sample is then transmitted via the network to the back end for comparison with the originally obtained biometric sample. If the samples match the employee s identity is authenticated and the employee may proceed with commanding the electronic lock to unlock the gaming device . The command may originate from a back end server or a command entered by security personnel at the back end or the operator may invoke the command locally at the gaming device such as by selecting an opening command displayed at the PTM or primary game display .

Each access event is preferably recorded in a log retained in one or more back end servers. Thus when an attendant seeks access and acquire the require authorizations an event would be logged including data of the date time attendant identification and event information. The event information may be acquired through the attendant entering a code e.g. machine fault and re boot or the like.

In a specific example a drop crew must remove and replace the cash boxes from a row of twenty four gaming devices . Each cash box not shown is located within the interior of a gaming device and is secured by its own locking mechanism. Currently these cash box locks are mechanical locks of the type described above in relation to the prior art. However using electronic locks according to the present invention for cash boxes as well would provide an advantage. A supervisor would insert her ID card into a gaming device at the front of the row of a bank of gaming devices . Next the supervisor enters the desired task activity on a user interface. Specifically for this example the supervisor would select or enter drop this row as the desired entry and then would be required to enter her PIN. The entered PIN is evaluated to determine whether is corresponds to the inserted ID card. If the correct PIN was entered a server or local controller would initiate the command to the controller to open the electronic locks for the doors and or cash box electronic locks. For example in one embodiment each of electronic locks for the cash boxes in the row of twenty four gaming devices would simultaneously unlock. Alternately in another embodiment on each gaming device the electronic lock secures an access panel to the cash box. Once the attendant has been authenticated the row drop request the electronic locks access panels to the cash boxes release at specific time intervals. For example the access panel may release at three second intervals one at a time to give the drop crew a consistent flow of removing the cashbox from the open panel and replacing it with an empty one. After replacing each cashbox the casino attendant closes the access panel which would automatically lock the panel securely shut. In this example the drop process is efficiently and timely executed thereby resulting in a consistent drop process. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that any predetermined time interval may be utilized.

In another example representing an optional embodiment a wireless handheld device is utilized. For example referring to the above described embodiment the supervisor uses a handheld device to perform the drop row task. The handheld device includes a user interface for interacting with a supervisor or other use. The supervisor selects the desired row of gaming machines from the handheld device and authorizes the drop. Additionally in an optional embodiment the supervisor may be required to enter a PIN or password before the drop is allowed. Furthermore the handheld device permits the drop to be performed without requiring input from a gaming machine user interface. In this embodiment it may be required that the back end server issue the commands to open the locks as well as record the event in the log. Examples of data that can be collected and reported by the electronic lock associated with a centrally managed system include but are not limited to access grant or revocation by any particular employee and the identity of the person granting or revoking access prevent access to secured devices during non working hours a.k.a. off shift time stamp and identification of device accessed duration of access to devices for work performance metrics.

A variety of authentication methods may be incorporated into the electronic lock. In one embodiment numerical codes passwords or pass phrases may be used for authentication. For example an electronic lock may require entry of the correct code in order to release a lock. A device such as a keypad or other user interface may be provided to allow for entry of the pass code. Optionally a user may enter the pass code on a wireless device such as but not limited to a PDA cellular phone or smart phone.

Alternately security tokens may be used for authentication purposes. More particularly a user may be required to scan or swipe a security token such as a smart card to release a lock. Optionally a security token may interact with a lock via wireless means. For example infra red Bluetooth or radiofrequency data transfer methods can be used to send and receive data thereby permitting access to a lock.

The lock controller may also incorporate fault control and reporting mechanisms such as but not limited to a lock that does not open after being commanded to do so a fault for no lock open after motor rotation detected a fault for no open sense after a certain period of time. In accordance with one or more embodiments the controller may require pull ups or downs on Hall Sensor inputs to ensure no false activation based on a broken harness or non connected harness. The controller may incorporate some method of providing tamper detection for external overdrive of motor lines and sensor outputs forcing unlock activation to ensure harness tampering cannot be done without triggering a fault. Additionally in accordance with one or more embodiments a robust method of ensuring the electronic lock is home on initial start up and that the electronic lock has been installed and aligned to home once is provided. Other embodiments prevent power on interruption from causing a false unlock while still others return the electronic lock back to home if an unlock operation is interrupted via power loss. The controller may store lock states a history of commands controller state power and time stamp history in its memory. Other diagnostics checks may include a motor detect method to ensure the electronic lock is attached to controller the ability to detect winding resistance a timeout error if the lock motor is activated more than a certain number of seconds with no unlock sensed an error for no Hall sense on cam after a certain number of seconds and the like. In accordance with one or more embodiments battery back up of the controller may provide for power fail access.

The controller may provide an external override control method in the event of main power failure within the installed device. Main power fail external override methods secondary external connector that has flush terminals for remote power and secure serial communications to controller such as USB. External Power contacts and serial interface to authenticate lock open command Controller with on board battery for fault power. New MPS430 CPUs can live in standby for over 10 years on a coin cell. Use larger battery for lock operation and non powered access for years. Battery is only active in power off condition. Use RFID NFC antenna on machine to allow override via smart phone or passive secured RFID tag. Separate COM channel to back end system or bank controller Ethernet RS 485 . . . for remote activation of lock. Power over Ethernet POE alternate channel to bank or back end system for power and COMs Power over control lines such as CAN bus simple two wire interface Contactless power pad on side of machine with wireless low speed COM for emergency access. Powers controller and provides encrypted com access to open lock.

The electronic lock being an electronically controlled device may incorporate methods to ensure no unauthorized actuation. In the preferred embodiment the control would be an encrypted command where a key is stored in the controller and a when an unlock command is issued either from within the installed enclosure s control remote system control or the external control connector the command is verified as genuine by the controller prior to activation and unlocking of the device. The encryption key method can be implemented in a number of methods. In this design the controller may also be downloaded with new keys via the back end system or via a port on the controller directly. They may also be loaded via the external power control port however for security purposes this is not a preferred method. The controller s unique chip serial number could also be incorporated into the security scheme thus potentially eliminating non genuine control. It is envisioned that the installed cabinet control of the electronic lock would be via a serial communications port however other methods are also possible such as parallel optical and wireless. It is also envisioned that the external emergency access port would be USB to provide operating power and communications but may be any other comparable method to power and communicate with the controller and actuate the electronic lock . Additional security features may also be incorporated as detection of non commanded lock activation power or sensor drive via an external source between the controller and the electronic lock . Detection of such events may activate silent or active alarm states locally and or to a back end system or security station. The lock mechanism may contain a serial number encryption device or other unique ID mechanism that communicates to the controller or host server to ensure genuine activation commands only open the electronic lock .
