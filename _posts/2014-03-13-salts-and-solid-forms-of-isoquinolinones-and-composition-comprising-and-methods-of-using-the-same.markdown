This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 789 740 filed Mar. 15 2013 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases including numerous forms of cancer inflammatory disorders metabolic disorders vascular and neuronal diseases Gaestel et al. 2007 14 2214 2234 .

Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and or themselves i.e. autophosphorylation . Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues e.g. erb2 PDGF receptor EGF receptor VEGF receptor src abl serine threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and or threonine residues e.g. mTorC1 mTorC2 ATM ATR DNA PK Akt and dual specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine serine and or threonine residues.

Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid derived biologically active organic molecules play a role in many different physiological processes including cell proliferation migration adhesion and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide s kinases e.g. PI3 kinases PI4 Kinases diacylglycerol kinases and sphingosine kinases.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks constitute a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3 OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities expression patterns and modes of regulation. The class I PI3Ks p110 p110 p110 and p110 are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G protein coupled receptors to generate a lipid product termed PIP which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt PDK1 pathway mTOR the Tec family kinases and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI 3 P and PI 3 4 P2.

The PI3K signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis inflammatory bowel diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder psoriasis multiple sclerosis asthma disorders related to diabetic complications and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome.

Many inhibitors of PI3Ks have been generated. While such compounds are often initially evaluated for their activity when dissolved in solution solid state characteristics such as polymorphism play an important role. Polymorphic forms of a drug substance such as an inhibitor of PI3K can have different chemical and physical properties including crystallinity melting point chemical reactivity solubility dissolution rate optical and mechanical properties vapor pressure and density. These properties can have a direct effect on the ability to process or manufacture a drug substance and the drug product. Moreover polymorphism is often a factor under regulatory review of the sameness of drug products from various manufacturers. For example polymorphism has been evaluated in compounds such as warfarin sodium famotidine and ranitidine. Polymorphism can affect the quality safety and or efficacy of a drug product such as a kinase inhibitor. Thus research directed towards polymorphs of PI3K inhibitors and processes for preparing polymorphs of PI3K inhibitors represents a significantly useful field of investigation in the development of active pharmaceutical ingredients APIs .

In addition PI3K inhibitors have been used to treat various diseases and disorders in humans e.g. in clinical trials . For the production of a drug substance intended for use in humans current Good Manufacturing Practices GMP are applicable. Procedures need to be in place that can control the levels of impurities and ensure that API products are produced which consistently meet their predetermined specifications. Thus a significant need exists for a process to prepare PI3K inhibitors suitable for human use particularly on a commercial scale that is inter alia safe scalable efficient economically viable and or having other desirable properties. Among other entities disclosed herein are polymorphic forms of PI3K inhibitors which address these needs and provide exemplary advantages.

As used herein the term pharmaceutically acceptable salt refers to those salts which are within the scope of sound medical judgment suitable for use in contact with the tissues of subjects without undue toxicity irritation allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example Berge et al. describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in 1977 66 1 19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid phosphoric acid sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid oxalic acid maleic acid tartaric acid citric acid succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate alginate ascorbate aspartate benzenesulfonate besylate benzoate bisulfate borate butyrate camphorate camphorsulfonate citrate cyclopentanepropionate digluconate dodecylsulfate ethanesulfonate formate fumarate glucoheptonate glycerophosphate gluconate hemisulfate heptanoate hexanoate hydroiodide 2 hydroxy ethanesulfonate lactobionate lactate laurate lauryl sulfate malate maleate malonate methanesulfonate 2 naphthalenesulfonate nicotinate nitrate oleate oxalate palmitate pamoate pectinate persulfate 3 phenylpropionate phosphate picrate pivalate propionate stearate succinate sulfate tartrate thiocyanate p toluenesulfonate undecanoate valerate salts and the like.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a solvate e.g. a hydrate . As used herein the term solvate refers to compounds that further include a stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amount of solvent bound by non covalent intermolecular forces. The solvate can be of a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Where the solvent is water the solvate is a hydrate . Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes that for example can include 1 to about 100 or 1 to about 10 or one to about 2 3 or 4 solvent or water molecules. In some embodiments the solvate can be a channel solvate.

As used herein and unless otherwise specified prodrug is meant to indicate a compound that can be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus the term prodrug refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug can be inactive when administered to a subject but is converted in vivo to an active compound for example by hydrolysis. In some embodiments the prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism see e.g. Bundgard H. Design of Prodrugs 1985 pp. 7 9 21 24 Elsevier Amsterdam . A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi T. et al. Pro drugs as Novel Delivery Systems A.C.S. Symposium Series Vol. 14 and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design ed. Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987 both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. The term prodrug is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers which release the active Formula I in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound as described herein can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active Formula I in such a way that the modifications are cleaved either in routine manipulation or in vivo to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that when the prodrug of the active Formula I is administered to a mammalian subject cleaves to form a free hydroxy free amino or free mercapto group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include but are not limited to acetate formate and benzoate derivatives of an alcohol or acetamide formamide and benzamide derivatives of an amine functional group in the active compound and the like. Other examples of prodrugs include compounds that comprise NO NO ONO or ONOmoieties. Prodrugs can typically be prepared using well known methods such as those described in 172 178 949 982 Manfred E. Wolff ed. 5th ed. 1995 and H. Bundgaard ed. Elselvier New York 1985 .

For example if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains a carboxylic acid functional group a prodrug can comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable ester formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a group such as C C alkyl C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkanoyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 10 carbon atoms alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms 1 methyl 1 alkoxycarbonyloxy ethyl having from 5 to 8 carbon atoms N alkoxycarbonyl aminomethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms 1 N alkoxycarbonyl amino ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms 3 phthalidyl 4 crotonolactonyl gamma butyrolacton 4 yl di N N C C alkylamino C C alkyl such as dimethylaminoethyl carbamoyl C C alkyl N N di C C alkylcarbamoyl C C alkyl and piperidino pyrrolidino or morpholino C C alkyl.

Similarly if a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the compound contains an alcohol functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the alcohol group with a group such as C C alkanoyloxymethyl 1 C C alkanoyloxy ethyl 1 methyl C C alkanoyloxy ethyl C C alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl N C C alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl succinoyl C C alkanoyl amino C C alkanoyl arylacyl and aminoacyl or aminoacyl aminoacyl where each aminoacyl group is independently selected from the naturally occurring L amino acids P O OH P O O C C alkyl or glycosyl the radical resulting from the removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a carbohydrate .

If a disclosed compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form of the Formula I incorporates an amine functional group a prodrug can be formed by the replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a group such as R carbonyl RO carbonyl NRR carbonyl where R and R are each independently C C alkyl C C cycloalkyl benzyl a natural aminoacyl or natural aminoacyl natural aminoacyl C OH C O OYwherein Yis H C C alkyl or benzyl C OY Ywherein Yis C C alkyl and Yis C C alkyl carboxy C C alkyl amino C C alkyl or mono N or di N N C C alkylaminoalkyl C Y Ywherein Yis H or methyl and Yis mono N or di N N C C alkylamino morpholino piperidin 1 yl or pyrrolidin 1 yl.

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is an isomer. Isomers are different compounds that have the same molecular formula. Stereoisomers are isomers that differ only in the way the atoms are arranged in space. As used herein the term isomer includes any and all geometric isomers and stereoisomers. For example isomers include geometric double bond cis and trans isomers also termed E and Z isomers R and S enantiomers diastereomers d isomers and l isomers racemic mixtures thereof and other mixtures thereof as falling within the scope of this disclosure.

Substituents around a carbon carbon double bond alternatively can be referred to as cis or trans where cis represents substituents on the same side of the double bond and trans represents substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. The arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring can also be designated as cis or trans. The term cis represents substituents on the same side of the plane of the ring and the term trans represents substituents on opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the ring are designated cis trans. 

 Enantiomers are a pair of stereoisomers that are non superimposable mirror images of each other. A mixture of a pair of enantiomers in any proportion can be known as a racemic mixture. The term is used to designate a racemic mixture where appropriate. Diastereoisomers are stereoisomers that have at least two asymmetric atoms but which are not mirror images of each other. The absolute stereochemistry is specified according to the Cahn Ingold Prelog R S system. When a Formula I is an enantiomer the stereochemistry at each chirogenic carbon can be specified by either R or S. Resolved compounds whose absolute configuration is unknown can be designated or depending on the direction dextro or levorotatory which they rotate plane polarized light at the wavelength of the sodium D line. Certain of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus give rise to enantiomers diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms that can be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry at each asymmetric atom as R or S . The present chemical entities pharmaceutical compositions and methods are meant to include all such possible isomers including racemic mixtures optically substantially pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active R and S isomers can be prepared for example using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques.

As used herein and unless otherwise specified the term stereomerically pure means a composition or substance that comprises one stereoisomer of a compound and is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. For example a stereomerically pure composition of a compound having one chiral center will be substantially free of the opposite enantiomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure composition of a compound having two chiral centers will be substantially free of other stereoisomers e.g. diastereoisomers or enantiomers or syn or anti isomers or cis or trans isomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80 percent by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20 percent by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound greater than about 90 percent by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10 percent by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound greater than about 95 percent by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5 percent by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound or greater than about 97 percent by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3 percent by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound.

As used herein and unless otherwise specified the term enantiomerically pure means a stereomerically pure composition of a compound having one or more chiral center s .

As used herein and unless otherwise specified the terms enantiomeric excess and diastereomeric excess are used interchangeably herein. In some embodiments compounds with a single stereocenter can be referred to as being present in enantiomeric excess and those with at least two stereocenters can be referred to as being present in diastereomeric excess. For example the term enantiomeric excess is well known in the art and is defined as 

Thus the term enantiomeric excess is related to the term optical purity in that both are measures of the same phenomenon. The value of ee will be a number from 0 to 100 zero being racemic and 100 being enantiomerically pure. A compound which in the past might have been called 98 optically pure is now more precisely characterized by 96 ee. A 90 ee reflects the presence of 95 of one enantiomer and 5 of the other s in the material in question.

Some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50 75 90 95 or 99 of the S enantiomer. In other words the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the S enantiomer over the R enantiomer. In other embodiments some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50 75 90 95 or 99 of the R enantiomer. In other words the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the R enantiomer over the S enantiomer.

For instance an isomer enantiomer can in some embodiments be provided substantially free of the corresponding enantiomer and can also be referred to as optically enriched enantiomerically enriched enantiomerically pure and non racemic as used interchangeably herein. These terms refer to compositions in which the percent by weight of one enantiomer is greater than the amount of that one enantiomer in a control mixture of the racemic composition e.g. greater than about 1 1 by weight . For example an enantiomerically enriched preparation of the S enantiomer means a preparation of the compound having greater than about 50 by weight of the S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer such as at least about 75 by weight further such as at least about 80 by weight. In some embodiments the enrichment can be much greater than about 80 by weight providing a substantially enantiomerically enriched substantially enantiomerically pure or a substantially non racemic preparation which refers to preparations of compositions which have at least about 85 by weight of one enantiomer relative to other enantiomer such as at least about 90 by weight and further such as at least 95 by weight. In certain embodiments the compound provided herein is made up of at least about 90 by weight of one enantiomer. In other embodiments the Formula I is made up of at least about 95 98 or 99 by weight of one enantiomer.

Enantiomers can be isolated from racemic mixtures by any method known to those skilled in the art including chiral high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC the formation and crystallization of chiral salts or prepared by asymmetric syntheses. See for example Jacques Ed. Wiley Interscience New York 1981 Wilen et al. 33 2725 1977 E. L. Eliel Ed. McGraw Hill NY 1962 and p. 268 E. L. Eliel Ed. Univ. of Notre Dame Press Notre Dame Ind. 1972 .

In certain embodiments the pharmaceutically acceptable form is a tautomer. As used herein the term tautomer is a type of isomer that includes two or more interconvertable compounds resulting from at least one formal migration of a hydrogen atom and at least one change in valency e.g. a single bond to a double bond a triple bond to a single bond or vice versa . Tautomerization includes prototropic or proton shift tautomerization which is considered a subset of acid base chemistry. Prototropic tautomerization or proton shift tautomerization involves the migration of a proton accompanied by changes in bond order. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors including temperature solvent and pH. Where tautomerization is possible e.g. in solution a chemical equilibrium of tautomers can be reached. Tautomerizations i.e. the reaction providing a tautomeric pair can be catalyzed by acid or base or can occur without the action or presence of an external agent. Exemplary tautomerizations include but are not limited to keto to enol amide to imide lactam to lactim enamine to imine and enamine to a different enamine tautomerizations. An example of keto enol tautomerization is the interconversion of pentane 2 4 dione and 4 hydroxypent 3 en 2 one tautomers. Another example of tautomerization is phenol keto tautomerization. Another example of phenol keto tautomerization is the interconversion of pyridin 4 ol and pyridin 4 1H one tautomers.

As used herein and unless otherwise specified structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms.

Certain isotopically labeled disclosed compounds e.g. those labeled with H and C are useful in compound and or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C isotopes can allow for ease of preparation and detectability. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability e.g. increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements . Isotopically labeled disclosed compounds can generally be prepared by substituting an isotopically labeled reagent for a non isotopically labeled reagent. In some embodiments provided herein are compounds that can also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. All isotopic variations of compounds of the present disclosure whether radioactive or not are encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure.

Like different crystal forms different polymorphs may have different physical properties such as for example melting temperatures heats of fusion solubilities dissolution rates and or vibrational spectra as a result of the arrangement or conformation of the molecules and or ions in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties may affect pharmaceutical parameters such as storage stability compressibility and density important in formulation and product manufacturing and dissolution rate an important factor in bioavailability . Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity e.g. differential oxidation such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph or mechanical changes e.g. tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to a thermodynamically more stable polymorph or both e.g. tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity . As a result of solubility dissolution differences in the extreme case some solid state transitions may result in lack of potency or at the other extreme toxicity. In addition the physical properties may be important in processing for example one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities and particle shape and size distribution might be different between polymorphs .

Potential pharmaceutical solids include crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Amorphous solids are characterized by a lack of long range structural order whereas crystalline solids are characterized by structural periodicity. The desired class of pharmaceutical solid depends upon the specific application amorphous solids are sometimes selected on the basis of e.g. an enhanced dissolution profile while crystalline solids may be desirable for properties such as e.g. physical or chemical stability see e.g. S. R. Vippagunta et al. . 2001 48 3 26 L. Yu . 2001 48 27 42 . A change in solid form may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties which may provide benefits or drawbacks in processing formulation stability and bioavailability among other important pharmaceutical characteristics.

Whether crystalline or amorphous potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may include single component and multiple component solids. Single component solids consist essentially of the pharmaceutical compound in the absence of other compounds. Variety among single component crystalline materials may potentially arise from the phenomenon of polymorphism wherein multiple three dimensional arrangements exist for a particular pharmaceutical compound see e.g. S. R. Byrn et al. 1999 SSCI West Lafayette .

Additional diversity among the potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may arise from the possibility of multiple component solids. Crystalline solids comprising two or more ionic species are termed salts see e.g. P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth Eds. 2002 Wiley Weinheim . Additional types of multiple component solids that may potentially offer other property improvements for a pharmaceutical compound or salt thereof include e.g. hydrates solvates co crystals and clathrates among others see e.g. S. R. Byrn et al. 1999 SSCI West Lafayette . Moreover multiple component crystal forms may potentially be susceptible to polymorphism wherein a given multiple component composition may exist in more than one three dimensional crystalline arrangement. The discovery of solid forms is of great importance in the development of a safe effective stable and marketable pharmaceutical compound.

In some embodiments provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing a compound as provided herein and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments provided herein are pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration containing i an effective amount of a disclosed compound optionally ii an effective amount of one or more second agents and iii one or more pharmaceutical excipients suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition further contains iv an effective amount of a third agent.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition can be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms such as capsules cachets or tablets or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non aqueous liquid an oil in water emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more ingredients. In general the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then if necessary shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules optionally mixed with an excipient such as but not limited to a binder a lubricant an inert diluent and or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.

The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water can be added e.g. about 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the pharmaceutical compositions for an oral dosage form any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers such as for example water glycols oils alcohols flavoring agents preservatives coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions solutions and elixirs or aerosols or carriers such as starches sugars micro crystalline cellulose diluents granulating agents lubricants binders and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example suitable carriers include powders capsules and tablets with the solid oral preparations. In some embodiments tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.

Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to corn starch potato starch or other starches gelatin natural and synthetic gums such as acacia sodium alginate alginic acid other alginates powdered tragacanth guar gum cellulose and its derivatives e.g. ethyl cellulose cellulose acetate carboxymethyl cellulose calcium sodium carboxymethyl cellulose polyvinyl pyrrolidone methyl cellulose pre gelatinized starch hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose microcrystalline cellulose and mixtures thereof.

Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms provided herein include but are not limited to talc calcium carbonate e.g. granules or powder microcrystalline cellulose powdered cellulose dextrates kaolin mannitol silicic acid sorbitol starch pre gelatinized starch and mixtures thereof.

Disintegrants can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant can produce tablets which can disintegrate in the bottle. Too little can be insufficient for disintegration to occur and can thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient s from the dosage form. Thus a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient s can be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds provided herein. The amount of disintegrant used can vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration and can be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant can be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to agar agar alginic acid calcium carbonate microcrystalline cellulose croscarmellose sodium crospovidone polacrilin potassium sodium starch glycolate potato or tapioca starch other starches pre gelatinized starch other starches clays other algins other celluloses gums or mixtures thereof.

Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to calcium stearate magnesium stearate mineral oil light mineral oil glycerin sorbitol mannitol polyethylene glycol other glycols stearic acid sodium lauryl sulfate talc hydrogenated vegetable oil e.g. peanut oil cottonseed oil sunflower oil sesame oil olive oil corn oil and soybean oil zinc stearate ethyl oleate ethylaureate agar or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include for example a syloid silica gel a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition.

When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active ingredient therein can be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matter or dyes and for example emulsifying and or suspending agents together with such diluents as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin and various combinations thereof.

The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent for example calcium carbonate calcium phosphate or kaolin or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium for example peanut oil liquid paraffin or olive oil.

Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include but are not limited to hydrophilic surfactants lipophilic surfactants and mixtures thereof. That is a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants can be employed a mixture of lipophilic surfactants can be employed or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant can be employed.

A suitable hydrophilic surfactant can generally have an HLB value of at least about 10 while suitable lipophilic surfactants can generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic lipophilic balance HLB value . Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic and have greater solubility in oils while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10 as well as anionic cationic or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly lipophilic i.e. hydrophobic surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions.

Hydrophilic surfactants can be either ionic or non ionic.

Such dosage forms can be used to provide slow or controlled release of one or more active agents using for example hydropropylmethyl cellulose other polymer matrices gels permeable membranes osmotic systems multilayer coatings microparticles liposomes microspheres or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art including those described herein can be readily selected for use with the active agents provided herein. Thus the pharmaceutical compositions provided encompass single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as but not limited to tablets capsules gelcaps and caplets that are adapted for controlled release.

All controlled release pharmaceutical products have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non controlled counterparts. In some embodiments the use of a controlled release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the disease disorder or condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled release formulations include extended activity of the drug reduced dosage frequency and increased subject compliance. In addition controlled release formulations can be used to affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics such as blood levels of the drug and can thus affect the occurrence of side e.g. adverse effects.

In some embodiments controlled release formulations are designed to initially release an amount of a compound as provided herein that promptly produces the desired therapeutic effect and gradually and continually release other amounts of the compound to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of the compound in the body the compound should be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of drug being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled release of an active agent can be stimulated by various conditions including but not limited to pH temperature enzymes water or other physiological conditions or compounds.

In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in a subject at an appropriate site determined by a practitioner of skill i.e. thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson 115 138 vol. 2 1984 . Other controlled release systems are discussed in the review by Langer 249 1527 1533 1990 . The one or more active agents can be dispersed in a solid inner matrix e.g. polymethylmethacrylate polybutylmethacrylate plasticized or unplasticized polyvinylchloride plasticized nylon plasticized polyethyleneterephthalate natural rubber polyisoprene polyisobutylene polybutadiene polyethylene ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethylsiloxanes silicone carbonate copolymers hydrophilic polymers such as hydrogels of esters of acrylic and methacrylic acid collagen cross linked polyvinylalcohol and cross linked partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate that is surrounded by an outer polymeric membrane e.g. polyethylene polypropylene ethylene propylene copolymers ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymers ethylene vinylacetate copolymers silicone rubbers polydimethyl siloxanes neoprene rubber chlorinated polyethylene polyvinylchloride vinylchloride copolymers with vinyl acetate vinylidene chloride ethylene and propylene ionomer polyethylene terephthalate butyl rubber epichlorohydrin rubbers ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer ethylene vinyl acetate vinyl alcohol terpolymer and ethylene vinyloxyethanol copolymer that is insoluble in body fluids. The one or more active agents then diffuse through the outer polymeric membrane in a release rate controlling step. The percentage of active agent in such parenteral compositions is highly dependent on the specific nature thereof as well as the needs of the subject.

Since the compounds described herein can be administered in combination with other treatments such as additional chemotherapeutics radiation or surgery the doses of each agent or therapy can be lower than the corresponding dose for single agent therapy. The dose for single agent therapy can range from for example about 0.0001 to about 200 mg or about 0.001 to about 100 mg or about 0.01 to about 100 mg or about 0.1 to about 100 mg or about 1 to about 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.

When a compound provided herein is administered in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises one or more agents and the agent has a shorter half life than the compound provided herein unit dose forms of the agent and the compound provided herein can be adjusted accordingly.

In some embodiments provided herein are kits. The kits can include a compound or pharmaceutical composition as described herein in suitable packaging and written material that can include instructions for use discussion of clinical studies listing of side effects and the like. Such kits can also include information such as scientific literature references package insert materials clinical trial results and or summaries of these and the like which indicate or establish the activities and or advantages of the pharmaceutical composition and or which describe dosing administration side effects drug interactions or other information useful to the health care provider. Such information can be based on the results of various studies for example studies using experimental animals involving in vivo models and studies based on human clinical trials.

In some embodiments a memory aid is provided with the kit e.g. in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card e.g. as follows First Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. . . . Second Week Monday Tuesday . . . etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A daily dose can be a single tablet or capsule or several tablets or capsules to be taken on a given day.

The kit can further contain another agent. In some embodiments the compound as provided herein and the agent are provided as separate pharmaceutical compositions in separate containers within the kit. In some embodiments the compound as provided herein and the agent are provided as a single pharmaceutical composition within a container in the kit. Suitable packaging and additional articles for use e.g. measuring cup for liquid preparations foil wrapping to minimize exposure to air and the like are known in the art and can be included in the kit. In other embodiments kits can further comprise devices that are used to administer the active agents. Examples of such devices include but are not limited to syringes drip bags patches and inhalers. Kits described herein can be provided marketed and or promoted to health providers including physicians nurses pharmacists formulary officials and the like. Kits can also in some embodiments be marketed directly to the consumer.

An example of such a kit is a so called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms tablets capsules and the like . Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. The strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.

Kits can further comprise pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles that can be used to administer one or more active agents. For example if an active agent is provided in a solid form that must be reconstituted for parenteral administration the kit can comprise a sealed container of a suitable vehicle in which the active agent can be dissolved to form a particulate free sterile solution that is suitable for parenteral administration. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include but are not limited to Water for Injection USP aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to Sodium Chloride Injection Ringer s Injection Dextrose Injection Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection and Lactated Ringer s Injection water miscible vehicles such as but not limited to ethyl alcohol polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol and non aqueous vehicles such as but not limited to corn oil cottonseed oil peanut oil sesame oil ethyl oleate isopropyl myristate and benzyl benzoate.

The present disclosure further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example water can be added e.g. about 5 in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. For example pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and or humidity during manufacturing packaging and or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition can be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions can be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include but are not limited to hermetically sealed foils plastic or the like unit dose containers blister packs and strip packs.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI3Ks are members of a conserved family of lipid kinases that regulate numerous cell functions including proliferation differentiation cell survival and metabolism. Several classes of PI3Ks exist in mammalian cells including Class IA subgroup e.g. PI3K which are generally activated by receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs Class IB e.g. PI3K which is activated by G protein coupled receptors GPCRs among others. PI3Ks exert their biological activities via a PI3K mediated signaling pathway that includes several components that directly and or indirectly transduce a signal triggered by a PI3K including the generation of second messenger phophotidylinositol 3 4 5 triphosphate PIP3 at the plasma membrane activation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling and generation of further second messengers such as cAMP DAG and IP3 all of which leads to an extensive cascade of protein kinase activation reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck B. et al. 2001 70 535 602 . For example PI3K is activated by cellular receptors through interaction between the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 SH2 domains or through direct interaction with RAS. PIP3 produced by PI3K activates effector pathways downstream through interaction with plextrin homology PH domain containing enzymes e.g. PDK 1 and AKT PKB . Fung Leung W P. 2011 23 4 603 8 . Unlike PI3K PI3K is not associated with a regulatory subunit of the p85 family but rather with a regulatory subunit in the p101 family. PI3K is associated with GPCRs and is responsible for the very rapid induction of PIP3. PI3K can be also activated by RAS.

In some embodiments provided herein are methods of modulating a PI3K kinase activity e.g. selectively modulating by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable form e.g. pharmaceutically acceptable salts hydrates solvates isomers prodrugs and isotopically labeled derivatives thereof or pharmaceutical compositions as provided herein. Modulation can be inhibition e.g. reduction or activation e.g. enhancement of kinase activity. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity by contacting the kinase with an effective amount of a compound as provided herein in solution. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting the kinase activity by contacting a cell tissue organ that express the kinase of interest with a compound provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting kinase activity in a subject by administering into the subject an effective amount of a compound as provided herein. In some embodiments the kinase activity is inhibited e.g. reduced by more than about 25 30 40 50 60 70 80 or 90 when contacted with a compound provided herein as compared to the kinase activity without such contact. In some embodiments provided herein are methods of inhibiting PI3 kinase activity in a subject including mammals such as humans by contacting said subject with an amount of a compound as provided herein sufficient to inhibit or reduce the activity of the PI3 kinase in said subject.

In some embodiments the kinase is a lipid kinase or a protein kinase. In some embodiments the kinase is selected from a PI3 kinase including different isoforms such as PI3 kinase PI3 kinase PI3 kinase PI3 kinase DNA PK mTor Abl VEGFR Ephrin receptor B4 EphB4 TEK receptor tyrosine kinase TIE2 FMS related tyrosine kinase 3 FLT 3 Platelet derived growth factor receptor PDGFR RET ATM ATR hSmg 1 Hck Src Epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR KIT Inulsin Receptor IR and IGFR.

As used herein a PI3K mediated disorder refers to a disease or condition involving aberrant PI3K mediated signaling pathway. In one embodiment provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K mediated disorder in a subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein is a method of treating a PI3K or PI3K mediated disorder in a subject the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition as provided herein. In some embodiments provided herein is a method for inhibiting at least one of PI3K and PI3K the method comprising contacting a cell expressing PI3K in vitro or in vivo with an effective amount of the compound or composition provided herein. PI3Ks have been associated with a wide range of conditions including immunity cancer and thrombosis reviewed in Vanhaesebroeck B. et al. 2010 DOI 10.1007 82 2010 65 . For example Class I PI3Ks particularly PI3K and PI3K isoforms are highly expressed in leukocytes and have been associated with adaptive and innate immunity thus these PI3Ks are believed to be important mediators in inflammatory disorders and hematologic malignancies reviewed in Harris S J et al. 2009 10 11 1151 62 Rommel C. et al. 2007 7 3 191 201 Durand C A et al. 2009 183 9 5673 84 Dil N Marshall A J. 2009 46 10 1970 8 Al Alwan M M et al. 2007 178 4 2328 35 Zhang T T et al. 2008 2008 122 4 811 819.e2 Srinivasan L et al. 2009 139 3 573 86 .

Numerous publications support roles of PI3K PI3K and PI3K in the differentiation maintenance and activation of immune and malignant cells as described in more detail below.

The importance of PI3K in the development and function of B cells is supported from inhibitor studies and genetic models. PI3K is an important mediator of B cell receptor BCR signaling and is upstream of AKT calcium flux PLC MAP kinase P70S6k and FOXO3a activation. PI3K is also important in IL4R S1P and CXCR5 signaling and has been shown to modulate responses to toll like receptors 4 and 9 Inhibitors of PI3K have shown the importance of PI3K in B cell development Marginal zone and B1 cells B cell activation chemotaxis migration and homing to lymphoid tissue and in the control of immunoglobulin class switching leading to the production of IgE. Clayton E et al. 2002 196 6 753 63 Bilancio A et al. 2006 107 2 642 50 Okkenhaug K. et al. 2002 297 5583 1031 4 Al Alwan M M et al. 2007 178 4 2328 35 Zhang T T et al. 2008 2008 122 4 811 819.e2 Srinivasan L et al. 2009 139 3 573 86 

In T cells PI3K has been demonstrated to have a role in T cell receptor and cytokine signaling and is upstream of AKT PLC and GSK3b. In PI3K deletion or kinase dead knock in mice or in inhibitor studies T cell defects including proliferation activation and differentiation have been observed leading to reduced T helper cell 2 TH2 response memory T cell specific defects DTH reduction defects in antigen dependent cellular trafficking and defects in chemotaxis migration to chemokines e.g. S1P CCR7 CD62L . Gar on F. et al. 2008 111 3 1464 71 Okkenhaug K et al. 2006 . 177 8 5122 8 Soond D R et al. 2010 115 11 2203 13 Reif K 2004 . 2004 173 4 2236 40 Ji H. et al. 2007 110 8 2940 7 Webb L M et al. 2005 175 5 2783 7 Liu D et al. 2010 184 6 3098 105 Haylock Jacobs S et al. 2011 2011 36 3 4 278 87 Jarmin S J et al. 2008 118 3 1154 64 .

In neutrophils PI3K along with PI3K and PI3K contribute to the responses to immune complexes FC RII signaling including migration and neutrophil respiratory burst. Human neutrophils undergo rapid induction of PIP3 in response to formyl peptide receptor FMLP or complement component C5a C5a in a PI3K dependent manner followed by a longer PIP3 production period that is PI3K dependent and is essential for respiratory burst. The response to immune complexes is contributed by PI3K PI3K and PI3K and is an important mediator of tissue damage in models of autoimmune disease Randis T M et al. 2008 38 5 1215 24 Pinho V 2007 179 11 7891 8 Sadhu C. et al. 2003 170 5 2647 54 Condliffe A M et al. 2005 106 4 1432 40 . It has been reported that in certain autoimmune diseases perfrential activation of PI3K may be involved. Kulkarni et al. 2011 4 168 ra23 1 11 . It was also reported that PI3K deficient mice were highly protected in an Fc R dependent model of autoantibody induced skin blistering and partially protected in an Fc R dependent model of inflammatory arthritis whereas combined deficiency of PI3K and PI3K resulted in near complete protection in inflammatory arthritis. Id. .

In macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD glucocorticoid responsiveness can be restored by treatment of the cells with inhibitors of PI3K . Macrophages also rely on PI3K and PI3K for responses to immune complexes through the arthus reaction FCgR and C5a signaling Randis T M et al. 2008 38 5 1215 24 Marwick J A et al. 2009 179 7 542 8 Konrad S et al. 2008 283 48 33296 303 .

In mast cells stem cell factor SCF and IL3 dependent proliferation differentiation and function are PI3K dependent as is chemotaxis. The allergen IgE crosslinking of FCgR1 resulting in cytokine release and degranulation of the mast cells is severely inhibited by treatment with PI3K inhibitors suggesting a role for PI3K in allergic disease Ali K et al. 2004 431 7011 1007 11 Lee K S et al. 2006 20 3 455 65 Kim M S et al. 2008 29 10 493 501 .

Natural killer NK cells are dependent on both PI3K and PI3K for efficient migration towards chemokines including CXCL10 CCL3 S1P and CXCL12 or in response to LPS in the peritoneum Guo H et al. 2008 205 10 2419 35 Tassi I et al. 2007 27 2 214 27 Saudemont A 2009 106 14 5795 800 Kim N et al. 2007 110 9 3202 8 .

The roles of PI3K PI3K and PI3K in the differentiation maintenance and activation of immune cells support a role for these enzymes in inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis to allergic inflammatory disorders such as asthma and inflammatory respiratory disease such as COPD. Extensive evidence is available in experimental animal models or can be evaluated using art recognized animal models. In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating inflammatory disorders ranging from autoimmune diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis multiple sclerosis to allergic inflammatory disorders such as asthma and COPD using a compound described herein.

For example inhibitors of PI3K and or have been shown to have anti inflammatory activity in several autoimmune animal models for rheumatoid arthritis Williams O. et al. 2010 Chem Biol 17 2 123 34 WO 2009 088986 WO2009 088880 WO 2011 008302 . PI3K is expressed in the RA synovial tissue especially in the synovial lining which contains fibroblast like synoviocytes FLS and selective PI3K inhibitors have been shown to be effective in inhibiting synoviocyte growth and survival Bartok et al. 2010 62 Suppl 10 362 . Several PI3K and inhibitors have been shown to ameliorate arthritic symptoms e.g. swelling of joints reduction of serum induced collagen levels reduction of joint pathology and or inflammation in art recognized models for RA such as collagen induced arthritis and adjuvant induced arthritis WO 2009 088986 WO2009 088880 WO 2011 008302 .

The role of PI3K has also been shown in models of T cell dependent response including the DTH model. In the murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis EAE model of multiple sclerosis the PI3K double mutant mice are resistant. PI3K inhibitors have also been shown to block EAE disease induction and development of TH 17 cells both in vitro and in vivo Haylock Jacobs S. et al. 2011 36 3 4 278 87 .

Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is a complex disease that at different stages requires memory T cells B cell polyclonal expansion and differentiation into plasma cells and the innate immune response to endogenous damage associated molecular pattern molecules DAMPS and the inflammatory responses to immune complexes through the complement system as well as the Freceptors. The role of PI3K and PI3K together in these pathways and cell types suggest that blockade with an inhibitor would be effective in these diseases. A role for PI3K in lupus is also predicted by two genetic models of lupus. The deletion of phosphatase and tensin homolog PTEN leads to a lupus like phenotype as does a transgenic activation of Class 1A PI3Ks which includes PI3K . The deletion of PI3K in the transgenically activated class 1A lupus model is protective and treatment with a PI3K selective inhibitor in the murine MLR lpr model of lupus improves symptoms Barber D F et al. 2006 176 1 589 93 .

In allergic disease PI3K has been shown by genetic models and by inhibitor treatment to be essential for mast cell activation in a passive cutaneous anaphalaxis assay Ali K et al. 2008 180 4 2538 44 Ali K 2004 431 7011 1007 11 . In a pulmonary measure of response to immune complexes Arthus reaction a PI3K knockout is resistant showing a defect in macrophage activation and C5a production. Knockout studies and studies with inhibitors for both PI3K and PI3K support a role for both of these enzymes in the ovalbumin induced allergic airway inflammation and hyper responsiveness model Lee K S et al. 2006 20 3 455 65 . Reductions of infiltration of eosinophils neutrophils and lymphocytes as well as TH2 cytokines IL4 IL5 and IL13 were seen with both PI3K specific and dual PI3K and PI3K inhibitors in the Ova induced asthma model Lee K S et al. 2006 118 2 403 9 .

PI3K and PI3K inhibition can be used in treating COPD. In the smoked mouse model of COPD the PI3K knockout does not develop smoke induced glucocorticoid resistance while wild type and PI3K knockout mice do. An inhaled formulation of dual PI3K and PI3K inhibitor blocked inflammation in a LPS or smoke COPD models as measured by neutrophilia and glucocorticoid resistance Doukas J et al. 2009 328 3 758 65 .

Class I PI3Ks particularly PI3K and PI3K isoforms are also associated with cancers reviewed e.g. in Vogt P K et al. 2010 Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 347 79 104 Fresno Vara J A et al. 2004 30 2 193 204 Zhao L and Vogt P K. 2008 Oncogene 27 41 5486 96 . Inhibitors of PI3K e.g. PI3K and or have been shown to have anti cancer activity e.g. Courtney K D et al. 2010 28 6 1075 1083 Markman B et al. 2010 Ann Oncol. 21 4 683 91 Kong D and Yamori T 2009 Curr Med.

In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating cancer.

Types of cancer that can be treated with an inhibitor of PI3K particularly PI3K and or include e.g. leukemia chronic lymphocytic leukemia acute myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia e.g. Salmena L et al. 2008 133 403 414 Chapuis N et al. 2010 16 22 5424 35 Khwaja A 2010 347 169 88 lymphoma e.g. non Hodgkin s lymphoma e.g. Salmena L et al. 2008 133 403 414 lung cancer e.g. non small cell lung cancer small cell lung cancer e.g. Herrera V A et al. 2011 31 3 849 54 melanoma e.g. Haluska F et al. 2007 34 6 546 54 prostate cancer e.g. Sarker D et al. 2009 15 15 4799 805 glioblastoma e.g. Chen J S et al. 2008 Mol Cancer Ther. 7 841 850 endometrial cancer e.g. Bansal N et al. 2009 Cancer Control. 16 1 8 13 pancreatic cancer e.g. Furukawa T 2008 43 12 905 11 renal cell carcinoma e.g. Porta C and Figlin R A 2009 182 6 2569 77 colorectal cancer e.g. Saif M W and Chu E 2010 16 3 196 201 breast cancer e.g. Torbett N E et al. 2008 415 97 100 thyroid cancer e.g. Brzezianska E and Pastuszak Lewandoska D 2011 16 422 39 and ovarian cancer e.g. Mazzoletti M and Broggini M 2010 17 36 4433 47 .

Numerous publications support a role of PI3K and PI3K in treating hematological cancers. PI3K and PI3K are highly expressed in the heme compartment and some solid tumors including prostate breast and glioblastomas Chen J. S. et al. 2008 7 4 841 50 Ikeda H. et al. 2010 116 9 1460 8 .

In hematological cancers including acute myeloid leukemia AML multiple myeloma MM and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL overexpression and constitutive activation of PI3K supports the model that PI3K inhibition would be therapeutic Billottet C et al. 2006 25 50 6648 59 Billottet C et al. 2009 69 3 1027 36 Meadows S A 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Ikeda H et al. 2010 116 9 1460 8 Herman S E et al. 2010 116 12 2078 88 Herman S E et al. 2011 . 117 16 4323 7. In an embodiment described herein is a method of treating hematological cancers including but not limited to acute myeloid leukemia AML multiple myeloma MM and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL .

A PI3K inhibitor CAL 101 has been evaluated in a phase 1 trial in patients with haematological malignancies and showed activity in CLL in patients with poor prognostic characteristics. In CLL inhibition of PI3K not only affects tumor cells directly but it also affects the ability of the tumor cells to interact with their microenvironment. This microenvironment includes contact with and factors from stromal cells T cells nurse like cells as well as other tumor cells. CAL 101 suppresses the expression of stromal and T cell derived factors including CCL3 CCL4 and CXCL13 as well as the CLL tumor cells ability to respond to these factors. CAL 101 treatment in CLL patients induces rapid lymph node reduction and redistribution of lymphocytes into the circulation and affects tonic survival signals through the BCR leading to reduced cell viability and an increase in apoptosis. Single agent CAL 101 treatment was also active in mantle cell lymphoma and refractory non Hodgkin s lymphoma Furman R R et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Hoellenriegel J et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Webb H K et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Meadows et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Kahl B et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Lannutti B J et al. 2011 117 2 591 4 .

PI3K inhibitors have shown activity against PI3K positive gliomas in vitro Kashishian A et al. Poster presented at The American Association of Cancer Research 102Annual Meeting 2011 Apr. 2 6 Orlando Fla. . PI3K is the PI3K isoform that is most commonly activated in tumors where the PTEN tumor suppressor is mutated Ward S et al. 2003 10 3 207 13 . In this subset of tumors treatment with the PI3K inhibitor either alone or in combination with a cytotoxic agent can be effective.

Another mechanism for PI3K inhibitors to have an affect in solid tumors involves the tumor cells interaction with their micro environment. PI3K PI3K and PI3K are expressed in the immune cells that infiltrate tumors including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes macrophages and neutrophils. PI3K inhibitors can modify the function of these tumor associated immune cells and how they respond to signals from the stroma the tumor and each other and in this way affect tumor cells and metastasis Hoellenriegel J et al. 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. .

PI3K is also expressed in endothelial cells. It has been shown that tumors in mice treated with PI3K selective inhibitors are killed more readily by radiation therapy. In this same study capillary network formation is impaired by the PI3K inhibitor and it is postulated that this defect contributes to the greater killing with radiation. PI3K inhibitors can affect the way in which tumors interact with their microenvironment including stromal cells immune cells and endothelial cells and be therapeutic either on its own or in conjunction with another therapy Meadows S A et al. Paper presented at 52Annual ASH Meeting and Exposition 2010 Dec. 4 7 Orlando Fla. Geng L et al. 2004 64 14 4893 9 .

In other embodiments inhibition of PI3K such as PI3K and or can be used to treat a neuropsychiatric disorder e.g. an autoimmune brain disorder. Infectious and immune factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders including but not limited to Sydenham s chorea SC Garvey M. A. et al. 2005 20 424 429 Tourette s syndrome TS obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Asbahr F. R. et al. 1998 155 1122 1124 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder AD HD Hirschtritt M. E. et al. 2008 1 1 16 Peterson B. S. et al. 2000 57 364 372 anorexia nervosa Sokol M. S. 2000 10 133 145 Sokol M. S. et al. 2002 159 1430 1432 depression Leslie D. L. et al. 2008 47 1166 1172 and autism spectrum disorders ASD Hollander E. et al. 1999 156 317 320 Margutti P. et al. 2006 3 149 157 . A subset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorders and tic disorders has been grouped as Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci PANDAS . PANDAS disorders provide an example of disorders where the onset and exacerbation of neuropsychiatric symptoms is preceded by a streptococcal infection Kurlan R. Kaplan E. L. 2004 113 883 886 Garvey M. A. et al. 1998 13 413 423 . Many of the PANDAS disorders share a common mechanism of action resulting from antibody responses against streptococcal associated epitopes such as GlcNAc which produces neurological effects Kirvan. C. A. et al. 2006 179 173 179 . Autoantibodies recognizing central nervous system CNS epitopes are also found in sera of most PANDAS subjects Yaddanapudi K. et al. 2010 15 712 726 . Thus several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with immune and autoimmune components making them suitable for therapies that include PI3K and or inhibition.

In certain embodiments a method of treating e.g. reducing or ameliorating one or more symptoms of a neuropsychiatric disorder e.g. an autoimmune brain disorder using a PI3K and or inhibitor is described alone or in combination therapy. For example one or more PI3K and or inhibitors described herein can be used alone or in combination with any suitable therapeutic agent and or modalities e.g. dietary supplement for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Exemplary neuropsychiatric disorders that can be treated with the PI3K and or inhibitors described herein include but are not limited to PANDAS disorders Sydenham s chorea Tourette s syndrome obsessive compulsive disorder attention deficit hyperactivity disorder anorexia nervosa depression and autism spectrum disorders.

Typically limited scleroderma involves cutaneous manifestations that mainly affect the hands arms and face. Limited and diffuse subtypes are distinguished based on the extent of skin involvement with sparing of the proximal limbs and trunk in limited disease. See e.g. Denton C. P. et al. 2006 2 3 134 143. The limited subtype also typically involves a long previous history of Raynaud s phenomenon whereas in the diffuse subtype onset of Raynaud s phenomenon can be simultaneous with other manifestations or might occur later. Both limited and diffuse subtypes may involve internal organs. Typical visceral manifestations of limited systemic sclerosis include isolated pulmonary hypertension severe bowel involvement and pulmonary fibrosis. Typical visceral manifestations of diffuse systemic sclerosis include renal crisis lung fibrosis and cardiac disease. Diffuse systemic sclerosis typically progresses rapidly and affects a large area of the skin and one or more internal organs e.g. kidneys esophagus heart or lungs . Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma is a rare disorder in which patients develop vascular and fibrotic damage to internal organs in the absence of cutaneous sclerosis.

An appropriate size reaction vessel was equipped with mechanical stirrer reflux condenser and temperature probe. Crude Compound 1 from step 2 in Example 7 was charged to the reaction vessel. Acetic acid 4.5 vol. was added. The internal temperature was adjusted to 25 5 C. target temperature 23 26 C. and the mixture was stirred for a minimum of 15 minutes. Water 4.5 vol. was added. The temperature was increased to 32 5 C. target temperature 29 33 C. and the reaction mixture was stirred for a minimum of 15 minutes. Type 5 carbon 3M 40 wt was charged and the mixture was stirred for a minimum of 30 minutes. The slurry was filtered on a 0.45 m filter. The cake was washed with a 1 1 mixture of acetic acid water 4.4 vol. .

28 NHOH 7.4 7.5 vol. was charged to an appropriate size vessel equipped with mechanical stirrer reflux condenser and temperature probe. The acidic filtrate above was charged to the vessel with stirring at a rate to maintain the temperature 25 C. Water 4.5 vol. was added the pH should be neutral .

In one exemplary study the suspension resulted from above was filtered and dried to provide a solid product of free base Compound 1. XRPD showed the solid product was Form 1 of the free base of Compound 1.

In another exemplary study the suspension resulted from above was heated to 90 5 C. for 10 15 hrs cooled to 20 5 C. over a minimum of 1 hr. The mixture was stirred at 20 5 C. for a minimum of 1 hr. The solid product was filtered washed with water 2 4 vol. and dried at 40 C. to constant weight to provide the hydrate of free base of Compound 1 as a white solid yield 75 90 . XRPD showed the solid product was the more stable Form 2 of the free base of Compound 1.

Approximately 35 mg 0.057 mmol portions of mono maleic acid salt Form 1 of Compound 1 were weighed into 2 ml screw topped HPLC vials. One of 21 solvents was added to each vial in a number of aliquots up to 30 volumes with shaking. All the samples were then placed under maturation between RT to 50 C. 4 hours at each temperature for 3 days. After maturation the samples were analysed by XRPD. Clear solutions were cooled to 20 C. freezer . If no precipitation occurred samples were evaporated at RT.

The results are summarized in Table 6. Mono maleic acid salt Form 1 was obtained from 8 out of 15 single solvent systems and 2 out of 6 solvent mixtures. The samples didn t recrystallize in MEK Acetone Water 90 10 v v or methanol. The free base recrystallized in Ethanol 2 Propanol 1 Propanol Acetone THF 2 Propanol Water 90 10 v v EtOH Water 90 10 v v Acetic acid Water 25 75 v v . The mono maleic acid salt has a tendency to dissociate in these solvents.

The amorphous mono maleic acid salt of Compound 1 was prepared by evaporation at RT of a methanolic solution saturated with mono maleic acid salt Form 1. H NMR data not shown demonstrated that the amorphous mono maleic acid salt contains about 0.9 eq. of maleic acid salt and about 0.6 eq. of MeOH.

Aliquots of the selected solvents 10 vol. were added to the amorphous mono maleic acid salt in 2 ml HPLC vials at RT. Samples were placed under maturation between RT 50 C. 4 hours cycle for 3 days. After maturation the samples were analyzed by XRPD. Clear solutions were then cooled to 20 C. freezer . If no precipitation occurred samples were evaporated at RT.

The results are summarized in Table 7. Mono maleic acid salt Form 1 was obtained from 11 single solvent systems. The samples didn t recrystallize in anisole methanol 50 50 v v chloroform 1 4 dioxane or 1 1 1 trifluoroethanol.

Approximately 30 mg 0.06 mmol of free base Form 1 of Compound 1 or free base Form 2 of Compound 1 was weighed separately into 2 ml HPLC vial and diluted in the selected solvents. The solutions were heated to 50 C. An appropriate volume of stock acid solution prepared in water and prepared without water was added to each vial under magnetic stirring. The vials were then sealed and cooled to 5 C. within 8 hours to enhance the crystallization of the salts. The clear solutions were cooled to 20 C. freezer and then evaporated at RT. Samples of the solids obtained during the sequence of manipulations were filtered and analysed by XRPD.

The results of the first salt formation series are summarized in Table 8. Free base of Compound 1 was crystallized in 13 out 20 experiments. Mono maleic acid salt Form 1 was crystallized in 4 out of 20 experiments with 2 Butanone MEK or ethyl acetate as the solvent. The sample didn t recrystallize in 3 out of 20 experiments.

A second salt formation experiment series was made using various ratios of maleic acid stock solution to assess the process robustness. The results are summarised in Table 9. With 0.5 eq. of maleic acid the free base crystallized with 1.3 eq. and 1.5 eq. of maleic acid maleic acid salt Form 1 was crystallized with an excess of maleic acid in the crystalline solid and with 2.0 eq. of maleic acid a low crystallinity maleic acid salt Form 1 was crystallized. In anisole with 1.0 eq. of maleic acid added as a 1M stock solution in THF maleic acid salt Form 1 was crystallized.

Bis Sulfuric acid salt Form 1 of Compound 1 ca. 35 mg was weighed into vials. The corresponding solvents and solvent mixtures were added in portions of a total of 5 10 20 and 30 volumes at 50 C. with shaking aiming for clear solutions. After each addition the vials were allowed to shake for 20 minutes after which observations were made. Solutions were allowed to evaporate whereas slurries were set for 8 hour temperature cycling maturation between RT and 50 C. for 5 days.

The results are summarized in Table 10. The material showed clear solutions in 5 volumes of acetic acid water 1 3 and methanol at 50 C. Slow evaporation of these solutions yielded oils which were subjected to maturation producing the bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 in the case of the methanol experiment. The experiment in ethanol water 90 10 v v initially showed a slurry in 30 volumes but a clear solution was observed after maturation for three days. Evaporation produced an oil which crystallized to the bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 after maturation. All other experiments showed slurries in 30 volumes of solvent and maturation for five days did not show any changes.

Bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 ca. 100 mg was weighed in a round bottom flask and dissolved in methanol 2.5 mL . Rotary evaporation was carried out at 45 mbar in a 50 C. water bath. After 20 minutes an oil was observed on the flask walls which became a solid after scratching with a spatula. The amorphous character was confirmed by XRPD and H NMR confirmed the structure as well as the presence of residual methanol 0.3 equivalents .

Further amorphous material was prepared in vials to be used as input material for a maturation screen. Bis Sulfuric acid salt Form 1 ca. 250 mg was dissolved in 1.25 mL methanol and pipetted into HPLC vials. The temperature was set at 80 C. to aid solvent evaporation which yielded oils after 20 minutes. The oils were placed in a vacuum oven at 40 C. in order to remove residual solvent.

Basic characterisation of these oils highlighted that the oils were wet broad water peak by NMR and weight loss of 7 below 100 C. . The DSC was typical of an amorphous material and no crystallization was observed below degradation.

The oils obtained by solvent evaporation were used for the maturation screen. Anhydrous solvents 5 volumes 100 L were used in order to minimise the amount of water present. Any solutions were allowed to slowly evaporate whereas slurries were set for 8 hour temperature cycling maturation between RT and 50 C. After 24 hours most oils had not mixed with the solvents and these were scratched with a spatula producing slurries. These were matured for a further 24 hours before performing XRPD analysis.

The results are summarized in Table 11. The bis sulfuric acid salt is difficult to crystallise in an anhydrous environment. The experiment in methanol produced a clear solution which then became an oil after solvent evaporation. The experiment in acetonitrile produced a slurry for which maturation yielded a poorly crystalline solid with an XRPD pattern slightly different to the bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 . The remaining experiments had to be mixed manually with a spatula and maturation of the slurries for 24 hours did not induce crystallisation. Basic characterisation of the slurry in acetonitrile experiment showed a poorly crystalline solid whose crystallinity decreased on standing at room conditions for 24 hours. H NMR showed residual solvent 0.3 equivalents of methanol and 0.2 equivalents of acetonitrile . The DSC trace showed an irregular baseline with a small endothermic event at 191 C.

Free Base Form 1 and Form 2 of Compound 1 25 mg was weighed into vials and dissolved or suspended in the selected solvents 20 volumes 500 L at 50 C. Sulfuric acid 2.2 equivalents 112 L solution in THF 50 L solution in water or 50 L solution in ethanol was added at 50 C. A cooling ramp to 20 C. was set up at 0.1 C. minute. All solids observed were isolated and analysed by XRPD. Solutions were set for slow evaporation.

The results are summarized in Table 12. Experiments in anisole methanol and MEK started as solutions of the free base at 50 C. whereas experiments in ethanol and ethyl acetate started as slurries. After the addition of the acid most experiments remained unchanged although some solutions showed immediate precipitation. Most isolated solids were amorphous by XRPD. A low crystalline solid was crystallised from the system anisole methanol THF showing an XRPD pattern slightly different to that of the bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 . Basic characterisation suggested that this material could be an unstable solvate and . Three experiments yielded the bis sulfuric acid salt Form 1 ethanol THF from evaporation and MEK THF from maturation of gums .

The results of the characterization of Form 1 of the free base of Compound 1 are summarized in Table 13. Free base Form 1 was analysed to be a hydrate 0.6 equivalents water by KF . Thermal analysis showed dehydration to Form 4 anhydrous from around 75 C. followed by a melt onset at 161 C. . GVS suggested that Form 1 material hydrates to a higher hydrate above 80 RH but this re converts to Form 1 on desorption. One week storage at 25 C. 93 RH showed conversion to Form 3 whereas storage at 40 C. 75 RH over the same period of time did not show any changes.

The results of the characterization of Form 2 of the free base of Compound 1 are summarized in Table 14. Free base Form 2 was analysed to be a highly crystalline hydrate 0.8 equivalents water by KF . Thermal analysis showed a very slight change in the XRPD pattern on heating above 75 C. followed by a melt onset at 172 C. . GVS showed slight moisture uptake on loading 1 w w between 40 50 RH remaining stable with 5.7 w w moisture content between 90 10 on desorption. Slight evidence of hysteresis re uptake is slower between 0 10 RH and very slight changes in the XRPD after the experiment. One week storage at 25 C. 93 RH and 40 C. 75 RH also showed mainly the same pattern with a few differences. The fact that the XRPD patterns hardly change with moisture content varying between 0 and 6 w w water 0 to 2 equivalents suggests that this material is a channel hydrate where water can easily move in and out of the crystal lattice.

In one exemplary study to 5 g of crude Compound 1 from step 2 in Example 7 was added 400 mL of t BuOH water 95 5 . The mixture was heated up with heat gun until a solution was obtained then 100 mL of water was added. After 30 min at RT the solution was still homogeneous and brownish. The solution was freeze dried lyophilization for 9 days to provide 4.7 g of Compound 1 as a solid material. Picture under microscope of the solid material showed that it was amorphous. NMR showed that the material contained about molar of t BuOH. The solid material was put into vacuum over at 40 C. for 4 days and NMR showed that it contained about 20 molar ratio of t BuOH.

The results of the characterization of the amorphous free base of Compound 1 are summarized in Table 15. The amorphous free base of Compound 1 was analysed to be amorphous with high chemical purity and some residual tert butanol content. Thermal analysis showed some solvent loss but no evidence of crystallisation before decomposition. No crystallisation after storage at elevated humidity.

Amorphous free base Compound 1 ca. 25 mg was weighed into vials. The selected solvents and solvent mixtures 5 to 20 volumes were added with stirring. Any solutions were allowed to slowly evaporate whereas slurries were set for 8 hour temperature cycling maturation between RT and 50 C. for 2 days.

The results are summarized in Table 16. Most vials showed an off white solid in a brown solution after solvent addition. These suspensions were set for temperature cycling and most of them converted to thick slurries after 24 hours. These were allowed to cycle for a further 24 hours prior to analysis. Most of these solids showed a very similar XRPD pattern and were denoted as Form 5 . Slight differences were observed suggesting that these are isostructural solvates where differences in the solvent result in slight differences by XRPD. The only experiment that gave a different XRPD was the experiment in water which showed Form 4. Finally maturation in isopropyl acetate resulted in material with similar XRPD to Form 5.

Crystalline Hydrate Form 2 of Compound 1 showed changes in solubility in the whole range of solvent systems investigated. The best solvent systems clear solutions were methanol anisole 1 1 and DMSO 10 volumes at RT dioxane 10 volumes 50 C. chloroform 20 volumes RT . Experiments in 2 methyltetrahydrofuran THF 5 water and ethanol anisole showed clear solutions using 50 volumes and methanol DCM THF DME DCM methanol 1 1 and acetonitrile 5 water using 100 volumes.

The results are summarized in Table 17. Solutions were placed at 4 C. where eight experiments showed crystallisation. Crystals were ground in order to analyse them by XRPD. Suspensions were set for temperature cycling for a total of five days after which time XRPD analysis was carried out. Most solids obtained from both procedures showed Form 5. Similar to the screen in Example 20 these XRPD patterns show slight differences . However solids from both screens obtained from the same solvent show a matching XRPD pattern also supporting that this is a series of isostructural solvates.

The solid obtained from ethanol water 1 1 showed the unchanged Form 2. Solutions from 2 methyltetrahydrofuran and dioxane yielded oils which crystallised to Form 5 or a mixture of Forms 5 and 3 respectively after temperature cycling for two days same program .

Maturation of the hydrate Form 1 of free base Compound 1 and the amorphous material in acetic acid water 1 1 for three days yielded an XRPD pattern denoted as Form 6. However maturation of the hydrate Form 2 of free base Compound 1 did not show any changes in form. The results are summarized in Table 18.

Samples from the screen using amorphous free base Compound 1 were analysed by H NMR and DSC and re analysis by XRPD was also carried out after drying at 50 C. vacuum and storage at 40 C. 75 RH the same sample was dried and stored at elevated humidity .

The results are summarized in Table 19. H NMR revealed different amounts of residual organic solvent in most solids with the exception of that from methanol. DSC analysis varied significantly between different solids. Generally a melting endotherm was observed onsets between 159 and 178 C. and some traces show solvent loss broad endotherms. VT XRPD on selected samples did not show any form changes below the melt. TGA on selected samples showed a weight loss on the melt area which suggests that these solvates only release the solvents on melting which is consistent with the lack of form change by XRPD. Drying at 50 C. under vacuum did not show any changes by XRPD and neither did storage at 40 C. 75 RH suggesting that water could have replaced the organic solvent. H NMR of selected samples after storage showed that these had lost their organic solvent to some extent.

Hydrate Form 1 of free base Compound 1 90 mg was heated in an oven to 125 C. for two hours. The resulting solid was analysed to be the anhydrous Form 4 consistent with the dehydration of Form 1 by VT XRPD. Basic characterisation was carried out and it is summarized in Table 20. Form 4 was analysed to be anhydrous and resulted from dehydration of the Hydrate Form 1. This material adsorbs some moisture as shown in thermal analysis and KF. GVS suggests this material hydrates above 80 RH but reversibly dehydrates back at 40 RH.

Batch 1 of Form 6 of free base of Compound 1 was obtained from maturation of Form 1 of free base of Compound 1 in acetic acid water as described in Example 22. Batch 2 of Form 6 was obtained in a similar manner. Form 1 22 mg of free base of Compound 1 was suspended in acetic acid water 1 1 100 L 5 volumes and set for temperature cycling maturation between room temperature and 50 C. 4 hours at each temperature for a total of 16 hours. Very small amount of solid was present so the liquors were evaporated.

Basic characterisation was carried out and it is summarised in Table 21. Form 6 was analysed to be an acetic acid solvate containing 0.5 equivalents of acetic acid. Desolvation to the anhydrous Form 4 occurred at around 100 C. by VT XRPD and at 0 RH on the GVS. TGA and DSC showed complex thermal behaviour above those temperatures. Storage at elevated humidity conditions showed conversion to Hydrate Form 3. The fact that both Solvate Form 6 and Hydrate Form 3 show very similar diffractograms suggests that they could be another set of isostructural solvates hydrate.

Hydrate Form 2 of free base of Compound 1 50 mg was suspended in pure water or a mixture acetic acid water 1 3 10 volumes and set to mature at constant temperature 25 C. or 90 C. for a total of 40 hours. Aliquots of the suspensions were filtered and analysed by XRPD and the results are summarized in Table 22. Both solids obtained from maturation at 25 C. from water and the aqueous acetic acid mixture showed the unchanged Form 2. At 90 C. the solid from pure water also showed Form 2 but the solid from acetic acid water showed some evidence of the acetic acid solvate Form 6 mixed with a majority of Form 2. Thermal analysis of Form 2 shows dehydration above 80 C. and the presence of acetic acid could favour the solvate when the water content is not too high.

A sample of Form 5 of free base of Compound 1 acetonitrile solvate was submitted for single crystal X ray diffraction studies. The results are shown in Table 23. The structure solution was obtained by direct methods full matrix least squares refinement on Fwith weighting w F 0.0453P 0.0000P where P F 2F 3 anisotropic displacement parameters empirical absorption correction using spherical harmonics implemented in SCALE3 ABSPACK scaling algorithm.

The software used for data collection was GADDS for XP 2000 4.1.43 and the data were analyzed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA v13.0.0.2 or v15.0.0.0. Samples run under ambient conditions were prepared as flat plate specimens using powder as received without grinding. Approximately 1 2 mg of the sample was lightly pressed on a glass slide to obtain a flat surface. Samples run under non ambient conditions were mounted on a silicon wafer with heat conducting compound. The sample was then heated to the appropriate temperature at 10 C. min and subsequently held isothermally for 1 minute before data collection was initiated.

X Ray Powder Diffraction patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu K radiation 40 kV 40 mA 2 goniometer and divergence of V4 and receiving slits a Ge monochromator and a Lynxeye detector. The software used for data collection was Diffrac Plus XRD Commander v2.6.1 and the data were analysed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA v13.0.0.2 or v15.0.0.0.

Off line analysis was carried out using Topspin v1.3 or ACD SpecManager v12.5.

DSC data were collected on a Mettler DSC 823E equipped with a 34 position auto sampler. The instrument was calibrated for energy and temperature using certified indium. Typically 0.5 1.5 mg of each sample in a pin holed aluminium pan was heated at 10 C. min from 25 C. to 300 C. A nitrogen purge at 50 ml min was maintained over the sample. The instrument control and data analysis software was STARe v9.20.

TGA data were collected on a Mettler TGA SDTA 851e equipped with a 34 position auto sampler. The instrument was temperature calibrated using certified indium.

Samples were studied on a Leica LM DM polarised light microscope with a digital video camera for image capture. A small amount of each sample was placed on a glass slide mounted in immersion oil and covered with a glass slip the individual particles being separated as well as possible. The sample was viewed with appropriate magnification and partially polarised light coupled to a false colour filter.

The water content of each sample was measured on a Metrohm 874 Oven Sample Processor at 150 C. or 180 C. with 851 Titrano Coulometer using Hydranal Coulomat AG oven reagent and nitrogen purge. Weighed solid samples were introduced into a sealed sample vial. Approx 10 mg of sample was used per titration and duplicate determinations were made.

Sorption isotherms were obtained using a Hiden IGASorp moisture sorption analyser controlled by CFRSorp software. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 C. by a Huber re circulating water bath. The humidity was controlled by mixing streams of dry and wet nitrogen with a total flow rate of 250 ml min. The relative humidity RH was measured by a calibrated Vaisala RH probe dynamic range of 0 95 RH located near the sample. The weight change mass relaxation of the sample as a function of RH was constantly monitored by the microbalance accuracy 0.001 mg . Typically 10 20 mg of sample was placed in a tared mesh stainless steel basket under ambient conditions. The sample was loaded and unloaded at 40 RH and 25 C. typical room conditions . A moisture sorption isotherm was performed as outlined below 2 scans giving 1 complete cycle . The standard isotherm was performed at 25 C. at 10 RH intervals over a 0 90 RH range.

The software uses a least squares minimisation procedure together with a model of the mass relaxation to predict an asymptotic value. The measured mass relaxation value must be within 5 of that predicted by the software before the next RH value is selected. The minimum equilibration time was set to 1 hour and the maximum to 4 hours. The sample was recovered after completion of the isotherm and re analysed by XRPD.
