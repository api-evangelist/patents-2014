The contents of all of the above mentioned references are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Some embodiments of the present invention relate to control of human physiology and more particularly but not exclusively to devices and methods of controlling human physiology such as kidney or cardiovascular function by stimulation of the urinary system.

The kidneys are organs that have numerous biological roles. Their primary role is to maintain the homeostatic balance of bodily fluids by filtering and secreting metabolites and minerals from the blood and excreting them along with water as urine. The ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the adult the ureters are usually 25 30 cm 10 12 inches long.

The upper urinary system receives autonomic mostly sympathetic innervation by the efferent nervous system. The sensory information is conveyed to the central nervous system CNS via the afferent nervous systems. The two systems have different regional distribution the efferent sympathetic innervation reaches all the segments of the renal vasculature and to a much lesser extent the tubular nephron. The afferent sensory fibers are localized and predominate in the renal pelvis and ureter. The corticomedullary connective tissue contains both types of innervation with a more prominent afferent innervation.

Congestive heart failure CHF is a very common disorder affecting 6 million Americans and more than 22 million worldwide. CHF is a disease of the old it is the leading hospital discharge diagnosis in individuals aged 65 years or older. CHF is the number one reason for hospitalization in people 65 years or older in the United States accounting for approximately 1 million hospitalizations annually. The cost of hospitalizations for CHF is twice that for all forms of cancer and myocardial infarction combined. Treatment of heart failure costs an estimated 40 billion per year in the United States and nearly 80 billion worldwide.

Renal impairment is an independent and significant predictor of morbidity and mortality in CHF patients. Mortality increases incrementally across the range of renal function with 7 increased risk for every 10 mL min decrease in glomerular filtration rate GFR . CHF triggers kidney dysfunction by a pathological process dubbed the cardio renal syndrome. The cardio renal syndrome can be acute characterized by a rapid decrease in cardiac output together with worsening renal function or chronic in which gradual worsening of heart and or kidney function develops over months.

The cardio renal syndrome is a common condition in the US more than 500 000 patients are admitted to hospital every year with acute heart failure and up 80 of these patients suffer from deteriorating renal functions. High renal sympathetic activity constitutes an important link between CHF and renal dysfunction. Signals of shock and hypoperfusion present in CHF patients activate a number of compensation systems to increase the blood pressure and prevent fluid losses. Of these the renal sympathetic system is one of the most important ones it effectively reduces renal blood flow and kidney functions including sodium and water excretion to urine. In addition it activates the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and therefore leads to hypertension fluid retention and kidney dysfunction. It is now known that increased renal sympathetic drive is an independent factor in terms of progressive deterioration of renal function and adverse outcome in CHF patients as was shown by Petersson et al. 2005 .

As of now CHF is a progressive incurable disease. Surgical treatment options are few and are reserved for end stage patients.

In patients with CHF and volume overload initial therapy focuses on salt and water restriction and diuretics. Diuretics improve symptoms and quality of life but do not necessarily prolong life. When patients experience persistent pulmonary congestion despite adequate diuretic treatment they are defined as diuretic resistant. It is unadvised to increase the dose of the diuretic as the potential negative side effects outweigh the possible benefit of fluid removal. One of the most serious side effects of diuretic administration is activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone axis and the sympathetic nervous system that leads to vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ACEI and beta blockers are prescribed to most patients for control of hypertension and to reduce cardiac remodeling. Although ACEI and adrenergic blockers are extensively used in these patients these agents work on a systemic level. As such they cannot be used in an adequate dosage to selectively inhibit the pathological sympathetic renal drive.

Hypertension is one of the most common worldwide diseases afflicting humans. In the US forty three million people are estimated to have hypertension the age adjusted prevalence of hypertension varying from 18 32 . Because of the associated morbidity and mortality and the cost to society hypertension is an important public health challenge hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease which is the leading cause of death in North America stroke the third leading cause congestive heart failure end stage renal disease and peripheral vascular disease.

Abnormal renal excretory function is one of the most important mechanisms of the initiation and progression of hypertension. Variations of arterial pressure signals the kidney to alter urinary sodium and water excretion. On the long term maintenance of sodium and water balance by the kidneys is believed to be primary in the long term control of arterial pressure. Thus factors that decrease renal excretory function lead to an increase in arterial pressure which is required to reestablish and maintain sodium and water balance.

The dramatic positive effect of renal denervation on the development of hypertension is evident in a wide variety of animal models in multiple species suggesting that increased renal nerve activity may be a final common pathway for the defect in renal sodium excretory ability required for the development and maintenance of hypertension.

Chronic kidney disease CKD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality particularly at the later stages. More than 400 000 patients US are on dialysis per year at an annual cost up to 67 000 for each patient. The 5 year survival rate for a patient undergoing chronic dialysis in the United States is approximately 35 . The most common cause of death in the dialysis population is cardiovascular disease.

A large body of evidence indicates the presence of functional abnormalities of the sympathetic nervous system in uremic animals and humans. In patients with bilateral nephrectomy the rate of sympathetic discharge was lower than in patients with their native kidneys and this increased rate was accompanied by lower mean arterial pressure and regional vascular resistance.

Sympathetic activation contributes to progressive kidney damage by elevation of blood pressure and by promoting atherosclerosis. Increased sympathetic activity progressive atherosclerosis and elevated blood pressure contribute to the development of cardiac remodeling and functional alterations. These conditions are highly prevalent in patients with CKD.

Current treatment aims for CKD are to halt the progression of the renal damage by controlling the underlying condition that triggers the damage i.e. hypertension and diabetes. Prescription of ACEI in such patients should take into account the potential influence of renal impairment on ACEI metabolism and adverse effects on the renal function itself especially hypotension and acute reductions in glomerular filtration rate which if untreated can escalate to acute renal failure .

Drugs that act on the sympathetic overactivity such as alpha and beta adrenergic blockers are second or third line of treatment. These agents have significant side effects alpha blockers were recently shown to increase the risk for stroke in patients with essential hypertension. Beta blockers are associated with intradyalitic hypotension.

As GFR decreases diuretics are increasingly required for excretion of the daily water load. However for a number of reasons diuretics become relatively ineffective in patients with a moderate to severe degree of chronic kidney disease creatinine clearance below approximately 35 ml min 1 . Diuretics can lead to further rise in the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentrations and a high incidence of hypokalemia and electrolyte disorders. Furthermore net losses of sodium and fluid during regular diuretic administration are limited by postdiuretic renal sodium and fluid retention. Because of these complications diuretic use in the final stages of chronic kidney disease although desirable theoretically to maintain body water balance is impractical because of the severe side effects

Causes of acute renal failure ARF can be broadly divided into three clinical categories a Prerenal which is an adaptive response to severe volume depletion b renal or intrinsic in response to kidney insult including contrast material and c postrenal.

Prerenal ARF is the most common cause of ARF. It often leads to intrinsic ARF if it is not promptly corrected. Acute reduction of renal blood flow RBF either because of blood loss or hypotension can result in this syndrome. The hallmark of intrinsic ARF and the most common form is acute tubular injury ATN . Prerenal ARF and ATN occur on a continuum of the same pathophysiological process and together account for 75 of the cases of ARF.

It cannot be overstated that the current treatment of ARF is mainly supportive in nature and no therapeutic modalities to date have shown efficacy in treating the condition. Indications of immediate dialysis treatment include hyperkalemia not responsive to conventional treatment pulmonary edema and uremia.

Mortality rate estimates in ARF patients vary from 25 90 . The in hospital mortality rate is 40 50 in intensive care settings the rate is 70 80 . The mortality in patients requiring dialysis is about 50 . Mortality rates have changed little over the last two decades reflecting the fact that there is no adequate treatment for this condition.

The present invention in some embodiments thereof relates to a method of controlling body functions using stimulation of the urinary system.

A broad aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to controlling body functions by stimulating the urinary system. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the body functions are kidney functions such as glomerular filtration rate GFR urine flow rate urine composition urine density and renal hormone secretion. Optionally or alternatively the body functions are cardiovascular functions such as blood pressure portal pressure pulmonary pressure organ including renal blood flow cardiac output heart rate intravascular and extravascular fluid volume pulmonary and body edema levels. Optionally or alternatively the functions are bodywide systems such as blood chemistry or sympathetic nerve activity. In some embodiments body functions are affected by modifying kidney function. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention kidney function is modified by controlling a renal reflex for example the reno renal reflex or the vesico vascular reflex. Optionally kidney function is modified by changing a peristalsis e.g. by overpacing with sensing of self pacing or at an enforced frequency of one or both ureters possibly such stimulation modulating a reno renal reflex mediated by the ureter and or by affecting urine pressure in the kidney. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the parts of the urinary system stimulated are parts which are adapted to carry urine such as the kidney pelvis the ureter and or the bladder. Optionally the stimulated part comprises afferent nerves which are affected by the stimulation. Optionally stimulation in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention is used optionally with other treatment such as medication or stimulation of other parts of the body affect for example to control to compensate force manage modulate and or stand in for natural body feedback cycles damaged and or healthy such cycles. Optionally the stimulation and or control of body physiology are used as a long term treatment optionally with a goal of treating preventing degradation and or maintaining a patient.

Various embodiments of the invention are based on the inventors surprising discovery that stimulation of the urinary system can affect kidney function and or other bodywide functions rather than merely affecting local function such as peristalsis or bladder voiding. In particular the inventors have discovered that stimulating the bladder bladder trigone the ureters as well as other parts of the urinary system affect kidney and or other body functions including functions not directly related to urinary such as cardiovascular functions for example blood pressure. It is believed but this need not limit the scope of the invention that such stimulation latches onto existing feedback cycles in the body possibly by affect the source of feedback signals e.g. the afferent nerves or by causing activity of the stimulated portions which then modulates existing reflex feedback cycles.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation is electrical. However in other embodiments of the invention other simulation methods may be used instead or in addition for example chemical stimulation thermal stimulation and or mechanical stimulation. In particular ureter receptors may be stimulated by providing sodium ions therein.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention an implanted device is used for stimulating the urinary system. Alternatively or additionally the device includes a trans urethraly or transcutanesouly inserted stimulator which may optionally extend out of the urethra to an external stimulator controller and or power source. Optionally the device includes a stimulator inside the bladder inside the kidney and or inside the ureter. Optionally the device operates by expanding the ureter.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention an intra ureteral stimulator is made thin and or soft enough so it allows urine flow past it and or does not interfere with valves of the urinary tract. Optionally such a stimulator is equipped with an anchoring mechanism such as for example such a stimulator ends in a curved element for example a pig tail at one or both sides or alternatively in a widening form for example radially extending arms or a conical coil which lodges in the urinary system for example in the kidney pelvis and or bladder and or is optionally used to stimulate said system at said widening.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention an intra ureteral stimulator comprises a tubular element e.g. a stent like hollow tube optionally formed of a mesh which engages the walls of the ureter. In another example the stimulator includes one or more rings which lodge in the ureter optionally connected by a wire or cable.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention an intra ureteral device operates by mechanical or thermal stimulation of the ureter for example by an expanding element. Optionally this expansion simulates the effect on the sensory nerves in a manner similar to a ureteral blockage and or chemical irritation and or directly stimulates sensory nerve endings.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention a stimulator is mounted on a double pigtail ureteral catheter.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention the stimulator is mounted on an outside of a ureter. Optionally such a stimulator is designed to not interfere with ureteral peristalsis and or ureteral repositioning for example the mounting on the ureter being flexible optionally axially. Such flexibilities are optionally provided for intra ureteral catheters as well. Optionally the stimulator provides stimulation specifically to the desired location without stimulating other targets for example by isolation of the stimulator from other organs.

In an alternative embodiment of the invention a stimulator is inserted transcutaneously directly into the kidney. Optionally the stimulator is inserted transcutaneously. In an alternative embodiment of the invention a stimulator is mounted on a nephrostomy catheter.

Optionally the stimulator includes a distal expanding portion for example a single wire which folds into a spatial shape to help anchor in the kidney bladder and or kidney pelvis. Such a design may also be used for a stimulator which lies in the ureter.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a stimulating device can apply multiple therapies for example applying in addition to modification of kidney or body function or alternatively thereto one or more of bladder stimulation to assist prevent modify and or otherwise modulate voiding nerve stimulation and or sphincter function and or is used for treating one or more of stress incontinence neurogenic bladder atonic bladder cystocele and or urinary tract infection e.g. by better drainage of urine . Additionally for example as described below stimulation can include multiple stimulations in the urinary system such as ureters and in addition nerve s and or blood vessel s and or stimulation of other body systems such as the heart or baro receptors in the carotid arteries or vagus nerves or nervous plexuses. Optionally renal stimulation is used to counteract a negative systemic effect which would affect the kidneys and caused by vagal or other nerve stimulation. For example reduced blood pressure may reduce renal blood flow to a damaging level. Stimulation in accordance with some embodiments of the invention can increase renal flow while not be strong enough to negate the systemic treatment. Optionally renal stimulation is used to modulate such a systemic e.g. vagal nerve stimulation medication treatment.

An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to treating modifying or maintaining body functions using a urinary system stimulator device or system . While in some embodiments of the invention a device may apply an open loop treatment whereby a therapy is set for a desired effect in an exemplary embodiment of the invention the device includes an input optionally from internal or external sensor or more than one sensor which generates an indication of body function or input from other devices such as a pacemaker or urine analysis system and or input form a user such as a subjective feeling. Optionally or alternatively the stimulation device is used to command and or control such systems and or interoperate for example preventing interference of function and or of sensing allowing a feedback loop to be closed. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the sensor includes a sensor of kidney function and urinary parameters such as one or more of urine chemistry urine volume and urine flow. Optionally or alternatively the sensor includes a physiological sensor for kidney function for example GFR urine flow urine composition secretion of hormones from the kidney in blood and or urine creatinine levels inulin levels. Optionally or alternatively the sensor includes a sensor of urinary systems function for example urinary parameters peristalsis and or pressure. Optionally or alternatively the sensor includes a physiological sensor for non urinary systems for example blood chemistry blood pressure heart rate breathing rate lung fluid volume and or ECG. Optionally or alternatively the sensor includes an input for user entry of a command or of a physiological parameter. Optionally or alternatively to a physiological sensor an environmental sensor is used for example an acceleration sensor may indicate movement and thus suggest blood pressure changes or body posture e.g. supine possibly indicating a rest period when cardiac demand is lower and a temperature sensor may indicate environmental temperature and thus suggest sweating rate .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation applied by the device is set so as not to cause pain or even not to cause a perceptual feeling. Typically subjective feeling of electrical stimulation depends on the waveform the frequency and the amplitude of stimulation as well as on the stimulated area above and beyond a sensed functional effect for example due to nearby tissue muscle contractions and or pain receptors in that tissue. In the bladder sine waves are generally less tolerated than square waves possibly due to the larger current flowing in the sine waveform. In general higher frequencies are less irritating bladder stimulation is not felt up to 2 mA stimulation with a 2000 Hz sine wave 1 mA with 250 Hz and 0.5 mA with 5 Hz suggesting that bladder sensation is mediated by C fibers that are sensitive to low frequency stimulation. The urethra is about 4 10 times more sensitive to electrical stimulation. The trigone appears to not generate sensations up to 16 v with 2500 Hz square wave stimulation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulation is maintained below these values. In some cases even pain or sensation causing stimulations may be used depending on the importance of stimulation. Optionally larger electrodes are used to reduce the current density and possibly pain which relates to current density.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation has a continuing effect even after it is stopped for example an effect lasting at least 3 minutes 20 minutes 1 hour 2 hours or intermediate times. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention longer periods are used for having a useful lasting physiological effect. Shorter periods are optionally used for feedback and or to determine stimulation parameters. Optionally the stimulation is not repeated for such time periods while the effect lasts.

In some experiments it was observed that the duration of an after effect appeared dependent on the duration of stimulation. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation sequence used assumes a factor of for example 1.5 2 3 5 10 or intermediate or greater factors between stimulation time and expected useful effect duration. Optionally the link for a particular patient is determined for example during calibration and used as part of a plan for and or selection of for stimulation sequences therefore.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation includes positively affecting or controlling two kidneys optionally controlling one kidney in opposite to an effect expected by control of the other kidney.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the device is used for treating one or more of acute or chronic high blood pressure acute or chronic heart failure myocardial infarct acute or chronic renal failure nephrotic syndrome hepatorenal syndrome cardiorenal syndrome and other disease states. Optionally the sensing is used to indicate when a particular therapy is working and can be stopped or slowed down and or when a specific therapy is not working and should be changed.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the following treatment protocols are used for particular disease states. For shock patients e.g. including septic shock it is noted that these patients suffer from reduced blood pressure and can be treated by vasoconstrictors in order to increase systemic vascular resistance and increase blood pressure but it often results in renal failure due to reduced renal perfusion. Optionally increase of the reno renal reflex is used to protect the kidneys during the treatment. For detoxication for example of substances that are excreted by the kidneys increased kidney perfusion can be used to eliminate the toxins more quickly. For acute renal failure there are anecdotal reports showing that increasing renal function during acute tubular necrosis phase of renal failure can improve the clinical condition. Optionally a treatment starts as early as possible lasting up to a few days following the initial damage. Optionally renal blood flow is increased using a reno renal reflex or other stimulation while renal function is reduced for example by adrenaline. For chronic renal failure in general these patients benefit from diuretics if not for their harming effects on the GFR. A chronic stimulation of the reno renal reflex to increase it with diuretic administration may be used for such patients.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the device coordinates with another device that applies a non urinary system stimulation for example cardiac pacing or a medication pump or a transdermal medication application patch.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the device is programmed with a plurality of possible stimulation protocols. Optionally a table or algorithm is provided which matches stimulation profiles with desired effects physiological conditions and or possible side effects. Optionally or alternatively a correction is provided for various situations such as age or diabetes in which cases the stimulation intensity required for desired effect may be doubled and or optionally programmed by a user.

An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to devices for stimulating tissues near the bladder for example the urinary bladder trigone and or distal ureter area. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention such a device includes a stimulator which resides at least in part in the bladder. Optionally such a stimulator is equipped with an expanding part optionally a balloon which dwells in the bladder optionally an inflating part of a Foley catheter. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulator is shaped so that access to the trigone and or the ureter is not blocked by an enlarged prostate. Optionally the balloon is not spherical for example a torus for better control of location of stimulation. Optionally the stimulator is a balloon with a concavity matching the bulging prostate area. Optionally or alternatively the stimulator includes an adapting mechanism matching a protrusion into or distortion of the bladder caused by organ prolapse. Optionally the adapting mechanism is the ability of the device to change its form optionally to bend to match the distortion of the bladder. Optionally such a stimulator is designed to not mechanically interfere with urine flow for example including a channel for urine to the urethra and or includes a channel for urine flow from the ureters to the bladder. Optionally the stimulator includes at least one optionally more draining holes to fully empty the bladder. Optionally the stimulator does not fill the entire volume of the bladder. Optionally the stimulator includes only a wire in the urethra thereby allowing the bladder neck to operate in its valving function. A potential advantage of a trans pubic approach is that a direct insertion into the ureter and or contact with a trigone area may be possible by transfixing the bladder at a correct orientation and reducing the risk of infection.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulator is designed to have a contact adjacent a trigone or distal ureter area. Optionally the stimulator includes a plurality of contacts for different areas in the bladder.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the bladder is stimulated at multiple locations for example at non trigone areas. It is believed that such stimulation if applied over a sufficient surface of the bladder can activate such sensory nerves which can then trigger or modulate a vesico vascular effect. Optionally controlled differential stimulation of different parts of the bladder is used to provide control of the at least practically counteracting reflexes of the reno renal reflex and the vesico vascular reflex. Optionally the degree of vesico vascular excitation is controlled by one or more of controlling intensity and controlling surface area stimulated e.g. a 20 area stimulation generates less of an effect than 60 area stimulation .

Optionally such stimulations are applied in series alternatively they at least partially overlap in time. Optionally after a reno renal reflex is activated a vesico vascular reflex is applied to reduce the kidney function to a desired amount or the trigone may be stimulated to increase the reno renal reflex intensity . Optionally such stimulations are applied as needed to maintain a desired physiological effect within a desired range for example resulting in a series of stimulations of the trigone and the rest of the bladder not necessarily alternate stimulations.

Optionally the stimulation used is to reduce sensitivity for example by hyperpolarization of nerves. Optionally such dampening stimulation is used for example when stimulating the entire bladder to first desensitize the trigone so it does not counteract the effects of bladder stimulation the ureter is then optionally stimulated to achieve a desired effect on the reno renal reflex . Optionally or alternatively the relative contributions of vesico vascular reflex and reno renal reflex or other reflexes can be controlled by reducing the contribution of one in addition to or instead of increasing the other.

Optionally once stimulation shows a desired effect or instead of such stimulation nerve endings in a portion of the bladder may be permanently ablated to reduce a reflex such as the vesico vascular reflex.

In some exemplary embodiments of the invention the stimulation is used to increase or reduce sensitivity for example by modification of reflex gain. Optionally this is provided by electrically stimulating other reflexes and or nerves of the urinary system.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention sensitivity of various receptors pathways and or physiological function is tested by stimulation and or optionally damping stimulation as part of a diagnosis process.

Optionally or alternatively a protocol may include a test session to see what a patient responds to and or what a patient may over respond to and a treatment protocol is optionally decided accordingly.

In some cases kidney voiding problems and or an enlarged prostate cause over stimulation of a bladder region thereby causing over stimulation or habitation of a reflex. Optionally such a physiological condition is treated as a way of affecting such a reflex and having a desired non local effect as described herein. For example a prostate may be resected or shrunk e.g. using ablation or medication and or a urethra may be opened and or a bladder be stimulated to assist in voiding and or a bladder may be resected to reduce a surface area thereof.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulator includes a plurality of contacts but only on one hemisphere thereof. Optionally the contacts are fewer than 10. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the contacts all or some are positioned to specifically reach the trigone area. For example if the stimulator is a balloon entering from the urethra a distance between the urethra and the trigone is used to set the distance between the contacts or some of them an a part of the balloon that contacts the bladder neck.

An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to non electrical stimulation of the urinary system for example thermal mechanical and or chemical stimulation of the ureter trigone and or kidney. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a device for mechanical stimulation includes an element which expands inside the ureter and thereby simulates a blockage. Optionally the element does not block urine flow. Alternatively it does.

An aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to an integrated bladder dwelling stimulation system. Optionally the system is adapted to be inserted through a urethra. Optionally or alternatively the system is adapted to be inserted via the pubic area. Optionally the system includes in a single unit sensing control and power. Optionally the system is designed to specifically stimulate the trigone. Optionally the system is simple and or designed for disposing for example not including an on off control and or including only a power control so that a setting which is effective but not painful or causing discomfort may be selected.

Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not necessarily limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components and or methods set forth in the following description and or illustrated in the drawings and or the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways.

Referring now to the drawings where is a flowchart of a method of controlling body physiology using stimulation of the urinary system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention. is a simplified schematic block diagram of a urinary system stimulation system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulation system comprises a stimulator optionally an electrical stimulator but possibly a stimulator of a different type for example chemical thermal or mechanical. Stimulator is optionally coupled to a controller by a lead . Alternatively a wireless coupling may be provided. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention controller includes a power source such as a battery. Optionally the battery has enough power for treating a patient for at least 1 3 years. In some embodiments a small battery suitable for example for 1 6 days or 1 4 weeks is provided. Optionally controller is enclosed in a housing for example suitable for implantation in the body or for survival outside the body. Optionally an input source is provided for example for user input or for sensor input and or for a time signal.

At a patient is optionally diagnosed. In some cases the diagnosis is pre existing. In other cases stimulation of the urinary system will help in determining a diagnosis. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulation is used as part of a diagnostic method. For example patients having hyperactivity of the renal nerves may be identified. For example in CHF patients there is a variability in the function of sympathetic renal nerves. It is expected that stimulation in accordance with some embodiments of the invention would have a more pronounced effect on high renal nerve activity patients. After such identification such patients may be treated for example using a chronic device using a nerve or vessel stimulator such as suggested by U.S. Pat. No. 7 162 303 and US patent publication 2006 0212078 and or a more vigorous anti sympathetic therapy.

Optionally or alternatively various kidney functions may be measured. Optionally weariness of the kidneys can be identified by determining how well the kidneys respond to stimulation. Optionally or alternatively diagnosis comprises bypassing various parts of the renal system to see where a normal response is detected. For example if stimulation of afferent nerves has an effect that ureter stimulation does not this suggests a damaging of the ureteral nerve endings.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a degree of renal sympathetic drive can be measured from the timescale amplitude of the response to reno renal stimulation. As taught by Schramm et al activation of the reno renal reflex reduces the attenuation of renal function during sympathetic stimulation. The reno renal reflex can also slow the renal response to renal nerve stimulation. Optionally a number of different intensities of stimulations are provided and the patient s response for example blood pressure and or urine flow is measured. Comparison of the effects of stimulation can provide the gain of the sympathetic system and the responsiveness of the kidneys and or the cardio vascular system.

At a treatment is optionally selected. As noted in some cases stimulation of the urinary system is used to help in choosing a treatment protocol for example to see which stimulation has a therapeutic effect with acceptable side effects. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the treatment is selected to affect one or more of kidney function blood chemistry and or cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure and susceptibility to arrhythmia e.g. by lowing sympathetic activity .

At stimulator is provided if one was not provided before. As described herein stimulator may be for example external transcutaneously implanted trans urethrally implanted and or inserted in the vagina or rectum of a patient. below shows exemplary target stimulation locations in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulator is provided on a urinary catheter which is also used to measure urinary output and or ensure bladder evacuation.

At the urinary system is stimulated using stimulator . In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulation system is programmable with a set of parameters which may be selected for example based on a desired treatment.

At an additional treatment is optionally provided for example drugs to affect the body and or urinary system in particular or electrical stimulation for example of the urinary system nervous system and or the heart. Optionally or alternatively an existing treatment such as diuretic medication may be modified to take into account the stimulation of the urinary system. Optionally or alternatively a synergistic result is to be obtained between acts and .

At feedback is optionally provided for example by providing a physiological indication such as blood pressure urine volume GFR blood flow impedance weight blood chemistry.

At one or more stimulation parameters and or treatment parameters of 4010 are optionally changed taking the desired result and or physiological indication s into account. This may result in repeating for example diagnosis treatment selection and or urinary system stimulation and or other treatment.

At additional input is optionally provided for example user commands e.g. reduce blood pressure increase blood pressure medication taken programming and or non physiological sensor input e.g. accelerometers indicating alertness or posture laboratory external urine analysis results and optionally used in determining stimulation and or treatment parameters. Optionally or alternatively this input is used to determine which stimulator to use and or what physiological measures to check.

At a stimulator is optionally removed e.g. when not needed or changed e.g. by replacing an external stimulator having a trans urethral stimulation with an implanted stimulator. For example such replacement may be useful when a temporary stimulator is used to determine parameters and or suitability of a permanent stimulator.

While various possibilities of treatment and stimulator configuration are described below a particular exemplary stimulation system includes a trans urethral catheter terminating in a balloon configured to electrically stimulate trigone tissue in the bladder. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation is used to increase kidney function including for example one or more of renal blood flow filtration rate urine production salt excretion and or reduction of blood pressure possibly by activating a reno renal reflex. Optionally such increase in kidney function is used to alleviate heart failure and or hypertension.

It should be noted that in some embodiments of the invention only a lead is implanted and in some cases the implantation is temporary being for example by placing in a urethra. In other embodiments implantation is longer term includes forming new apertures in the body surface and or organs and or includes a more robust attachment to tissue than a structure which urges a stimulator against a tissue. For example a stimulator may be implanted for for example 3 days to 2 weeks 1 6 months 1 5 years or shorter intermediate or longer periods.

The above has described an exemplary system and method for stimulating a urinary system in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Following are examples of therapies and or effects which may be achieved by such a system thereafter are described several alternative subcomponents of such a system for example stimulator type stimulator location and designs for different implantation methods. It is to be stressed that a practical implementation of some embodiments of the invention may include picking and choosing particular therapies programming structural features options and or implantation methods and or adaptations from several and or different ones of the sections below.

In general the urinary system includes two kidneys connected by two ureters at kidney pelvises the ureters further being connected to a bladder by uretero vesical junctions UVJ which together with an orifice of a urethra form a trigone area . All of these body parts are adapted to hold urine and some such as the ureter and bladder are muscular. In some cases the stimulation increases the force of contraction of the ureter.

In the following various potential targets are listed. Some of these targets may have been used in the art but in conjunction with other targets other methods of control devices and or methods described herein are novel. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention targets include targets that are within a control loop of the kidney for example nerves and or tissue which modulate and or trigger existing reflexes such as the reno renal reflex and the vesico vascular reflex. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention targets are within the urine flow system which allows ease of access for temporary implantation and or acute treatment.

 a the inside surface of urethra e.g. using an intra urethral electrode this may be an easy to stimulate location which is close to trigone e.g. if parts near UVJ are stimulated stimulation can contract the urethral sphincter and or activate the reno renal reflex 

 b the outside surface of bladder e.g. using implantable stimulator Depending on the location of stimulation different reflexes can be activated for example the stimulation can activate the vesico vascular reflex but if located at posterior locations near the ureters can also activate the reno renal reflex 

 c intramuscular portions of bladder e.g. using a catheter based device an implantable lead and or a suprapubic device such a lead or device may include a tissue penetrating electrode such as prongs or a screw e.g. with a contact at the prong or screw which can be used also in a trigone area 

 d portions of the inner bladder wall e.g. using catheter or suprapubically inserted device optionally this uses an easy to insert device optionally the stimulation can activate the vesico vascular reflex 

 e the trigone area of the bladder e.g. using a catheter a suprapubically inserted device or an implantable device specific activation of the trigone activates the reno renal reflex or dampens it if inhibitory stimulation is used 

 f distal portions of the ureter near or at the connection to the bladder e.g. with a ureter catheter based device Optionally the ureter region is used for specific reno renal reflex activation modulation 

 g distal portions of the ureter somewhat distanced from the bladder e.g. within 2 3 or 3 5 or 5 10 centimeters from the end optionally near a junction of nerves and the ureter 

 i inside surfaces or within wall portions of the ureter at any point thereof for example using an intra ureteral catheter or an extra ureter stimulator either optionally connected to a implanted device 

 k pelvic portions of the kidney optionally inner surfaces thereof stimulation can optionally control ureteral peristalsis in addition to activation of the reno renal reflex.

 l the cortex of the kidney for example its outside surface e.g. the renal capsule optionally under a fat layer thereof 

 m internal structures of the kidney for example one or more of a Renal pyramid a Renal hilum a Minor calyx a Major calyx a Renal papilla and or a Renal column and or an active kidney portion such as a Nephron 

Optionally or alternatively nerves that innervate or otherwise affect the kidney are stimulated to affect kidney or other body function. Optionally the nerves may be one or more of afferent nerves somatic nerves parasympathetic nerves and sympathetic nerves. Optionally a nerve ganglion or other plexus e.g. the spine is stimulated to directly or indirectly affect such nerves. A particular advantage of stimulating afferent nerves is that such stimulations allows existing kidney feedback mechanism to be manipulated as if a real event was happening. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the nerve stimulated is a nerve that is directly connected to a kidney. In other embodiments the nerve is not directly connected to a kidney for example a nerve connected to a spine. In one example a vagal nerve is used to affect general body nervous tone and an additional stimulation used to specifically affect a kidney.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the nerves being stimulated enervate the urinary system and or are adjacent thereto e.g. are stimulated within 2 5 cm optionally 1 3 cm optionally about 1 cm from their connection to the urinary system . Possibly this will increase the locality of the stimulation and reduce undesired effects on other body systems

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the targets include one or more of a Splanchnic nerve a Pelvic nerve a Pudendal nerve a Pelvic ganglion a Celiac ganglion a spinal cord portion or and or a Vagus nerve . It should be noted that in general nerves may be less desirable to stimulate if their stimulation is not specific and or if there is a danger of inflammation of the nerve.

Optionally or alternatively blood vessels not shown are stimulated for example one or more of an Interlobar artery a Renal artery a Renal vein and an Interlobar vein. Stimulating vessels can be used to increase or reduce blood flow to the kidneys.

A particular advantage of stimulating urine holding tissues is that such tissues may be more robust and or more muscular and easier to contact without damaging. Another potential advantage of stimulating functional tissue rather than nerves is that such stimulation may assist in simulating a desired behavior of the kidneys using pre existing feedback mechanism. For example stimulating a ureter can be used to simulate an obstruction in the ureter and or the sensory signals caused by such obstruction thereby triggering biologically natural reflexes and feedback loops. In another example stimulation of sufficient parts of the bladder can simulate a full bladder and thereby reduce kidney function. In some examples stimulation is targeted at locations in the body which include receptors such as force receptors and chemo receptors.

Bold boxes include external stimulations some generally known e.g. diuretics and some novel e.g. stimulation of the ureter . Unbolded boxes indicate effects of such stimulations. An important feature shown in this figure is the multiple inputs for some of the effects. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention to achieve a desired effect multiple inputs may be provided inputs which work together and or inputs which interfere. Additionally some inputs may be reduced e.g. medication if they interfere with a desired effect. Optionally or alternatively different inputs are provided at different times of day for example when their side effects are less bothersome and or to provide different modes of interference with body function at different time which may prevent habitation and or adaptation.

As shown activation of the vesico vascular reflex can increase renal sympathetic activity which can then lead to one or more of decreasing renal blood flow decreasing GFR decreasing diuresis decreasing natriuresis and or increased renin secretion . These last two can cause increased blood pressure optionally in cooperating with increased renal sympathetic drive . Blood pressure can also be increased using blood pressure elevating medications and by systemic increased sympathetic activity . Diuretics can also increase renal sympathetic drive and therefore increase blood pressure .

Blood pressure lowing agents can decrease blood pressure as can ACEI and ARBs angiotensin blockers which reduce renin angiotensin aldosterone axis activation. Alpha and beta blockers can reduce the systemic sympathetic activity and thereby reduce blood pressure .

Stimulation of the ureter and or trigone areas can evoke the reno renal reflex and or for example reduce renal sympathetic drive and or increase renal and or systemic CGRP calcitonin gene related peptide secretion which can then increase renal blood flow increase GFR increase diuresis increase natriuresis and or reduce renin secretion .

In general treatment of any particular patient may be a navigation of a maze of interactions and counter interactions between stimulations and treatment while taking into account the responsiveness of a patient and his her danger zones. Optionally a stimulation system and or a monitoring system are programmed with such interaction e.g. 3 4 5 or more interactions and used to predict and monitor the effect of treatments and or suggest treatments and or treatment levels.

In accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention one or more of the following effects on urinary system function is achieved 

 c increasing or decreasing peristalsis in a ureter for example by overpacing a ureter or by applying a desensitizing stimulation to the ureter e.g. a hyper polarizing stimulation such as DC or a high frequency stimulation Optionally over pacing is to above a normal rate for example to above 3 4 5 or more peristaltic waves per minute.

 d increasing or decreasing renal blood flow for example by stimulating renal vessels and or modulating a reflex increasing renal blood flow may increase kidney function and vice versa 

 g stimulate receptors to modify a baseline activity thereof e.g. increase or decrease thereby making a reflex weaker or stronger for a same stimulation or physiological condition 

 j modify cardiovascular function such as blood pressure heart rate vessel dilation and or resistance and or susceptibility to arrhythmia for example by releasing hormones preventing the release of hormones modify an intensity of a reflex and or modifying systemic sympathetic activity.

Dampening or exciting receptors. Pressure and chemo receptors in the urinary system can be activated by electrical stimulation. Some of these receptors are NMDA glutamate receptors which are known to have a prolonged timescales of activation and can be pushed to long desensitization states by high frequency stimulation. In addition activation of NMDA receptors is very frequency dependent frequencies as low as 5 Hz stimulations can progressively increase receptor activation for example see Polsky et al. Different patterns of electrical stimulation can selectively excite or dampen receptor activity. NMDA receptors are also the main mediators of long term potentiation and depression which are important mechanisms of modulation of neural activity and neural reflexes. As known in the art to excite a nerve electrical stimulations are usually given in short pulses of up to 10 ms in length or by sinus wave shaped currents. To dampen nerve function long DC currents or very high e.g. 1000 Hz stimulation frequencies can be applied.

Activation and modulation of the reno renal and the vesico vascular reflexes. A team lead by DiBona and Kopp revealed in a number of seminal papers that the reno renal reflex is normally activated by a rise in pressure or sodium concentration in the collecting system the renal pelvis and the ureters any of which are stimulated in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the invention . The reflex can be naturally activated by sensing from one side of the urinary system but the normal effect is a bilateral reduction of the sympathetic input and increase in CGRP mediated effect to both kidneys as found by Zhu et al. Physiologically the reno renal reflex increases renal blood flow renal filtration GFR diuresis natriuresis and reduces blood pressure both by promoting sodium excretion and by a direct effect on brainstem sympathetic ganglions.

The vesico vascular reflex has a rather opposite effect on the sympathetic system and on some kidney function. It is activated by increased bladder pressure or bladder distension as occurs during bladder outlet obstruction. Chien et al found that activation of the reflex reduces renal blood flow GFR sodium and water excretion and increases renin secretion by renal nerve mediated effect. Fagius and Karhuvaara reported that in human subjects the reflex also increases blood pressure in a direct proportion to the intrabladder pressures. The increase in blood pressure is independent of renal nerves activity or renal function.

Modulation of reflexes has been shown for example in work done by Jiang and Lindstrom in the urinary system who demonstrated a change in responsiveness of the micturition reflex. Short 5 min electrical stimulation of the bladder and other pelvic structures effectively increased the threshold for the reflex for at least one hour post stimulation. Possibly the effect was mediated by change in the strengths of the synaptic connections in the reflex pathway.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention it is noted that the two reflexes are generally at least in part opposite. Optionally the balance between the reflexes is changed for example by strengthening one reflex or exciting or increasing a baseline excitement level of receptors associated therewith and or by weakening the other reflex e.g. or dampening a baseline excitation level and or sensitivity of its receptors .

Hormone release. The reno renal reflex is mediated by two nervous systems first it triggers a reduction of the sympathetic activity of the kidneys. In addition it induces release of CGRP in the kidneys. CGRP is one of the most potent vasodilators in the cardiovascular system and it is known to cause both arterial and venous vasodilatation. In addition it can elevate renal functions for example in a work done by Li and Wang and it was shown to increase GFR urine flow and natriuresis in rats. CGRP infusion to human CHF and CKD patients was shown to decrease blood pressure and increase renal blood flow and GFR Shekhar et al and Palla et al . These studies had also shown that CGRP has a relatively long effect lasting a few hours despite a relatively short plasma half live of about 10 min.

CGRP is probably released from simulated afferent nerves in accordance with some embodiments of the invention as these nerves have both sensory and excretory functions. Zhu et al had shown that activation of the reno renal reflex by increasing ureteral pressure increased plasma CGRP levels. However the mean CGRP concentration achieved by this stimulation was about 10 fold lower than the minimally effective infused CGRP levels. By sufficient stimulation it is believed that these levels will be reached for example 7 10 15 20 or more of normal levels. Optionally such results are achieved by applying a train e.g. 10 or 20 or intermediate or larger number of stimulations with rest periods e.g. 10 40 seconds or 1 15 minutes between so that the nerves are re stimulated by each stimulation to excrete more CGRP.

In some embodiments of the invention CGRP levels are measured in the urine and or the blood. Optionally or alternatively stimulation is repeated enough so that significant e.g. vessel dilatation affecting systemic levels of CGRP are provided optionally measured by blood test and or measuring vessel diameter e.g. with a vessel cuff or an ultrasound transducer measuring a signal across a vessel .

Regarding the role of CGRP in ureteral innervation. Lang et al described the inhibitory effect of CGRP on the motility of the isolated renal pelvis and ureter. The effect of CGRP is especially evident in the ureter as a suppression of evoked motility the all or none suppressant effect probably occurs because CGRP abolishes the firing of action potentials evoked either by electrical stimulation or chemical agents. A descending gradient exists in the guinea pig pyeloureteral tract regarding sensitivity to the inhibitory effect of CGRP the ureter is extremely sensitive whereas the spontaneous activity of the renal pelvis is inhibited but not suppressed by this peptide. CGRP is the main mediator involved in the local regulation of ureteral motility its main effect can be described as a powerful suppression of latent pacemakers of the ureter smooth muscle. Optionally motility is controlled for example by pacing to overcome a motility reducing effect.

It should be noted that while some of the above effects have been described in the art they have not generally been described as being part of a system for control of bodily functions. Rather some embodiments of the invention utilize what is known with respect to biological interactions and provide a control system based thereon.

Following are examples of relationships between stimulation location and effect on kidney function in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the invention 

 b stimulation of the bladder can be used to simulate a full bladder and evoke a vesico vascular reflex or to prevent such a reflex from being evoked.

Possibly the renal pelvis is more responsive to stimulation than the ureter and this is used for selecting some embodiments of the invention.

In some embodiments stimulation at or near the trigone and or of a sacral is used to affect a closing of a bladder sphincter. A combined sphincter closing effect may be useful if there is inadvertent causing of bladder contractions and or feelings of discomfort.

It should be noted that while some of the stimulations have a biomechanical effect e.g. peristalsis sphincter closing non mechanical physiological effects such as on blood pressure and kidney function are often more of interest.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a stimulation system is used to stimulate a plurality of targets in the body and or urinary system. Optionally a plurality of such targets are stimulated in a same therapeutic session. Optionally or alternatively such targets may be stimulated substantially simultaneously for example within 1 minute 5 minutes 20 minutes 35 minutes of each other or intermediate or longer periods.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention sequential stimulation of different targets is used to modulate an effect. For example a first stimulation target triggers a reno renal reflex. A second stimulation is then applied after a time to for example evoke the vesico vascular reflex an thereby reduce the effect of the previously evoked reno renal reflex to a desired amount. A urinary system specific stimulation is used together with a systemic stimulation for example a reno renal reflex applied at a same time as a vagal stimulation. In another example a combination of a medication and a stimulation is used for example evoking the reno renal reflex to counteract a reduction in renal functions or enhance the effect of a diuretic.

Optionally different kidneys are differently controlled for example by supplementing the reno renal reflex using another stimulation method. One of the stimulations may be a baseline stimulation for one or both kidneys and the other used for modulation of both kidneys or only one.

In accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the invention what is provided is a controller for urinary and or other body functions. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the controller is used to directly or indirectly affect the underlying pathophysiological causes of some important diseases. Optionally such a controller can replace enhance decrease and or support existing body feedback cycles receptors and or sensor function. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention such a controller substitutes normal or corrected responses for sensed body conditions in a manner which compensates for damaged receptor pathways and or prevents a self reinforcing syndrome such as a cardio renal syndrome. Optionally or alternatively such a controller can provide long term therapy and or short term therapy as desired. Optionally such a controller can be used to specifically modulate a function of one organ optionally the kidneys for example providing opposite effects e.g. otherwise physiologically incompatible on different organs.

Several exemplary treatment combinations follow. These are only exemplary combinations and many of the stimulations described herein can be combined with stimulations of types known in the art to provide a myriad of different treatment options optionally with a synergistic compensating and or side effect reducing effect.

 a Reno renal reflex activation systemic vasoconstrictors that may include sympathetic activation alpha and or beta agonists vasopressin agonists somatostatin agonists this combination can elevate blood pressure and ensure perfusion to the heart and brain without compromising renal blood flow.

 b Reno renal reflex activation diuretics boost the effectiveness of diuretics by enhanced renal delivery due to increased renal blood flow.

 c Reno renal reflex activation sympathetic inhibition e.g. beta blockers ACEI ARBs increase the blockage of the renal sympathetic activity and its negative effects on cardiorenal interactions.

 d Reno renal reflex activation water and or saline infusion that increases plasma volume for example to increase blood pressure and renal function and aid in salt removal.

 e Reno renal reflex activation splanchnic vasoconstrictors e.g. vasopressin V to redistribute blood flow from the splanchnic circulation to the kidneys.

 f Reno renal reflex activation Vesico vascular reflex activation simultaneously or not to control renal and cardiovascular function as desired.

 h Inhibition of the vesico vascular reflex to reduce blood pressure. Reduction of the reflex can be performed with a pharmacological agent such as capsaicin e.g. infused into bladder optionally while protecting trigone area or by electrical stimulation for example by a high frequency electrical stimulation or DC stimulation.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the above effects on kidney function and or direct effects of urinary system stimulation on body functions are used to provide one or more of the following systemic effects 

 a Blood pressure reduction. This may be achieved for example by increasing renal urine and sodium output for example by increasing kidney function in one or both kidneys. This also can be achieved by decreasing sympathetic activity for example by activation of the reno renal reflex or decreasing of the vesico vascular reflex.

 b Blood pressure increase for example by activation of the vesico vascular reflex or inhibition of the reno renal reflex.

 c Diversion of blood to other organs while optionally maintaining at least a minimum renal blood flow. This can be done by a number of methods according to a desired effect. For example systemic or specific for example splanchnic vasoconstrictor agents can be given together with activation of the reno renal reflex. In this way blood flow will be redirected from the systemic or splanchnic circulation to the vital organs heart brain and to the kidneys. Vesico vascular reflex can decrease renal blood flow and increase peripheral vascular resistance.

 d Change in cardiac load. Cardiac afterload is reduced by reduction of blood pressure as provided for example by examples described herein. Activation of the reno renal reflex reduces the total body sympathetic activity and therefore will reduce the sympathetic chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart.

 e Temporal redistribution of kidney function and or load on body systems temporal modulation of kidney function for example to when blood flow is needed in other body parts e.g. when walking or not e.g. when sleeping . This may compensate for damaged blood flow physiological regulation mechanisms.

 f Kidney rest. Selective control of kidney function by a combination of reno renal and vesico vascular reflexes in combination with systemic treatments can halt and restart the activity of the kidney as needed.

 g Change plasma sodium concentration. Activation of the reno renal reflex alone or in combination with infusion of sodium will lead to a change in plasma sodium concentration depending on the intensity of reno renal activation and sodium load.

 h Control of total body water amount can be achieved by increasing and decreasing water balance by the vesico vascular and reno renal reflexes respectively.

 i Increase of renal function for example by activation of the reno renal reflex or inhibition of the vesico vascular reflex.

 j Various disease states which may benefit by increasing or reducing systemic sympathetic activity. Many disease states can be affected by such modifying for example irritable bowel syndrome. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention modifying sympathetic activity using methods as described herein are used as treatment in diseases where such modification may be useful and or to counteract an undesired modification caused by another therapy.

It should be noted that some of the above effects are short term effects and some are longer term effects. Optionally when a longer term effect is desired the stimulation leading to a short term effect is repeated. Optionally during a calibration state a patient is tested to determine his response to stimulations and the duration of effect to be expected. Optionally the system automatically applies a stimulation and logs its effect. Optionally the system tries out a plurality of stimulations with different parameters and finally selects one according to its beneficial effect. Optionally a user is called to select between options and or reprogram the device based on logged effect. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a user has a programmer that can be used to communicate with the device downloading logs and or uploading programs and or tables indicating what stimulation to apply under what condition e.g. of sensed signals or input .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the above kidney effects and system effects optionally together with other bodily control methods are used for treatment of clinical conditions.

In many conditions including some cases of CHF the treatment is optionally formulated to correct a hemodynamic imbalance. As such a control of blood flow in different vascular beds is often desirable. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention fine tuning of the renal blood flow is provided renal blood flow should be high enough to maintain adequate renal function. However in conditions of reduced cardiac output care should generally be taken to insure an adequate perfusion of other tissue when renal circulation is increased.

For CHF patients exemplary treatment protocol may include measurements of one or more of patient weight blood pressure amount of diuresis natriuresis GFR and subjective and objective analysis of dyspnea. Optionally one or more of cardiac output renal sympathetic activity catecholamine spillover renal blood flow and or wedge pressure are measured as well.

In the case of finding signs of shock and hypoperfusion the immediate treatment can be a combination of bladder stimulation to activate the vesico vascular reflex or administration vasoconstrictors and or activation of the reno renal reflex for example to obtain a positive effect on both blood pressure and renal function or activation of both vesico vascular reflex and reno renal reflex.

In this case blood pressure and kidney function monitoring may be especially important to assess the progression of the treatment as excessive vesico vascular reflex activation may result in hypertension or acute renal failure. One proposed limit of vesico vascular activation can be stimulation till the mean blood pressure reaches a target value for example 80 mmHg or GFR deteriorates by a fixed amount for example 20 from control values .

In CHF patients suffering from increased blood pressure dyspnea hypernatremia or reduced renal function activation of the reno renal reflex with or without concomitant diuretic administration can decrease blood pressure reduce weight effectively remove water and sodium increase the effectiveness of diuretics increase renal function decrease cardio renal interactions and attenuate dyspnea. In these patients the treatment may continue till the patient reaches a target weight. Optionally more complex treatment protocols may be used. For example treatment with stimulation of the reno renal reflex is commenced till a fixed amount of diuresis is reached for example 1 cc kg min the stimulation is then stopped until diuresis drops below predetermined value for example 0.5 cc kg min or GFR decreases for example by more than 20 . Alternatively stimulation can be stopped if a negative effect occurs for example if the mean blood pressure drops below 80 mmHg or if severe hyponatremia is found for example on a blood analysis . The stimulation may be given in a short session for example during a hospitalization for acute heart failure. In this clinical setup the effects of reno renal stimulation may be double first the short term effect of diuresis to reduce body water levels and reduce dyspnea and ascites edema symptoms and or second a long term e.g. one or more weeks or months or years protective effect on GFR e.g. no or reduced GFR reduction or GFR increase . Diuretic treatment alone is known to reduce GFR both acutely but more importantly chronically. Renal function mainly GFR is one of the most important prognostic factors in patient morbidity and mortality in CHF. Maintaining GFR during hospitalization is one of the primary goals of CHF treatment. Reno renal reflex activation increases renal filtration and therefore can protect the kidneys during hospitalization and reduce the rehospitalization rates due to lesser cardio renal syndrome intensity.

Stimulation of the reno renal reflex may be used to specifically inhibit the lethal cardio renal syndrome present in CHF patients. No current treatment modality usefully reduces the sympathetic drive to the kidneys which is one of the most important mediators of the cardio renal syndrome. The cardio renal syndrome which can be acute or chronic reduces renal function increases water and sodium retention and leads to hypertension and progressive heart and kidneys deterioration. Breaking of this pathological process may have a number of beneficiary effects in CHF patients. First reno renal stimulation frees the kidneys to exert their normal function and correctly control the homeostasis of the body. Second the stimulation may lead to a synergistic effect with other current treatments of CHF as increased renal blood flow will increase renal drug delivery and renal metabolism of drugs so that they or their metabolites will not reach toxic plasma levels. Optionally or alternatively load on the heart may be reduced.

Chronic modulation of kidney function for example by activation of the reno renal reflex or inhibition of the vesico vascular reflex may have a paramount importance in treating CHF patients and reducing the chronic cardio renal syndrome. Optionally the treatment may be in a form of multiple preventive acute sessions for example with a catheter based device. Alternatively the treatment may include implantation of an implantable device and continues stimulation. The added value of such stimulation is patient comfort and prevention of heart and kidney function deterioration lesser hospitalizations and a better quality of life.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention for treatment of CHF and or hypertension it is assumed that receptors and or nerve pathways for the reno renal reflex are damaged. Optionally such damage is at least partly overcome by over stimulation and or by stimulating nerves instead of allowing the receptors to act naturally. Optionally stimulation is at the location of damaged receptors and either prompts such receptors into action or directly stimulates nerve endings or other parts thereof at the location bypassing the damaged receptors.

Some CHF patients suffer from hyponatremia which can complicate diuretic treatment. In these patients it is possible to selectively activate the reno renal reflex to increase GFR and diuresis but not natriuresis. The reno renal reflex can be combined with sodium infusion and diuretics to elevate plasma sodium levels and increase the effectiveness of diuretics. In these patients the decision upon treatments can involve body weight measurements treatment stopped when a target body weight is reached and or serum urine electrolyte measurements. For example stimulation of the reno renal reflex can be stopped if high urine sodium excretion is found on urine analysis or plasma sodium levels are reduced above some preset value. Optionally renal sympathetic stimulation at a desired level is provided to counteract some effects of the reno renal reflex activation.

When the patient is found to have high renal sympathetic activity for example by analysis of renal vein catecholamine amount or renal nerve activity e.g. optionally implanted nerve activity sensors a chronic reno renal stimulation may be appropriate with continuation of may optionally depending on renal sympathetic activity measurements.

For hypertensive patients the workup may optionally include one or more of cardiovascular parameters such as blood pressure and renal function analysis GFR and possibly proteinurea . Renal sympathetic activity may be measured as well and treated if abnormal.

In hypertension patients the reno renal reflex may not function properly possibly due to a dysfunction of sensory receptors. The proposed treatment can include direct reno renal reflex activation by electrical stimulation alone or in combination with known hypertension treatment modalities for example diuretics alpha and beta blockers ACEI and ARBs calcium channel inhibitors etc. . Activation of the reno renal reflex reduces blood pressure on the short timescale by reducing total body sympathetic system activity and on prolonged basis because of a more efficient water and sodium removal. Other treatment options may include a combination of the reno renal reflex with additional stimulation targets for example carotid sinus stimulation or renal nerve ablation. Length and intensity of reno renal stimulation may depend upon blood pressure measurements so that it can be stopped or weakened when a target blood pressure is reached. Treatments may be provided intermittently when high blood pressure is detected or suspected by a patient or continuously for example with an implantable stimulator for maintenance purposes.

For patients suffering from CKD renal function parameters in addition to blood pressure are optionally measured. Renal sympathetic activity can be determined as well. For example one or more of the following may be measured renal sympathetic activity GFR diuresis natriuresis body weight and hemoglobin.

The treatment may depend on the pathophysiology of renal dysfunction. For example for patients suffering from malignant blood pressure and increased renal sympathetic activity activation of the reno renal reflex can be combined with aggressive antihypertensive treatment such as treatment known in the art. For patients suffering from reduced GFR and reduced water and solute excretion the reno renal reflex may be stimulated together with diuretic treatment to assist in water and sodium removal without the risk of renal diuretic mediated shutdown. In this case the stimulation can be discontinued or weakened if the level of diuresis is satisfactory for example 1 cc kg min and commenced if reduction of GFR is noticed for example 0.1 mgdl increase in plasma creatinine .

Acute renal failure is optionally first treated by determining and ameliorating the cause of the renal function deterioration. Reno renal reflex activation may be provided during the initial stages of renal dysfunction as determined by renal function and urine analysis. In some selected cases renal shutdown for example by activation of the vesico vascular reflex may be preferable for example during intoxication with a substance that is known to affect the kidneys the treatment optionally coupled with dialysis to remove the offensive agent. Monitoring of the patient and the treatment efficiency may include body weight as proxy for fluid retention. In the case that body weight increases above desired or if the patient exhibits other signs of hypervolemia uremia for example subjective or objective dyspnea increase in serum creatinine and or urea above preset value the vesico vascular reflex can be stopped and or a reno renal reflex activated. Similarly if the toxic material is removed from the body or detoxified vesico vascular stimulation may be stopped. Stimulation of the reno renal reflex may be discontinued or reduced if urine analysis reveals elevation of protein levels or appearance of casts indicating hyperfiltration nephron damage. Optionally renal blood flow is intentionally increased or decreased optionally by renal vessel stimulation and or renal nerve stimulation.

A rare but lethal hepatorenal syndrome can be managed for example by redirecting blood flow to the kidneys. In patients suffering from this syndrome weight blood pressure and or kidney function analysis are optionally taken. Optionally the pressure in the splanchnic circulation is also measured either directly or estimated based on clinical signs. Optionally if kidney functions show progressive deterioration the reno renal reflex can be activated or vesico vascular reflex depressed or other method used optionally to increase renal blood flow and renal function. The treatment may be discontinued when desired levels of renal blood flow is reached. If hypotension or portal hypertension is found the reno renal reflex may be activated together with systemic or splanchnic vasoconstrictors or a surgical intervention to reduce the portal pressure. This treatment may optionally continue till systemic or blood pressure normalizes or kidney function improves for example a reduction of 0.2 mgdl in createnine levels .

In patients suffering from edema and or ascites body weight and renal function can be assessed for signs of reduced diuresis. The reno renal reflex may be then activated to remove the excessive fluids.

For shock patients it may be appropriate to increase the blood pressure increase peripheral resistance but preserve the renal blood flow so as not to damage the kidneys. As mentioned above a number of possible stimulation methods may be appropriate. The reno renal reflex can maintain renal perfusion while vasoconstrictors or vesio vascular reflex increase systemic blood pressure.

Women suffering from preeclampsia may benefit from activation of the reno renal reflex. In these patients blood pressure kidney function and the fetal distress signs are optionally assessed to decide upon the treatment. If maternal and fetal status do not require urgent delivery reno renal reflex stimulation may be used optionally to reduce blood pressure and prolong the pregnancy. Monitoring may include blood pressure and fetal sonography. The treatment may continue either intermittently when high blood pressure is determined or intermittently for example as a preventive treatment.

In cases of Dyspnea high wedge pressure diuretics are optionally administered for venous vasodilatation and a reno renal reflex evoked to maintain GFR.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention of treating hypertension a short term effect is lowering sympathetic drive. This can have an effect in seconds. On a longer term effect of hours or days or weeks reduction in sodium and fluid levels can reduce fluid volume in the body and blood pressure.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention restimulation at short intervals is used to enhance and or maintain the effect on the sympathetic system.

The described systems methods can work together and affect working of a cardiac pacemaker. One example follows. Activation of a reno renal reflex is expected to reduce the whole body sympathetic activity. In an otherwise healthy individual decrease of the sympathetic system leads to reduction of the heart rate. In many cases of patients equipped with a pacemaker the pacemaker determines the rhythm of the heart. To mimic the correct physiologic response the described device can optionally signal the pacemaker to reduce the pacing frequency. In another example the pacemaker and urinary stimulator together affect cardiac output by for example control of afterload or preload using the urinary stimulator with appropriate cardiac stimulation by the pacemaker. Optionally during an arrhythmia or fibrillation flow to the kidneys is shut down for example to improve flow to the brain.

In some cases a single stimulation location affects several kidney and or system function simultaneously. Optionally two or more stimulations are applied together to result in a desired more specific effect with one stimulation modulating the other. Optionally or alternatively some effects e.g. the acute effect on blood pressure vs. change in GFR have different time constants from others e.g. due to an inherently different time constant of the cause such as the cause being hormones or sympathetic activity and or due to an effective time constant mediated by the activation of various homeostatic and other feedback controls of the body and closing a feedback loop on one effect to reduce the efficacy of providing a second undesired effect.

 a The sympathetic drive to the kidney affects different aspects of kidney function according to the strength of the sympathetic activity. Lowest strength triggers renin secretion and thus elevates blood pressure stronger intensity reduces diuresis and natriuresis and the strongest intensity leads to reduction of renal blood flow and GFR. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the sympathetic control of the kidney is modulated together with another stimulation thereby providing additional specificity. Optionally sympathetic drive is modulated by stimulating the carotid body e.g. with a direct effect on renal nerves .

 b Optionally or alternatively cooling e.g. with a contact cooler or heating e.g. with a contact heater of the skin is used with cooling generally increasing GFR on a transient basis and or rediverting blood flow towards organs other than the skin.

 c Optionally or alternatively modulation of hepatic pressure e.g. by placing a constricting or valve in or on the portal vein or stimulating the splanchnic nerve is used wherein increased hepatic pressure reduces renal blood flow.

 d Optionally or alternatively pressure is modified in renal veins e.g. using a valve or an external constriction such as an inflatable balloon wherein increased renal venous pressure reduces renal blood flow.

 e Pharmacology can be used to provide addition effects or counteract some effects of stimulation. For example a reno renal reflex may be evoked while providing vasoconstrictors for shock treatment thereby avoiding kidney damage due to low blood flow. Optionally kidney blood flow is provided at an increasing or cycling amount for example with a lowest amount provided when shock is first treated and then additional blood flow provided after a time e.g. 30 45 minutes possibly only in an amount sufficient to prevent kidney damage.

Optionally the IC is used to generate stimulation pulses e.g. intermittent or continuous .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention communication module and power transmission module are unified. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention input s and or communication module are used to enter external data for example laboratory results from an external laboratory or test unit for example a unit which analyses urine and or blood chemistry. Additional examples of externally entered data are weight medication ingestions and or general feeling headache malaise etc. .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention communication module is used to connect to one or more programming and or monitoring and or co operating systems. In some embodiments of the invention communication is with other stimulator system s other implanted devices and or devices external to a patient s body using one or more different communication protocols.

In one example a laptop a cellular telephone or a miniaturized computer or PDA are used by a user for programming circuitry component and or monitoring its operation and or generating commands thereto.

Optionally or alternatively a pacemaker or other cardiac control device commands circuitry is commanded by circuitry or coordinates therewith. In one example a combined therapy is used for heart failure. In another example blood flow to the kidneys is reduced when pacing is applied to compensate for reduced cardiac output. In another example circuitry is disabled when a defibrillation signal is generated by device . In another example circuitry senses pacing signals and uses such signals to decide on an operational mode thereof. In another example pacing rate is reduced when stimulation of the urinary system is used to reduce sympathetic drive. In another example pacing is used to increase cardiac output when vasodilatation is caused by urinary system stimulation.

Optionally or alternatively a pacemaker or other controller for a heart stomach and or other organ shares components such as a housing a power supply a controller and or a communication module with a urinary system stimulation system. It is noted that in some embodiments of the invention stimulation of the urinary system uses a periodicity which is significantly lower than cardiac pacing for example 1 10 or less or intermediate parts of the periodicity of cardiac pacing typically 1 2 per second . Optionally or alternatively the power used for the urinary system is lower than in the cardiac system. This may be for example for one or both of two reasons. First in pacing capture by the heart is essential. In the urinary system there is usually no immediate threat by missing a single activation. Second in the heart stimulation of a significant area of muscle tissue is often required. In the urinary system in some embodiments of the invention smaller areas and or more sensitive tissue e.g. nerve receptors are stimulated. For example the power of a single exciting stimulus train in the urinary system may be for example less than 1 10 1 20 or intermediate portions of that used to capture a heart during pacing of the left ventricle from the apex in the right ventricle e.g. 5 8 mA for 2 ms . This may allow a longer battery life and or the use of smaller batteries.

In another example multiple stimulation systems for a urinary system are provided for example one system for nerves and one for ureters. One or both systems may be implanted.

In another example stimulation system is part of or receives input from a homeostasis system for example as may be provided in an ICU to control hydration levels and blood chemistry by for example providing medications or infusions depending on measurement of body parameters. In one example circuitry provides instructions to modify fluid provision and or provision of medication of blood components food or ions. Alternatively an external system controls multiple fluid and chemistry modifying sub systems one of which is system . Optionally or alternatively system is instructed to stimulate a reno renal reflex if salt levels are up in the blood and or if urine levels are down.

In another example a scale for example a scale equipped with a wireless transmitter is used to indicate to circuitry a patient s weight which may be used to automatically change a fluid retention schedule thereof.

In another example system may include or be coupled to a urine system for example for measuring urine flow and or content. Such measurements may be used to for example automatically modify system operation.

In another example a lung fluid monitoring system is used for example to provide feedback on ability of the system to improve fluid in the lung conditions and or trigger an increase in renal output to reduce fluid retention in the lungs.

In another example system may include or be connectable to a long distance link such as using a land line or a cellular communication protocol. For some applications urinary system stimulation configuration includes a hemostasis system .

In some embodiments circuitry component is implantable. shows an exemplary implantable system in which a capsule is provided which encloses circuitry component .

An electrical stimulator e.g. a lead with a distal side and a proximal side terminates with one or more electrical contacts and is coupled to system using a connector for example of a type known in the art for example with connectors to 2 3 4 or more leads or other wires. Optionally capsule serves as a ground or other electrode. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention contact s are adapted for coupling to a ureter for example as described below.

Capsule can be of a design known in the art of pacemakers and is optionally a pacemaker capsule including cardiac pacemaker circuitry programmed to provide stimulation as described herein.

Capsule is optionally made or coated with biocompatible materials such as noble or refractory metals materials or compounds such as platinum iridium tantalum titanium titanium nitride niobium or alloys thereof or of a polymer. Optionally capsule is hermetic to liquid and or vapor passage. Optionally capsule is designed to permit passage of electromagnetic or other fields used to transmit data including commands and or power.

The shape of the stimulator is optionally determined by the structure of the desired anatomy the surrounding area and the method of insertion or deployment and can be for example of a standard pacemaker for the heart or an elongate element which does not interfere with bending of the body.

Exemplary dimensions of a housing are for example between 3 5 cm by 3 5 cm by 0.5 1.5 cm. An exemplary volume is less than 30 cc less than 20 cc less than 10 cc or intermediate volumes.

In some embodiments circuitry component is left outside the body. This may be the case for example if the stimulation is via a transurethral stimulator but in other cases as well for example as shown below.

Other embodiments described below show embodiments where lead is part of an in bladder device such as a stimulator based on a Foley catheter which is configured to electrically stimulate parts of the bladder in particular a trigone area thereof.

Dimensions of an external stimulator control unit can be for example between 1 5 cm by 1 5 cm by 0.5 1.5 cm. Optionally the unit is cylindrical and has a size of about 1 2 cm diameter and 3 5 cm in length. An exemplary volume is less than 30 cc less than 12 cc less than 5 cc or intermediate volumes.

Various sensors may be used with a urinary stimulation system including for example one or more of the following. It should be noted there are various packaging options for the sensors. For example the sensors can be packaged with circuitry . In some cases the sensors are connected to circuitry using a lead optionally sharing a lead with a stimulator. In some cases the sensors are connected using wireless means. In some cases the sensors provide their input via human intervention. For example the following types and exemplary sensors while being only examples may be used 

Stimulation system may be provided with one or more feedback modes depending for example on its implementation and or programming. In one example system operates in an open loop mode. In such a mode the device is programmed to provide stimulation at set times periods and or other parameters. One example where this may be useful is when a patient is identified as having high fluid retention and system is used to reduce fluid load by increasing kidney activity. A standard protocol such as application for 2 10 hours or 3 10 days may be provided. In another protocol chronic stimulation is used for example for 2 4 months or 2 4 years. Optionally even in an open loop mode a safety feedback is provided to stop operation of system or perform a counter operation and or provide an alert if a safety threshold is passed or a safety problem otherwise detected. For example when the electrical charge provided by the stimulation may harm the stimulated structure. In one example low renal blood flow low blood pressure or high blood pressure caused by over stimulation is detected. Optionally the maximum allowed renal blood flow and or output are set and the system optionally applies a suitable stimulation or stops stimulation if a threshold is passed. Such safety features may be used with other renal urinary stimulation systems as well.

Another exemplary mode is a semi open loop mode in which feedback is provided relatively infrequently for example once an hour once a day once a week or at intermediate length times. This may be used for example for body weight optionally including an input for patient to indicate intake of food and or fluid which may be corrected for.

Another exemplary mode is closed loop mode in which feedback is provided on a time scale similar to the effect on the body system being controlled by stimulation system . For example feedback on blood pressure may be provided every minute. An additional exemplary closed loop may include measures to prevent patient dehydration and or hyponatremia. Optionally a manual input to the device is first made indicating the actual vs. the desired weight of the patient and or plasma sodium levels. Optionally the device has sensors to measure urine flow and or urinary sodium concentration. By counting the amount secreted it is possible to discontinue the stimulation when the desired fluid removal is reached or when the amount of excreted sodium may lead to hyponatremia. An additional exemplary closed loop may be an automatic stimulation of the reno renal reflex when renal function deteriorates. Optionally the device senses GFR or urine flow for example once an hour. If renal function is reduced below some preset value as sensed the device may start stimulation of the reno renal reflex optionally until renal function improves. An additional exemplary closed loop may be an enhancement of a naturally occurring reno renal reflex. It is possible that in patients suffering from hypertension the reno renal reflex may not be functioning sufficiently to excrete fluid and sodium from the kidneys. Optionally stimulation of the reno renal reflex may be imitated when a natural stimulus of reno renal reflex activation such as increased urine flow or urine sodium levels are detected by the sensory element. The benefit from this method of stimulation may be a more physiological activation of the reno renal reflex as needed for example when the patient consumed large amount of water or sodium. Optionally the sensing includes bladder volume pressure sensing and inhibition of the vesico vascular reflex to prevent activation of the sympathetic system. In one example closed loop operation is pre limited to a certain time frame and or to a certain number of measurement stimulation cycles. It is note however that in general system need not take a measurement before each stimulation event. For example measurements values can be estimated instead of measuring or feedback may be defined to be taken periodically or on some other basis.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a stimulation sequence parameter set includes one or more of stimulation sequence desired short and or long term effects safety parameters of one or more physiological sensors a feedback mode and or a logic for determining and acquiring feedback or further instructions.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the mode of operation takes into account a residual effect of stimulation. As shown below some stimulations have an effect on kidney function lasting at least up to several hours after application. Such stimulation sequences may be considered to be inherently open loop or semi open loop. In some cases such effects are counteracted by additional stimulations if limitation thereof is desired. Optionally the stimulation applied depends on patient specific parameters for example cardiac output. This may be instead of or in addition to setting of safety parameters such as threshold amounts of change in blood pressure.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention reflexes are controlled directly. For example a base line activity of a reno renal reflex and or a vesico vascular reflex may be measured directly for example by measuring nerve activity or indirectly by measuring effect. Optionally a control loop is closed by the stimulation system raising and or lowering a level of activity of the reflex for example by stimulation of receptors and or nerves involved in the reflex. In some embodiments this is an example of external control of an existing control loop. In some embodiments the control is instead of diminished body control.

In some embodiments of the invention information or commands to close the loop are provided externally form a user. For example a user can indicate when a feeling of malaise starts and when it finishes. Optionally the control circuitry may be configured to modify and or otherwise process user input. For example even if a user indicates to stop stimulation the circuitry may continue stimulation for example to provide an easing off or if measured parameters indicate a continuation and or changing of stimulation.

At a mode of operation programming or non programming is selected for example based on an internal command or an internal processing.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention when in non programming mode an external and or internal signal and or parameter optionally indicating biological status or response to stimulation is received at e.g. feedback or command . The signal or parameter received is optionally analyzed at and a desirable stimulation e.g. excitation signal is determined. Optional adjustment or determination of algorithm parameters e.g. stimulation parameter set may also be done at .

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention at a sub mode of operation is determined diagnostic working or monitoring. When in a diagnostic mode the signal s and or parameter s received are optionally communicated and or logged. When in a monitoring mode the signal s and or parameter s received and or the parameters that are the result of the analysis done by system are optionally communicated and or logged. When in working mode the stimulation signal is induced. Optionally the signal s and or parameter s received and or induced are communicated and or logged. Following signal induction the algorithm parameters may be adjusted according to the stimulation induced and or its effect . Other exemplary feedback methods which may be used together or instead are described herein.

When in a programming mode system optionally receives parameters in stage and or communicates parameters in stage optionally as part of a recurring loop . When programming is completed system optionally receives an external signal causing a switch to working mode and optionally a return to listening .

Optionally when no external or internal signals are received to indicate otherwise system passes from 100 to 101 automatically.

While electrical stimulation is preferred for some embodiments of the invention other stimulation modalities are provided in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. It is a feature of some embodiments of the invention that stimulation affects various receptors in the urinary system for example afferent nerves pressure receptors and or tension receptors. It is a feature of some embodiments of the invention that stimulation is used to trigger an existing reflex rather than control a process. These two features together or separately can make it useful to use non electrical stimulation which is less specific with respect to magnitude and or more specific with respect to receptors being triggered.

In one example afferent nerves are stimulated using light chemicals ultrasonic vibration and or heat.

In another example mechanical receptors are triggered by stretching pressure or vibration. For example expanding an object in a ureter can simulate blockage of the ureter by a reno renal reflex. Such expansion for example as shown below need not block the ureter but can be used to selectively reduce output from the blocked kidney and or increase output from an opposite kidney.

In an example of chemical stimulation chemical stimulation of the reno renal reflex can be by saline potassium hydrogen ions low pH and capsaicin to the ureter or bladder. Chemical substance can be released by perfusion from a nephrostome ureter catheter bladder dwelling stimulator and or implanted container. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention chemicals are released via one or more pores e.g. 1 10 each having a surface area of between for example 0.1 square mm to 1 square mm. Optionally or alternatively chemicals are eluted for example using iontophoreses or other electrical driving scheme for example from a gel solid or hollow storage element optionally using an electric field which causes stimulation intentionally or a field which does not. Optionally or alternatively chemicals are provided using a pump. Optionally or alternatively chemicals are released using a sustained release method and or chemical matrix as known in the art for drug delivery methods.

One option for a chemical stimulation of the bladder is intermittent e.g. each puff being for example 1 5 minutes and spaced apart 1 3 hours puffs of capsaicin to the trigone by a Foley like device with delivery element close to the trigone arranged similar to the electrical contacts. Optionally or alternatively stimulation of the rest of the bladder possibly with longer duration is used to reduce vesico vascular reflex. It is expected that a capsaicin puff will lead to desensitization of the receptors which may be good for reducing vesico vascular reflex.

In an example of mechanical stimulation in the ureter mechanical stimulation is optionally intermittent as chronic dilatation of the ureter may result in refractoriness with the ureter possibly expanding to a larger volume.

Optionally the ureter is expanded by a balloon. Optionally or alternatively the trigone is mechanically activated by one or both of an additional balloon on the bladder filling balloon and or a stiff mechanical element that is moved by an external or an internal engine or by magnetism.

Before relating to specific stimulation parameters it is noted that a stimulation sequence may be applied in response to an event in response to a command and or in response to a time. Further the sequence applied may be modified for example based on a history of application a desired long term effect and or based on a physiological or other input. Such variation can also be applied to a continuously applied stimulation sequence. It should also be noted that a stimulation of the urinary system and or the body may involve multiple stimulators each such stimulator being controlled as described herein optionally but not necessarily in a synchronized manner with known delays and or synchronized to events or sensed values.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention various application parameters as described herein are applied and or modified automatically by the control circuitry of system .

Referring now to an arbitrary stimulation sequence e.g. electrical but possibly other modality as well . A sequence can have a length of for example between 0.01 seconds and 2 hours for example between 10 seconds and 19 minutes for example about 10 minutes long. Optionally such a sequence comprises a train of pulses or a long pulse or a series of sub trains of pulses with delays there between. Within a sequence there can be for example a plurality e.g. between 1 and 100 for example above 4 and or below 30 of different pulses and or sub trains. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the actual stimulation parameters used are varied to reduce adaptation habitation and or perceptible and or painful sensations. Optionally a set of 2 20 e.g. 3 4 or more different sequences with a same expected effect are cycled to reduce such habitation.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention pulses and or sub trains and or sequences are charge balanced e.g. bi phasic and or designed so that there will not be too much charge asymmetry in a given period of time.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention delays between sub trains and or between applications of sequences are selected according to one or more consideration for example continued effect of a stimulation after it stops desired for tissue to recover desire for tissue to apply other uncontrolled functionality and or desire for tissue to return to a baseline so that baseline can be measured.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a single pulse can have a single frequency for example between 0.1 and 100 kHz for example between 5 and 1 kHz for example between 20 and 100 Hz. Optionally or alternatively a pulse may be a combination of frequencies for example two three or more frequencies. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a pulse has an energy of between 0.00001 Joule and 0.1 J. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a sequence has an energy of 0.001 Joule and 10 J for example between 0.01 and 0.1 Joule. In some embodiments pulses are generated by a voltage source and the voltage of a pulse is between 0.5 Volt and 100V for example between 1 and 10 Volts. Optionally or alternatively a pulse may be generated by a current source and its current set to be between 0.1 mA and 100 mA for example between 1 and 10 mA. Allowed parameters may depend on the frequencies contact area and or desired effect.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention stimulation is provided in sessions that total at least 2 hours 3 hours 5 hours or intermediate or longer times a day. Within such a session there may be inter sequence delays. Optionally such a session is repeated at least twice a day and or at least 3 times in three days.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention delays between stimulations are selected to reduce pain and or sensation while still providing effects as described herein. For example stimulation signals with a lasting effect may be used so that stimulation is less continuous.

In some cases the stimulation depends on the frequencies and the waveform of the stimulation. For sinusoidal stimulations the efficacy of stimulation may be higher for low frequency stimulation for example 5 250 Hz . The stimulation intensity is for example up to 1.5 mA for 5 Hz and 2.5 mA for 250 Hz. Optionally an absolute threshold stimulation intensity is about 10 mA for all frequencies as this may cause pain. Other thresholds may be provided as well. In some cases higher stimulation frequencies require higher thresholds of stimulations for example at 2000 Hz the stimulations need to be about twice as powerful as in 250 Hz to achieve a same effect. In some cases stimulation frequencies are selected to be frequencies that do or do not or some lesser degree of selectivity stimulate one or more of nerve tissue smooth muscle tissue sensory receptors and or skeletal muscle.

For square pulses much higher input can often be applied without pain. For square pulses pulse width is optionally wider than 1 ms. Optionally stimulation intensities can reach 10 times the values cited for 250 Hz e.g. 25 mA .

Optionally the pain is adjusted for patient condition optionally automatically by a programming system or by the stimulation system optionally manually . For example a patient with diabetes may have twice the pain threshold. Optionally or alternatively with age for example between age 50 and 80 there is an increase in threshold of a factor of 2. Intermediate ages may have a threshold based on an assumption of constant reduction in sensitivity per year.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention 100 Hz continuous or 30 seconds on 30 sec off stimulation is applied for durations of 30 minutes. Shorter or longer durations and or lower or higher duty cycles for example 90 80 60 50 30 20 10 or intermediate duty cycles within a sub train of pulses and or other frequencies may be used in some embodiments of the invention.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention each pulse has a shape selected from square wave rectangular wave triangular wave saw tooth and sinusoidal. Optionally the leading angle is smaller or larger than the trailing angle. While the pulse may be bi polar optionally the pulse is unipolar. In some embodiments the pulse is a DC pulse. Optionally a DC baseline or other baseline is added onto the pulse.

In some cases a composite pulse is applied for example a first part stimulating and a second part modulating the effect of stimulation. Optionally or alternatively a pulse has an FM modulation.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the stimulation is enveloped for example convoluted with a low frequency signal such as a sine wave or a sawtooth or a triangle envelope. Optionally or alternatively the convolution provides a change in frequency over time for example a ratio of 1 1.1 1 2 1 4 1 10 or intermediate or large ratios between different frequencies in different parts of a pulse.

While the pulses in a pulse train may be uniform in some embodiments they vary for example there being an envelope which defines changes in amplitude and or frequency and or other pulse characteristics along the train and or sequence. This may be useful to reduce adaptation. In some cases the sequence is simply a single uniform pulse.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the sequence is applied using bipolar electrodes. This may assist in locality. Optionally or alternatively at least some sequences are applied using a unipolar electrode with a common ground and or using a pair of spaced apart unipolar electrodes. Such electrodes may be spaced apart for example 3 mm 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm or smaller or intermediate or larger distances. Optionally the casing of an implantable stimulator system or an external electrode acts as a return electrode. Optionally a ground common or return electrode is placed in contact with the suprapubic skin.

In some cases a therapy or other application includes applying stimulation at a plurality of locations. Optionally all such locations are stimulated simultaneously. Alternatively at least some locations are stimulated after other locations. This may be useful for example to simplify power circuitry e.g. using a switch between electrodes instead of multiple electrode drivers . In another example peristalsis may be encouraged using timed spaced apart stimulations along the ureter.

In some cases multiple sequences are applied together to obtain a desired effect some of the sequences not being applied to the urinary system or being applied to different parts thereof. Optionally such sequences are applied together. Optionally such sequences are synchronized using a clock and or sensing of an event.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention at least two sequences are designed to be applied at spaced apart times for example a pre set time and or based on measurements. For example one sequence may cause a function and another sequence may stop the function and or otherwise modulate it. For example electrical stimulation may activate one reflex optionally the reno renal reflex for example by a 5 1000 Hz pulses and additional stimulation inhibit the vesico vascular reflex for example by a DC input.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention sensing is synchronized to sequence application for example being at a delay relative thereto or being timed to occur within inter train delays in the sequence. Optionally some sensing is done during or right after a sequence is applied for example to measure the applied stimulation and or its direct effect. In one example sensing of nerve activity is provided while stimulating the nerve at a different location.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention sensing is separate from stimulation. In other embodiments sensing of electrical activities and or electrode impedance and or tissue interface quality uses the same electrodes as used for stimulation.

Exemplary parameters for non electrical stimulation above the above described pulse parameters which apply to other stimulations include for example flow rate and concentration of chemical stimulants. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention NaCl or other sodium salt at a molarity of for example 0.5M 0.8M 0.9M 1.1M 2M or larger or intermediate concentration is used to stimulate a reno renal reflex. Optionally or alternatively Capsaicin at 1 uM 5 uM 10 uM 20 uM or smaller intermediate or larger concentrations is used in the ureter and or bladder. The molarity used may depend on the chemical and its effect on the targeted tissue and or may be limited by toxicity.

For mechanical stimulation pressure in tissue tension vibration rate and or amplitude may be controlled. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention mechanical stimulation in the ureter is by expansion of the ureter and applies pressure of for example 1 200 mmHg for example 30 70 mmHg. A relationship between ureteral pressure and blood pressure is shown for example in the Schrum 1975 paper in the background.

For thermal stimulation temperature difference temperature sign area and or rate of temperature change may be controlled. For example temperatures of 42 degrees Celsius may be used for exercitation. Temperatures of lower than 35 32 30 or intermediate degrees Celsius may be used for dampening excitability.

In some embodiments of the invention a stimulation system is implanted when its need is determined for example instead of providing medication or as part of a global therapy for example in patients suffering from hyperactivity of the renal sympathetic nerves. Optionally a minimally invasive system is used for a while e.g. 2 10 hours 2 10 days or 2 4 weeks or intermediate times to determine stimulation parameters and or expected benefits. Optionally a single stimulation session is used to determine system suitability and or initial parameters.

In some cases when in use a system according to some embodiments of the invention reduces hospital stays for example by 20 40 80 in duration and or number and or increases quality of life for example by 30 50 or more. Desirably a system according to some embodiments of the invention is used in a manner which reduces morbidity for example by 30 80 or intermediate or greater amounts.

In some embodiments the stimulation system or at least a stimulator portion thereof is implanted by default for example being provided with a Foley like catheter which may also be used for urine collection. This may be for example in ICUs and in heart failure patients with acute events.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention implantation for an implanted device is by open or laparoscopic surgery used to connect stimulators to the outsides of structures or to pierce such structures and then implantation of a control unit optionally in the abdominal region as for some pacemaker.

For some embodiments of the invention it may be beneficiary to check proper device location and or monitor an insertion process by external means for example by X ray CT MRI or ultrasound methods. Optionally such input may be inserted manually to the stimulation device for example to change the location of the stimulation. Optionally or alternatively optical means mounted on or in a stimulator and or which carry the stimulator are used during implantation and or at a later checkup.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a trans urethral device is inserted via a urethra optionally without a cystoscope into the bladder. A control unit may also be inserted e.g. dwell in the bladder or lie outside and connected wirelessly or by wire with the inserted stimulator portion. In an alternative embodiment a stimulator is inserted through the flesh of the pubic region into the bladder.

Optionally once in the bladder a stimulator may be left in the bladder. In some embodiments the stimulator is a trans ureteral stimulator which is advanced into one or two ureters. Optionally the stimulator is advanced into the kidney for example to reside in a kidney pelvis thereof. Various attachment mechanisms for the stimulator inside the urinary system are described below.

In another embodiment a stimulator is inserted into a kidney transcutaneously e.g. using a nephrostomy procedure .

In another embodiment implantation of the leads and a stimulator may be by a minimally invasive procedure. Optionally the lead is introduced to and then out of the inside of a urinary lumen for example a ureter by a cystoscope and or ureter catheter. Optionally the lead pierces the ureter or other urine carrying organ and is tunneled to a subcutaneous stimulator.

Optionally the procedure is performed under imaging guidance for example CT MRI and or ultrasound. The target organ is optionally first visualized by the imaging technique and then a lead is placed near through or inside it by a minimally invasive method as known in the art.

In still other embodiments the stimulator is mounted on a vaginal or rectal tampon and resides in the rectal or vaginal area. Alternatively the stimulator is inserted past the rectal and or vaginal wall for example to closer approximation with the urinary tract. Optionally vaginal rectal and or trans urethral insertion is used for treating a non acute cardio renal syndrome.

In another usage scenario preventive treatment and or ongoing intermittent treatment is provided. In this example a patient visits a physician periodically receives a short stimulation session e.g. 15 minutes or up to 3 hours and is released home.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the system includes one or more controls control which allows a patient to reduce stimulation power and or effect and or delay a stimulation responsive to the patient being bothered by the stimulation and or its effect.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention implantation is sometimes followed or preceded by a calibration act. Optionally or alternatively calibration is repeated as the patient s physiological state changes and or as device shifts and or otherwise interacts with the body. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention such calibration includes applying a series of stimulations and or stimulation combinations and determine a response of the body thereto. Optionally the body is placed in a certain physiological state for some such stimulations for example using medication or diet. Optionally the device is programmed with the results of such calibration and or with a set of stimulation sequences and or case stimulate pairs according to the stimulation results. Optionally an initial programming includes determining specific safety problems for the patient and selecting sequences more likely to avoid such problems. Optionally the stimulation sequences programmed include desired long term effects. Optionally the stimulation sequences are programmed to change as time goes on and or as physiology changes and approaches a desired outcome and or approaches an undesired outcome. For example more gentle stimulation may be applied as long as renal functions are above one threshold and stronger stimulation if baseline renal activity goes below such a threshold.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention calibration is fast e.g. with a round lasting 1 20 seconds or 1 5 minutes for example using patient feedback on nervous effects as sensed by the patient or based on sensing signals.

In an exemplary embodiment of the invention the device is configured for diagnosis and or includes a diagnosis related display for example showing one or more stimulations used and their effects on one or more parameters. Such a device can be an integral device or a two part device stimulator and controller .

Diagnosis of nervous function in a patient may be assessed for example by providing a stimulation and observing whether the stimulation induces or reduces bladder and or sphincter contractions. Optionally the information obtained by such means may be used to track a progression of a nephropathy in a diabetes patient.

In hypertension patients stimulation may be used to diagnose the origin of the disease. For example stimulation of a reno renal reflex and measuring urine flow natriuresis and or blood pressure of a patient. In patients suffering from a hypoactivity of the reno renal reflex such stimulation may have a significant effect on these parameters. In addition hyper activation of the vesico vascular reflex may also be a contributing factor to hypertension. Activation or depression of the vesico vascular reflex by stimulation of the bladder or afferent nerves can be used for diagnosis of such hyper activation and the treatment may be to provide a chronic stimulation to inhibit the vesio vascular reflex or amending the clinical condition contributing to said reflex activation for example treating bladder neck obstruction in patients suffering from an enlarged prostate.

Many of the exemplary leads described below fall under two main categories leads outside urinary tract and leads inside urinary tract. In general electrical leads outside urinary tract can be of any design known for stimulator leads in the art concerning for example flexibility diameter and biocompatibility. A specific issue for leads attached to the urinary tract is that the bladder and ureters move for example due to muscular action and due to changes in patient posture and or digestion as well as other motion causing events. Optionally the lead is soft enough and or has a large enough diameter to avoid damaging nearby tissues. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention a lead length is between 1 and 50 cm for example between 7 and 25 cm. Optionally the lead is axially elastic for example having an elongation of 20 without damage.

For non electrical stimulation the lead optionally delivers electrical power to a suitable transducer. In some embodiments the lead includes a lumen or two lumens for delivering and or circulating a fluid and or chemical to a suitable transducer.

For leads inside the urinary tract chemical resistance to urine is optionally provided for example using suitable coatings such as silicone. Optionally such an indwelling lead is hollow to allow urine flow therethrough. Optionally or alternatively the diameter of the lead is small enough to allow urine flow past.

The above has described many variants of devices and features which may be used together. The following lists some particular collections of features and usages into exemplary devices in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.

A bladder indwelling catheter. Optionally the placement is performed as shown in . Optionally the device will be used on acute decompensated heart failure patients admitted to the hospital. These patients can benefit from short term enhancement of renal function and interruption of acute cario renal syndrome. Many of these patients undergo insertion of a regular bladder catheter for urine measurement so a new procedure is not needed. The stimulation will optionally commence in the emergency department and last as long as patient s status as determined from a number of parameters including weight dyspnea cardiovascular and kidney functions require it. The stimulation will optionally be provided in short half an hour sessions given every 4 8 hours or as determined by a feedback from sensors or outside. One optional input may be blood pressure for safety reasons e.g. not to reduce or increase blood pressure inappropriately . Optionally urine flow sensing can be provided from the device itself to calibrate the amount of stimulation needed as urine flow is an easy to measure marker of kidney function. Additional optional group of patients treated by such device may include patients suffering from a hepato renal syndrome. In this case the stimulation may continue longer and may optionally serve as a bridge to keep the patient alive for a liver transplant.

Insertion of an implantable device similar to or . Patients that cannot undergo an operation for a lead IPG placement may benefit for ureteral catheter insertion or nephrostomy catheter insertion . The stimulation may optionally be commenced for half an hour 3 6 times a day optionally when the patient is resting or alternatively when the patient is active. Feedback to stimulation can be from an external device optionally measuring weight or blood pressure of a patient. Optionally stimulation is increased when patient s weight or blood pressure increases. Patients that can benefit from this device include CHF hypertension and CKD patients. In CHF patients interruption of a chronic cardio renal syndrome by reduction of the renal sympathetic drive may halt disease progression and may lead to a decrease in a number of hospitalizations. Patients suffering from hypertension or chronic kidney disease may also benefit from a chronic device implantation as the reno renal reflex may be dysfunctional in these patients leading to improper sodium handling and increase blood pressure in these patients.

Optionally a stimulation sequence for these patients may include sensing of urine flow or urine sodium concentration performed every few seconds minutes or hours and providing a stimulation of a reno renal reflex when urine flow or sodium concentration increase so as to optionally substitute for a malfunctioning natural reno renal reflex.

Various embodiments and aspects of the present invention as delineated hereinabove and as claimed in the claims section below find experimental support in the following examples.

Reference is now made to the following examples which together with the above descriptions illustrate some embodiments of the invention in a non limiting fashion.

The experiments were performed on healthy SD rats that were anesthetized with Inactin. A stimulating electrode made of two platinum plates each with area of about 5 mm located 2 3 mm apart was placed under one of the ureters. Typically the electrode was placed about 1 cm from the pelvis. The lower side of the electrode was isolated from the rat s body by a silicone coating. Both ureters were then catheterized and the urine collected. Great care was given to preserve the temperature of the animal and the hydration status the left femoral vein was catheterized and solution of saline with inulin and para aminohippuric acid PAH was perfused at a constant rate of 3 cc h.

Following the procedure the animal was left undisturbed for one hour for an equilibration of the solutes. The experiment began with baseline urine collection followed by a stimulation session and then by a recovery period. Each collection lasted 30 minutes. In some experiments we abstained from inserting ureteral catheters so that not to irritate the ureter. Blood samples were taken once an hour.

The ureters were stimulated with trains of biphasic 1 ms long 2 10V pulses. The inter stimulus interval was 10 ms train frequency of 100 Hz . In about half of the experiments stimulation trains were delivered for 30 sec once every minute. As the results of these experiments were not different from continuous stimulation experiments they were pooled together in the statistical analysis.

Following a stable baseline collection period we stimulated the ureter by a bipolar electrode located about 1 cm from the pelvis.

It should be noted that the results show in general that even after a stimulation of a minute or two a lasting effect of several minutes can be detected.

The results also show a correlation between RBF GFR and urine flow from the same animal. In general all parameters showed a high degree of correlation indicating that the effects shown may be due to a single intrinsic renal mechanism such as the reno renal reflex.

Stimulation of the ureters increased the total bilateral urine flow by 25 22 GFR by 26 30 and RBF by 13 21 n 8 animals . The increase in urine flow was statistically significant P 0.04 n 8 .

There was some experimental failure in rats probably due to the relative size of the rat and of the stimulators so additional experiments were performed on sheep.

For the experiments presented above half an hour urine collections were used. The long collection period was necessary for reliable measurements. In order to know the time scale of the effect of electrical stimulation of the ureter we used a different approach to explore the immediate effect of nerve stimulation. In this set of experiments we measured urine flow along a ureter catheter on a timescale of minutes during control stimulation settings.

In these experiments we were able to see the effect of stimulation on urine flow bolus sizes and bolus frequency.

We noticed that electrical stimulation often produced a rapid increase in the rate of urine flow and in many cases the effect outlasted the stimulation period. Bolus size tended to increase during stimulation in some instances the flow became continuous. These findings indicate that stimulation may not be given continuously to achieve the desired effect. On one hand this means that longer battery life can be maintained on the other hand intermittent stimulations may be better tolerated by the patient.

The increase in urine flow had variable amplitude possibly because of nerve fatigue and activation of other feedback mechanisms that control urine flow. In some embodiments of the invention such effects are used to control the main effect.

In all animals tested the mean blood pressure sharply decreased at the beginning of the stimulation by 7.4 3.6 mmHg but after about 10 seconds stabilized at 2.7 1.5 mmHg below the original mean arterial pressure not statistically significant P 0.23 and was stable during the full course of the stimulation.

The initial drop in arterial pressure can be a result for example of an activation of parasympathetic or deactivation of the sympathetic system. Optionally it may reflect CGRP secretion known to be activated by reno reno reflex stimulation. Coupled with increased urine flow GFR and RBF this result is highly suggestive of inhibition of the sympathetic drive. The stabilization of blood pressure following the initial drop is probably caused by activation of compensatory mechanisms most notably the aortic baroreceptors that return the blood pressure to normal.

Interestingly we show an increase in RBF during reduced or stable systemic blood tension. This may mean that stimulation of the ureter selectively dilates the renal vascular bed. Renal selectivity of the described device may make it an attractive option for treating the various pathologies in which renal function is impaired and systemic side effects are unwanted.

Effectiveness of electrical stimulation of the ureter was tested on one sheep that underwent nephrectomy 2 month prior to the current procedure. Anesthesia was induced with a mask and halothane 3 4 in oxygen the trachea was intubated and anesthesia was maintained by ventilating the lungs with halothane 0.5 1 in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen 3 2 . Abdominal cavity was opened by midsagittal incision and the ureter was gently exposed near the kidney. Bipolar stimulating electrode made from platinum sheets contact area of about 1 cm2 was placed on the ureter about 10 cm from the kidney the ureter was catheterized and urine collection was performed for 15 minutes. Stimulation of the ureter increased urine flow by 315 GFR by 550 and RBF 565 .

The impressive increase in urine flow GFR and RBF must be considered with respect to the low baseline activity of the kidneys. In this experiment the baseline GFR was just 12 ml min probably due to the stress of the operation. In this respect this experiment possibly stimulated a condition of developing acute renal failure. The sharp increase in RBF points to the responsiveness of the renal system to stimulation of the afferent system during condition of increased sympathetic activation. This result is encouraging as increased renal sympathetic activity is the hallmark of diverse medical conditions such as CHF hypertension CKD and ARF.

Using a flank approach external electrodes were implanted on both ureters about 5 cm from the renal pelvis. The electrodes were similar to the electrodes used in the acute experiment. They were connected to wires that were tunneled subcutaneously to exit at the lumbar region. One week post operation plasma creatinine level was 1.5 mg dL with corresponding GFR of about 70 80 ml cc. One month following the operation the sheep was placed in a metabolic cage for 24 h urine collection and GFR was estimated by creatinine clearance measurements. Ureteral stimulation was performed by an external pulse generator the stimulation lasted for 24 h. shows that Urine flow and GFR increased during prolonged 24 hour stimulation of a ureter by an implanted cuff electrode located 5 cm from the kidney pelvis. As can be seen prolonged elevation of kidney function is possible with long term stimulation. As shown on the prolonged stimulation improved urine flow by approximately 25 and GFR by up to 20 relative to control.

In general during experimentation on sheep same sheep were used for multiple experiments sometimes on consecutive days and sometimes non consecutive. No reduction in effect was noted.

The intravesical stimulator used in these experiments consisted of a specially designed bladder stimulators with 2 disk shaped platinum electrodes electrode diameter 2 5 mm glued to inflatable balloons of 20 Fr Foley catheters. The platinum contacts were connected with coated wires to an external standard laboratory stimulation device A M systems model 2100 . The balloon portion of the catheter was covered by a latex sheath to ease insertion through the urethra. During balloon inflation the sheath is pushed away by the enlargement of the balloon. This arrangement assured a safe non traumatic insertion of the catheter.

During the experiments the catheter was positioned so that the electrodes came into direct contact with the trigone good electrical contact was assessed by measuring conductance. When in contact with tissue the conductance ranged 10 1000 Kohm. Resistance of several ohms or less than 100 800 ohm may indicate shorting by urine. If the electrodes were in contact with urine the conductance dropped to a few ohms if the conductance indicated contact with urine the experiments were stopped and the catheter repositioned till a better location was found.

Three healthy female sheep were used in this study the stimulators were inserted by a direct visualization of the urethra with a laryngoscope no sedation was used. Stimulator insertion lasted less than five minutes immediately thereafter the stimulator was connected to a urine collection bag that was kept below the level of the bladder of the animal to ensure full emptying of the bladder at all times. During the experiment that typically lasted a few hours the animals were not allowed to drink or eat. This was done in order to reduce the variability of renal function associated with oral fluid or meal intake.

Urine collection periods were between 30 minutes and one hour. Stimulation was commenced when stable urine production was obtained. Average urine flow was calculated by dividing the volume collected urine by collection time. GFR was analyzed from the following equation GFR Ucr Uvol Pcr where Ucr is the urine concentration of creatinine Uvol is collected urine volume and Pcr is the plasma concentration of creatinine. Sodium excretion rate was calculated from multiplication of urine sodium concentration by the average urine flow.

FIGS. A B show that Urine flow GFR and sodium excretion increase if any following stimulation with the stimulator in healthy sheep in the trigone FIGS. A A and in the ventral wall of the bladder FIG. B B . vs control collections p

All stimulations started after a steady baseline in urine flow was reached. Stimulation of the trigone increased urine flow by 33 30 p 0.01 n 16 GFR by 25 25 p 0.001 n 15 and sodium excretion by 52 32 p

Non direction selective electrical stimulation of the bladder was examined in two experiments. The intravesical stimulator used in these experiments consisted of a specially designed bladder stimulator with 6 disk shaped platinum electrodes glued to an inflatable balloon of a 20 Fr Foley catheter and distributed evenly on the full circumference of the balloon 2 cm from the lower part of the balloon e.g. for stimulating both the trigone areas and other areas . Experimental protocol was similar as described above.
