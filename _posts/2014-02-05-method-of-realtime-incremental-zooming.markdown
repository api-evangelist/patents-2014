This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10 768 432. The subject matter of each of these applications is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.

The present invention is directed to user interfaces and more particularly to a method of navigation and interaction with a user interface. Such interaction and navigation involve operating an input device such as a mouse a trackball or a three dimensional hereinafter 3D pointing remote device. The operation of the input device includes at least one of point click scroll etc.

User interfaces such as graphical user interfaces GUIs are well known. Virtually all computers include or enable a graphical user interface in order to make the interaction with the computer more user friendly . This is accomplished by reducing if not eliminating the number of keystrokes a user is required to enter in order to perform a function such as launching an application residing on the computer. An increasing number of other electronic devices from cell phones to user controls on appliances rely on various graphical user interfaces that facilitate a user interaction with the particular device.

Traditional methods of using a GUI on a computer for example include the use of an input device such as a mouse or a track ball. A movement of the mouse or the track ball results in a corresponding pointer moving on the graphical user interface. The pointer can thus be navigated to an object represented by an icon on the GUI that corresponds to an executable task such as launching a software application for example. Once the pointer is navigated to an icon the corresponding task can be executed by clicking depressing on an actuating button that is integrated within the input device. For example if the icon on the GUI corresponds to a word processing application clicking on the icon results in launching the word processing application. The pointer can also be used to rapidly scroll through pages of text within a word processing document for example.

The input device can be used to perform various tasks depending on the application being executed on the computer. In a map software program generically referred to as location information program for example maps of a geographic area can be displayed. While displaying a map the actuating button of the pointer can be depressed on a particular area of the map to zoom in on the selected area to provide additional detail while displaying a smaller overall geographic area. The actuating button therefore can be used to zoom in on an area of interest.

Referring to a map of the United States is illustrated. Center point represents the center of bounding box which could also represent the user interface that includes map . User interface can represent a window corresponding to the map software program similar to a window that represents a work area of a document in a word processing program for example. The user can then request a more detailed view of a point of interest on the map such as New York City by moving the pointer to point of interest and depressing the actuating button. The points of interest displayed on a graphical user interface may be thought of as objects.

The zooming in on the point of interest i.e. New York in this example results in map of being included within user interface . As illustrated New York point of interest is now displayed in the center of user interface . Center point still representing center of the user interface but no longer representing center of map now coincides with point of interest . The point of interest and center point represent the same location on map .

Pointer previously pointing to the point of interest in however remains at the same physical location within the user interface but no longer points to the point of interest in . That is the relative distance of pointer with respect to the side and top of user interface in is identical to the relative distance of pointer with respect to the side and top of user interface in .

If a user now wishes to zoom in further on New York the user has to move the mouse until pointer points to the point of interest or center point prior to depressing the actuating button. The pointer location does not coincide with or is not synchronized to the point of interest when zooming occurs according to current implementations. If a user wishes to zoom in a few times to a number of zooming levels a cumulative delay factor is introduced into the process as the pointer has to be located and moved to the point of interest for each desired zooming level. The cumulative delay factor is a sum of delays each of which is associated with having to re centering the pointer after each zooming function.

Some embodiments provide a synchronization or coordination between the zooming function and the pointer location on a user interface.

Methods according to the present invention address these needs and others by providing a method for maintaining the position of pointer on a center of a graphical user interface

According to one exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method for navigating a pointer on a graphical user interface GUI includes the steps of scrolling an input device to locate the pointer corresponding to the input device on a point of interest within the GUI depressing an actuating button associated with the input device on the point of interest obtaining a detailed view of the point of interest while centering the point of interest on the GUI and maintaining a position of the pointer on the point of interest.

According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention a method of centering a pointer on a graphical user interface GUI includes navigating the pointer to a point of interest away from a center of the GUI actuating a mechanism for obtaining a magnified view of the point of interest computing a distance between a center of the GUI and a location of the point of interest generating a detailed view of the point of interest displaying the detailed view with the point of interest centered on the GUI and animating a movement of the pointer from the position away from the center of the GUI to the point of interest.

The following detailed description of the invention refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings identify the same or similar elements. Also the following detailed description does not limit the invention. Instead the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.

In exemplary embodiments incremental zooming may be utilized to coordinate pointer location with a point of interest on a user interface. Referring back to a user may navigate pointer to a point of interest and depresses the actuating button of an input device to obtain a more detailed view of point of interest . An incremental zooming may take place in a series of zooming levels from to a desired zooming level for the point of interest as illustrated in . The number of zooming levels may be two for example that is an intermediate zooming step may exist between user interface in and that of . Having two zooming levels is specified for exemplary purposes the number of zooming levels may be greater than two in preferred embodiments.

By navigating pointer and depressing actuating button at the point of interest on a user may identify the location for which a detailed view is desired. The detailed view may be obtained from pre stored information contained in the software program for example it may also be generated. The program may be stored in the computer in a computer medium such as a compact disc or accessible to the computer over a network such as the internet.

A distance between center and point of interest may be computed. A virtual line representing may be drawn between starting point and point of interest . The virtual line may represent the linear distance between points and of . An intermediate zooming level or step may be illustrated in . The center of user interface has now moved along the virtual line representing distance to approximately a midway point between center in and center of .

The center of the user interface remains fixed at one physical location on the interface as long as the size of the interface represented by the window remains constant the geographic point represented by the center may vary based on the zooming level. For example in center may represent some point in Nebraska while center of may represent some point in Ohio. The pointer designated by remains on the point of interest . The original location of pointer at point of interest in is also shown in to distinguish exemplary embodiments over existing implementation methods.

A detailed view desired by zooming in point of interest of is illustrated in . A second zooming level may be illustrated with respect to . Starting from the distance represented by line which is one half of the distance of between center and point of interest may be reduced to zero as center of coincides with point of interest . As with above pointer is now located over point of interest in . The location of pointer at point of interest in is also illustrated in to distinguish exemplary embodiments over existing implementation methods.

In some embodiments the intermediate zooming level the results of which are illustrated in may not be needed. That is the zooming can transition from to . Pointer would be positioned over point of interest after the transition. Other embodiments may include additional zooming levels additional to the two levels illustrated .

Centering the point of interest within user interface while zooming in may be achieved by combining the zooming function with a simultaneous panning function. Panning refers to translating the view in either the vertical horizontal dimensions. As a result of the panning process the point of interest coincides with center of the interface .

As the actuation button of the input device is depressed to achieve zooming the point of interest may move along the dotted distance line to center of the interface . A progress of the pointer s movement along this line may be illustrated in an animated manner. In preferred embodiments panning in order to make the point of interest coincide with center of user interface may be completed at the same time the desired zooming level is achieved. The amount of movement or displacement the point of interest undergoes for each zooming step may be computed. As described above center of the interface represents the point of interest as a result of this movement.

The final level of detail available for zooming in may be determined by a designer of the particular software program being used. For example a designer of a map software program might choose to facilitate zooming in to a block level or a street level etc. This may assist in determining the number of available zooming levels between a starting point of and ending point of for example. The number of available zooming levels may also determine how long it takes to get from the starting point to the ending point.

While the number of zooming levels illustrated is two and one intermediate frame is illustrated in this example a higher number of zooming levels will result in more intermediate frames being shown. If four levels are available in an embodiment then the number of intermediate frames may be three. That is a first intermediate frame may depict point being located between point of and point of a second intermediate frame may be identical to a third intermediate frame may depict point being located between point of and point of or B and a fourth frame may be identical to of B . If the number of available zoom levels is N then the number of intermediate frames may be N 1.

Exemplary methods may also facilitate zooming out from a point of interest. In zooming out the pointer may remain on the point of interest but the center may no longer coincide with the pointer. In for example if zooming out is indicated via the user input device a portion of the user interface may illustrate the Atlantic Ocean east of New York for which no data may be available. In this case the center may be moved westward while pointer remains on point of interest .

Each of the figures also shows a scale designated by and to depict what one unit may represent such as distance for example in the corresponding figure. In some embodiments a history of zooming levels that were illustrated frames may be maintained in order to enable a user to visit previous frames.

In some embodiments as described above the animation or transition between a starting point such as and the ending point may occur in a linear manner. That is if only one intermediate frame is shown the intermediate frame may be the midway point between the starting and ending points similarly if three intermediate frames are shown they may represent points that are one quarter of the way one half of the way and three quarters of the way between the starting point and the ending point as the intermediate frames.

In other embodiments the animation may take place at a different rate or at a varying rate . The first few intermediate frames may be shown slowly the next several intermediate frames may be shown at a faster rate and the last few intermediate frames may be shown slowly for example.

Exemplary embodiments may be implemented on a general purpose computer such as a desktop a laptop a pocket PC personal digital assistant PDA or other similar devices having the processing capacity. Methods described may be encoded on a computer readable medium as a series of executable instructions or on an application specific integrated chip ASIC .

Methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments as described above may be illustrated as process or flow charts and in respectively.

While the description has focused on zooming in on a map exemplary methods may be equally applicable in other scenarios such as in virtual tour programs i.e. real estate viewing for example and in gaming etc. The methods can also be used in menu selection within an entertainment pay per view environment. For example thumb nail images representing various movies available for viewing or on a pay per view basis may be displayed to a user on a display or screen. The user may utilize a 3D pointing device such as that developed by Hillcrest Laboratories Inc. of Rockville Md. to select one of the images. As a result of this selection more detailed information corresponding to the selected image may be displayed to the user. Input devices may also include a graphic tablet a tracking surface such as a track pad or a 3D pointing device.

The above described exemplary embodiments are intended to be illustrative in all respects rather than restrictive of the present invention. Thus the present invention is capable of many variations in detailed implementation that can be derived from the description contained herein by a person skilled in the art. All such variations and modifications are considered to be within the scope and spirit of the present invention as defined by the following claims. No element act or instruction used in the description of the present application should be construed as critical or essential to the invention unless explicitly described as such. Also as used herein the article a is intended to include one or more items.
