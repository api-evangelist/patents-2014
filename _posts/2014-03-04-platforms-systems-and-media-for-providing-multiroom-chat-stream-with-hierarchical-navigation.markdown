Chat involves communication over the Internet that offers a real time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. A chat room is a virtual space allowing chat between users who are in the same chat room. Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created which distinguishes chatting from other text based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email. In general chat rooms are to some extent organized around a particular type of user interest or topic and more users in a chat room will result in a livelier more interesting conversation.

Existing chat technologies suffer from shortcomings remedied by the subject matter disclosed herein. By way of example current chat technologies fail to adequately allow users to navigate a hierarchy of chat rooms to access more general topics or more specific sub topics. By way of further example current chat technologies do not allow efficient use of multiple chat rooms simultaneously and are not sufficiently location based. Moreover current chat technologies do not effectively manage the creation of new chat rooms or chat rooms with too few users to support an active discussion.

Advantages of the chat platforms systems media and methods described herein include but are not limited to providing a location based topical hierarchy of chat rooms that users may traverse to fine tune their chat conversations providing a chat stream allowing users to carry on many chat conversations simultaneously offering tools for creation of public and private chat rooms with a fine degree of user control and supplying options and suggestions to help users access lively engaging chat conversations at the desired level of topical specificity.

In still further embodiments if a topic does not exist in the topical hierarchy then users can create their own topics and assign tags to them. If the tags match a curated topic then they will appear as user created rooms in the topical hierarchy.

Many formats and data structures are suitable for topical hierarchies of chat rooms described herein. By way of example in some embodiments global chat is the root topic where if there are no users in any other topics below it all users will be put in global chat. By way of further example in some embodiments a topic represents any subject for example gaming and a topic contains one or more chat rooms. In further embodiments a room is a chat room where users can send messages to each other. In a particular embodiment a room is created when there is one user but it is not opened until two users are present. In general a room has a maximum number of users that is specific to each room however in a particular embodiment there is a global maximum default of 2000 users per chat room.

In some embodiments a hierarchy of chat topics includes featured topics curated by one or more editors. In some embodiments a topical hierarchy of chat rooms includes trending topics that are identified based on an algorithm.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a hierarchy of chat topics includes a global chat root topic. Subordinate to the global chat root topic are for example featured topics curated trending topics determined by algorithm and a navigable tree or graph of all topics. In this embodiment featured topics include a topic tagged games. Further in this embodiment the games topic includes a plurality of chat rooms including user generated chat rooms. Also in this embodiment all topics are arranged into tiers with progressively more specific topics subordinate to more general topics to form sub topics. In some embodiments the hierarchy is a graph and topics are optionally connected to topics in other branches at any level in the hierarchy.

In some embodiments a matchmaking service will dynamically open rooms when needed and suggest alternate rooms and or topics when there are low number of users or low activity by users or the user chooses to change rooms and or topics. In further embodiments the suggestion algorithm will traverse the topic graph and take in to consideration number of users and activity in its suggestions.

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include features to help users find chat rooms within the hierarchy of chat rooms about topics they re interested in. For example in some embodiments a user first picks a topic in a hierarchical tree structure of topics. Second if only one user wants to talk about a particular topic the technology reserves a seat for the user in a chat room about that topic. Third when a second user indicates an interest in discussing that topic the technology opens the chat room and notifies both users so they can enter the chat room and talk. In further embodiments while waiting for a second user the first user is placed in chat room at a higher level topic e.g. a more general topic so the user can find a conversation. By way of further example in a particular embodiment a user browses a topical hierarchy to a Games category and then to an Xbox sub category. If no other users are in an Xbox chat room but there are users in a Games chat room then the user is matched to a chat room about Games until a second or subsequent user enters the Xbox chat room at which point the first user is notified that the new populated Xbox chat room is available.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a user optionally chooses a topic from with a hierarchy described herein. In this embodiment a user chooses a first tier topic and a related but more specific second tier sub topic. If no chat rooms are available suitably populated and or active a new chat room is created and a seat in the new room is reserved for the user. The user participates in a process depicted in to find an alternative chat room to use while waiting for a second or subsequent user. If a chat room in the selected topic is available suitably populated and or active the user joins the room.

Referring to in a particular embodiment an alternative room is need due to user choice a low number of users or a low level of chat activity. In some cases another room in the same topic is available and is provided as an option to the user. In other cases another room in the same topic is not available and related topics are identified. In this embodiment the system or optionally the user searches the hierarchy of topics within one degree for suitable related topics. If suitable topics are identified the results are displayed to the user. If suitable topics are not identified the system or optionally the user searches the hierarchy of topics within two or more degrees until a suitable alternative room is identified.

Referring to in a particular embodiment a chat room achieves a maximum participant limit and the system automatically opens new rooms on the same or a related topic. Where the newly created rooms have available user capacity the matchmaking service distributes new users according to an algorithm that optionally weights more heavily toward filling rooms with a low number of current participants. In this embodiment a user selects a chat topic. If one or more chat rooms are available with user capacity remaining the user is placed in the chat room with the highest number of open user spaces. If no chat room is available on the selected topic a new chat room is created and a seat is reserved for the user in the new chat room. If and when a second or subsequent user requests to discuss the topic or enter the room all interested users are notified and invited to enter the room.

Referring to in a particular embodiment where a chat room has a low number of users and or low chat activity the matchmaking service assumes that public rooms with a low number of users and or chat activity is idle and attempts to suggest rooms with more activity. In this embodiment the user always has a choice to stay in their current chat room or go to a new chat room. For example a chat room currently has less than five users and less than one message sent per minute. The users in this chat room or a user attempting to enter the chat room is prompted to join a different room within the same topic. If the user accepts the prompt the user leaves the chat room and joins the new chat room. If the user declines the prompt the user stays in the original chat room.

In some embodiments the platforms systems media and methods described herein include features to allow users to share a web link that deep links to a particular chat room. See e.g. and . For example in some embodiments a user in a chat room talking about the 2014 Men s Slopestyle Olympics event can send out a link via SMS email Facebook and or Twitter via the standard mobile operating system controls. In a particular embodiment a receiving user that taps on the link and has the chat application described herein would automatically be linked in to the chat room in the app. In an alternative particular embodiment if the receiving user does not have the chat application described herein they would be directed to the appropriate app store download page.

The following illustrative examples are representative of embodiments of the software applications systems and methods described herein and are not meant to be limiting in any way.

A user employs a chat application as described herein that is implemented as a mobile application. The user downloads the chat application from an online application store and installs it on his smartphone. He accesses a mobile topical hierarchy of chat rooms and searches available public chat rooms discussing his current interest in the topic of popular television series. The generated search results in a wide range of topics including broad topics such as television program genre and broadcast stations to very specific topics such as particular television shows actors and episodes. The generated search results are arranged by hierarchically and after viewing the search results the user decides to join the Most Popular Television Programs chat room. He then decides to join other similar chat rooms and utilizes the navigation bar to launch a search for similar chat rooms. The search results are once again presented in topically hierarchical form. User then navigates up and down the generated list and also joins chat rooms discussing Big Bang Theory and Discovery Channel. 

The user of Example 1 determines that he is also interested entering a wholly different topic discussion such as the best bars and restaurants located in Austin Tex. He adds a new public room to his list of entered public chat rooms and searches for chat rooms dedicated to his interest in particular bars and restaurants. He sees a potential chat room titled BestBeerBars joins the room and writes a chat message however the chat room has no other users. Accordingly a notification prompts user to join a different room topic and in the meantime the app will reserve his seat in BestBeerBarAustin and notify him the chat room has sufficient number of users and is open to join. The user then finds a different chat room titled ScotchBars but later also later joins BestBeerBars when he is notified the opening of BestBeerBars chat room.

The user of Example 1 is also interested a wide range of chat room topics such as restaurants sports and music. As such he is active in 15 different public and private chat rooms. The user views a chat stream feature which gives him all the updated activity from the various entered chat rooms and allows him to monitor all of his chat room activity simultaneously without having to go into each individual chat room separately.
