Various embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.

In recent years mobile wireless communication devices have become popular and many individuals families and organizations use or own multiple mobile wireless communication devices. As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art there are many kinds of mobile wireless communication devices including for example smart phones tablets laptops mobile phones personal digital assistants and many others. These mobile wireless communication devices are capable of sending and receiving wireless radio frequency signals over one or more wireless communication networks such as cellular e.g. 2G 2.5G 3G 4G LTE LTE advanced etc. networks local area e.g. Wi Fi networks or other wireless communication networks.

A mobile wireless communication device hereinafter generally referred to simply as a device may need to be associated with a service account in order to allow a user or owner of the device herein referred to as a subscriber or user to use the device to communicate over a particular wireless communication network in a manner that is meaningful to the subscriber e.g. to access content or a service offered by a service provider . Moreover the device may need to be associated with one or more service plans that allow it to access services offered by a service provider. A service plan may in general allow for a quantity of communication or a time period of communication e.g. 100 MB of data per month 24 hours of network access 100 minutes of phone calls etc. . Some examples of services that may be offered by a service provider include the non mutually exclusive categories of voice services e.g. phone calls etc. messaging services e.g. text messages multimedia messages etc. data services e.g. Internet access etc. and hybrid services e.g. voice over IP VOIP video chat etc. . A service provider may be an operator of a wireless communication network or may be another entity such as a mobile virtual network operator MVNO a retail partner a mobile wireless communication device original equipment manufacturer OEM a mobile wireless communication device operating system OS provider or a third party service partner. There are many other examples of services service plans and service providers and the examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting.

It may also be desirable to associate more than one device with a particular service account. There are many potential benefits of associating multiple devices with a particular service account including for example simplifying billing for the service provider and for the subscriber and potentially reducing service costs for subscribers e.g. by sharing the particular service account among multiple devices. For example a husband and wife may want to establish a single service account for both of their smart phones. As another example a parent may want to establish a single service account for the several mobile phones used by family members. As another example an employer may want to establish a single service account for multiple smart phones used by one or more of its employees. As another example a person may want to establish a single service plan for multiple devices that the person uses such as for example one or more of a smart phone a tablet a laptop and an intermediate networking device that forwards traffic between a local area network and a wireless cellular network. There are many other examples of situations in which it might be desirable to associate multiple devices with a single service account hereinafter referred to as a master service account .

In addition to associating multiple devices with a master service account it may be desirable to share a service plan that is associated with the master service account among the multiple devices associated with the master service account. For example a parent might want to purchase a single service plan that is shared among all members of the family or an employer might want to purchase a single service plan that is shared among multiple employees.

Today subscribers who wish to share a service plan among multiple devices can only do so with several limitations. For example creating a master service account and sharing a service plan among multiple devices can require direct involvement of a service provider e.g. a service provider customer representative. The service provider associates each of the devices with a master service account and with a service plan and the associated devices then share the service plan. Often subscribers cannot add or delete devices from the master service account without assistance from the service provider. In order to make changes to the master account subscribers may need to call the service provider or may be required to log in to a web portal e.g. by logging into a website e.g. through a separate computing system. Another drawback is that although all of the devices associated with a master service account share a service plan there are no controls to prevent a particular device from hogging allocations provided by the service plan. Another drawback is that although some service providers today allow sharing of voice minutes or text message allocations they may not allow sharing of a data plan or they may limit sharing of a data plan. Yet another drawback is that today s shared service plans may not allow subscribers to associate different kinds of devices e.g. a tablet and a smart phone with a master service account. As a result of these drawbacks the utility of shared service plans available today is limited.

Disclosed herein are methods systems and apparatuses to enable subscribers of devices to view research select and customize service plans for one or more devices. Also disclosed herein are methods systems and apparatuses that allow subscribers to create and manage a group of two or more devices herein referred to as a device group without service provider involvement. After a subscriber has established a master service account the subscriber can create a device group by associating additional devices with the established master service account that is already associated with a master device or with a master user e.g. an administrator at an enterprise or another party who is not necessarily associated with a master device but who is associated with the master service account . Also disclosed are methods systems and apparatuses to enable subscribers to share service plans among multiple devices in the device group. Also disclosed are methods systems and apparatuses to enable subscribers to fully or partially assign a service plan from one device to another device in the device group. Also disclosed are methods systems and apparatuses to allow subscribers to monitor or manage the devices in a device group from one or more master devices in the device group. Managing includes adding deleting or modifying devices or properties of devices service plans service accounts etc. For example managing includes dictating or changing a usage limit on one or more services available to devices in the device group.

As used herein service activity is used to refer to any service usage or traffic usage that can be associated with for example an application a network communication end point such as an address uniform resource locator URL or other identifier with which the device is communicating a traffic content type a transaction where content or other material information or goods are transacted purchased reserved ordered or exchanged a download upload or file transfer email text short messaging service SMS IP multimedia system IMS or other messaging activity or usage VOIP services video services a device usage event that generates a billing event service usage associated with a bill by account activity also referred to as billing by account as described herein device location device service usage patterns device user interface UI discovery patterns content usage patterns or other characterizations of device usage or other categories of user or device activity that can be identified monitored recorded reported controlled or processed in accordance with a set of verifiable service control policies. As will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the embodiments described herein some embodiments identify various service activities for the purpose of decomposing overall service usage into finer sub categories of activities that can be verifiably monitored categorized cataloged reported controlled monetized and used for end user notification in a manner that results in superior optimization of the service capabilities for various levels of service cost or for various types of devices or groups. In some embodiments it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the terms service activity and service usage are associated with categorizing and possibly monitoring or controlling data traffic application usage communication with certain network end points or transactions and it will also be apparent that in some embodiments the term service activity is intended to include one or more of the broader aspects listed above. The term service usage can be used interchangeably with the term service activity and neither term is intended in general to exclude any aspect of the other. In some cases where the term service usage and or service activity is used more specific descriptors such as traffic usage application usage website usage and other service usage examples are also used to provide more specific examples or focus in on a particular element of the more encompassing term.

Next this document describes several embodiments that allow a subscriber to establish a master service account and to manage the service plans and devices associated with the master service account.

In some embodiments a subscriber can acquire a device and establish a master service account through the device user interface e.g. a touch screen or through for example a website. illustrates device equipped with service processor in accordance with some embodiments. Service processor is communicatively coupled to service controller through wireless network . Service controller is communicatively coupled to network elements that facilitate the provisioning of services to devices such as billing systems not shown . The functions and capabilities of service processor and service controller have been described in many other patent applications and patents including for example U.S. Pat. No. 8 023 425. One of the functions of service processor is to present information to a user of device through a user interface of device e.g. a touch screen display etc. not shown . In some embodiments service processor also collects information from a user through the user interface. In some embodiments service processor sends some or all of the collected information or a representation of some or all of the collected information over a control channel to service controller . In some embodiments the control channel is secured by an encryption protocol.

In some embodiments service controller is also communicatively coupled to service design center . In some embodiments service design center allows a service provider or a service provider partner entity through service provider third party interface to configure service plan and service plan bundle offerings for distribution to devices such as device . In some embodiments service design center allows a service provider or a service provider partner entity to configure the messages information and screens as illustrated by multiple figures provided herein.

When a subscriber selects the Account partition in illustrates a representative screen that may be displayed as a result according to some embodiments. The display prompts the subscriber for the password associated with the master service account so that the user can view information about the account. After the subscriber enters the password the subscriber selects OK. In some embodiments a password or other credential is required in order to establish a new account. In some embodiments a password or other credential is required to be entered in order to associate with an existing account. In some embodiments a password or credential is associated with a set of permission levels that determine what account information the subscriber user can enter and or modify for a new or existing account. In some embodiments a set of screens presented to the subscriber user are dependent on the type of credential and or password entered by the subscriber user during the account setup process. In some embodiments additional information is obtained from the subscriber user to be used for supplemental authentication. In some embodiments a set of security questions is presented to the user subscriber through one or more screens on device . In some embodiments answers to at least one of the set of security questions is used for supplemental authorization e.g. when accessing a service management system or a customer support system.

In the example of the payment method is a credit card and the subscriber selects a credit card type and enters information in various fields. The subscriber enters his or her name in the Name field the credit card number in the Card Number field the credit card s expiration date in the Expiration fields the credit card s security code in the Security Code field the subscriber s address in the Address field and a nickname for the credit card in the Payment Nickname field. In this example the subscriber can also choose to remove the credit card or use the credit card as the default payment method. The subscriber completes entry of the payment information by selecting Update. 

Although illustrated the configuration and management of a prepay account it should be noted that in some embodiments the subscriber may alternatively configure the master service account to be a post pay account. In some embodiments the subscriber configures the master service account to be a post pay account and is billed later for services. In some embodiments the subscriber does not have to enter payment information to set up a post pay account. In some embodiments the service provider bills the subscriber with a post pay account at a regular interval e.g. monthly . In some embodiments the service provider bills the subscriber after the subscriber has accumulated a particular amount of charges e.g. after the subscriber has accumulated 5 of charges .

Having used one device hereinafter referred to as the master device Jeff Master in to establish a master service account and configure payment options including a payment source and if desired an automated top up of master service account funds in some embodiments the subscriber is able to add other devices hereinafter referred to as child devices or secondary devices to the master service account and create a device group. It should be noted that the designation of the device used to set up the master service account as a master device is for illustrative purposes. As will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art in light of this disclosure once a master service account has been established the capabilities of and permissions granted to the devices associated with that master account can be modified. Thus a device that was originally a master device can be made a child device and a device that was originally a child device can be promoted to a master device. The use of the terms master and child herein is merely to improve readability. As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art whether a device is a master or a child is dependent on the capabilities of and permissions granted by a subscriber to that device.

In accordance with some embodiments illustrates a representative display that may be presented when the subscriber selects Next in . The child device presents information that enables the subscriber to link i.e. pair associate etc. the child device with the master device and to add the child device to the master service account. In some embodiments such as the example shown in the information is displayed on the child device s user interface. In some embodiments the information is included in a text message or an e mail message received by the child device by the master device or by the subscriber. In some embodiments for security purposes the provided information expires after a particular time period and the display provides a countdown timer to indicate much time remains for the subscriber to complete the linking procedure. In some embodiments there is no countdown timer. In some embodiments the information that allows the subscriber to link the child device to the master service account is a bar code a quick response QR code or a sequence of alphanumeric characters e.g. a password . In some embodiments the information is an instruction for the subscriber to perform some type of action such as holding the child device in proximity to the master device to allow the information transfer from the child device to the master device. There are many ways the information can be transferred including for example infrared beaming Bluetooth exchange and text message exchange. As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art there are many types and forms of information that can enable the linking of the child device to the master device and to the master service account and the examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting.

In addition to establishing multiple master devices and permissions associated with each master device the subscriber can establish permission privileges for added e.g. child devices. illustrates a representative screen displaying an example of permission privileges the subscriber can grant to a child device in accordance with some embodiments. In some embodiments a subscriber grants full control to an added device. In some embodiments a device with full control can manage the master service account add or remove devices from the master service account and purchase service plans. In some embodiments a device with full control has the capabilities of a master device. In some embodiments a subscriber grants an added device the ability to purchase service plans but not the ability to configure or manage the master service account or the devices in the device group. In some embodiments a subscriber grants no privileges to an added device. In some embodiments a user of a device with no privileges cannot purchase service plans or view or manage the master service account.

Having added another device to the master service account the subscriber can manage all devices in the device group and can share one or more service plans among devices in the device group. The subscriber can also assign a service plan from a master device to a child device. In some embodiments service plans are designed to be shareable assignable see below or not shareable. In some embodiments service plans are designed using a service design center e.g. service design center illustrated in and the sharing properties are entered through the service design center. In some embodiments a service plan has an attribute that determines whether it is shareable. In some embodiments service plans that are shareable are automatically shared when devices are added to the master service account. In some embodiments service plans that are shareable are not automatically shared when devices are added to the master service account.

In some embodiments the subscriber can view information about shared service plans and can share service plans by selecting Plans Sharing from the screen shown in . illustrate that before sharing the Starter Plan all of the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan is allocated to the master device Jeff Master and that none of the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan is allocated to the child device that is now also associated with the master service account. In some embodiments selecting the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan in screen shown in launches screen shown in . By selecting Share this plan from screen illustrated in the subscriber can share the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan with another device.

Rather than simply sharing a service plan among multiple devices which may not prevent hogging of the allocation provided by the service plan by individual devices it may be desirable to allocate discrete portions of a service plan to different devices within the device group. For example a parent who has purchased a service plan that includes 500 voice minutes and 100 text messages per month might want to allocate 100 of the voice minutes and 40 text messages to each of her two children s mobile phones. illustrates a representative screen for Advanced service plan sharing in accordance with some embodiments. As shown in the subscriber can make less than all of the shared service plan available to devices in the device group. In the master device is allowed to use the entire service plan allocation whereas the child device is not allowed to use any of the service plan allocation. In the representative screen illustrated in however the subscriber has enabled the child device to use up to fifty percent of the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan allocation. The master device is still allowed to use up to all of the 250 Minutes of Talk service plan allocation however. Thus the master device may still hog the service plan s allocation but the subscriber has ensured that the child device cannot use more than half of the service plan s allocation.

As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art there are many ways a service plan could be shared among devices. For example the subscriber could allocate a certain percentage or amount e.g. number of minutes number of texts number of bytes etc. of a service plan to each device associated with the master service account such that the sum of all individual allocations is equal to the total allowed by the service plan. As would also be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art the subscriber may choose to share different service plans differently among devices in the device group. Similarly when the subscriber has purchased a service plan bundle such as Starter Plan the subscriber may choose to share constituent service plans of the service plan bundle differently e.g. a parent may choose to share 80 of the text messages but only 50 of the voice minutes with a child or she may choose to share all service plans included in a service plan bundle in the same way e.g. a parent may allow a child to use up to 50 of each service plan included in the service plan bundle. 

In some embodiments the subscriber chooses to place limits on a service usage amount e.g. impose a cap or specify an allocation that can be consumed by a particular device in the device group e.g. by entering a specific service usage limit using the master device or by using another device and providing a credential that indicates that the subscriber has permission to set service usage limits. By providing a limit for a service usage amount the subscriber can prevent the particular device from hogging the service plan. In some embodiments the particular device that is limited is the master device. In some embodiments the particular device that is limited is a child device in a device group shared with the master device i.e. of which the master device is also a member . In some embodiments the particular device is another device in a device group shared with the master device. In some embodiments the particular device is a device managed by a system administrator.

In some embodiments the subscriber specifies a micro lease allocation wherein a device master or child is provided an allocation of service usage and the device subsequently requests an additional allocation after the initial allocation is exhausted.

In some embodiments the master device monitors usage by devices in the device group and changes one or more plan sharing parameters based on the monitored usage. In some embodiments the master device revokes an allocation when the master device determines that the allocation is not being used or when the master device determines that another device has a greater need for the allocation. In some embodiments the master device changes an allocation i.e. increases or decreases an allocation based on a metric. In some embodiments the metric is an amount of usage or a failure to use a service plan during a time period. In some embodiments the metric is an expected usage during a time period. In some embodiments the metric is based on service plan usage by one or more other devices in the device group. In some embodiments the master device reapportions a service plan or an allocation of a service plan to one or more devices based on a determination that the reapportionment will reduce waste of the service plan.

In some embodiments the subscriber specifies one or more parameters to assist the master device in managing plan sharing. In some embodiments the master device manages plan sharing without subscriber involvement.

In some embodiments the subscriber allocates a maximum amount of a service plan for a period of time and establishes a metering of the total during a sequence of time periods e.g. a total of 100 text messages during a month and no more than 25 text messages per week . In some embodiments the subscriber allocates an initial allocation to a child device and then allocates an additional allocation e.g. a smaller allocation when the child device exhausts the initial allocation.

In the examples provided herein none of the Starter Plan service plan bundle had been consumed when the subscriber shared the service plan bundle with another device. In some embodiments had a portion of the service plan bundle been consumed prior to sharing the subscriber would only be able to share what service usage allocation remained of the service plan bundle. In some embodiments each service plan within a service plan bundle can be shared individually.

In some embodiments a subscriber may want to allocate the entirety of a service plan to a child device leaving none of the service plan available to the master device. For example a parent might purchase a service plan that is of great interest to her child but of no interest to the parent. In some embodiments therefore a subscriber may assign a service plan from one device in the device group to another device in the device group. In some embodiments a service plan must be assignable to be assigned. In some embodiments whether a service plan is assignable is configured using a service design center. In some embodiments a service plan has an attribute that determines whether it is assignable. In some embodiments a service plan is assignable but not shareable. In some embodiments a service plan is shareable but not assignable. In some embodiments a service plan is both shareable and assignable. In some embodiments a service plan is neither shareable nor assignable. In some embodiments one or more permission policies that can apply to a shared service plan can also apply to an assigned service plan.

As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art there are many different examples combinations and permutations of shared service usage displays and the examples presented herein are meant to be illustrative and not intended to be limiting.

Although indicates that in some embodiments the entirety of a service plan is assigned to a single device i.e. either Jeff Master or Jeff Child in some embodiments a subscriber can assign a single service plan to more than one device. For example a subscriber who has two children each of whom has a device can assign iStoryBooks to both children s devices. The children would then share the service plan. In some embodiments when a subscriber assigns a service plan to multiple devices the subscriber specifies how the service plan will be shared by the multiple devices e.g. using the terminology of in a Simple or Advanced manner .

As will be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art in light of the disclosures herein a difference between a subscriber assigning a service plan to one or more devices and the subscriber sharing the service plan is that in some embodiments a shared service plan remains visible on the master device as a service plan that is available to the master device whereas an assigned service plan does not remain visible on the master device as a service plan that is available to the master device.

It should now be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the art that there are many unique and interesting ways that a subscriber can share and assign service plans and the examples herein are not intended to be limiting.

In addition to adding devices to the master service account sharing service plans and assigning service plans subscribers may track usage and access usage history by selecting Usage from the display shown in . For example illustrates a representative screen showing that a subscriber may access child device usage in this case usage by Jeff Child through the child device. shows that the child device has used only one minute of the 20 hours of application use and none of the iStoryBooks service plan.

The subscriber may track usage for all devices or for just the master device from the master device by selecting Usage from the screen illustrated in . For example illustrate representative screens and showing usage for the categories of voice and data respectively. According to all 250 Minutes of Talk remain available.

In addition to viewing information about service usage in some embodiments the subscriber can access information about transactions. illustrates a representative screen of information available to a subscriber who selects Transactions and Balance from the screen illustrated in . In the transactions from the month of June 2012 are presented. They included a user initiated top up and two service plan purchases Starter Plan and iStoryBooks . As shown in following these transactions the subscriber s master account has a balance of 93.56.

In some embodiments a child device sends a message to a master device when a usage allocation is exhausted e.g. when the child device has exhausted its share of a service plan or when a particular milestone is met e.g. when the child device has only two minutes of talk time left . In some embodiments the child device sends a message to a master device and the master device presents a notification to the subscriber to provide information about the service usage event on the child device. In some embodiments the master device suggests a solution to the service usage event such as by presenting an offer to the subscriber such as an offer to purchase an additional service plan or an offer to assist the subscriber in modifying the parameters of a shared service plan.

In some embodiments a child device sends a message to a master device when a user of the child device has attempted an unauthorized service usage. For example in some embodiments if a user of a child device attempts to send a text message but the child device does not have an allocation of text messages the child device sends a message to the master device to report that the child device attempted to send a text message. In some embodiments the child device sends a message about an attempted unauthorized service usage to the master device without interaction with or input from a user of the child device. In some embodiments the master device presents an offer to the subscriber such as an offer to purchase an additional service plan or an offer to assist the subscriber in modifying the parameters of a shared service plan.

In some embodiments the child device presents a notification through its user interface when a user of the child device attempts an unauthorized service usage. In some embodiments a user of a child device subject to an allocation e.g. a maximum number of text messages who exhausts the allocation can send a message to one or more master devices to request an additional allocation. In some embodiments the child device assists a user of the child device in requesting a service plan or additional resources from the subscriber.

In some embodiments a subscriber can access the master service account from a device that is not a master device but is associated with the master service account by logging into the master service account e.g. through a screen such as the representative screen illustrated in . This functionality may be useful for when a master device is not immediately accessible but the subscriber wishes to share a service plan modify service plan sharing for one or more service plans or assign a service plan.

In some embodiments a subscriber can give as a gift a service plan or a portion of a service plan to a device that is not within the device group but that is capable of receiving the gift. For example in some embodiments a subscriber can give a service plan or a portion of a service plan to a device outside a first device group but within a second device group.

In some embodiments a user of child device with no purchase capability can from the child device request that the master device grant the child device access to a service. For example in some embodiments when a user of a child device attempts to use or access a service that is not authorized the child device will present a notification that indicates the child device is not authorized for the service. In some embodiments the notification facilitates the child device requesting access from the master device e.g. the notification includes a button called Request Access From Master . In some embodiments the master device receives the request and presents a notification through the master device s user interface thus allowing the subscriber to grant or deny access to the requested service. In some embodiments the master device sends a message to the child device indicating whether the request was granted or denied. In some embodiments after receiving the message from the master device the child device presents a notification through a user interface to indicate whether the request was granted or denied.

In some embodiments the master device subscriber initiates the linking process. In some embodiments the master device subscriber e.g. via a Device Agent A requests a one time token from Sign Up Request Processor labeled A in . At B Sign Up Request Processor verifies with Subscriber Management System that the subscriber associated with Master Device A has permission to add additional devices to the master service account device group or multi device service plan e.g. by verifying a username and or password credential etc. . At C Sign Up Request Processor generates a one time token associates it with the master subscriber e.g. device credential user credential account credential etc. stores the token and the credential in database labeled DB and then at D delivers the token to the master subscriber via Device Agent A . At E the master device subscriber shares the one time token with the intended secondary device subscriber e.g. via email SMS MMS an image that can be scanned e.g. bar code QR Code etc. sound file NFC bump Bluetooth message etc. . The secondary device subscriber enters the one time token via the Device Agent on Secondary Device B. There are many ways the secondary device subscriber can enter the one time token e.g. by scanning an image sending or receiving or opening an email attachment sending or receiving or opening an SMS sending or receiving or opening an MMS attachment sending or receiving or opening a sound file through a near field communication NFC through a bump with another device e.g. Master Device A using a Bluetooth message etc. In some embodiments the master device subscriber shares the token with Secondary Device B by displaying an image that can be scanned on its screen and Secondary Device B s Device Agent B scans the image e.g. with a built in camera and scanning software . In some embodiments Master Device A s Device Agent A displays a PIN code on Master Device A and the secondary device subscriber enters that PIN code into Secondary Device B via Device Agent B. In other embodiments Master Device A shares the token with Secondary Device B via a Bluetooth link a near field communication NFC a bump or any other type of communication that allows devices in relatively close proximity to communicate with each other.

At F Device Agent B sends the entered token information plus its e.g. device user etc. credential e.g. 2nd credential shown in from Secondary Device B to Sign Up Request Processor . At G Sign Up Request Processor looks up the token in database and obtains the master device credential e.g. 1st credential shown in . At H Sign Up Request Processor sends the master device credential the secondary device credential and a request to join Secondary Device B to the master service account device group or multi device service plan to Subscriber Management System . Subscriber Management System de provisions if necessary Secondary Device B from its current plan and at I adds Secondary Device B as a subscriber onto the master service account device group or multi device service plan e.g. for voice text and data . De provisioning Secondary Device B from its current plan is not shown explicitly in but de provisioning can occur in some embodiments before adding Secondary Device B to the intended master service account device group or multi device service plan. At J Subscriber Management System provisions the network elements to recognize that Secondary Device B is now associated with the master service account device group or multi device service plan. At K the Master device subscriber and secondary device subscribers both receive a notification that Secondary Device B is associated with the master service account device group or multi device service plan. Optionally in some embodiments the network system or the master device subscriber can assign usage quotas to Secondary Device B.

In some embodiments Sign Up Request Processor does not send the token back to Master Device A but instead sends it directly to Secondary Device B to enable the secondary device subscriber to accept the invitation to be added to the shared plan. In this embodiment when the secondary device subscriber accepts the invitation the token is sent back to Sign Up Request Processor as described above and the provisioning process occurs.

In some embodiments the master device subscriber initiates the share request from a website. In this embodiment the process is similar to the process where the share request is initiated from Master Device A. In this embodiment the master device subscriber logs into a secure website or portal and enters the necessary information to initiate the sharing request e.g. his account number user credential device credential etc. and the request is then processed in the same manner as if the request originated from Master Device A.

In some embodiments the token is a PIN and the PIN is delivered out of band to the secondary device subscriber e.g. via SMS email message etc. . In some embodiments the secondary device subscriber calls an Interactive Voice Recognition IVR system and enters the PIN. The IVR obtains the PIN e.g. through DTMF tones or through voice to text processing and delivers it to Sign Up Request Processor . From there the process continues as if the request were handled by Device Agent B on Secondary Device B.

In some embodiments the token is a PIN and the PIN is delivered out of band to the secondary device subscriber e.g. via SMS email message etc. . In some embodiments an IVR system automatically calls the secondary device subscriber at a phone number specified by the Master device subscriber in the share request or on the secondary device itself etc. . The secondary device subscriber then enters the PIN e.g. using DTM voice to text processing on the IVR and the IVR delivers the PIN to Sign Up Request Processor . From there the process continues as if the request were handled by Device Agent B on Secondary Device B.

In some embodiments Master Device A is a first device that has a master device credential provisioned into a network access service permission system by Subscriber Management System to provide for Master Device A to access network services in accordance with a multi device service plan and Secondary Device B is a second device that has a secondary device credential provisioned into the network access service permission system by Subscriber Management System to provide for secondary device access network services in accordance with a multi device service plan.

In some embodiments the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system before the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system. In some embodiments the secondary device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system before the master device credential is provisioned into the network access service permission system. In some embodiments the secondary device credential and the master device credential are provisioned at the same time into the network access service permission system.

In some embodiments Sign Up Request Processor is located in the carrier network. In some embodiments Sign Up Request Processor is located in a third party provider network e.g. device OEM VSP MVNO device OS provider Voice over IP VoIP provider etc. .

Optionally in some embodiments a network element e.g. Provisioning or Policy Management or the master device subscriber can assign usage quotas to Secondary Device B.

In some embodiments prior to sending the add request to Subscriber Management System at D Sign Up Request Processor may send a validation request to Secondary Device B via Device Agent B or the secondary device subscriber to confirm the change and wait for the response before performing the add action. In some embodiments the request is an SMS a call from an IVR system an email a notification on Secondary Device B via Device Agent B etc.

In some embodiments the master device subscriber adds Secondary Device B to the master device subscriber s shared plan prior to Secondary Device B being activated. In some embodiments the master device subscriber adds Secondary Device B to the master device subscriber s shared plan at the time that Secondary Device B is being provisioned or activated.

In some embodiments where Secondary Device B is added to the master service account device group or multi device service plan prior or during the activation process Sign Up Request Processor delivers a notification to the secondary device subscriber indicating that the device has been associated with the master service account device group or multi device service plan. In some embodiments the notification is delivered to Device Agent B for presentation through a user interface of Secondary Device B. In some embodiments the notification is delivered as an SMS MMS voice message either live or IVR or email. In some embodiments the notification requires the secondary device subscriber to acknowledge the notification prior to associating Secondary Device B with the master service account device group or multi device service plan. In some embodiments the secondary device subscriber is automatically associated with the master service account device group or multi device service plan without the secondary device subscriber having to confirm the notification.

In some embodiments Sign Up Request Processor is located in the carrier network. In other embodiments it is located in a third party provider network e.g. device OEM VSP MVNO device OS provider VoIP provider etc. .

In some embodiments in which a service plan is shared the master device subscriber may wish to only share a portion of the total service plan with a secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments the sharing process includes a step where the master device subscriber defines what portion or portions of the service plan voice service plan messaging service plan data access service plan etc. are to be shared with the secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments the portions represent a set of services less than all of the services offered by the service plan to be shared. In some embodiments the portions are represented by imitations expressed in voice minutes long distance minutes international calling destinations international calling minutes number of text messages number of MMS messages access to specific data services e.g. website domain content type e.g. streaming audio streaming video VoIP etc. quality of service QoS rated services protocol type general data access in time or usage e.g. megabytes kilobytes etc. application usage content downloads content uploads 3G access 4G access Wi Fi access etc. time periods e.g. days of the week specific hours in a day or total hours in a day total hours in a week total days in a month etc. or other units that are applicable to the shared portion of the service plan. In some embodiments the portions can be expressed as percentage of the service plans service usage allowance for a category of service e.g. 5 of the voice minute allowance 20 of the data allowance etc. or absolute values e.g. 20 minutes of voice 100 messages 5 MB of data 5 hours of data use 1 hour of VoIP calling 30 minutes of media streaming etc. . In some embodiments the sharing limits are set up with the initial offer to share. In some embodiments the sharing limits are set up after the plan has been shared with Secondary Device B. In some embodiments in which sharing limits are set up with the initial offer to share the sharing attributes may be stored in database and associated with the sharing token. When the secondary device subscriber is provisioned onto the sharing plan the sharing attributes are also communicated to Subscriber Management System along with the add request.

In some embodiments the master device subscriber may purchase an add on service plan for the secondary device subscriber and allocate e.g. assign the entire add on service plan to the secondary device subscriber e.g. the secondary device subscriber gets an add on service plan that provides additional service usage quota for a service that the secondary device subscriber uses more frequently than other users e.g. an application specific e.g. Facebook email etc. service plan an additional allocation of voice minutes or text messages etc. . In some embodiments the master device subscriber adds certain capabilities that might be offered at a discount to certain users so that those users do not consume the quotas of the shared service plan while using these activities. For example a master device subscriber might share a non streaming data plan with a secondary device subscriber but the secondary device subscriber desires to stream data e.g. by watching a video listening to streaming audio video conferencing etc. . The master device subscriber may purchase an audio video streaming capable service plan and assign that service plan to Secondary Device B but not to other devices. This allows the secondary device subscriber to stream data without the master device subscriber having to purchase a larger streaming capable plan.

In some embodiments in which a service plan is shared the master device subscriber may wish to set curfews e.g. no messaging between 10 00 PM and 6 00 AM email data access only during school hours no voice calls except certain numbers during the school day e.g. numbers on a whitelist no international long distance calls etc. associated with Secondary Device B which may be a child device as part of the sharing process. In some embodiments these curfews provide limits on usage of certain aspects of the shared portion of the service plan and thus provide for further control of service plan sharing. In some embodiments the service plan sharing process includes a step where the master device subscriber defines the curfews on the portion or portions of a service plan voice service plan messaging service plan data access service plan etc. that are to be shared with Secondary Device B. The curfews can be expressed as limits on certain aspects of the service plan during certain time periods e.g. no text messaging from 10 00 PM until 6 00 AM Monday Friday only allow voice calls to a certain set of numbers during school hours no Hulu videos after 8 00 PM etc. maximum usage of an aspect of a service plan during a time period e.g. maximum of 30 minutes of voice calling per day on weekdays maximum of 20 MB of Facebook during school hours no text messaging on Mondays etc. . In some embodiments the curfews restrict certain types of access during a specified interval. In some embodiments the curfews limit certain types of access during a specified interval. In some embodiments the curfews are set up with the initial offer to share. In some embodiments the curfews are set up after the secondary device subscriber has been joined to a shared service plan. In some embodiments in which the curfews are set up with the initial offer to share the curfew attributes are stored in database and associated with the sharing token. When the secondary device subscriber is provisioned onto a shared service plan the curfew attributes are communicated to Subscriber Management System along with the add request. In some embodiments curfews are combined with sharing limits e.g. 100 MB of data usage during the service plan cycle and no data usage allowed during school hours etc. .

In some embodiments a user may want to set quotas curfews or limitations on his own service usage. One motivation for doing this may be cost related e.g. a user wants to ensure a service plan allowance is not exhausted before the end of the service plan cycle a user wants to prevent overages a user s company subsidizes only a certain percentage of service plan usage and the user does not want to exhaust his portion of the allowance etc. but there may be other reasons. In some embodiments the notification enables the secondary subscriber to request additional service from the master subscriber when the notification is triggered. In some embodiments the notification enables an automatic purchase or re purchase of a specified service plan. In some embodiments the automatic purchase of a service plan also delivers a notification to the master subscriber. In some embodiments the notification that is delivered to the master subscriber is delivered via email SMS MMS a message on Master Device A e.g. through Device Agent A a message on a portal or a message on a website. In some embodiments the user interacts with Device Agent A on his device to set the desired service controls. Device Agent A communicates the service limits to Subscriber Management System either directly or via an intermediate element and Subscriber Management System provisions the controls to the appropriate enforcement elements. In some embodiments the control elements are network elements e.g. policy controller policy charging and rules function PCRF policy charging enforcement function PCEF etc. . In some embodiments the control elements are device based agents elements. In some embodiments the control agents elements exist both in the network and on the device.

In some embodiments the master device subscriber may desire to set up notifications for secondary users to alert them when they are reaching plan allowances their individual quota allowances plan time elapsed or remaining usage velocity e.g. rate of service usage etc. In these types of embodiments the master device subscriber can from his device or from an alternative device e.g. a Secondary Device B another device associated with the master service account device group or multi device service plan a website visited from a computer or tablet etc. set up these notifications. In some embodiments the notifications can also include actions or offers to modify an aspect of service usage e.g. turn off or block certain services because an allocated quota is running out or because a service is expensive while roaming etc. . In other embodiments the notifications can include an action to also inform the master device subscriber of a secondary device subscriber s activity within the service. In some embodiments this alert to the master device subscriber can also include a request from the secondary device subscriber to increase the secondary device subscriber s quota allocation to purchase additional service and assign an additional allocation to the secondary device subscriber to re allocate other users quotas on the service to this particular secondary subscriber etc. In some embodiments these notifications can be initiated because a particular secondary user is not using much of his allocated quota and the notification is sent to the master device subscriber to inform the master device subscriber of the condition and allow the master device subscriber to reallocate the quota as the master device subscriber deems appropriate e.g. the subscriber may give more service allocation to a different user including himself since the particular secondary device subscriber is not going to use his allocation based on current usage velocity e.g. the average rate of data consumption over a period of time e.g. one hour one day one week etc. trends .

In some embodiments the master device subscriber uses an application e.g. application locally on Master Device A a website from a computer an application on Secondary Device B etc. to configure the notifications. In some embodiments the master device subscriber enters a login credential an account number a phone number etc. to identify him as someone who is authorized to make changes to the account. Once logged in the master device subscriber interacts with the application to set up the desired notifications for the specific secondary device subscriber or users . In some embodiments the notifications are configured to be the same for all secondary device subscribers. In some embodiments the notifications are specific to each secondary device subscriber. In some embodiments the notifications are specific to a subset of secondary device subscribers. For example in an enterprise scenario there may be groups of users based on their position or function within the enterprise e.g. sales executive field service etc. . Each group of users may have different sets on notifications configured by the master device subscriber because each group of users may have different aspects of a service plan shared with them. For example a sales group and a field service group may have a larger allocation of service usage for maps and navigation services and there could be notifications for service usage within that particular allocation for those groups so they know if they are running out of that type of service. In a family share scenario the children might have limited access to a social networking application during school hours e.g. 10 MB 30 minutes etc. and the master device subscriber sets a notification to notify the child when she is reaching her daily limit. In some embodiments the notification that is configured is delivered to the specific user of the service e.g. the child etc. . In some embodiments the notification is delivered to the master device subscriber. In some embodiments the notification is delivered to both the master device subscriber and the specific user of the service. Once the notifications are configured they are sent to Subscriber Management System . Subscriber Management System provisions the notification type parameters text actions etc. to the various elements that are responsible for implementing the notification policy. In some embodiments the elements are network based elements e.g. OCS PCRF PCEF notification element etc. . In some embodiments the elements are device based agents e.g. agents for local usage counting local classification and policy management local notification agent etc. . In some embodiments the elements are located in both the network and the device e.g. accounting and policy control in the network notification agent on the device etc. . Once the elements are provisioned the notification policy is associated with the appropriate subscribers e.g. the one or more secondary device subscribers and enabled when the subscriber is actively using the services.

As discussed previously in some embodiments the notification is actionable by either the secondary device subscriber or the master device subscriber. For example in an enterprise scenario when the user is reaching the limit of an enterprise paid service the notification can include an option for the secondary device subscriber to purchase additional service just for him e.g. not shared with other users . In some embodiments the notification action is to alert the master device subscriber so he can take action e.g. purchase additional shared service purchase service just for that user reallocate usage quotas etc. . In some embodiments the notification to the master device subscriber includes an option to purchase additional service. In some embodiments the additional service includes shared service e.g. additional usage for all subscribers on the shared account . In some embodiments the additional service is specifically for the subscriber whose usage profile generated the notification. In some embodiments the additional service is for a specific subset of subscribers on the shared service plan. In some embodiments the master device subscriber has the option to decline the additional service offer. In some embodiments the action taken by the master device subscriber e.g. additional service purchased no additional service purchased etc. is communicated to the secondary Device subscriber. In some embodiments the communication is via email SMS MMS a message delivered to Device Agent B on Secondary Device B a message displayed on a portal or a message displayed on a website.

In some embodiments the system is configured to detect when Device Agent B on Secondary Device B has been tampered with. In some embodiments tampering includes removal of Device Agent B modification of Device Agent B or modification of the configuration data used by Device Agent B. In some embodiments this is achieved by detecting that Device Agent B on Secondary Device B has not sent a heartbeat message e.g. a message configured to inform a network element that the device agent is present and operating properly where such messages are possibly sent periodically or upon request by the network element to Sign Up Request Processor or other monitoring network element or to Device Agent A on Master Device A in the configured time interval. In some embodiments the detection is achieved by inspecting traffic to or from Secondary Device B and determining if the inspected traffic conforms to the controls that are expected to be enforced e.g. whether there is data usage when data curfews are in place whether there is a voice call to a non whitelisted number when a voice curfew is in place etc. . In some embodiments detecting tampering is achieved by verifying a credential of Device Agent B a software signing key a software hash a software configuration integrity a software configuration hash an operating system OS credential an OS software hash or an OS signing key. In some embodiments the detection occurs on Secondary Device B. In some embodiments the detection occurs on Master Device A. In some embodiments the detection occurs in the network. In some embodiments the detection is performed by two or more elements e.g. missing heartbeat message between Secondary Device B and a network element . In some embodiments when it has been detected that tampering has occurred on Secondary Device B a notification is sent to the master device user. In some embodiments the notification is delivered directly to Master Device A via for example SMS Device Agent B notification email or IVR phone call. In some embodiments the notification also includes an alert sound to bring immediate attention to the notification. In some embodiments the notification is displayed on top of all other UI elements on the master device. In some embodiments the notification is delivered to other account entities in addition to the master device subscriber or Master Device A. In some embodiments the notification is delivered to multiple account entities.

It is sometimes desirable that a common application programming interface API be implemented to simplify or eliminate the details of what has to happen in one or more carrier networks and to establish a finite set of pre specified API commands to support a common multi device service plan assignment system that works with a plurality of third party on device multi device service plan sharing and assignment solutions. In some embodiments the pre specified API commands include such actions as activate a device onto a shared plan add a device to a master service account device group or multi device service plan remove a device from a master service account device group or multi device service plan manage quotas for devices on a shared plan manage notifications for devices on a shared plan or assign specific plans to certain devices on a shared plan. As would be appreciated by a person having ordinary skill in the art there are many types actions that can be defined and the examples provided herein are not intended to be limiting.

In some embodiments such as the embodiment illustrated in there is one Sign Up Request Processor that interconnects with multiple service operators via Common API . Specifying a common API enables Sign Up Request Processor to add new service operators e.g. Service Operator 1 Service Operator N without having to implement new interfaces to support the new service operators. In some embodiments the subscriber has a common sign up experience regardless of his service operator. This allows a third party e.g. device OEM VSP MVNO device OS provider VoIP provider etc. to define a user interface UI and process and implement that UI once in Sign Up Request Processor and or Device Agent to enable the third party to offer a common experience across all of the service operators that it interworks with.

For example a device manufacturer may want to have a common service sign up and sharing management UI and process for all of its products and desires that the common service sign up and sharing management UI and process are implemented consistently across all of the service operators that are selling the manufacturer s products. Thus in some embodiments the device manufacturer provides Sign Up Request Processor and Common API and works with the service operators to have them implement the required functionality to support the on device service sign up and multi device sharing functions. In some embodiments the manufacturer implements on Sign Up Request Processor common APIs e.g. Common API for functions like add new service delete service add a device to a master service account device group or multi device service plan delete a device from a master service account device group or multi device service plan manage quotas on a shared plan etc. and then provide a well defined API interface and protocol e.g. JSON WSDL etc. to the interface with the individual service operators.

In some embodiments the subscribers sharing a service plan must be subscribed to the same service operator. In some embodiments where a centralized accounting function is implemented the subscribers may be but need not be subscribed to different service operators and the centralized accounting function tracks manages and aggregates the service usage of all of the devices sharing the shared plan across all of the service operators. By leveraging a single sign up request processor Sign Up Request Processor brokers the multi device plan sharing management and assignment requests across the different service operators.

In some embodiments each of the plurality of Sign Up Request Processors is associated with a subset of the entities requiring access to manage multi device plan sharing and assignment. In some embodiments these entities include device OEM OS provider VSP MVNO MNO retail distribution partners or sponsored service providers. In some embodiments each of the entities requiring access to manage multi device plan sharing and assignment implements its own UI device agent and on device workflows to enable the entity to customize the process to suit its needs without impacting the service operator interfaces.

Although illustrates Common API coupled with Sign Up Request Processor in some embodiments Common API is defined by each service operator e.g. MNO MVNO VSP etc. and is coupled with each service operator s Subscriber Management System . In some embodiments Sign Up Request Processor conforms to each service operator s API specification. In some embodiments the service operator API exposes the high level requests e.g. add subscriber to a master service account device group or multi device service plan remove subscriber from a master service account device group or multi device service plan allocate quotas add curfew remove curfew add notification delete notification etc. to Sign Up Request Processor and then converts the high level commands into the appropriate low level commands and workflow specific to that service operator.

In some embodiments a party specifies a global API that defines a superset of required high level commands that entities use to manage multi device plan sharing capabilities and then provide an internal framework to allow the individual service operators to convert the high level commands received from Sign Up Request Processor into the service operator specific low level commands and workflows that apply to that service operator.
