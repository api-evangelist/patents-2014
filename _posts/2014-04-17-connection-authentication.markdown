Generally a device may connect with another device or a system in a secure manner by establishing a secure connection between the device and the system. For example a Bluetooth device may connect with a system of a vehicle or a vehicle via a Bluetooth connection a wireless connection etc. Typically when an occupant of a vehicle such as a driver of the vehicle desires to connect a device with a system of the vehicle or the vehicle the system of the vehicle may provide the driver or occupant with a personal identification number PIN to enter on his or her device. A driver may be prompted to enter this PIN into a device to connect the device with the vehicle or to initiate a pairing between the vehicle or automobile and the device. Once the PIN is manually entered on a device the device may be placed in a discovery mode and a connection may be established or created between the device and the vehicle or a system of the vehicle. In this way the vehicle may recognize when a correct PIN has been entered on the device and create authenticate or establish a connection secure connection Bluetooth connection wireless connection communication channel etc. as a result or in response to entry of the PIN on the device.

However because manual entry of a PIN is often required such connections are generally established in scenarios where a vehicle is stationary not in motion or operation in park etc. to mitigate distractions for a driver while operating a vehicle. In some vehicles it may be impossible to connect devices to the vehicle or a system of the vehicle during operation due to features which disable such interactions or setup of a connection while the vehicle is in motion for example. A vehicle may require a user occupant or driver to place the vehicle in park in order for one or more connections e.g. Bluetooth wireless Wi Fi etc. between a device and the vehicle to be created or established.

Even when features do not outright stop or prevent an individual user occupant or driver from setting up a connection e.g. while a vehicle is in motion a great deal of effort may be required to establish or create such connections because entry of a PIN or interaction with an interface of the vehicle may be necessary. Often a driver is in close proximity with such an interface for initiating a connection between a device and a vehicle and the onus is on the driver to facilitate navigation of menus or other setup associated with a connection. To this end it may be tedious for a driver or occupant of a vehicle to connect a device with the vehicle in some scenarios such as when the vehicle is in motion for example.

This brief description is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are described below in the detailed description. This brief description is not intended to be an extensive overview of the claimed subject matter identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Generally a system of a vehicle may facilitate authentication of a connection such as a Bluetooth connection between a device and the vehicle by providing a personal identification number PIN and having a user e.g. driver or other occupant type the PIN into a device during authentication. Additionally some systems or vehicle may require that the vehicle be placed in a mode such as park while entering the PIN into the device. In one or more embodiments an occupant of a vehicle such as a driver is provided with a way to authenticate establish or create one or more connections for one or more devices or mobile devices. Because it is generally desirable for a driver to keep his or her eyes on the road an interface may be provided for the driver which enables the driver to quickly respond to authentication requests from one or more devices or mobile devices such as mobile devices of passengers of the vehicle.

As an example an occupant of the vehicle such as a passenger may utilize an application on his or her mobile device to initiate a request for a connection e.g. connection request with the vehicle or a system of the vehicle thereby making the mobile device an initiator of a connection and the vehicle a target or a beacon. The vehicle may receive the request for the connection or connection request and respond with a request for a device identifier from the mobile device. For example the mobile device may respond to the request for the device identifier with a device identifier associated with the mobile device e.g. a media access control MAC address Bob s Phone . This device identifier may be presented to the driver of the vehicle. Thereafter the driver may respond to the connection request from the mobile device by accepting or denying the connection request. When the driver accepts the connection request a connection may be established between the mobile device associated with the device identifier and the vehicle or a system of the vehicle. In other words one or more devices may be connected with one or more other devices systems of the vehicle or the vehicle based on approval of an occupant of the vehicle.

Accordingly an occupant of the vehicle such as the driver may effectively become a gatekeeper for authenticating establishing or creating connections e.g. Bluetooth connections wireless connections short range communications etc. between one or more devices or mobile devices and a vehicle or system of a vehicle. Further an interface component or an audio component may render connection requests and corresponding device identifiers for a driver in a manner which requires less hassle or driver interaction to respond to than typical pairing procedures such as by not utilizing a PIN for authentication for example. Other aspects enable an occupant such as a driver to provide create establish authenticate etc. a connection with a device without requiring navigation or setup such as manually navigating through a connection menu. When a connection request is received the driver may be presented with an accept option and a deny option on an interface thereby enabling the driver to enable or disable incoming connection requests from one or more devices e.g. associated with passengers of a vehicle . The driver may thus point click touch actuate or speak a response to facilitate forming or denying the connection.

The following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages or novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

Embodiments or examples illustrated in the drawings are disclosed below using specific language. It will nevertheless be understood that the embodiments or examples are not intended to be limiting. Any alterations and modifications in the disclosed embodiments and any further applications of the principles disclosed in this document are contemplated as would normally occur to one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.

For one or more of the figures herein one or more boundaries such as boundary of for example may be drawn with different heights widths perimeters aspect ratios shapes etc. relative to one another merely for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily drawn to scale. For example because dashed or dotted lines may be used to represent different boundaries if the dashed and dotted lines were drawn on top of one another they would not be distinguishable in the figures and thus may be drawn with different dimensions or slightly apart from one another in one or more of the figures so that they are distinguishable from one another. As another example where a boundary is associated with an irregular shape the boundary such as a box drawn with a dashed line dotted lined etc. does not necessarily encompass an entire component in one or more instances. Conversely a drawn box does not necessarily encompass merely an associated component in one or more instances but may encompass a portion of one or more other components as well.

The following terms are used throughout the disclosure the definitions of which are provided herein to assist in understanding one or more aspects of the disclosure.

As used herein a connection may include or be based on short range communication near field communication NFC Wi Fi technologies wireless technologies telematics telecommunications Bluetooth or other communication channels such as universal serial bus USB etc. Additionally a connection may be established utilizing multiple technologies. For example NFC may be utilized to prepare a device to initiate a connection with a vehicle while the connection itself may be implemented utilizing Wi Fi wireless technologies telematics etc.

A device may be or include a mobile device a cellular phone a personal device assistant PDA smart phone pocket personal computer PC laptop computer desktop computer smart watch or other devices having a processor processing unit or memory. A device may run one or more applications programs or apps . An application may be part of a larger suit of features or interactions. Examples of applications include applications available for the iPhone applications for devices running the Android operating system applications for BlackBerry devices tablets or most any other device etc.

As used herein the term infer or inference generally refer to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of a system a component an environment a user from one or more observations captured via events or data etc. Inference may be employed to identify a context or an action or may be employed to generate a probability distribution over states for example. An inference may be probabilistic. For example computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data or events. Inference may also refer to techniques employed for composing higher level events from a set of events or data. Such inference may result in the construction of new events or new actions from a set of observed events or stored event data whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.

In the scenario of occupant or user may wish to connect his or her device e.g. mobile device smart phone cellular phone etc. to the vehicle such that the device is communicatively coupled with the vehicle . As a brief overview of an example embodiment the user may launch an application on his or her mobile device allowing the mobile device to poll or search for one or more target systems. In this example the mobile device may find the vehicle . The mobile device may then send the vehicle a connection request. In response the vehicle may request a device identifier from the mobile device . The mobile device may prompt the user for permission or confirmation prior to transmitting the device identifier of the mobile device to the vehicle . The vehicle may render a notification to an occupant such as the driver via an interface component . The interface component may present a message to the driver prompting the driver to accept or deny a connection with the device . If the driver accepts the prompt or connection request connection is created or established.

The communication component of the system for connection authentication may receive a request for a connection e.g. a connection request . For example the communication component may receive a connection request from a device which may be acting as an initiator for a connection. A connection request may be a request from a device e.g. mobile device or other device to form establish authenticate or create a connection or a secure connection between the device and a respective system e.g. system of a system of a vehicle . In this way the communication component may facilitate pairing or connection of two or more devices or systems where the device acts as the initiator and the vehicle or a system of the vehicle acts as a target for the device initiating the connection between the two.

In response to the connection request from the device the communication component may respond with a request for a device identifier e.g. device identifier request for the device. The communication component may transmit a device identifier request in response to the connection request. A device identifier may be unique to a device and utilized to identify a corresponding device. In one or more embodiments the device identifier may include a media access control MAC address of a device a nickname associated with the device a serial number etc. In other words the device may respond to the request for the device identifier or device identifier request with a device identifier which uniquely identifies the device or is associated with the device in a unique manner e.g. MAC address Bob s phone etc. .

When a user of a device opts to transmit the device identifier of his or her device or acquiesces to transmission of the device identifier the communication component may receive the device identifier from the device. A device may transmit a corresponding device identifier to the system and the device identifier associated with the device may be received as a response to the device identifier request.

Once a connection is established between a device and a system such as the system of the communication component may transfer data between the device and the system of the vehicle based on or utilizing the established connection. As use of the device or mobile device may utilize the connection to control one or more aspects or one or more components of the vehicle. To this end the communication component may receive a request to control one or more components of the vehicle such as from an application installed or running on the device. The communication component may interface with a device e.g. a networking component of a device transmit or receive data between the system and the device. Further the communication component may employ short range communications near field communications Wi Fi wireless telematics communications telecommunications or other technologies etc.

The interface component of the system may render notifications video audio alerts menus setup or other information to a driver or other occupant of a vehicle. For example the interface component may notify an occupant or driver of a vehicle of a connection request made from or initiated by a device such as a smart phone. Additionally the interface component may present an occupant of a vehicle with a corresponding device identifier of the device. In other words the interface component may prompt an occupant e.g. the driver of a vehicle to accept or deny a connection request from a device by prompting the driver using cues associated with the device identifier of the device. Based on a response of the occupant or driver a connection may be formed or established between the device and the vehicle or system of the vehicle. Explained another way the interface component may prompt an occupant of the vehicle to acquiesce to one or more connections between the vehicle and one or more devices to enable one or more of the devices to access manipulate or control one or more aspects of the vehicle e.g. one or more components of the vehicle .

The interface component may render prompts in a visual manner as audio or via other feedback e.g. tactile feedback vibrations email text notifications etc. for an occupant of a vehicle or driver of a vehicle. The interface component may render a connection request for an occupant of a vehicle based on a device identifier of a device. For example the interface component may alert a driver that a device wishes to connect having a device identifier associated with a nickname such as Bob s Phone . The alert may include audio such as a beep or be presented on a display interface such as the interface of for example. A driver or occupant may be provided with an interface which includes a heads up display HUD enabling a driver to accept or deny connection requests or incoming connection requests using buttons on the steering wheel buttons on a console of the vehicle hardware buttons software buttons e.g. on screen or on display soft buttons etc.

Further the media component may render connection requests corresponding device identifiers or device nicknames for a driver or occupant in a manner which mitigates an amount of hassle or driver interaction than a typical pairing procedure. For example the system of does not utilize a PIN during the connection setup or connection request process. Accordingly a driver or other occupant of the vehicle is not required to manually enter a PIN to pair or connect a device with the vehicle or system of a vehicle. As mentioned a device may act as an initiator of a connection while a vehicle acts as a target. In this way a number of initiators and a number of targets is reduced. Conversely during other types of pairing e.g. pairing or connecting utilizing a PIN the vehicle may act as an initiator searching for an unknown number of targets e.g. devices . In a scenario where a device is acting as an initiator for a connection and there are multiple e.g. two or more vehicles or systems an occupant or driver of respective vehicles may act as a gatekeeper for authentication or establishing a connection thus ensuring connection security. Additionally a user of a mobile device acting as an initiator may be prompted with an alert to select which vehicle or system to which he or she wishes to send a connection request.

Other aspects of the interface component enable an occupant such as a driver of a vehicle to provide create establish authenticate control or manage a connection with a device without requiring navigation or setup such as manual navigation through a connection menu. In other words a device may be authenticated by presenting a driver or other occupant of a vehicle with an interface which allows the driver to select yes or no approve or deny enable or disable or the like to control or manage formation or establishing one or more connections. A driver or occupant may respond to a connection request rendered by the interface component in a variety of ways. For example the driver may point click touch actuate or speak a response to facilitate formation or denial of a connection between a device and a system or vehicle. In this way the interface component may receive a response to the connection request from an occupant or driver of the vehicle.

In one or more embodiments the media component may include a text to speech TTS component or TTS functionality which allows a driver or occupant to speak his or her selection rather than utilizing a button to make a selection for example. Because connections may established based on a response of an occupant e.g. to a prompt provided by the interface component a response based authentication scheme is provided where a driver or occupant may control pairing or the connection process rather than utilizing a PIN for example.

Additionally the interface component may prompt an occupant of a vehicle for additional or supplemental information. For example the supplemental information may be related to one or more aspects of a connection such as an authentication preference e.g. as a prompt such as save user or one time guest corresponding with a device. An authentication preference associated with a device may be indicative of a temporal aspect of a connection or how long a connection between a device and a system should last. The interface component may allow an occupant or driver to select among different authentication preferences such as one time authentication e.g. a single connection session permanent authentication e.g. storing the device identifier on the storage component such that the same device may reconnected on an ongoing basis without need for a connection request or occupant approval for subsequent connections timer based authentication e.g. determining a predetermined length of a connection etc.

Regardless when an occupant of a vehicle provides a response e.g. user input to a connection request the interface component may receive the response to the connection request and provide confirmation accordingly. Further the interface component may identify provide or render a list of connected devices pending connection requests saved devices etc. In this way the interface component may notify an occupant or driver of a status of one or more connections or previous connections.

One benefit provide by the interface or rendering associated with the interface component is that the interface enables a driver to maintain control or manage one or more connections between a vehicle vehicle computer or systems of a vehicle and one or more devices e.g. within range of the vehicle . In this way the interface component enables an occupant such as the driver to act as a gatekeeper for authentication or pairing of a device and the system . In other words an approval based authentication scheme for pairing devices and or systems is provided such that an occupant may utilize an interface to approve or deny connections between respective devices e.g. associated with occupants of the vehicle and systems of a vehicle or the vehicle.

The authentication component may be utilized to authenticate a connection request and establish control or manage a connection between a corresponding device and a vehicle or system of the vehicle based on a response to a connection request e.g. from a driver of the vehicle or based on driver approval etc. . For example the authentication component may establish or create a connection when driver approval is received from the driver of the vehicle. Stated another way the authentication component may authenticate a connection between a device and a vehicle based on a connection request and an approval or corresponding response from an occupant of the vehicle.

Explained yet another way the authentication component may authenticate one or more devices or connections associated therewith utilizing an authentication scheme based on driver approval or occupant approval e.g. associated with an identity of a user occupant driver etc. to accept establish create authenticate etc. or otherwise acquiesce to one or more connections between one or more devices and the system . When a driver or other occupant accepts a connection request a connection may be established between the device associated with the device identifier and the vehicle or a system of the vehicle. The connection may be made over a network a wireless network hotspot utilizing Bluetooth technology etc.

An authentication scheme based on occupant approval may be considered less intrusive to a driver or require less engagement from a driver or operator of a vehicle that other authentication schemes associated with PIN entry or menu navigation. For example in other authentication schemes where a device is a target a PIN may be useful because multiple targets e.g. devices may exist in range of the initiator e.g. vehicle . In these scenarios a PIN may help identify or distinguish one target device from another. According to one or more embodiments because there is generally merely a single target e.g. one vehicle or one target vehicle that a device is attempting to connect with no PIN is required. When multiple targets e.g. vehicles or target vehicles are present e.g. multiple targets available occupants of respective vehicles may act as gatekeepers to control connections between an initiator device and a target vehicle or target vehicle. Additionally the device or an interface on the device may prompt a user as to which vehicle to send a connection request to when multiple vehicles are present. For example when multiple vehicles are present or together the device may initiate a connection based on signal strength associated with one or more of the vehicles. In one or more scenarios the device may initiate a connection to the vehicle associated with a stronger or greater signal strength.

The authentication component may pass a device identifier of a device e.g. received by a communication component to a storage component when an occupant indicates that he or she desires for a connection to be formed between a corresponding device and a system or a vehicle. In one or more embodiments the storage component may store a device identifier of a device based on an authentication preference which may be selected by an occupant of a vehicle. Examples of authentication preferences include permanent authentication e.g. save user temporary authentication e.g. one time use timed authentication e.g. connection for a pre determined period of time etc. In this way pairing may be facilitated without the use of a shared secret key or the like.

The security component may enable transmission of data between a device and the system to be secure. For example the security component may encrypt data which is transferred over a connection between a device and the system thereby making data transmitted across the connection unreadable for everyone except the rightful receivers e.g. the system of the vehicle or the device . The security component may utilize an encryption algorithm to send encrypted data or receive encrypted data. The encryption algorithm may be utilized to encrypt or decrypt the data between an encrypted format and a decrypted format. In other words transfer of data between a device and the system may be based on one or more encryption algorithms.

In one or more embodiments the security component may verify or continually verify a connection between a device and a system . For example the security component may determine whether or not a device belongs as part of a connection or as part of a pair of trusted devices by checking to see if a device utilizes the correct standards protocols application programming interfaces APIs formatting etc. to communicate with the system . This may be achieved utilizing a challenge response scheme. If the security component determines that the device is not communicating in accordance with the correct protocols or procedures the security component may disable a connection between the system and the device ban the device ban the device identifier blacklist the corresponding device blacklist the corresponding device identifier notify a user driver occupant of a vehicle etc.

As mentioned the storage component may be utilized to store data or metadata associated with devices such as a device identifier corresponding authentication preferences etc.

A controller area network connects one or more components of a vehicle such as the media component the HVAC component etc. The media component may provide a driver or an individual or user connected via a device to operate infotainment a rear entertainment system RES the radio or other systems on a vehicle. Additionally the media component may have navigation functionality. In one or more embodiments the media component may have text to speech functionality as well. The HVAC component may allow a driver or an individual connected via a device to manage a fan speed temperature air conditioning heating cooling etc. or other aspects of an HVAC unit of a vehicle.

The networking component may perform an inquiry to find one or more devices one or more systems or one or more vehicles to which to connect. In other words the networking component may perform an inquiry for one or more target devices systems or vehicles which the device may be connected to as desired by a user of a device. The networking component may interface with a communication component e.g. of of a vehicle. For example a connection may be established between the networking component and one or more target systems.

An application component may enable an occupant of a vehicle e.g. who is also a user of a device such as a passenger to utilize or run an application on his or her device to initiate a request for a connection e.g. connection request with a vehicle or system of a vehicle thereby making the device an initiator of a connection and the vehicle as target or a beacon.

In one or more embodiments an application may be a software module executed on a device or a device. The software module or application may be iPhone based or Android based. The application may be stored on a device or device and may be part of embedded software of the device or integrated into an operating system of the device. In other embodiments the application can be downloaded via a wired or wireless system e.g. using Apple s iTunes Google Play Store etc. . For ease of discussion the disclosure will be described based on a software module being an application stored on a memory of the device and executed by a processing unit of the device. As used herein the software module will be referred to as an application or an app .

The application component may execute an application or a module on the device to initiate pairing or connection of the device with a vehicle or a system of a vehicle. In other words the application enables a device to act as an initiator for a connection rather than having a vehicle act as the initiator. To this end the vehicle or a system of a vehicle would be a target or a beacon which the device is seeking. The application may be web based browser based interface based installed from an app store etc.

The application component may execute an application which enable or turns on a communication channel or communication technology associated with the device. For example the application may enable Bluetooth when Bluetooth is found to be disabled. Additionally the application may determine whether or not the device has discovery mode enabled. Discovery mode is a mode which enables the device to pair or connect with another device system or vehicle. If the application determines that the device has discovery mode disabled the application may enable or turn on discovery mode to facilitate connection authentication. In one or more embodiments the application may provide a list of one or more devices systems vehicles etc. found by the networking component to which the device may be connected e.g. potential connections .

The application executed by the application component may generate a connection request for a device acting as an initiator for a connection with one or more target systems. For example one or more of the target systems may be a vehicle. The networking component may transmit the connection request to a vehicle or a system of the vehicle to initiate pairing or a connection between the device and the vehicle e.g. in response to a corresponding user input at the application level such as selecting a send connection request button . In one or more embodiments the connection request may not include a device identifier of the device without user permission or consent. In other embodiments the connection request may automatically transmit the device identifier of the device e.g. based on a setting or user preference .

The networking component may interface with the communication component of a vehicle e.g. of and may receive a request for a device identifier e.g. device identifier request from a vehicle or system. For example the networking component may receive a device identifier request in response to a connection request. Further the application may respond to the device identifier request by having the networking component transmit the device identifier of the device. In one or more embodiments the networking component may transmit the device identifier to a communication component of a vehicle in response to the device identifier request.

In one or more embodiments the application may prompt a user of a device to provide consent prior to having the networking component transmit the device identifier of the device to an external source such as the communication component of a vehicle or system. The rendering component may render a notification for a user of a device when a device identifier request is received by the networking component . In this way the system may provide the user with an option to accept or deny the device identifier request and transmit the device identifier to an external source or not transmit the device identifier thereby cancelling the connection request previously initiated by the networking component .

The application may enable a user of a device e.g. system to control one or more aspects of a vehicle or one or more components of a vehicle such as a media component HVAC component etc. when a connection between the device and the vehicle or system exists and the device is in range of the vehicle or connection . In one or more embodiments driver approval of one or more actions may be implemented such that the driver or occupant of the vehicle remains as a gatekeeper for actions proposed by a user or passenger utilizing a device within the vehicle. For example the driver may be notified when a passenger or user attempts to modify or change the temperature of the vehicle using the HVAC component.

The application may automatically reconnect a device with a vehicle when the device is in range of the vehicle when the device is turned on the application is launched a button is pressed on the device or the vehicle the vehicle ignition is switched on based on a location of the vehicle e.g. where the location of the vehicle may be determined by a navigation system a global positioning system GPS etc. opening or closing a door to the vehicle pulling a door handle in response to a voice command engaging the vehicle in another way etc.

The input component and the rendering component may be integrated as a single component such as a touch screen for example. The input component may further include a microphone to capture audio an image capture device etc. The rendering component may render the application on a display of the device along with one or more features associated with an application such as a menu setup an accept or deny a request prompt etc.

One or more embodiments may employ various artificial intelligence Al based schemes for carrying out various aspects thereof. One or more aspects may be facilitated via an automatic classifier system or process. A classifier is a function that maps an input attribute vector x x1 x2 x3 x4 xn to a confidence that the input belongs to a class. In other words f x confidence class . Such classification may employ a probabilistic or statistical based analysis e.g. factoring into the analysis utilities and costs to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed.

A support vector machine SVM is an example of a classifier that may be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hypersurface in the space of possible inputs which the hypersurface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non triggering events. Intuitively this makes the classification correct for testing data that may be similar but not necessarily identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches e.g. na ve Bayes Bayesian networks decision trees neural networks fuzzy logic models and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence may be employed. Classification as used herein may be inclusive of statistical regression utilized to develop models of priority.

One or more embodiments may employ classifiers that are explicitly trained e.g. via a generic training data as well as classifiers which are implicitly trained e.g. via observing user behavior receiving extrinsic information . For example SVMs may be configured via a learning or training phase within a classifier constructor and feature selection module. Thus a classifier may be used to automatically learn and perform a number of functions including but not limited to determining according to a predetermined criteria.
