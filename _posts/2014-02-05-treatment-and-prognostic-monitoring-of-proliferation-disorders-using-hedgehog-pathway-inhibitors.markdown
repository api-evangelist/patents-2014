The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 831 823 filed Jun. 6 2013 and U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61 813 122 filed Apr. 17 2013 which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety including any figures tables or drawings.

Inhibitors of the Hedgehog Hh molecular signaling pathway HhP have emerged in recent years as a promising new class of potential therapeutics for cancer treatment. Numerous drug discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of a wide variety of small molecules that target different members of this pathway including Smoothened Smo Sonic hedgehog protein Shh and Glioma Associated Oncogene Homolog I II and III Gli1 Gli2 and Gli3 . Smo inhibitors have now entered human clinical trials and successful proof of concept studies have been carried out in patients with defined genetic mutations in the Hh pathway. In fact the first Smo inhibitor was approved by the FDA in early 2012 for use in treatment of patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma vismodegib marketed as ERIVEDGE from Roche Genentech validating the commercial validity of using drugs to modulate this pathway.

Activation of the HhP has been implicated in the development of cancers in various organs including brain lung mammary gland prostate and skin. Basal cell carcinoma the most common form of cancerous malignancy has the closest association with hedgehog signaling. Loss of function mutations in Patched and activating mutations in Smo have been identified in patients with this disease Sahebjam et al. The Utility of Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibition for Cancer 2012 17 1090 1099 .

As an antifungal the mechanism of action of itraconazole is the same as the other azole antifungals inhibiting the fungal mediated synthesis of ergosterol. However itraconazole has been discovered to have anti cancer properties. Itraconazole inhibits angiogenesis and Hh signaling and delays tumor growth in murine prostate cancer xenograft models. Itraconazole appears to act on the essential Hh pathway component Smo in a mode that is different than the drug vismodegib by preventing the ciliary accumulation of Smo normally caused by Hh stimulation and has a much shorter half life which may be the reason it has less side effects than vismodegib.

Prostate cancer rates are higher and prognoses are poorer in developed countries than in the rest of the world. Prostate cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the world but is the number one non skin cancer in men from the United States. Prostate cancer affects a large percent of American men sometimes resulting in death. In patients who undergo treatment of prostate cancer the most important clinical prognostic indicators of disease outcome are stage pre therapy prostate specific antigen PSA level and Gleason score. In general the higher the grade and the stage of prostate cancer the poorer the prognosis. Nomograms can also be used to calculate the estimated risk of the individual patient. Some but not all prostate cancers appear to have an up regulation of the Hh molecular pathway U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20120083419 Altaba et al.

It would be advantageous to have available a prognostic tool or biomarker with proven ability to identify and distinguish as early as possible those cancer patients who are likely to respond to HhP inhibitor treatment from those patients that are not so that HhP inhibitor treatments can be provided to those patients for which an HhP inhibitor will be effective and alternative treatment modalities can be provided to those for which an HhP inhibitor will be ineffective or less effective than other available treatments.

The present invention concerns methods for treating proliferation disorders such as prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer and other cancers with a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor and methods for monitoring subjects undergoing such treatments based on biomarkers and other criteria predictive of efficacy.

Some aspects of the invention concern methods for prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with HhP inhibitor therapy and for determining the efficacy of HhP inhibitor therapy based on post therapy prostate specific antigen. Unlike the majority of prostate cancer drugs which target androgens in order to lower testosterone levels itraconazole s effect is androgen independent.

A non comparative randomized phase II study was conducted evaluating the antitumor efficacy of two doses of oral itraconazole in men with metastatic prostate cancer. Based on the analysis described in an increase in PSA post treatment was identified as a marker for responders to itraconazole therapy. The inventors identified patients who exhibited a PSA increase of 1000 ng ml at 4 weeks along with the above mentioned 

PSA levels are known to be a function of androgen activity. As androgen activity increases such as results from supplemental testosterone therapy the higher the PSA. As androgen activity decreases such as results from androgen deprivation therapy anti androgens etc. the lower the PSA. Because itraconazole has no effect on androgen synthesis plasma levels or receptor activity it was not expected that itraconazole would have any significant effect on PSA. Additionally since itraconazole is an inhibitor of the HhP and is not significantly cytotoxic unlike chemotherapy there was no reason to expect any significant effect on PSA because itraconazole does not kill the cancer cells and hence eliminating their contribution to PSA levels . Dendreon s Provenge cancer vaccine is an example of anti prostate cancer agent that has no effect on PSA or PFS but provides improved overall survival. In contrast in the case of itraconazole the inventors discovered unexpectedly that a reduction in PSA rise of 

Surprisingly the inventors found that the plasma concentrations of itraconazole required to show a clinical benefit in humans with cancer are significantly greater than the typical levels for antifungal efficacy. Shi W. et al. reported that antifungal potency is determined by structure unrelated to the inhibition of the HhP Shi W. et al. Itraconazole Side Chain Analogues Structure Activity Relationship Studies for Inhibition of Endothelial Cell Proliferation Vascular Endothelial Cell Growth Factor Receptor 2 VEGFR2 Glycosylation and Hedgehog Signaling 2011 54 7363 7374 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety thus the use of higher doses of HhP inhibitors such as itraconazole to treat systemic fungal infections in cancer patients did not support or suggest that the dose required to treat cancer was in the range of high dose antifungal therapy.

Furthermore the determination of the minimum trough level to achieve an effect on proliferation disorders such as cancer was not predicted from the in vitro studies by Shi W. et al because of these considerations i itraconazole has multiple anti cancer properties including anti angiogenic mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition and anti hedgehog therefore the in vitro studies of the HhP or anti angiogenic effects for example were not sufficient to predict dosing or plasma levels ii after a number of days of dosing sufficient to achieve a steady state the tissue concentration of itraconazole is known to be a multiple of plasma levels and iii unlike the antifungal effects the major metabolite of itraconazole hydroxy itraconazole is not equipotent as a HhP inhibitor but it does seem to have significant effects making extrapolation to in vivo plasma levels that are effective in cancer impossible to predict.

One aspect of the invention concerns a method for treating a proliferation disorder in a subject such as prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer and other cancers comprising orally administering a composition comprising a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor to the subject wherein the composition is orally administered in an effective amount to achieve a plasma trough level of at least about 1 000 ng mL of the HhP inhibitor. Optionally the method of treatment includes monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject to determine whether there has been a clinical response to HhP inhibitor treatment.

Another aspect of the invention concerns a method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy in a subject comprising comparing the level of prostate specific antigen PSA in a sample obtained from the subject following HhP inhibitor therapy with a reference level of PSA wherein the level of PSA in the sample compared to the reference level of PSA is prognostic for an outcome of treatment with the HhP inhibitor.

Any inhibitor of the HhP may be used. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor targets the Smoothened Smo protein of the HhP pathway acting on Smo for example by binding to it. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is cyclopamine competitive. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor comprises itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug or active metabolite thereof. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is a purified stereoisomer of itraconazole non racemic mixture or an itraconazole analogue in which the sec butyl side chain has been replaced with one or more moieties relative to itraconazole. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is cyclopamine competitive. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is non cyclopamine competitive. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is cyclopamine competitive and the proliferation disorder is prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma or lung cancer.

In some embodiments the method of treatment further comprises obtaining the sample from the subject. In some embodiments the sample is a serum sample.

The method of treatment may include monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject to determine whether there has been a clinical response to HhP inhibitor treatment. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein a lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment is indicative that the plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor should be increased further above about 1000 ng mL and wherein the occurrence of a clinical response and a plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor substantially higher than about 1000 ng mL indicates that one or more subsequent doses of the HhP inhibitor can be reduced. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein a lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment after about four weeks of said administering is indicative of a need to increase the dose and or frequency of the dose of the HhP inhibitor. Optionally the method further comprises subsequently administering the HhP inhibitor to the subject at the increased dose and or frequency. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein the occurrence of a clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment after about four weeks of said administering is indicative of a need to decrease the dose and or frequency of the dose of the HhP inhibitor. Optionally the method further comprises subsequently administering the HhP inhibitor to the subject at a decreased dose and or frequency.

In some embodiments the monitoring comprises visual inspection palpation imaging assaying the presence level or activity of one or more biomarkers associated with the proliferation disorder in a sample obtained from the subject or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. In some embodiments the monitoring comprises monitoring at least one of the following parameters tumor size rate of change in tumor size hedgehog levels or signaling appearance of new tumors rate of appearance of new tumors change in symptom of the proliferation disorder appearance of new symptom associated with the proliferation disorder quality of life e.g. amount of pain associated with the proliferation disorder or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

As indicated above the inventors found that the plasma concentrations of itraconazole required to show a clinical benefit in humans with cancer are significantly greater than the typical levels for antifungal activity. In particular the minimum plasma trough level after 4 weeks of therapy required to have a clinically significant effect was at least 1000 ng ml. Achieving these levels of itraconazole is enhanced by the use of formulations with greater bioavailability such as SUBA CAP. Nevertheless there can be side effects peculiar to such high doses such as hypertension peripheral edema and hypokalemia which seem to be a result of an increased production of mineralocorticoid. These side effects associated with these high doses of itraconazole can be effectively managed by giving a selective mineralocorticoid antagonist such as eplerenone. Accordingly in some embodiments the method further comprises administering eplerenone or other mineralocorticoid inhibitor. In some embodiments the subject is suffering from an adverse effect selected from hypertension peripheral edema and hypokalemia and wherein the mineralocorticoid inhibitor is administered in an amount effective to treat the adverse effect.

In some embodiments the subject has a fungal infection. In other embodiments the subject does not have a fungal infection.

In some embodiments the subject has a fungal infection selected from Blastomycosis Histoplasmosis Candidiasis and Aspergillosis. In other embodiments the subject does not have a fungal infection selected from among Blastomycosis Histoplasmosis Candidiasis and Aspergillosis.

In some embodiments the subject has received no prior chemotherapy to treat the proliferation disorder.

In some embodiments the subject is administered no agent that interacts with CYP3A4 during the duration of the treatment.

The present invention also concerns methods for prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy and for determining the efficacy of HhP inhibitor therapy based on post therapy prostate specific antigen.

One aspect of the invention concerns a method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy in a subject comprising comparing the level of prostate specific antigen PSA in a sample obtained from the subject following HhP inhibitor therapy with a reference level predetermined level of PSA wherein the level of PSA in the sample compared to the reference level of PSA is prognostic for an outcome of treatment with the HhP inhibitor. In some embodiments the reference level is the PSA level in the subject at initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy. In some embodiments the method comprises monitoring the PSA level in the subject comprising comparing the PSA level in multiple samples with the reference level of PSA wherein the samples are obtained from the subject over time following HhP inhibitor therapy.

Another aspect of the invention concerns a method of determining the efficacy of Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy for prostate cancer in a human subject comprising measuring prostate specific antigen PSA level in a sample obtained from the subject following initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy wherein a measured PSA level compared to a first reference PSA level first predetermined level at initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy is indicative of efficacy and wherein a measured PSA level compared to a second reference PSA level second predetermined level is indicative of a lack of efficacy. In some embodiments the method comprises monitoring the PSA level in the subject comprising measuring the PSA level in multiple samples obtained from the subject over time following HhP inhibitor therapy e.g. at one or more of 4 weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 7 weeks 8 weeks 9 weeks 10 weeks 11 weeks 12 weeks or longer following initiation of HhP therapy . In some embodiments a sample is obtained at about 3 to 5 weeks and or at about 11 to 13 weeks following initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy. In some embodiments a sample is obtained at about 4 weeks and or at about 12 weeks following initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention a PSA level increase of less than about 25 relative to the PSA level at initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy is indicative of efficacy and a PSA level increase of about 25 or greater is indicative of a lack of efficacy.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the HhP inhibitor comprises itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite thereof. For example the HhP inhibitor may comprise or consist of a SUBA formulation Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd. e.g. the SUBACAP formulation of itraconazole see for example U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030225104 Hayes et al. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Poorly Soluble Drugs issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6 881 745 which is a solid dispersion wherein itraconazole is associated with acidic molecules and the formulation allows for improved absorption. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor such as a SUBA formulation is administered to the subject at a dose in the range of 100 mg to 600 mg per day.

In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is administered intravenously or locally e.g. by direct injection to a prostate cancer lesion or tumor. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is administered orally e.g. in capsule tablet suspended powder liquid suspension or liquid solution form. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is orally administered e.g. in capsule tablet suspended powder liquid suspension or liquid solution form in an amount comprising or consisting of about 25 mg to about 100 mg per dose twice a day. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is orally administered e.g. in capsule tablet suspended powder liquid suspension or liquid solution form in an amount comprising or consisting of 50 mg per dose twice a day.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the sample is obtained from the subject within 4 to 6 weeks after initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the method further comprises administering the HhP inhibitor to the subject and obtaining the sample from the subject after said administering.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the method further comprises maintaining HhP inhibitor therapy if the measured level of PSA is indicative of efficacy.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the method further comprises withholding HhP inhibitor therapy if the measured level of PSA is indicative of a lack of efficacy. Withholding HhP inhibitor therapy may include watchful waiting or active surveillance. Optionally the method further comprises administering one or more treatments for the prostate cancer other than an HhP inhibitor. Examples of prostate cancer treatments include but are not limited to radiation therapy hormone therapy chemotherapy immunotherapy surgery surgical excision removal of cancerous tissue e.g. open or laparoscopic prostatectomy cryosurgery high intensity focused ultrasound and proton beam radiation therapy.

It should be understood that indications of HhP inhibitor therapy efficacy or lack of efficacy can be specific to the dose and or frequency of the dose administered. In this way the invention provides a method for determining a dose of HhP inhibitor suitable for administration to a subject for treatment of prostate cancer. This involves carrying out a method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment or determining efficacy of an HhP inhibitor therapy as described herein and determining an effective dose of HhP inhibitor based on the comparison of PSA level measured in a sample obtained following a dosage level and or dose frequency change to a reference PSA level.

For example it is possible to administer a dose of HhP inhibitor at one level and or one frequency and not observe a PSA response but administer a dose at a different greater level and or frequency and observe a PSA response. Therefore the dose level and or frequency of dosing may affect whether an HhP inhibitor works or does not work. Consequently if a lack of efficacy is indicated based on PSA level at one dose and or one frequency of the HhP inhibitor before withholding the HhP therapy and or administering an alternative non HhP inhibitor treatment for the prostate cancer it may be desirable to modulate e.g. increase the dosage and or frequency of the HhP inhibitor and optionally obtain one or more subsequent samples and measure the PSA level in the sample s and compare the measured level to the reference level to make another determination of prognosis or efficacy non efficacy at the different dosage and or frequency. Accordingly in some embodiments of the methods of the invention the method further comprises increasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor and or frequency of dose of the HhP inhibitor if the measured level of PSA is indicative of a lack of efficacy. This may be repeated one or more times until efficacy of that dosage regimen is indicated based on measured level of PSA relative to the reference level e.g. as a dose titration using reference PSA level as a guide . Optionally at any point in the process the HhP inhibitor can be withheld and optionally an alternative non HhP inhibitor treatment administered to the subject.

Alternatively if a subject does achieve a PSA level indicative of efficacy at one dose level and or frequency but the subject experiences one or more side effects then the dose level and or frequency of dose may be subsequently decreased. One or more samples may then be obtained PSA level measured and compared to a reference level to ensure that the measured PSA level at the decreased dose and or frequency remains indicative of efficacy. Again the PSA level may be used as a biomarker or guide for optimal dosing of subsequent administrations with the HhP inhibitor. Accordingly in some embodiments of the methods of the invention the method further comprises decreasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor and or frequency of dose of the HhP inhibitor if the measured level of PSA is indicative of efficacy but the subject is experiencing one or more side effects. This may be repeated one or more times until the side effects are reduced or eliminated without compromising efficacy of that dosage regimen based on PSA level. Optionally at any point in the process the HhP inhibitor can be withheld and optionally an alternative non HhP inhibitor treatment administered to the subject. This may be desirable if the side effects are not manageable without compromising efficacy.

As indicated above an aspect of the invention is a method for determining a dose of HhP inhibitor suitable for administration to a subject for treatment of prostate cancer comprising measuring a PSA level in a sample obtained from the subject following HhP inhibitor administration e.g. at about 4 weeks and or about 12 weeks after initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy and determining an effective dose of the HhP inhibitor based on comparison of the measured PSA level to a reference level of PSA e.g. a PSA level increase of less than about 25 relative to the PSA level at initiation of HhP inhibitor therapy . By way of example 50 mg of an HhP inhibitor may be administered incrementally to a subject to establish efficacy by increasing the dose adjusting the amount and or frequency of subsequent doses upward if the subject does not respond or decreasing the dose adjusting the amount and or frequency downward if it is too toxic. In the case of a SUBA formulation of an azole antifungal drug for example such as a SUBACAP formulation a dose may be titrated up or down such that the dose is within the range of 100 mg to 600 mg of SUBA formulation per day usually in divided doses administered twice daily. The high end of the range may be used for example to obtain rapid trough levels on day one or day two and then the dose may be reduced in amount and or frequency or for some prostate cancers it may be determined that a more potent dose is required.

In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the PSA level is the level of total PSA free unbound PSA and bound PSA . In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the PSA level is PSA doubling time.

In the methods of the invention the determined PSA level may represent the amount of PSA protein the amount of nucleic acid DNA or mRNA encoding PSA or the amount of PSA activity. In some embodiments the PSA protein level is measured by radioimmunoassay RIA immunoradiometric assay IRMA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA dot blot slot blot enzyme linked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT assay Western blot peptide microarray surface plasmon resonance fluorescence resonance energy transfer bioluminescence resonance energy transfer fluorescence quenching fluorescence fluorescence polarization mass spectrometry MS high performance liquid chromatography HPLC high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry HPLC MS high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry HPLC MS MS capillary electrophoresis rod gel electrophoresis or slab gel electrophoresis. In some embodiments the PSA mRNA level is measured by Northern blot Southern blot nucleic acid microarray polymerase chain reaction PCR real time PCR RT PCR nucleic acid sequence based amplification assay NASBA or transcription mediated amplification TMA .

The sample obtained from the subject may be potentially any sample harboring PSA protein or nucleic acids. The sample may be processed before or after the PSA biomarker is measured. In some embodiments of the methods of the invention the sample is a serum sample.

The methods of the invention may further comprise obtaining the sample from the subject such as by withdrawing blood or by tissue biopsy.

The methods of the invention may further comprise identifying the subject as having prostate cancer e.g. based on one or more biomarkers signs symptoms biopsy etc. before initiating HhP therapy.

In some embodiments prior to initiation of treatment with the HhP inhibitor the subject has undergone treatment for the prostate cancer with a non HhP inhibitor. For example the HhP inhibitor may be administered as a second line third line or fourth line therapy.

There are other tools available to help predict outcomes in prostate cancer treatment such as pathologic stage and recurrence after surgery or radiation therapy. Most combine stage grade and PSA level and some also add the number or percent of biopsy cores positive age and or other information. The methods of the invention may be used in addition to or as an alternative to methods for prognosticating prostate cancer such as D Amico classification the Partin tables the Kattan nomograms and the UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment CAPRA score.

Another aspect of the invention concerns a method for treating prostate cancer in a subject comprising administering Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy to the subject and carrying out a method of the invention i.e. a method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with a HhP inhibitor therapy or a method of determining the efficacy of HhP inhibitor therapy .

Optionally subjects in need of treatment or further treatment of a proliferation disorder such as prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer or other cancer may be selected as an individual particularly suitable for treatment with an HhP inhibitor based on Hh levels or signaling which may be assessed directly or indirectly by measuring a biomarker an HhP biomarker that represents the HhP signal itself or a modulator of the HhP signal inducer or inhibitor . If the biomarker is an inhibitor of the HhP signal and the level of the inhibitor is below normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is elevated above normal. Likewise if the biomarker is an inhibitor of the HhP signal and the level of the inhibitor is above normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is reduced below normal. If the biomarker is an inducer of the HhP signal and the level of the inducer is below normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is reduced below normal. Likewise if the biomarker is an inducer of the HhP signal and the level of the biomarker is above normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is elevated above normal. Optionally the accuracy of the aforementioned assumptions may be confirmed by measuring HhP signaling directly or by measuring other additional HhP biomarkers.

Hh levels or signaling may be assessed by measuring an HhP protein or a nucleic acid encoding an HhP protein such as an HhP ligand that activates the pathway and or an upstream or downstream component s of the HhP e.g. a receptor activator or inhibitor of hedgehog. Ligands of the mammalian HhP include Sonic hedgehog SHH desert hedgehog DHH and Indian hedgehog DHH . Activation of the HhP leads to nuclear translocation of glioma associated oncogene homolog Gli transcription factors and the levels of these transcription factors may be assessed as well e.g. Gli1 Gli2 Gli3 or a combination or two or more of the foregoing .

Any of the aforementioned biomarkers can be detected in a sample obtained from the subject such as blood urine circulating tumor cells a tumor biopsy or a bone marrow biopsy. These biomarkers can also be detected by systemic administration of a labeled form of an antibody to a biomarker followed by imaging with an appropriate imaging modality. The measured level in the sample may be compared to a reference level such as a normal level representative of constitutive expression of the biomarker or a normal level of HhP signaling or a level that was previously measured in a sample obtained from the subject e.g. in a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time in the treatment regimen or before the subject developed the proliferation disorder . If the HhP biomarker is upregulated elevated relative to the reference level then the subject can be selected for treatment with an HhP inhibitor such as itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite thereof and administration of the HhP inhibitor to the subject may proceed. Furthermore as described below the proliferation disorder may then be monitored for a clinical response by obtaining another sample from the subject measuring the biomarker and comparing the measured level to the level measured in the sample that was obtained previously. Multiple samples may be obtained and measurements determined and compared during the course of the treatment to monitor the proliferation disorder and clinical response to the treatment over time.

Because not every proliferation disorder may not be immediately responsive to every dosage regimen with an HhP inhibitor even in the therapeutic range of at least about 1000 ng mL it may be desirable to monitor the proliferation disorder in the subject for the presence or absence of a response to the HhP inhibitor treatment. The plasma trough level of at least about 1000 ng ml ensures an empirical trial of HhP inhibitor is more likely to be effective but it may take higher levels to be effective and in some subjects no matter what the dose the HhP inhibitor is not effective perhaps because the HhP is not up regulated or there are mutations that make the HhP inhibitor ineffective in blocking the up regulation.

Accordingly in some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder for the presence or absence of a response to the HhP inhibitor treatment. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein a lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment is indicative that the plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor should be increased further above about 1000 ng mL and wherein the occurrence of a clinical response and a plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor substantially higher than about 1000 ng mL indicates that one or more subsequent doses of the HhP inhibitor can be reduced. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein a lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment after about four weeks of said administering is indicative of a need to increase the dose and or frequency of the dose of the HhP inhibitor. In some embodiments the method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject wherein the occurrence of a clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment after about four weeks of said administering is indicative of a need to decrease the dose and or frequency of the dose of the HhP inhibitor.

In some embodiments the monitoring comprises visual inspection palpation imaging assaying the presence level or activity of one or more biomarkers associated with the proliferation disorder in a sample obtained from the subject or a combination of two or more of the foregoing one or more times at various intervals of treatment to ascertain whether the treatment is effectively treating the proliferation disorder in the subject causing or contributing to a clinical response in the subject . For skin cancers such a basal cell or malignant melanoma visual inspection can be with unaided eye. Visual inspection via colonoscopy may be utilized for colorectal cancers and precancerous proliferation disorders such as polyps. Bronchoscopy may be used for lung cancer. Esophagoscopy may be used for esophageal cancers and precancers e.g. Barret s esophagus . Gastroscopy may be used for gastric cancers. Cystoscopy may be used for bladder cancers and precancerous proliferation disorders. Laparoscopy may be used for ovarian cancers and endometriosis. Biomarkers such as PSA PCA2 antigen and Gli Gli1 Gli2 Gli3 or a combination of two or three Gli may be assayed. For example a decreased level of expression of the Gli in the sample relative to a reference level such as a baseline is indicative of a positive clinical response to the HhP inhibitor treatment efficacy and an increased level of expression of the Gli relative to a reference level such as a baseline is indicative of a negative clinical response or lack of clinical response to the HhP inhibitor treatment lack of efficacy . Examples of other tumor markers are provided below.

Examples of imaging modalities that may be utilized include computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI ultrasound x ray and nuclear medicine scans. Palpation may be conducted for lymph nodes transrectal digital exam for prostatic cancers and a pelvic exam for ovarian cancers abdominal palpation for liver cancers primary or metastatic .

In some embodiments the monitoring comprises monitoring at least one of the following parameters tumor size rate of change in tumor size hedgehog levels or signaling appearance of new tumors rate of appearance of new tumors change in symptom of the proliferation disorder appearance of a new symptom associated with the proliferation disorder quality of life e.g. amount of pain associated with the proliferation disorder or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

As indicated above the method for treating a proliferation disorder may include monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject following administration of the HhP inhibitor wherein a lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment is indicative that the plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor should be increased further above about 1 000 ng mL and wherein the occurrence of a clinical response and a plasma trough level of the HhP inhibitor substantially higher than about 1 000 ng mL indicates that one or more subsequent doses of the HhP inhibitor can be reduced.

In some embodiments the treatment method further comprises monitoring the proliferation disorder in the subject for a clinical response. In some embodiments the clinical response is tumor response and the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors RECIST may be used to define when tumors in cancer patients improve show a clinical response stay the same stabilize or worsen progress during treatment. In some embodiments a decrease in tumor size is indicative of improvement or clinical response and an increase or no change in the size of a tumor is indicative of a lack of clinical response. The site of the tumor will depend upon the type of cancer. In basal cell carcinoma the tumor will be in the skin. The occurrence of a clinical response to the treatment after a period of time e.g. after about four weeks of administering the HhP inhibitor indicates that the HhP inhibitor dose HhP inhibitor dose frequency and choice of HhP inhibitor s currently being administered are satisfactory and the treatment may proceed in the absence of any adverse effects of the treatment. The HhP inhibitor dose and or frequency of dose may be reduced if any adverse effects are observed. A lack of clinical response in the proliferation disorder to the treatment after about four weeks of administering the HhP inhibitor can be indicative of a need to modify the treatment regimen by increasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor or increasing the frequency of the dosing of the HhP inhibitor or administering an additional HhP inhibitor before during or after the HhP inhibitor currently being administered or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. In some embodiments one or more additional HhP inhibitors are administered and the additional HhP inhibitor differs from the currently administered HhP inhibitor s in its mechanism of action by which it inhibits the HhP e.g. itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of itraconazole and vismodegib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of vismodegib . Multiple samples may be obtained and measurements determined and compared during the course of the treatment to monitor the proliferation disorder over time.

Monitoring may comprise visual inspection palpation imaging assaying the presence level or activity of one or more biomarkers associated with the proliferation disorder and or clinical response in a sample obtained from the subject or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Examples of biomarkers include Gli1 Gli2 Gli3 PSA and the plasma level of HhP inhibitor or its metabolite.

In some embodiments monitoring comprises monitoring at least one of the following parameters tumor size rate of change in tumor size hedgehog levels or signaling appearance of a new tumor rate of appearance of new tumors change in a symptom of the proliferation disorder appearance of a new symptom associated with the proliferation disorder quality of life e.g. amount of pain associated with the proliferation disorder or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Following treatment a decrease in tumor size decreased rate of tumor growth or decrease in hedgehog levels or signaling or lack of appearance of new tumors or decrease in rate of new tumors or improvement of a symptom of the proliferation disorder or lack of appearance of a new symptom of the proliferation disorder or improvement in the quality of life can indicate a clinical response i.e. that the selected HhP inhibitor s and treatment dosing regimen are satisfactory and do not need to be changed though the dose and or frequency of administration could be reduced if an adverse reaction exists . Likewise following treatment an increase in tumor size or increased rate of tumor growth or no change in tumor size or increase in hedgehog levels or signaling or appearance of new tumors or increase in rate of new tumors or worsening of a symptom of the proliferation disorder or appearance of a new symptom of the proliferation disorder or a decrease in quality of life can indicate a lack of clinical response to the treatment and can indicate a need to modify the treatment regimen by increasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor assuming that any adverse reaction if present is manageable or increasing the frequency of the dosing of the HhP inhibitor again assuming that any adverse reaction if present is manageable or administering an additional HhP inhibitor before during or after the other HhP inhibitor or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. As indicated above if one or more additional HhP inhibitors are administered it may be desirable for the additional HhP inhibitor s to differ from the currently administered HhP inhibitor s in its mechanism of action by which it inhibits the HhP e.g. itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of itraconazole and vismodegib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of vismodegib . Multiple samples may be obtained and measurements determined and compared during the course of the treatment to monitor the proliferation disorder over time.

An assessment of a subject s clinical response to HhP inhibition therapy may be made based on Hh levels or signaling which may be assessed directly or indirectly by measuring a biomarker an HhP biomarker that represents the HhP signal itself or a modulator of the HhP signal inducer or inhibitor . If the biomarker is an inhibitor of the HhP signal and the level of the inhibitor is below normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is elevated above normal. Likewise if the biomarker is an inhibitor of the HhP signal and the level of the inhibitor is above normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is reduced below normal. If the biomarker is an inducer of the HhP signal and the level of the inducer is below normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is reduced below normal. Likewise if the biomarker is an inducer of the HhP signal and the level of the biomarker is above normal an assumption may be made that the HhP signal is elevated above normal. Optionally the accuracy of the aforementioned assumptions may be confirmed by measuring HhP signaling directly or by measuring other additional HhP biomarkers.

Hh levels or signaling may be monitored by measuring a biomarker representative of HhP activity such as an Hh protein or a nucleic acid encoding an HhP protein such as an HhP ligand that activates the pathway and or an upstream or downstream component s of the HhP e.g. a receptor activator or inhibitor of hedgehog is analyzed. Ligands of the mammalian HhP include Sonic hedgehog SHH desert hedgehog DHH and Indian hedgehog DHH . The levels of Gli transcription factors may be assessed as well e.g. Gli1 Gli2 Gli3 or a combination or two or more of the foregoing .

Any of the aforementioned biomarkers can be detected in a sample obtained from the subject such as blood urine circulating tumor cells a tumor biopsy or a bone marrow biopsy. These biomarkers can also be detected by systemic administration of a labeled form of an antibody to a biomarker followed by imaging with an appropriate imaging modality. If a biomarker representative of HhP activity is measured and when compared to a reference level of that biomarker a normal control or a level measured in a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time such as before initiation of the HhP inhibitor treatment HhP signaling has increased or stayed the same following treatment with the HhP inhibitor it can indicate a lack of clinical response to the treatment and a need to modify the treatment regimen by increasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor or increasing the frequency of the dosing of the HhP inhibitor or administering an additional HhP inhibitor before during or after the HhP inhibitor currently being administered or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. As indicated above if one or more additional HhP inhibitors are administered it may be desirable for the additional HhP inhibitor s to differ from the first HhP inhibitor in its mechanism of action by which it inhibits the HhP e.g. itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of itraconazole and vismodegib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of vismodegib . If a biomarker representative of HhP activity is measured e.g. after about four weeks of administering the HhP inhibitor and when compared to a reference level of that biomarker a normal control or a level measured in a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time such as before initiation of the HhP inhibitor treatment relative reduction of HhP signaling indicates that the HhP inhibitor dose the HhP inhibitor dose frequency and the choice of HhP inhibitor s currently being administered are satisfactory and the treatment may proceed in the absence of any adverse effects of the treatment. The HhP inhibitor dose and or frequency of dose may be reduced if any adverse effects are observed. Multiple samples may be obtained and measurements determined and compared during the course of the treatment to monitor the proliferation disorder over time. By way of example if the proliferation disorder is basal cell carcinoma monitoring may comprise measuring Gli1 in a sample of skin tissue or tumor taken at one or more time points following HhP inhibitor administration e.g. after about four weeks of administering the HhP inhibitor and comparing the measured level of Gli1 to a reference level a normal control or a level measured in a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time such as before initiation of HhP inhibitor treatment . If Gli1 increases or stays the same following treatment with the HhP inhibitor it suggests a lack of clinical response to the treatment and can indicate a need to modify the treatment regimen as indicated above by increasing the dose of the HhP inhibitor or increasing the frequency of the dosing of the HhP inhibitor or administering an additional HhP inhibitor before during or after the other HhP inhibitor or a combination of two or more of the foregoing. Multiple samples may be obtained and measurements determined and compared during the course of the treatment to monitor the proliferation disorder over time.

The methods of the invention may comprise assaying the presence level or activity of one or more biomarkers in a sample obtained from a subject before during and or after administering the HhP inhibitor to the subject. In some embodiments the biomarker is associated with a proliferation disorder. For example if the proliferation disorder is a cancer the biomarker may be a tumor specific antigen or tumor associated antigen. In some embodiments the biomarker is associated with a clinical response or lack thereof such as the extent of HhP signaling. Examples of such biomarkers include Gli1 Gli2 Gli3 HhP ligand such as Sonic hedgehog SHH desert hedgehog DHH or Indian hedgehog DHH upstream or downstream component of the HhP such as a receptor activator or inhibitor PSA and the plasma level of an administered HhP inhibitor or its metabolite.

Optionally it can be determined whether the biomarker level has subsequently increased diminished or remained the same e.g. in character and or extent relative to a reference biomarker level.

An assessment can be made of the subject s biomarker level one or more times after the initial treatment with the HhP inhibitor. Preferably an assessment of the subject s biomarker level is also made before during or immediately after the subject s initial treatment with the HhP inhibitor e.g. to establish a control or base line for comparison to a subsequent assessment or assessments post treatment . This may serve as a biomarker reference level. For example an assessment of a biomarker level can be made from a sample obtained from the subject before treatment with the HhP inhibitor but after treatment with one or more other modalities such as chemotherapy immunotherapy and or surgery.

In the methods of the invention the subject s biomarker level can be monitored by making multiple assessments after the initial treatment at uniform time intervals e.g. daily weekly monthly or annually or at non uniform time intervals. Monitoring of the subject s biomarker level can continue for a pre determined period of time for a time determined based on therapeutic outcome or indefinitely. Preferably the subject s biomarker level is monitored from a time period starting prior to initial treatment with the HhP inhibitor and continuing for a period of time afterward for example for a period of at least five years or indefinitely through the subject s life.

Typically each assessment will involve obtaining an appropriate biological sample from the subject. The appropriate biological sample may depend upon the particular aspect of the subject s biomarker to be assessed e.g. depending upon the particular assay . For example in some embodiments the biological sample will be one or more specimens selected from among whole blood serum peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC and a tissue e.g. a tumor . Samples for assessments are taken at a time point appropriate to obtain information regarding the biomarker at the time of interest. For example a sample may be taken from the subject from a time prior to administration of the HhP inhibitor and additional samples may be taken from the subject periodically after administration to determine the nature and extent of the biomarker levels observed.

The presence or level of biomarkers can be determined by measuring the level of biomarker nucleic acid DNA or mRNA or protein using known techniques. For example immunological monitoring methods i.e. an immunoassay may be utilized to determine the level of biomarker such as a competitive or immunometric assay. The assay may be for example a radioimmunoassay RIA immunoradiometric assay IRMA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA dot blot slot blot enzyme linked immunosorbent spot ELISPOT assay Western blot Northern blot Southern blot peptide microarray or nucleic acid microarray. The level of biomarker can be determined using surface plasmon resonance fluorescence resonance energy transfer bioluminescence resonance energy transfer fluorescence quenching fluorescence fluorescence polarization mass spectrometry MS high performance liquid chromatography HPLC high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry HPLC MS high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry mass spectrometry HPLC MS MS capillary electrophoresis rod gel electrophoresis or slab gel electrophoresis. The level of biomarker can be determined using RT PCR PCR nucleic acid sequence based amplification assays NASBA transcription mediated amplification TMA or computerized detection matrix.

Assay standardization can include specific parameters to control for general variability such as assay conditions sensitivity and specificity of the assay any in vitro amplification step involved positive and negative controls cutoff values for determining positive and negative test results from subjects samples and any statistical analytical methods to be used for test results can be determined and selected by one of ordinary skill in the art.

A reference level of a biomarker that the determined biomarker level of the sample is compared against may be for example a level from a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time point before or after administration of the HhP inhibitor or the reference level of biomarker may be a normal level or a statistically calculated level from an appropriate subject population representing a level that is consistent with a positive desired clinical outcome i.e. the HhP inhibitor exhibits some degree of efficacy for the subject or that is inconsistent with a positive clinical outcome i.e. the HhP inhibitor does not exhibit efficacy for the subject . The reference level may be a single value e.g. a cutoff value a range etc. For example the reference level may be a range such that if the subject s biomarker level does not reach the reference level or falls within the range the subject s biomarker level is deemed acceptable and no action need be taken. Conversely if the subject s biomarker level reaches or exceeds the reference level or falls outside the acceptable range this can indicate that some action should be taken such as withholding or ceasing treatment with the HhP inhibitor or reducing the amount of HhP inhibitor administered and optionally administering an alternative treatment i.e. other than an HhP inhibitor.

Examples of biomarkers that can be determined or assayed include prostate specific antigen PSA in serum and PCA2 antigen in urine for prostate cancer. Another example of a biomarker that can be determined or assayed is Gli in whole blood serum plasma urine cerebrospinal fluid and tissue for a variety of proliferation disorders including cancers see for example U.S. Patent Publication No. 20120083419 Altaba A. et al. Methods and Compositions for Inhibiting Tumorigenesis the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety .

In some embodiments the biomarker comprises PSA. PSA also known as gamma seminoprotein or kallikrein 3 KLK3 is a glycoprotein enzyme encoded in humans by the KLK3 gene. PSA is a member of the kallikrein related peptidase family. In the methods of the invention determination or measurement of PSA level in a sample may be made directly by assessment of the amount of nucleic acid e.g. DNA or mRNA encoding PSA PSA polypeptide PSA gene product or in the activity of PSA. Examples of PSA measurement methods that may be utilized include but are not limited to those described in Blase A. B. et al. Five PSA Methods Compared by Assaying Samples with Defined PSA Ratios May 1997 43 5 843 845 Gelmini S. et al. Real time RT PCT For The Measurement of Prostate Specific Antigen mRNA Expression in Benign Hyperplasia and Adenocarcinoma of Prostate 2003 March 41 3 261 265 and Kalfazade N. et al.

In accordance with the invention PSA level may be determined by measuring total PSA tPSA measure of all PSA in a sample free PSA fPSA amount free unbound PSA protein or complex PSA cPSA the amount of PSA that is complexed with or bound to other proteins in a sample. Optionally determination of PSA level further comprises determining PSA velocity or PSA doubling time. PSA velocity is the rate of change in a subject s PSA level over time typically expressed as ng mL per year. PSA doubling time is the period of time over which a subject s PSA level doubles. Pro PSA refers to several different inactive precursors of PSA. Preferably the mature active form of PSA lacking the leader peptide is determined. However pro PSA may be measured as an alternative or in addition to the mature form Masood A. K. et al. Evolving Role of Pro PSA as a New Serum Marker for the Early Detection of Prostate Cancer 2002 4 4 198 200 .

The methods of the invention may comprise assessing the level of PSA in a sample obtained from a subject before during and or after administering the HhP inhibitor to the subject to determine whether the PSA level has subsequently increased diminished or remained the same e.g. in character and or extent relative to a reference PSA level.

An assessment can be made of the subject s PSA level one or more times after the initial treatment with the HhP inhibitor. Preferably an assessment of the subject s PSA level is also made before during or immediately after the subject s initial treatment with the HhP inhibitor e.g. to establish a control or base line for comparison to a subsequent assessment or assessments post treatment . This may serve as a PSA reference level. For example an assessment of PSA level can be made from a sample obtained from the subject before treatment with the HhP inhibitor but after treatment with one or more other modalities such as chemotherapy immunotherapy and or surgery.

In the methods of the invention the subject s PSA level can be monitored by making multiple assessments after the initial treatment at uniform time intervals e.g. daily weekly monthly or annually or at non uniform time intervals.

A reference level of PSA that the determined PSA level of the sample is compared against may be for example a level from a sample obtained from the subject at an earlier time point before or after administration of the HhP inhibitor or the reference level of PSA may be a statistically calculated level from an appropriate subject population representing a level that is consistent with a positive desired clinical outcome i.e. the HhP inhibitor exhibits some degree of efficacy for the subject or that is inconsistent with a positive clinical outcome i.e. the HhP inhibitor does not exhibit efficacy for the subject .

Conversely if the subject s PSA level reaches or exceeds the reference level or falls outside the acceptable range this can indicate that some action should be taken such as withholding or ceasing treatment with the HhP inhibitor or reducing the amount of HhP inhibitor administered and optionally administering an alternative treatment i.e. other than an HhP inhibitor.

The methods of the invention can further include the step of monitoring the subject e.g. for a change e.g. an increase or decrease in one or more of tumor size hedgehog levels or signaling stromal activation levels of one or more cancer markers the rate of appearance of new lesions the appearance of new disease related symptoms the size of soft tissue mass e.g. a decreased or stabilization quality of life e.g. amount of disease associated pain or any other parameter related to clinical outcome. The subject can be monitored in one or more of the following periods prior to beginning of treatment during the treatment or after one or more elements of the treatment have been administered. Monitoring can be used to evaluate the need for further treatment with the same HhP inhibitor alone or in combination with the same therapeutic agent or for additional treatment with additional agents. Generally a decrease in one or more of the parameters described above is indicative of the improved condition of the subject although with serum hemoglobin levels an increase can be associated with the improved condition of the subject.

The methods of the invention can further include the step of analyzing a nucleic acid or protein from the subject e.g. analyzing the genotype of the subject. In one embodiment a hedgehog protein or a nucleic acid encoding a hedgehog ligand and or an upstream or downstream component s of the hedgehog signaling e.g. a receptor activator or inhibitor of hedgehog is analyzed. The elevated hedgehog ligand can be detected in blood urine circulating tumor cells a tumor biopsy or a bone marrow biopsy. The elevated hedgehog ligand can also be detected by systemic administration of a labeled form of an antibody to a hedgehog ligand followed by imaging. In addition to determination of PSA in accordance with the invention the analysis can be used e.g. to evaluate the suitability of or to choose between alternative treatments e.g. a particular dosage mode of delivery time of delivery inclusion of adjunctive therapy e.g. administration in combination with a second agent or generally to determine the subject s probable drug response phenotype or genotype. The nucleic acid or protein can be analyzed at any stage of treatment but preferably prior to administration of the HhP inhibitor and or therapeutic agent to thereby determine appropriate dosage s and treatment regimen s of the HhP inhibitor e.g. amount per treatment or frequency of treatments for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of the subject.

In certain embodiments the methods of the invention further include the step of detecting elevated hedgehog ligand in the subject prior to or after administering a HhP inhibitor to the subject. The elevated hedgehog ligand can be detected in blood urine circulating tumor cells a tumor biopsy or a bone marrow biopsy. The elevated hedgehog ligand can also be detected by systemic administration of a labeled form of an antibody to a hedgehog ligand followed by imaging. The step of detecting elevated hedgehog ligand can include the steps of measuring hedgehog ligand in the patient prior to administration of the other cancer therapy measuring hedgehog ligand in the patient after administration of the other cancer therapy and determining if the amount of hedgehog ligand after administration of the other chemotherapy is greater than the amount of hedgehog ligand before administration of the other chemotherapy. The other cancer therapy can be for example a therapeutic agent or radiation therapy.

Hh pathway activation begins when the Hh ligand binds to and inhibits the transmembrane receptor Patched1 Ptch1 allowing the signal transducer Smoothened Smo to activate Gli transcription factors and amplify Hh target gene expression. Thus far all of the nuclear events ascribed to Hh occur through the Gli transcription factors with Gli1 acting predominantly as an activator Gli3 acting predominantly as a repressor and Gli2 possessing both repressive and activator functions.

Any HhP inhibitor may be used in the invention as a monotherapy or in combination regimens with one or more other HhP inhibitors and or in combination with one or more other therapeutic or prophylactic agents or treatments such as chemotherapeutic agents radiation surgery and immunotherapy. HhP inhibitors and biological assays and in vivo models that may be employed for the identification and characterization of inhibitors of various members of the HhP are described in Peukert S and Miller Moslin K. Small Molecule Inhibitors of the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway as Cancer Therapeutics 2010 5 4 500 512 Sahebjam et al. The Utility of Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibition for Cancer 2012 17 1090 1099 Liu H. et al. Clinical Implications of Hedgehog Signaling Pathway Inhibitors 2011 30 1 13 26 Atwood Scott X. et al. Hedgehog Pathway Inhibition and the Race Against Tumor Evolution 199 2 193 197 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20090203713 Beachy P. A. et al. Hedgehog Pathway Antagonists to Treat Disease the contents of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Drug discovery efforts aimed at identifying inhibitors of the Hh signaling pathway have facilitated the development of a multitude of biological assay systems for interrogating Hh pathway activity including cell based assays tissue assays and at least one in vivo assay and binding assays have been used to confirm the specific proteins in the pathway being targeted. In addition animal disease models have been established for a variety of cancer types including medulloblastoma basal cell carcinoma BCC breast cancer lymphoma and chronic myeloid leukemia CML as well as pancreatic prostate colorectal and small cell lung cancer SCLC . These models have been used to evaluate the effects of various small molecule HhP inhibitors on tumor growth and progression.

The Smoothened receptor Smo has thus far shown to be the most druggable target in the pathway as demonstrated by the structurally diverse array of both naturally occurring and fully synthetic small molecule Smo inhibitors reported. Efforts are ongoing to identify additional druggable nodes in the pathway and promising initial results have been demonstrated for targeting the Sonic hedgehog protein Shh and the downstream target Gli1 with small molecule inhibitors.

The most common way to target HhP is modulation of Smo. Smo is a G protein coupled receptor protein encoded by the Smo gene of the HhP. Smo is the molecular target of the teratogen cyclopamine. Antagonists and agonists of Smo have been shown to affect the pathway regulation downstream. The most clinically advanced Smo targeting agents are cyclopamine competitive. Itraconazole Sporanox has also been shown to target Smo through a mechanism distinct from cyclopamine and vismodegib. Itraconazole inhibits Smo in the presence of mutations conferring resistance to vismodegib and other cyclopamine competitive antagonists such as IPI 926 and LDE 225. Ptch and Gli3 5E1 antibodies are also a way to regulate the pathway. A downstream effector and strong transcriptional activator siRNA Gli1 has been used to inhibit cell growth and promote apoptosis. Arsenic trioxide Trisenox has also been shown to inhibit hedgehog signaling by interfering with Gli function and transcription.

As used herein the terms hedgehog inhibitor hedgehog pathway inhibitor HhP inhibitor or in most contexts inhibitor refer to an agent capable of blocking or reducing cellular responses to the hedgehog signaling pathway e.g. in cells with an active hedgehog signaling pathway and more specifically inhibiting cellular responses directly or indirectly to the hedgehog family of secreted growth factors. The hedgehog inhibitor may antagonize hedgehog pathway activity through a number of routes including but not limited to by interfering with the inhibitory effect that Ptch exerts on Smo by activating Smo without affecting Ptc by influencing Smo function by directly binding to Smo and or by activating the pathway downstream of Smo. Exemplary hedgehog inhibitors may include but are not limited to steroidal alkaloids such as cyclopamine and jervine. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor antagonizes HhP activity by binding to a component effector molecule of the pathway e.g. a Hedgehog receptor such as Ptch or Smo or a signaling mediator such as Gli1 Gli2 or Gli3 interfering with the inhibitory effect that a component of the pathway exerts on another component of the pathway by activating a component of the pathway without affecting another component by activating a component of the pathway downstream of Smo or by reducing or eliminating expression of a component of the pathway. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor antagonizes HhP activity by binding to Smo interfering with the inhibitory effect that Ptch exerts on Smo by activating Smo without affecting Ptch by activating the pathway downstream of Smo or by reducing or eliminating expression of Smo. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is cyclopamine competitive. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is cyclopamine competitive and the proliferation disorder is lung cancer basal cell carcinoma prostate cancer or other cancer. The HhP inhibitor may be any class of agent or treatment capable of blocking or reducing cellular responses to the HhP and may be for example a polypeptide e.g. protein peptide immunoglobulin antibody or antibody fragment a nucleic acid e.g. antisense molecule ribozyme or interfering RNA such as siRNA or shRNA or a small molecule. The HhP inhibitor may be active upon administration to the subject and or active upon metabolic processing or other mechanisms in vivo i.e. as one or more active metabolites .

Although the term HhP inhibitor and its grammatical variants are used herein to refer to agents capable of blocking or reducing cellular responses to the hedgehog signaling pathway e.g. in cells with an active hedgehog signaling pathway and more specifically inhibiting cellular responses directly or indirectly to the hedgehog family of secreted growth factors the invention encompasses use of HhP inhibitors to treat proliferation disorders e.g. cancer whether that particular agent s primary mechanism of action in treating the proliferation disorder in question is through the above described HhP inhibition or through some other mechanism of action such as inhibition of angiogenesis. For example itraconazole is an HhP inhibitor and inhibits angiogenesis. In treating some cancers in accordance with the invention the HhP inhibitor may act by a mechanism completely independent of its HhP inhibition properties. Thus the identification of an agent as being an HhP inhibitor is not limited to the context in which it is being used but rather to its ability to inhibit the HhP.

Suitable hedgehog inhibitors for use with the present invention include for example those described and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7 230 004 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0293754 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0287420 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0293755 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0019961 the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein.

HhP inhibitors useful in the current invention can contain a basic functional group such as amino or alkylamino and are thus capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts in this respect refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process or by separately treating the compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. Representative salts include the hydrobromide hydrochloride sulfate bisulfate phosphate nitrate acetate valerate oleate palmitate stearate laurate benzoate lactate phosphate tosylate citrate maleate fumarate succinate tartrate naphthylate mesylate besylate glucoheptonate lactobionate and laurylsulphonate salts and the like see for example Berge et al. Pharmaceutical Salts 1977 66 1 19 .

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include but are not limited to conventional nontoxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds e.g. from non toxic organic or inorganic acids. For example such conventional nontoxic salts include but are not limited to those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloride hydrobromic sulfuric sulfamic phosphoric nitric and the like and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic propionic succinic glycolic stearic lactic malic tartaric citric ascorbic palmitic maleic hydroxymaleic phenylacetic glutamic benzoic salicyclic sulfanilic 2 acetoxybenzoic fumaric toluenesulfonic methanesulfonic benzenesulfonic ethane disulfonic oxalic isothionic and the like.

In other cases the HhP inhibitors can contain one or more acidic functional groups and thus are capable of forming pharmaceutically acceptable salts with pharmaceutically acceptable bases. The term pharmaceutically acceptable salts in these instances refers to the relatively non toxic inorganic and organic base addition salts of compounds of the present invention. These salts can likewise be prepared in situ in the administration vehicle or the dosage form manufacturing process or by separately treating the compound in its free acid form with a suitable base such as the hydroxide carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation with ammonia or with a pharmaceutically acceptable organic primary secondary or tertiary amine. Representative alkali or alkaline earth salts include the lithium sodium potassium calcium magnesium and aluminum salts and the like. Representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylamine diethylamine ethylenediamine ethanolamine diethanolamine piperazine and the like.

If administered with another therapeutic agent the HhP inhibitor and the therapeutic agent can be administered as separate compositions e.g. pharmaceutical compositions or administered separately but via the same route e.g. both orally or both intravenously or administered in the same composition e.g. pharmaceutical composition.

In one embodiment the HhP inhibitor is administered prior to detection of the proliferation disorder. In another embodiment the HhP inhibitor is administered after detection of the proliferation disorder. In one embodiment the proliferation disorder is cancer prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer or other cancer and the HhP inhibitor is administered prior to detection of the cancer. In another embodiment the proliferation disorder is cancer prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer or other cancer and the HhP inhibitor is administered after detection of the cancer.

Some HhP inhibitors may comprise one or more asymmetric centers and thus can exist in various isomeric forms i.e. stereoisomers enantiomers diastereomers cis trans isomers E Z isomers etc. . Thus HhP inhibitors can be in the form of an individual enantiomer diastereomer or other geometric isomer or can be in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers. Enantiomers diastereomers and other geometric isomers can be isolated from mixtures including racemic mixtures by any method known to those skilled in the art including chiral high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC and the formation and crystallization of chiral salts or prepared by asymmetric syntheses see for example Jacques et al. Enantiomers Racemates and Resolutions Wiley Interscience New York 1981 Wilen S. H. et al. 1977 33 2725 Eliel E. L. Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds McGraw Hill NY 1962 Wilen S. H.

Itraconazole a Commonly Used Antifungal that Inhibits Hedgehog Pathway Activity and Cancer Growth 2010 17 4 388 399 Patent Publication No. WO 2008 124132 Liu J. et al. entitled Chirally Pure Isomers of Itraconazole and Inhibitors of Lanosterol 14A Demethylase For Use as Angiogenesis Inhibitors . In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor comprises a stereoisomer of itraconazole selected from 2R 4S 2 R 2R 4S 2 S 2S 4R 2S R or 2S 4R2 S . In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor comprises an itraconazole analogue in which the sec butyl side chain has been replaced with one or more moieties relative to itraconazole. For example the itraconazole analogue may be one in which the native sec butyl side chain is replaced with C Calkyl C Calkenyl or C Calkynyl that are straight branched or cyclic and are unsubstituted or substituted one or more times at any position with a C Calkoxy C Caryl N OH Cl Br I F C Caryl oxy C Calkyl carboxy aryl carboxy wherein any substituent can be further substituted with any of the foregoing.

In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is an azole antifungal drug containing composition as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20030225104 Hayes et al. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Poorly Soluble Drugs issued as U.S. Pat. No. 6 881 745 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . In some embodiments the composition in vivo provides a mean Cof at least about 100 ng ml e.g. 150 to 250 ng ml after administration in the fasted state. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is a composition including an azole antifungal drug such as itraconazole and at least one polymer having one or more acidic functional groups. In a particularly preferred form the polymer is a polycarboxylic acid such as a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate such as that available from Shin Etsu Chemical Industry Co Ltd as HP 50 HP 55 or HP 55S. In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is a composition including an azole antifungal drug such as itraconazole and at least one polymer having one or more acidic functional groups wherein the composition in vivo provides a mean Cof at least 100 ng ml e.g. 150 to 250 ng ml . In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is a composition including about 100 mg of an azole antifungal drug such as itraconazole and optionally at least one polymer having acidic functional groups.

In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is the SUBACAP formulation of itraconazole. The SUBACAP formulation is a solid dispersion wherein itraconazole is associated with acidic molecules and the formulation allows for excellent absorption at pH 5.5 7. Itraconazole release occurs in the intestines therefore fed or fasted state does not affect the absorption nor are there restrictions for achlorhydric patients or patients on proton pump inhibitor drugs for high acid control.

In some embodiments an HhP inhibitor such as itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite thereof is administered in a SUBA formulation at a dose in the range of 100 mg to 600 mg per day. In some embodiments 150 mg of an HhP inhibitor such as itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite thereof is administered in a SUBA formulation two or more times per day. In some embodiments 200 mg of an HhP inhibitor such as itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite thereof is administered in a SUBA formulation two or more times per day.

One aspect of the invention concerns a method for treating a proliferation disorder in a subject comprising administering a composition comprising a Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor to the subject wherein the composition is administered preferably orally in an effective amount to achieve a plasma trough level of at least about 1 000 ng mL of the HhP inhibitor.

The method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment and method of determining the efficacy of HhP inhibitor therapy may further comprise administering an HhP inhibitor therapy. Thus another aspect of the invention concerns a method for treating prostate cancer in a subject comprising administering Hedgehog pathway HhP inhibitor therapy to the subject and carrying out a method of the invention i.e. a method of prognosticating an outcome of prostate cancer treatment with a HhP inhibitor therapy or a method of determining the efficacy of HhP inhibitor therapy .

In treating a proliferation disorder e.g. prostate cancer basal cell carcinoma lung cancer or other cancer one or more HhP inhibitors and compositions containing them may be administered by any route effective for delivery to the desired tissues e.g. administered orally parenterally e.g. intravenously intramuscularly sublingually buccally rectally intranasally intrabronchially intrapulmonarily intraperitoneally topically transdermally and subcutaneously for example. The HhP inhibitors can be formulated for the most effective route of administration. For example an HhP inhibitor may be administered orally or locally e.g. by direct injection to a desired site such as a precancerous lesion or tumor e.g. prostate cancer lesion or prostate tumor or other cancer tumor . The amount administered in a single dose may be dependent on the subject being treated the subject s weight the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Generally however administration and dosage and the duration of time for which a composition is administered will approximate those which are necessary to achieve a desired result.

The selected dosage level of the HhP inhibitor will depend upon a variety of factors including for example the activity of the particular compound employed the route of administration the time of administration the rate of excretion or metabolism of the particular compound being employed the rate and extent of absorption the duration of the treatment other drugs compounds and or materials used in combination with the particular compound employed the age sex weight condition general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated and like factors well known in the medical arts.

In general a suitable daily dose of an HhP inhibitor will be that amount of the inhibitor which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. Generally oral intravenous and subcutaneous doses of the HhP inhibitor for a subject when used for the indicated effects will range from about 0.0001 mg to about 1000 mg per day or about 0.001 mg to about 1000 mg per day or about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day or about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg per day or about 0.0001 mg to about 600 mg per day or about 0.001 mg to about 600 mg per day or about 0.01 mg to about 600 mg per day or about 0.1 mg to about 600 mg per day or about 200 mg to 600 mg per day. The optimal pharmaceutical formulations can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art depending upon the route of administration and desired dosage.

In some embodiments the HhP inhibitor is administered with one or more other therapeutic treatments before during or after the HhP inhibitor. The HhP inhibitor and the therapeutic agent that is a non HhP inhibitor can be administered within the same formulation or different formulations. If administered in different formulations the HhP inhibitor and the therapeutic agent can be administered by the same route or by different routes.

Depending on the intended mode of administration the inhibitors and therapeutic agents used in the methods described herein may be in the form of solid semi solid or liquid dosage forms such as for example tablets suppositories pills capsules powders liquids suspensions lotions creams gels or the like preferably in unit dosage form suitable for single administration of a precise dosage. Each dose may include an effective amount of a compound used in the methods described herein in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and in addition may include other medicinal agents pharmaceutical agents carriers adjuvants diluents etc.

Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can prepared for example by dissolving dispersing etc. a compound for use in the methods described herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in an excipient such as for example water saline aqueous dextrose glycerol ethanol and the like to thereby form a solution or suspension. For solid compositions conventional nontoxic solid carriers include for example pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharin talc cellulose glucose sucrose magnesium carbonate and the like. If desired the pharmaceutical composition to be administered may also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents pH buffering agents and the like for example sodium acetate sorbitan monolaurate triethanolamine sodium acetate triethanolamine oleate etc. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in this art see for example Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 18th Ed. 1990 Mack Publishing Co.

In some embodiments 500 mg mpemetrexed and 75 mg mcisplatin are administered intravenously.

It has been demonstrated that HhP inhibitors e.g. itraconazole are capable of delaying or inhibiting tumor cell growth. Using the methods of the invention the HhP inhibitors can be administered locally at the site of a tumor e.g. by direct injection or remotely from the site e.g. systemically . As used herein the term tumor refers to all neoplastic cell growth and proliferation whether malignant or benign and all pre cancerous and cancerous cells and tissues. For example a particular cancer may be characterized by a solid mass tumor or non solid tumor. The solid tumor mass if present may be a primary tumor mass. A primary tumor mass refers to a growth of cancer cells in a tissue resulting from the transformation of a normal cell of that tissue. In most cases the primary tumor mass is identified by the presence of a cyst which can be found through visual or palpation methods or by irregularity in shape texture or weight of the tissue. However some primary tumors are not palpable and can be detected only through medical imaging techniques such as X rays e.g. mammography or magnetic resonance imaging MRI or by needle aspirations. The use of these latter techniques is more common in early detection. Molecular and phenotypic analysis of cancer cells within a tissue can usually be used to confirm if the cancer is endogenous to the tissue or if the lesion is due to metastasis from another site.

According to the method of the subject invention an HhP inhibitor can be administered to a subject by itself or co administered with one or more other agents such as an HhP inhibitor or a different agent or agents. In some embodiments the additional agent is one or more anti cancer agents. Anti cancer agents include but are not limited to the chemotherapeutic agents listed in Table 2.

Co administration can be carried out simultaneously in the same or separate formulations or consecutively with the additional agent administered before and or after one or more HhP inhibitors. Furthermore HhP inhibitors can be administered to a subject as adjuvant therapy. For example one or more HhP inhibitors can be administered to a patient in conjunction with one or more chemotherapeutic agents.

Thus the HhP inhibitor s whether administered separately or as a pharmaceutical composition can include various other components as additives. Examples of acceptable components or adjuncts which can be employed in relevant circumstances include antioxidants free radical scavenging agents peptides growth factors antibiotics bacteriostatic agents immunosuppressives anticoagulants buffering agents anti inflammatory agents anti angiogenics anti pyretics time release binders anesthetics steroids and corticosteroids. Such components can provide additional therapeutic benefit act to affect the therapeutic action of the HhP inhibitor or act towards preventing any potential side effects which may be posed as a result of administration of these agents. The HhP inhibitor can be conjugated to a therapeutic agent as well.

In some embodiments two or more HhP inhibitors are administered to the subject simultaneously in the same or different formulations or sequentially. The HhP inhibitors may act on the same member of the HhP whether in similar or distinct manners or on different members of the pathway. For example it may be desirable to administer HhP inhibitors that inhibit the HhP pathway at different points in the pathway or by different mechanisms. For example while both itraconazole and vismodegib target Smo they differ in the way they bind and act on the receptor inhibiting the HhP by different mechanisms of action. Vismodegib acts as a cylcopamine competitive antagonist of the Smo receptor causing the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 to remain inactive which inhibits the expression of tumor mediating genes within the HhP. In contrast itraconazole inhibits activation of the HhP by targeting Smo at a site distinct from that of cyclopamine mimics currently in development. The Smo protein can generally be activated by its translocation to the primary cilium and or by changing its configuration. Vismodegib works on Smo effectively by ensuring that the protein does not change its configuration whereas itraconazole works by preventing its translocation. These distinctions are supported by the ability of these two drugs to synergize. Accordingly in some embodiments one or more additional HhP inhibitors are administered and the additional HhP inhibitor differs from the first HhP inhibitor in its mechanism of action by which it inhibits the HhP e.g. itraconazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of itraconazole and vismodegib or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt prodrug stereoisomer or active metabolite of vismodegib .

Additional agents that can be co administered to target cells in vitro or in vivo such as in a subject in the same or as a separate formulation include those that modify a given biological response such as immunomodulators.

As used herein the term efficacy in the context of HhP inhibitory therapy refers to the ability of the therapy as monotherapy or in combination therapy with another HhP inhibitor or other agent that is not an HhP inhibitor to alleviate one or more symptoms of the proliferation disorder e.g. cancer diminish the extent of disease stabilize i.e. not worsening the state of the disease delay or slow disease progression amelioration or palliation of the disease state remission whether partial or total whether detectable or undetectable tumor regression inhibit tumor growth inhibit tumor metastasis reduce cancer cell number inhibit cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs increase progression free survival improve progression free survival improve time to disease progression TTP improve response rate RR prolonged overall survival OS prolong time to next treatment TNTT or prolong time from first progression to next treatment or a combination of two or more of the foregoing.

As used herein the terms anticancer agent conventional anticancer agent or cancer therapeutic drug refer to any therapeutic agents e.g. chemotherapeutic compounds and or molecular therapeutic compounds radiation therapies or surgical interventions used in the treatment of cancer e.g. in mammals . HhP inhibitors may be administered with a therapeutic agent such as an anticancer agent.

As used herein the terms drug and chemotherapeutic agent refer to pharmacologically active molecules that are used to diagnose treat or prevent diseases or pathological conditions in a physiological system e.g. a subject or in vivo in vitro or ex vivo cells tissues and organs . Drugs act by altering the physiology of a living organism tissue cell or in vitro system to which the drug has been administered. It is intended that the terms drug and chemotherapeutic agent encompass anti hyperproliferative and antineoplastic compounds as well as other biologically therapeutic compounds.

As used herein the term solvate refers to an HhP inhibitor having either a stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amount of a solvent associated with the compound. The solvent can be water i.e. a hydrate and each molecule of inhibitor can be associated with one or more molecules of water e.g. monohydrate dihydrate trihydrate etc. . The solvent can also be an alcohol e.g. methanol ethanol propanol isopropanol etc. a glycol e.g. propylene glycol an ether e.g. diethyl ether an ester e.g. ethyl acetate or any other suitable solvent. The hedgehog inhibitor can also exist as a mixed solvate i.e. associated with two or more different solvents .
