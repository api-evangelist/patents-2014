The present invention generally relates to a payment card and in particular to a payment card with anti skimming functions and features.

Payment cards such as credit cards or debit cards have been used widely by consumers to make payments at various merchants. During a payment process at a merchant the merchant typically reads a customer s payment card by swiping the payment card at a card reader. The card reader reads the magnetic stripe on the payment card to receive information about the payment card. Card skimming is the fraudulent practice of obtaining the card information of a payment card by swiping the payment card at an illegitimate card reader without the card owner s consent or authorization. Card skimming typically occurs in the absence of the customer such as when a merchant takes the payment card away from the customer to process payment. The merchant or an employee of the merchant may first swipe the payment card at a legitimate card reader to process the legitimate payment authorized by the customer and then perform an additional swipe at an illegitimate card reader to skim the card information from the payment card. The skimmed card information may then be collected and used for fraudulent transactions in the future. Thus there is a need for a device system and method that prevents such card skimming practices.

Embodiments of the present disclosure and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures wherein showings therein are for purposes of illustrating embodiments of the present disclosure and not for purposes of limiting the same.

A magnetic stripe emulator and a read sensor also may be provided in the payment card . The read sensor is configured to detect a reading of the payment card by a card reader. The read sensor may include a magnetic field sensor such as a Hall effect sensor or a solenoid. As such the read sensor may detect a presence and movement of a magnetic head of a card reader when the payment card is swiped at the card reader.

The magnetic stripe emulator is configured to emulate the magnetic stripe of conventional payment card when the payment card is swiped and read by a card reader. In particular the magnetic stripe emulator may include a solenoid configured to emit a sequence of magnetic signal mimicking the magnetic signal of a magnetic stripe when the payment card is swiped through a card reader. A current generator may be used to generate and feed pulses of currents through the solenoid to generate particular patterns of magnetic signals. For example a sequence of electrical current pulses may be fed through the solenoid of the magnetic stripe emulator to generate a particular sequence of magnetic signals. By varying the sequence of current pulses the magnetic stripe emulator may emulate the magnetic stripes of different payment cards. In an embodiment the magnetic stripe emulator and the read sensor may be implemented as one unit. In another embodiment the magnetic stripe emulator may be implemented as a separate unit.

The payment card also may include a communication device . The communication device may include one or more of a Bluetooth communication module a Bluetooth Low Energy BLE module a Near Field Communication NFC module a WiFi communication module and the like. As such the payment card may communicate with user device or other devices via the communication device .

In some embodiments the payment card may be a simple payment card with one or more fixed or preset card numbers and including the read sensor . For example the simple payment card may have one card number or have two card numbers that are selectable by the user . The simple payment card may have the read sensor and a conventional magnetic stripe. The controller may provide indication to the user such as by an LED light red or green that additional swipes have been performed on the payment card.

At step the payment card may receive payment card profiles. The user may have one or more payment card accounts from different banks such as various credit card accounts debit card accounts and the like. Each payment card profile may include the payment card number the expiration date the name on the payment card the card security code name of the payment network such as VISA MASTERCARD AMERICAN EXPRESS and the like billing address billing zip code and other information. As noted above the user may have more than one payment card. Each payment card may have a payment card profile. The user may select payment cards that the user wishes to be incorporated into the payment card to be emulated by the payment card .

The user may enter the payment card profiles through the payment card or the user device . For example the user may enter the payment card profiles by operating a touch screen or input device at the payment card . In another example the user may enter the payment card profiles at the user device and the user device may upload the payment card profiles to the payment card via wired or wireless communication such as Bluetooth or BLE communication. In still another example the user device may include a camera or scanner that may capture an image of the payment cards. The user device may analyze the image to extract the payment card information from the image of the payment cards by optical character recognition technique. As such the user need not type or input the payment card information manually. This may provide additional convenience to the user .

Each payment card profile also may include settings on how a payment card should be used or emulated by the payment card for payment transactions. For example the user may designate certain payment cards for use at certain merchants. In another example the user may designate certain payment cards for use at certain time day location country situation merchant and the like.

In an embodiment the user may set a payment card profile as the default or primary payment card profile which the payment card would emulate by default for payment transactions unless the user indicates otherwise. The user also may set one or more secondary payment card profiles when the default or primary payment card profile is not activated or is not accepted for a payment transaction.

In an embodiment the user may set limits on the number of reads or swipes for the payment card . The limits on the number of reads may be designated for different locations such as different countries cities or merchant stores different times such as seasons weekends weekdays and time. In an embodiment the limits on the number of reads may be designated for different connection statuses of the payment card . For example the payment card may be allowed unlimited number of swipes when the payment card is connected to the user device via BLE indicating that the payment card is in the presence of the user . The payment card may be limited to one swipe when the payment card is disconnected from the user device indicating that the payment card has departed from the presence of the user . This may prevent others from skimming the payment card with additional swipes when the payment card is not in the user s presence.

In an embodiment the user may set the security measures that may be implemented when the payment card exceeds the swiping limit. For example the payment card may be disabled or rendered unreadable when the swiping limit is reached. The payment card may require user authentication to be enabled. In another example the payment card may allow the above limit swipe but may notify the user with regard to the additional swipe later. The payment card may send a request to the user device to approve an additional swipe over the swiping limit. In an embodiment the payment card may switch to another payment card profile when the swipe limit is exceeded. For example the payment card may use a payment card profile that has better security safeguards for the above limit swipe to protect the user from potential fraudulent charges.

After the user has uploaded the payment card profiles into the payment card. and designated various payment settings for the payment card the payment card is ready to be used for payment transactions. At step the payment card may receive instructions for payment. When the user is ready to use the payment card to make a payment the user may take the payment card out and may swipe the payment card at a merchant s card reader. In an embodiment the user may provide the payment card to an employee of the merchant such as at a restaurant and the employee may leave with the payment card to process payment.

Before swiping the card the user may select a payment card profile to use for the payment transaction. For example the user may select one payment card profile from a plurality of credit cards and debit cards that previously were uploaded into the payment card . The user also may designate security measures before providing the payment card to others for payment. For example the user may set a swipe limit on the payment card for the specific current payment transaction. In an embodiment the payment card selection and the security settings may have been set previously by the user . For example based on the location of the user detected by the user device and or the connection status of the payment card the payment card may automatically select a particular payment card to use and the security settings for the payment transaction.

At step the payment card may select the payment card profile to emulate. The controller may receive the payment card profile selection via an input device such as a touch screen at the payment card or via the communication device from the user device . The controller may then retrieve the selected payment card profile. The controller may generate a set of current signals to emulate the selected payment card based on the payment card s number expiration date name service code and the like. The controller also may check the security settings related to the selected payment card profile to determine whether additional security requirements are needed before using the payment card profile. For example the selected payment card profile may require user authentication such as fingerprint scanning or PIN entry before the selected payment card can be emulated or used at payment card . In another example the selected payment card profile may have a swipe limit on how many times the payment card can be read or swiped.

The controller may control the display to display the name logo or picture of the currently selected payment card profile to show the user which payment card is currently being used for payment at the payment card . The controller also may display additional information such as a swipe limit security requirements for using the card and the like. After a payment card profile is properly selected and the selected payment card is activated to be used through the payment card the payment card may detect and count the number of reads or swipes at step . The read sensor at the payment card may detect or sense a presence and movement of a magnetic head of a card reader when the payment card is swiped and read at the card reader. The read sensor may generate and send a signal to the controller each time the read sensor detects the magnetic head of the card reader. The controller may count the number of times the payment card is read or swiped by card readers.

At step the payment card may implement security measures based on the number reads detected by the read sensor . If the number of reads detected is less than the limit the payment card may emulate the selected payment card when swiped. For example when the read sensor detects that the payment card is in the process of being swiped by a card reader the controller may control the magnetic stripe emulator to emulate the magnetic stripe of the selected payment card by emitting a similar magnetic signal when the payment card passes through the card reader. As such the card reader may receive the magnetic signal embedded with the card information of the selected payment card such as card number name expiration date security code and the like. The card reader may relay the card information to the payment network for payment processing.

If the number of reads detected by the read sensor is equal to or exceeded the limit the controller may implement security measures as designated by the user. In an embodiment the controller may disable the magnetic strip emulator such that the payment card can no longer be used for payment. Thus even if the payment card is swiped at a card reader no signal is emitted to the card reader. The controller also may control the display to indicate that the payment card is temporarily disabled and provide instructions on how to enable it. For example the display may display a message Payment card disabled. Please return to card owner who may activate the payment card. Thus the payment card may be returned to the user and the user may re enable the payment card by entering a PIN or by fingerprint scanning. In another embodiment the payment card may be re enabled upon detection that the card is back in the user s possession such as co located with the user device e.g. smart phone or other wearable in communication with the user device etc.

In an embodiment the payment card may allow the additional swipe exceeding the limit. The payment card may later notify the user of the additional swipe at the user device when the payment card is brought back to the user and the payment card is again connected to the user device . For example a message The payment card was swiped three times which is two times above the limit may be displayed to the user at the user device . As such the user may be notified to take necessary measures. In an embodiment the payment card may record the time date and location of each swipe to establish a swipe history. As such when there is a security breach in a payment card account the user may back track to find out where the card skimming activity may have occurred. In another embodiment when the swipe limit has been reached or exceeded the user may be notified such as through the user s device and be allowed to authorize additional swipe s such as by returning an authorization through text email or the like. This can include entering a password or PIN into the user device.

In an embodiment the payment card may have different security settings for different locations and or different connection status. In particular the payment card may have different security settings based on a combination of other user devices connected to the payment card . For example the payment card may allow unlimited number of swipes if the payment card is connected to two or more of the user s devices such as mobile devices and or wearable devices. The payment card may allow unlimited number of swipes after user authentication at the payment card such as by fingerprint scanning or PIN entry when the payment card is connected to a user device. The payment card may allow only one swipe after the payment card is disconnected from the user device indicating that the payment card has departed from the user s presence.

In an embodiment the payment card may detect location or receive location information from the user device and may implement security settings based on the location information. For example the payment card may allow unlimited swipes when the user is at a merchant trusted by the user or a merchant that the user frequently visits. The payment card may require user authentication for each swipe when the user is in a new location.

In an embodiment the payment card may select a payment card profile to use based on the number of swipes detected by the read sensor . For example the payment card may allow one swipe with the primary payment card which provides the user with more reward benefits. The primary payment card may have lower security protection. As such for subsequent swipes the payment card may switch to a secondary payment card which provides more security protection but has lower reward benefits.

In an embodiment the payment card may detect the type of card reader based on the pattern of magnetic signals detected at the read sensor . For example if the read sensor detects a relative fast movement or passing of a magnetic head of a card reader the controller may determine that the payment card is being swiped at a typical POS card reader. If the read sensor detects a slow and steady movement of a magnetic head of a card reader and the read sensor is read two times in opposite directions the controller may determine that the payment card is being used at an automated machine such as an ATM machine. Thus the controller may adjust the read count accordingly. For example two reads at an ATM machine may be counted as one reading even though payment card passes the card reader twice once for being inserted into the machine and once for exiting the machine after the transaction.

In an embodiment the payment card may detect the pattern of swiping motion to learn the user s swiping signature. As such the controller may determine whether the payment card is swiped by the user or by others. The controller may implement security measures based on the swiping motion detected by the read sensor . For example the controller may allow a higher swiping limit without user authentication when the swiping motion resembles that of the user . The controller may have a lower swiping limit and may require user authentication when the swiping motion does not resemble that of the user .

In an embodiment the payment card may generate and embed security information in the signals generated at the magnetic stripe emulator based on the number of swipes detected. For example when the payment card has exceeded the limit number of swipes the payment card may add a flap or a security code in the emulated magnetic stripe signal to indicate to the merchant the issuer acquirer bank the payment network and or a payment service provider that the payment transaction has an elevated risk of being compromised. Thus the related financial or payment service providers may take additional pre caution in processing such transactions.

In an embodiment the payment card may delay magnetic emulator to emulate a magnetic stripe after each scan or each swipe. This may prevent the fraudulent practice in which false ATM fronts are installed over real units. When a false front is installed at an ATM machine the payment card may be scanned by the false front before entering the real ATM machine. Thus by adding some delay such as a 10 second delay between magnetic stripe emulations the payment card may prevent the false front from reading the payment card. Although the false front may read the payment card the ATM would not be able to and the user may be alerted to the potential for theft of the payment card and thus avoid giving up their PIN because the real ATM machine would reject and return the card as unreadable.

In an embodiment the payment card may include a conventional magnetic stripe a magnetic stripe masking device and the read sensor . When a skimming event is detected the payment card may be locked out for certain period of time during which the magnetic stripe masking device may generate noise to mask the signals of the conventional magnetic stripe when read by a card reader.
