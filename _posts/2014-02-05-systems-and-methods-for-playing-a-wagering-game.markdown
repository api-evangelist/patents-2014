Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods for playing online poker and other wagering games.

Poker is a card game in which a group of players are dealt one or more playing cards sometimes referred to as hole cards to form a hand of cards. In some embodiments the players may replace one or more of the dealt cards with newly dealt cards and or with cards that are shared between the players sometimes referred to as community cards . The players may place bets on the outcome of the game and the bets are collected in a pot. The player or players with the highest ranked hand or in some cases the lowest ranked hand wins the pot or the pot may be split between the players with the lowest ranked hand and the highest ranked hand.

Online poker is a form of poker in which the game is provided over a network by one or more computers. The various components of the poker game such as the table the playing cards the dealer etc. are represented virtually by the computers. In addition the players typically are represented virtually within the game by one or more avatars or icons for example.

Some online poker players desire to play multiple online poker games at once sometimes referred to as multitabling . The players typically will play on a plurality of tables provided by an online poker operator or website. In this manner the players hope to increase the amount of money they may win over a period of time. However many online poker operators or websites either do not allow players to multitable or are not optimized for multitabling. Accordingly the players desiring to multitable may experience inefficiencies in the multitable implementation and or may not be able to play on the number or type of tables desired.

In addition online poker websites may experience large fluctuations in the amount of players visiting the site. For example some websites experience player fluctuations of up to 1000 between peak periods and non peak periods. Such fluctuations may strain the computing resources required to provide the poker games to the players. Accordingly at least some websites or online poker operators may be required to procure computing resources that are sufficient to meet an expected peak demand for the poker games. However if the demand for the poker games drops e.g. fewer players request to play games on the website the computing resources may be underutilized leading to unnecessary expenditures to maintain the underutilized resources.

In one embodiment a game system for providing one or more wagering games is disclosed that includes a game server configured to connect to at least one gaming device over a network. The game server includes a processor further configured to provide at least one wagering game to a player using the gaming device. Each wagering game is played by a plurality of players at a virtual table who are dealt a plurality of cards to form a hand and the hand satisfying a winning criterion is determined to be a winning hand. The game system also includes at least one non relational database configured to be connected to the game server. The database is further configured to store a state of the hands of each table as a plurality of document oriented datasets.

In another embodiment a method of providing one or more wagering games is disclosed. The method includes connecting at least one gaming device to a game server over a network and providing by the game server at least one wagering game to a player using the gaming device. Each wagering game is played by a plurality of players at a virtual table who are dealt a plurality of cards to form a hand and the hand satisfying a winning criterion is determined to be a winning hand. The method also includes connecting at least one non relational database to the game server and storing a state of the hands of each table as a plurality of document oriented datasets within the non relational database.

In yet another embodiment a system for providing one or more wagering games is disclosed. The system includes a game system having a game server that includes at least one first processor configured to provide at least one wagering game to a player using the gaming device. Each wagering game is played by a plurality of players at a virtual table who are dealt a plurality of cards to form a hand and the hand satisfying a winning criterion is determined to be a winning hand. The game system also includes at least one non relational database configured to be connected to the game server. The database is further configured to store a state of the hands of each table as a plurality of document oriented datasets. The system also includes a gaming device configured to connect to the game server over a network. The gaming device includes at least one second processor configured to enable the player to play the wagering game.

Systems and methods for playing a wagering game are described herein. In one embodiment the systems and methods enable one or more players to play a game of online poker. Alternatively any suitable wagering game may be played using the systems and methods described herein.

In one embodiment of online poker a player uses a gaming device to connect to a game system. The gaming device may be authenticated by the game system and a game server within the game system may provide the poker game to the player through the gaming device. For example the player may select one or more tables at which to play the game and the player may be virtually seated at the selected table. In one embodiment an avatar representing the player may be seated at the table and other competing players may also be virtually seated at the table through their respective avatars.

The player may select one or more widgets to enable the player to enhance the poker game experience. For example the player may select a note taking widget that enables the player to rank and or take notes about one or more competitors at the table. The avatar of the competitor that the player ranked may be highlighted or otherwise marked according to the ranking given by the player. For example the player may rank one or more competitors as strong players so that the respective avatars are highlighted or outlined in red and may rank one or more competitors as weak players so that the respective avatars are highlighted or outlined in green. The above examples are merely for illustration and it should be recognized that any suitable ranking and or marking may be used as desired. In addition any other suitable widget may be selected and used within the game.

The player may also choose to play on a plurality of poker tables at the same time i.e. the player may multitable . In one embodiment a plurality of tables that the player has selected to play are displayed in a queue of tables. The tables in the queue may be ordered and or prioritized based on a priority of the action required to be taken at each table. In one embodiment the priority of the action required to be taken is based on an amount of time remaining for the player to act at the table such as by betting calling raising checking or folding. If the player acts at a table the table may be re positioned or moved to a lowest position or any other position of priority within the queue. It should be recognized that in some embodiments the player may enter an action out of turn at one or more tables in the queue such as by selecting an icon or button to check or fold a hand. When it becomes the player s turn the action entered out of turn is then automatically implemented.

In some embodiments a state of the tables and or the players hands may be stored in a database such as a non relational database that stores document oriented data. This allows the tables and the hands to be persistently stored in a flexible state within a database rather than within memory of the game server. In addition if the game server becomes inaccessible or crashes for example the states of the tables and hands may be recoverable when the game server is restored. The number of tables provided by the game system may also be scaled efficiently using the non relational database to accommodate increased or decreased player activity.

A technical effect of the systems and methods described herein includes one or more of a connecting at least one gaming device to a game server over a network b providing by the game server at least one wagering game to a player using the at least one gaming device wherein each wagering game is played by a plurality of players at a virtual table who are dealt a plurality of cards to form a hand and in which the hand satisfying a winning criterion is determined to be a winning hand c connecting at least one non relational database to the game server and d storing a state of the hands of each table as a plurality of document oriented datasets within the at least one non relational database.

As used herein a wagering game or game refers to an electronic game that is played by a player in which the player places one or more wagers on the outcome of the game to participate or continue to participate in the game. In addition an outcome of the game is at least partially based on chance or a random selection of game components. For example while poker is a wagering game that may be partially based on skill e.g. determining a strength of a hand strategically placing bets and analyzing an opponent s gameplay or strategy the outcome of the game may be at least partially based on a random selection of cards for the players hands.

The terms wager and bet are used interchangeably herein to refer to an amount of money credits or other consideration placed on the outcome of a game. Wagers or bets may alternatively include play money or free to play credits or tokens that are not usable except to play one or more games and that have no inherent monetary value. The wagers from each of the players are placed into a pot or a pool that is typically awarded to the player who wins the hand or the round of the game.

One example of a wagering game that may be played according to embodiments of the present disclosure is online poker also referred to as Internet poker . Online poker is a game of poker that is played by a plurality of players over a network such as the Internet.

The term blind or blinds refers to a required bet that at least a portion of the players at a table must make at the beginning of a hand. For example in a Texas Hold Em poker game the first player to the left of the dealer position must automatically place a small blind bet and the second player to the left of the dealer position must automatically place a big blind bet typically twice the size of the small blind at the start of the hand. In some tournaments the blinds may increase according to a predetermined sequence or rate as the tournament progresses. It should be recognized that antes i.e. amounts that must be paid by each player to play a hand may be used in place of or in addition to blinds based on the type of game being played.

A rake refers to an amount of money or credits typically a predetermined percentage up to a predetermined maximum amount or cap that is automatically taken out of the pot by the owner or operator of the game. For example a rake may be between about 2 and about 5 of the amount of money in the pot up to a maximum of 50 in some embodiments. However it should be recognized that any predetermined amount percentage and or cap may be used for the rake.

Gaming devices and wagering games described herein may use real money for play of the games or may utilize a credit based system in which the credits used for the games do not have a cash value. Similarly prizes for the games may be in the form of credits cash and or physical prizes such as televisions automobiles or the like.

As used herein a widget refers to an application or script that may be embedded within another application script website or user interface. For example a widget may be implemented and or embedded within a website or user interface using HTML or JavaScript or any other suitable programming language.

In an embodiment game system may calculate and select a blind amount for the big blind and the small blind e.g. in a Texas Hold Em tournament based on the time elapsed in the tournament and or based on the amount of time remaining until the desired end of the tournament as determined or set by the administrator . For example the blinds may be adjusted based on the number of players left in the tournament and the amount of time that has elapsed in the tournament to achieve a desired end time for the tournament. The blind amounts to be used in a hand may additionally or alternatively be calculated based on an amount of chips or money that each player has based on a speed of the gameplay and or based on any other suitable information. In one embodiment the blind amounts set by game system for some tables may be different than the blind amounts set for other tables. Accordingly each table may have a different blind amount and blind amount progression during the same tournament. By dynamically adjusting the blind amounts during the tournament the amount of time that it takes players to be eliminated may be at least partially controlled thus allowing the tournament to complete at or near the desired end time.

In a specific embodiment the guaranteed finish time tournament may be configured to include a clock displayed next to each player s avatar in the tournament. Each time it is a player s turn to act the player s clock begins counting down. When the player acts the clock stops and the next player s clock starts to count down. A total amount of time for each player s clock may be calculated by dividing the desired tournament length by the number of players in the tournament. In such an embodiment a player can be eliminated from the tournament in either of two ways. First the player may be eliminated by losing all of his or her chips. In this case the remaining time left on the player s clock is evenly distributed between all other remaining players in the tournament. Second the player may be eliminated when the player s clock reaches 0. In this case the player s remaining chips are removed from play.

The timing structure of the guaranteed finish time embodiment described above may also be implemented for Sit Go games in live poker rooms using chess clocks or the like for each player at the table. Players in this case would need to fully complete their action before hitting their clock.

For the guaranteed finish time tournament embodiment a time bank loaded with a predetermined amount of time may be implemented in addition to the player clocks in order to prevent stalling near blind level changes or payout jumps. Each player may take no longer than the amount of time remaining on the time bank for an individual turn. If the time bank runs out before the player takes an action the player will be automatically check folded or another predetermined action may be automatically taken for the player. If the automatic action is taken for the player in this embodiment the player will not be removed from the tournament assuming the player s clock described above still has time remaining.

Another embodiment of the guaranteed finish time tournament described above may provide bounties on a player s time hereinafter referred to as a time bounty tournament . Some poker tournaments award a prize to a player if the player eliminates another player also known as busting or knocking out the other player . Such prizes are typically in the form of money. In a time bounty tournament the reward for eliminating another player is that the player receives the time left on the eliminated player s clock rather than having the eliminated player s time distributed evenly among the remaining players in the tournament. This provides additional incentive for players to eliminate other players and an optimal strategy for playing in this type of tournament may be different than a strategy employed in other types of poker tournament.

In another embodiment a fluctuating blind structure tournament may be provided. For example the blind amounts may vary for each hand such that even consecutive hands at the same table may have different blind amounts. In one embodiment the fluctuating blind structure may be used to facilitate maintaining a desired average chip stack size for players throughout a tournament. If the average chip stack size is above the desired amount the blind amounts may increase more rapidly. In contrast if the average chip stack size is below the desired amount the blind amounts may increase more slowly.

In another embodiment a no position poker tournament may be provided. In the no position poker tournament there is no predetermined starting position or player who must act first in the hand. Rather any player may act first to become the first player in the hand. In one embodiment the first action may not be a fold. If no player acts within a predetermined amount of time such as 3 seconds or 5 seconds for example all players hands are automatically folded or check folded . After the first player acts play continues in a clockwise direction from the first player in an otherwise typical fashion. It should be recognized that the no position poker tournament structure may be implemented for Sit Go games tournament games and or heads up games as desired.

In another embodiment a tournament may be configured to enable at least some players sometimes referred to as late registration players or late players to buy in to the tournament after the tournament has already started even allowing the players to register at late stages in the tournament. A buy in amount or a cost to enter the tournament and the number of chips given to the late registration players may be based on the number of players remaining in the tournament and based on the number of chips in play during the tournament. Alternatively the late registration player can receive the same number of chips for the same buy in amount up to a predetermined late entry time after which point other late registrants may have increased buy in requirements and or may receive an amount of chips based on the number of players remaining in the tournament. In one embodiment players may register at any time until the point at which a predetermined number of players remain in the tournament. For example in one embodiment players may register late until 5 players remain in the tournament. However the players who register late may be required to pay more money to buy in to the tournament than players who registered earlier.

As an illustrative example of the late registration tournament configuration consider a tournament in which an initial buy in amount at the beginning of the tournament is 10 and in which the players receive 3000 chips for the initial buy in. If 100 players initially buy in to the tournament the total prize pool would be 1000 and 300 000 chips would be in play during the tournament. Each chip would therefore be worth about 0.003. If a late player decides to enter the tournament when 17 players remain in the tournament for example the player would receive an amount of chips equal to the average chip stack at that point in the tournament. The average chip stack is calculated by dividing the number of chips in play by the number of remaining players. In this example the average chip stack would be 300 000 divided by 17 which is 17 647 chips rounded down . Therefore the late player would receive 17 647 chips in this example.

The cost of buying in by the late player may be calculated by the number of chips the late player receives multiplied by the value of the chips. Since the value of the chips was calculated to be about 0.003 above and the number of chips the late player receives is 17 647 the cost of buying the chips would be about 52.94. However since the late player receives a benefit in registering late such that the player did not have to endure multiple chances of being eliminated in prior rounds the buy in cost may be increased by a predetermined amount or factor for example. In one embodiment the buy in cost may be multiplied by a factor of 2 to result in a total buy in cost of 105.88 for entering the tournament. The buy in cost may be multiplied or adjusted by increasing amounts as the tournament progresses closer to the final table or grouping of players. If a late registration player enters the tournament after other players have been eliminated the late registration player s buy in amount may be added to the pot that is winnable by the remaining players only. For example if a player is eliminated after winning a prize or a portion of the chip pool that player would not receive any portion of the buy in amount of another player who registers afterward. It should be recognized that aspects of the tournament structures and embodiments described above may be combined together or may be modified with any other embodiment described herein. Additionally any other suitable formula or calculation may be used to determine the cost of buying in to the tournament the value of the chips and or the number of chips provided to the player at late registration.

For example the player may be enabled to customize an avatar associated with the player and or to customize the user interface of game system and or for one or more wagering games. The player may also be enabled to select one or more games to play such as Texas Hold Em poker Omaha poker or the like. A list of poker tables or other tables associated with the selected game or games may be presented to the player to enable the player to select the table or tables to play on for each game. The player may also select one or more options for each game and or game table to be played such as an initial amount of money to bring to the table a speed of the gameplay and the like. In some embodiments a table buy in interface may be presented to the player to enable the player to select an initial buy in amount for the table to select gameplay preferences for the table such as whether to automatically top up to replenish lost chips after a hand whether to auto muck a hand and or to select any other suitable option. The selected preferences may be stored and automatically re selected when the player chooses a table at a later time. At any point before during or after a game is selected and or played the player may be enabled to deposit money or credits representative of money either real money or play money into a player account associated with the player on game system .

After the player has selected one or more games tables and any options the player is enabled to play each selected game on each selected table. It should be recognized that game system may enable the player to play a variety of different games on different tables at the same time. For example the player may play a first game of pot limit Texas Hold Em poker on a first table a second game of Limit Omaha poker on a second table and a third game of Open Face Chinese Poker on a third table. As described more fully herein the tables may be displayed to the player simultaneously on gaming device to enable the player to play the different games and tables concurrently.

In some embodiments one or more identity verifications or challenges may need to be completed to play the game and or to continue playing the game after a period of time has elapsed. For example in one embodiment a biometric challenge may be presented to the player that needs to be successfully completed before the player plays the game. In addition further biometric challenges may be presented to the player that must be successfully completed at predetermined or random times to continue playing the game or games. The biometric challenges may include for example submitting a scan of the player s fingerprint or retina to be matched against a stored or reference scan of the player s fingerprint or retina a recording of the player s voice to be matched against a stored voiceprint of the player and or any other suitable challenge. The biometric challenges may be randomly selected from a list of challenges in some embodiments.

In one embodiment the player may designate one or more games or tables to be played in an accelerated fashion sometimes referred to as a fast fold poker game variation . In the fast fold poker game variation if the player folds a hand on one table game system automatically transfers the player to a newly created table of the same game type having the same limits as the prior table. In one embodiment the player may be automatically seated at the new table with other players who are playing the fast fold poker game variation without having to wait in a queue for a table to be prepared for the player. Gameplay may commence on the new table after a predetermined number of players join the table. For example the game may begin once the maximum number of players e.g. 9 players have joined the table or the game may begin once fewer than the maximum number of players e.g. 5 or 7 players have joined the table. In one embodiment the number of players required to start the game may change based on a total number of players who have opted to play the fast fold poker game variation. Accordingly the game play described above in the fast fold poker game variation may be significantly accelerated and an excitement associated with the game may be increased.

In another embodiment the game may be played with a run it twice configuration if every remaining player at the table i.e. every player who has not folded has opted in to the configuration. In the run it twice configuration when no more actions can be taken by players who remain in the hand e.g. if all remaining players have gone all in and there are still community cards that have not been dealt the remaining community cards for the hand are dealt and a duplicate set of the remaining community cards are also dealt. For example if the two players went all in after the flop in a Texas Hold Em game a first set of one turn card and one river card would be dealt and a second set of one turn card and one river card would be dealt as well. Each set is paired with each player s hole cards to determine which player had the winning hand with each set. If a player has the winning hand with the first set but the other player has the winning hand with the second set each player wins half of the pot for the hand. If one player has the winning hand with both sets that player wins the entire pot and the other player wins nothing. In such a manner additional variety and excitement may be added to the game. In one embodiment each player may set a global configuration setting or option to opt in or opt out of the run it twice configuration and may also override the global configuration setting if desired within a game.

After each hand of each game is finished game system determines whether the player won the hand. If the player won the hand game system awards a payout to the player which is typically equal to the pot the players competed to win during the game minus any applicable rake . The player may continue playing the game or the player may decide to end the game and optionally cash out the player s winnings.

In one embodiment the payout may be presented in the form of a gift card reward certificate or other instrument usable to deposit money into a player account at a later time. In another embodiment the payout may be in the form of reward points or money redeemable at an online reward store or catalog. The reward store or catalog may offer the player one or more free rooms meals tickets merchandise or other goods or services in exchange for the reward points or other portion of the payout.

After the player and or gaming device have optionally been authenticated by game system as described above the player may select one or more games to be played and one or more tables on which to play the games. Game system identifies the table or tables that the player has selected for each game to be played.

Game system causes gaming device to display at least some of the selected tables in a queue of tables. Each table in the queue is displayed in a reduced form as compared to an enlarged display or form of each table. In addition a current status of each table within the queue of tables is displayed by gaming device . For example for each table in the queue gaming device may display the name of the table and or game the hole cards held by the player the community cards drawn if applicable a betting status of each player at the table an amount of time remaining for the player to enter a command or act at the table sometimes referred to as a time to act counter and or any other suitable information.

As used herein the term reduced form or minimized form refers to a display or representation of information and or graphics in a predetermined form factor or size that is smaller and or more compact than an enlarged form or a maximized form of the graphics and or information. For example a virtual poker table displayed in a reduced form may omit graphics of each player s avatar may display a simplified smaller graphic for the table as compared to a normal graphic of the table and or may display less information or information in a more compact form as compared to a normal display or an enlarged display of information associated with the table.

Gaming device may also display at least one additional table of the tables selected to be played by the player in an enlarged form on the same screen or user interface as the queue of tables. In addition the current status of each table displayed in the enlarged form is displayed. The current status may include the information described above with reference to the reduced form in addition to other information such as the name of each player the chip count of each player system messages or chat messages the avatars for each player and or any other suitable information.

As used herein the term enlarged form refers to a display or representation of information and or graphics in a predetermined form factor or size that is larger than a reduced form of the graphics and or information. For example a virtual poker table displayed in an enlarged form may include graphics of each player s avatar may display a larger and or more detailed graphic for the table as compared to a reduced graphic of the table and or may display more information or information in a more detailed form as compared to a reduced display of information associated with the table. A table displayed in the enlarged form may fill the entire screen space of a display or substantially the entire screen space next to the queue of tables or may fill a predetermined section of a grid or other portion of the screen for example.

In one embodiment the player is enabled to enter commands for each table in the queue of tables and for each table in the enlarged form. For example the player may enter an action to fold a hand for one or more tables displayed in the reduced form without first causing the table to be maximized i.e. displayed in the enlarged form .

In addition one or more tables from the queue may be changed to be maximized or displayed in the enlarged form based on a game event. For example the game event may be a selection of the table by the player a time to act counter of the player reaching zero or a predetermined value and or any other suitable event. It should be recognized that the player may also minimize or otherwise cause one or more of the tables displayed in the enlarged form to be displayed in the reduced form within the queue as desired.

The queue of tables may also be modified to display an updated list of tables for example based on a game event. For example the queue of tables may be continuously or intermittently reordered based on a priority of actions needed to be taken by the player an amount of time remaining in the player s time to act counter for each table and or any other suitable event or information. In other respects play of the game on each table may be conducted as described above with reference to for example.

The above described components of user interface should be viewed as illustrative only rather than limiting. It should be recognized that additional components may be included and or one or more of the above described components of user interface may be omitted in some embodiments.

Activity summary screen may display a snapshot of recent activity relating to the games the player has played and or activity of the player s friends. For example activity summary screen may display a list of recent pots the player has won gameplay videos or pictures or other videos or pictures uploaded by the player or friends of the player achievements unlocked tournaments scheduled to be played in deposits and withdrawals from the player s account invitations to one or more tables or tournaments revenue milestones and or any other suitable information. Activity summary screen may be updated in real time or may be updated on a scheduled basis.

Player summary screen may display information relating to the player s account or any other suitable information relating to the player. For example player summary screen may display the username of the player the avatar representing the player a current account balance of the player account a current skill level of the player a skill level meter or another indication of the player s progress towards achieving a higher skill level or any other information.

Recent game list may display a list of recent games or hands that the player has played. For example recent game list may display a list of games or hands the player has played within the last day within the last week or within another predetermined period of time. Alternatively recent game list may display the last 5 games or hands or another suitable number of games or hands most recently played by the player. In one embodiment each game or hand listed in recent game list may be selected by the player such as by using user interface device to display the results and details of the selected game or hand and or to view a replay of the selected game or hand.

Favorite table list may display a list of tables that the player has selected as favorites. Alternatively favorite table list may display a list of tables at which the player has most recently played in a similar manner as described above with reference to recent game list . A heat map may also be used to show an amount of wagering activity and or a speed of gameplay at each selected table. In one embodiment each table listed in favorite table list may be selected to either enable the player to be seated at the table or to view the gameplay at the table.

For example promotion list may display upcoming tournaments celebrity events deposit or gameplay bonuses or promotions new features of one or more games or applications advertisements for additional games or services and or any other suitable notification.

Friend list displays a list of one or more friends of the player. The friends may be identified within game system such as by adding friends playing on game system . Additionally or alternatively the friends may be identified or imported from a social networking site such as Facebook LinkedIn or the like.

Play icon enables the player to quickly join a table and start playing a game. For example when the player selects play icon game system may automatically select a table based on the player s most frequently used game or table selection criteria based on operator selected criteria e.g. based on the player s chip count and or any other suitable criteria and seats the player at the selected table. Accordingly play icon enables the player to start playing a game at a table by simply selecting one button.

Lobby icon enables the player to view another user interface or screen to select one or more tables to play. In one embodiment a new user interface is presented to the player when the player selects lobby icon . The new user interface may display a list or grid of tables that the player may select and may provide a plurality of table selection criteria for each table such as a name of the table minimum and maximum wager amount for the table a number of players currently playing at the table a maximum number of players allowed at the table and or other suitable criteria. In one embodiment each player is ranked by a skill level based on an amount of time played a number of hands won an amount of money won and or any other suitable criteria. In such an embodiment the tables available to be selected by the player may be restricted to those tables having players of similar skill level. In some embodiments players of different skill levels may play together but the players of a lower skill level may receive handicaps or other benefits to compensate for playing against players of a higher skill level. The handicaps may include for example automatically generated gameplay hints free gameplay or player statistics reduced blind amounts or any other suitable handicap. In other embodiments the tables may not be restricted to players having similar skill levels but rather the player may select any table as desired and all players may play on equal footing without handicaps.

In another embodiment tables may be grouped together or sorted based on similar gameplay criteria or characteristics. For example some tables may be configured to enable the players to play a faster version of poker hereinafter referred to as fast fold poker . In fast fold poker when the player folds a hand the player is automatically moved from the current first table and is automatically seated at a new second table having the same or substantially the same characteristics as the first table. For example the first and second tables may have substantially similar wagering limits number of players and game type. The player may therefore experience a more exciting and fast paced wagering game as compared to the gameplay at other tables.

The table lobby also enables the player to search for tables and or filter tables based on selected criteria. For example the tables may be searched and or filtered by player skill level wagering limits buy in amounts game type tables that friends are playing on table name tables that the player has been invited to and or any other suitable criteria. The player may also search for other player s names such as names of friends to find the table or tables that the player s friends are playing on for example. If the player does not want to be found by other players the player may set his or her profile or configuration settings to an incognito mode or another mode in which the player is not able to be found in the table lobby and or elsewhere within the game environment. In one embodiment if the player selects a table that a friend is playing on the player and the friend may have an indicator representing the friendship to enable other players at the table to see that there are friends playing together.

The tables shown in the table lobby may be displayed in a scrollable list filtered by the criteria described above or may be displayed as one or more images of the actual tables themselves. The images of the actual tables may be in effect a window into the gameplay at the table such that the player may view which other players are playing at the table how much money is being wagered how many seats are open etc. Accordingly the player may scroll through the images to determine which table the player wants to join and may then select the desired table. The images may be displayed as tiles windows thumbnails or any other suitable image that enables the player to view the gameplay of the table before joining the table.

In one embodiment the table lobby may present one or more head to head or one on one poker games or tables hereinafter referred to as arcade mode poker games or tables in which the player may play against only one other competitor. The arcade mode may be at least partially styled or modeled after one or more computer or console fighting games. Accordingly in one embodiment a stylized or enlarged avatar for the player and for the competitor may be presented on either side of the user interface implementing the game with the avatars facing each other. Various fighting moves or actions may be performed based on the gameplay of the poker game. For example betting or raising during a poker hand may correspond to the avatar of the betting player throwing a punch or a kick towards the other avatar. The avatar receiving the punch or kick may block or counter if the player matches the bet or re raises. As another example the avatar of the player who wins a hand may deliver a knockout punch kick or other move to the avatar of the player who loses the hand. In one embodiment each avatar may have a simulated health bar or other graphic that is drained or recharged based on the gameplay. The health bar may correspond to the player s chip count or each player may have a health bar that initially corresponds to the same value or number such that each avatar starts off with the same amount of health. In another embodiment the player may play against a sequence of computer controlled avatars sometimes referred to as bots . As each computer controlled avatar is defeated by the player the difficulty may increase for example by increasing the artificial intelligence used by the computer controlled avatar by decreasing a handicap of the computer controlled avatar by increasing the chip count of the computer controlled avatar and or by any other suitable means. The player may achieve rewards for defeating each computer controlled avatar. The above examples are merely illustrative and it should be recognized that any other fighting characteristic or simulation may be included in addition to or instead of the above described examples.

The table elements may include for example a table name a plurality of community cards for the table a plurality of hole cards for the player a chip count for the player an action controller for the player a time to act counter display for the player and a status display for the player and the players competitors at the table.

Action controller may present a limited or reduced set of controls to the player as compared to an action controller of enlarged form . For example action controller may only include a check fold box or icon that enables the player to fold the hand directly from queue without maximizing the table if another player bets during the hand. Alternatively action controller may include any suitable control and or icon as desired.

Time to act counter display may display an amount of time remaining for the player to take action on each table in queue . For example time to act counter display may be represented as a bar that progressively empties as the time remaining in the player s time to act counter decreases. Alternatively time to act counter display may be represented as a countdown timer or any other suitable display. In one embodiment the player may select time to act counter display or may hover a mouse or other pointer over time to act counter display to display an amount of seconds and or minutes remaining in the player s time to act counter.

Status display may display a representation of the gameplay status of the player and of each competitor of the player playing at the table. The gameplay status represented by status display may include without limitation a representation of the seat position the player or competitor is in e.g. small blind position big blind position etc. whether the player or competitor has folded the hand and or whether it is the player s or competitor s turn to act during the hand. For example the competitors who have folded may be represented on status display with red circles and the competitors who have not folded may be represented on status display with green circles. If the player has folded in one embodiment the player s hole cards may be grayed out or removed from the display of the table. Alternatively any suitable representation may be used to display the status of the player and the player s competitors.

In one embodiment the tables displayed in queue are ordered or sorted based on at least one predetermined criterion. For example the tables may be ordered or sorted based on a priority of the actions needed to be taken on each table. In one embodiment the table at the top of queue may be the table that has the highest priority action that needs to be taken and the table at the bottom of queue may be the table that has the lowest priority action that needs to be taken by the player. For example the priority of the actions may be based on the amount of time remaining in the player s time to act counter for each table such that the table at which the least amount of time remaining in the time to act counter has the highest priority and the table at which the most amount of time remaining in the time to act counter has the lowest priority. In one embodiment the tables in queue may flash or may be otherwise emphasized in accordance with the amount of time remaining on the time to act counter associated with each table. For example the tables may start flashing at a slow rate such as about once every second and may flash more quickly as the time to act counter runs down. Alternatively the tables may start flashing once the time to act counter reaches a predetermined value. The player may disable the reordering of the tables in queue for example by selecting an appropriate option in a gameplay or table configuration setting interface.

In addition the player can select a table in queue to cause the table to be switched from reduced form to enlarged form i.e. maximized . A table in enlarged form may thereby be replaced by the selected table and may be minimized or switched to reduced form and placed in queue . In one embodiment if the player enters an action on the maximized table the table in enlarged form the table is then minimized into the bottom or lowest priority position in queue or to another position in queue and the table having the highest priority e.g. the table in the top position of queue may be automatically maximized into enlarged form . The player may also select an icon or may enter another suitable command to minimize a previously maximized table such that the table is placed into queue . In one embodiment tables that the player is sitting out i.e. the player has withdrawn from active play on the table but retains his or her seat at the table are placed at the bottom of queue and are not reprioritized until the player sits back in at the table i.e. resumes active play at the table .

As the priority of each table may change over time and as the player may act on each table in any order e.g. by maximizing a table and or by folding a hand of a table in queue queue may continually be updated and the tables may be automatically reordered or repositioned to reflect the ranked priorities. Alternatively tables may only be ranked or prioritized when it becomes the player s turn to act on the table. Tables that are minimized by the player may be placed at the bottom of queue or at another suitable position and may remain in that position until it becomes the player s turn to act. While the priorities of the tables have been described herein as being based on an amount of time remaining in the player s time to act counter for each table it should be recognized that the priorities may be based on any suitable criteria.

In one embodiment if a player folds a hand at a table the table may be placed or re positioned in queue with the following position or priority Position where Pis the number of players remaining to act on the current street Pis the number of players remaining in the hand and Nis the number of streets remaining in the hand. A street refers to a betting round or a turn in which each player remaining in the hand is required to take an action such as betting folding etc. before the next card is dealt.

For a hand that is not folded at a table e.g. if the player minimizes the table without folding the table may be placed or repositioned in queue with the following priority Position where Pis the number of players who will act ahead of the player during the next street.
