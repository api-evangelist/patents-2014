This application is a continuation in part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 651 044 which was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Oct. 12 2012 entitled Improved Remineralizing and Desensitizing Compositions Treatments and Methods of Manufacture which specification including Examples Tables and Drawings are hereby incorporated by reference in total into the present application. This application is co pending with U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 251 220 filed on Apr. 11 2014 titled Enamel Protectant and Repair Toothpaste .

The present invention is directed to advances in enamel protectant and enamel repair aqueous free stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments whereby the protectant and repair ingredients are substantive to enamel surfaces thereby extending the protecting and repairing processes with improved stannous fluoride effectiveness. Key protectant and repair combinations for the toothpaste treatments of the present invention comprise stannous fluoride and calcium in aqueous free substantivity agents.

The use of fluoride in anticaries drug products marketed in the U.S. is carried out under the guidance of the FDA s Fluoride Monograph 21 CFR 355.10 revised Apr. 1 2012 .

Fluoride Dentifrices have been shown in numerous clinical trials to be effective anticaries agents Stookey 1990 69 Special Issue 805 812 and have been recognized as a major cause of the remarkable decline in caries prevalence in many developed countries. Dentifrices have been widely adopted around the world as the principle means of delivering topical fluoride and obtaining caries preventive benefits.

 Washout of various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients from enamel surfaces by saliva flow eventually controls the effective residence time of various commercial fluoride enamel protectant and enamel repair brushing compositions. To improve enamel protectant and enamel repair effectiveness commercial professionally prescribed fluoride brushing compositions resort to high levels of fluoride i.e. 5000 ppm for Rx toothpastes gels and rinses and to approximately 22 000 ppm fluoride for in chair professionally applied varnishes. In addition standard OTC fluoride toothpastes can contain up to 1500 ppm fluoride under the FDA s Fluoride Monograph.

The current market for fluoride brushing products includes professional and consumer oral care fluoride treatments both OTC and Rx brushing products including toothpastes gels pastes and varnishes. As noted above Rx fluoride toothpastes and Rx fluoride toothpastes are well outside fluoride Monograph levels containing up to 5000 ppm fluoride. Professional oral care in chair fluoride varnishes contain up to about 22 000 ppm fluoride while OTC fluoride toothpastes can contain up to 1500 ppm fluoride the maximum level provided for the Monograph.

The American Dental Association ADA the Food Drug Administration FDA and oral care professionals including general practitioners periodontists orthodontists pediatric dentists etc. as a group are generally concerned about the trend of increasing fluoride levels. These organizations and oral care professionals generally favor using lower levels of fluoride in various in chair treatments and various OTC and Rx oral care home treatments for patients provided that enamel protection and repair achieved with lower fluoride levels are comparable to the results reported for brushing products with higher levels of fluoride. This preference for lower fluoride brushing products is driven by the concern over toxicity fluorosis in children etc. associated with exposure to high fluoride levels long term.

It is generally accepted that approximately 90 of the fluoride used in OTC and Rx fluoride brushing treatments is expectorated after use. Thus the window for fluoride treatment of enamel is essentially limited to the time fluoride is being brushed onto the enamel. In contrast fluoride varnishes containing 22 000 ppm fluoride applied to the enamel by an oral care professional are designed to maintain substantive fluoride levels on the enamel after patient expectoration.

Fluoride varnishes are generally applied professionally at a frequency of about once every six months with the target audience comprising primarily children.

Dietary fluoride levels have gradually increased due to fluoridated drinking water and the fluoride in water used in food preparation etc. In addition most consumers use fluoride toothpastes rinses gels etc. Extensive literature citations indicate topical fluoride treatments are more effective in protecting and repairing enamel than treatment with systemic fluorides.

Yet with all this fluoride available caries continues to pose a challenge in children as well as adults including coronal caries in the elderly caries in dry mouth patients caries in immunocompromised patients caries in patients undergoing medical or dental treatment etc.

There is a need to improve enamel protectant and enamel repair effectiveness treatments for professional oral care fluoride procedures as well as for OTC fluoride products for patient treatment while reducing the risk associated with exposure to high fluoride levels.

Additionally there is a need to improve the efficacy of fluoride products in the area of enamel protection and enamel repair where the efficacy of various fluoride treatments is assessed as a function of the fluoride level used to effect treatment of various conditions of the enamel.

To provide stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments with improved enamel protectant factor EPF values and improved enamel repair factor ERF values.

To provide stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments with improved EPF and ERF values where improvements in EPF and ERF values are accompanied by reduced fluoride content in the toothpastes.

To reduce fluoride levels in toothpaste treatments while attaining comparable or improved EPF and ERF values compared to current commercial fluoride brushing treatments as well as fluoride brushing treatments described in the prior art.

To improve enamel conditions of at risk patients including immunocompromised patients cancer therapy cardio treatment diabetes COP patients etc.

The present invention is directed to aqueous free toothpaste composition treatments wherein the toothpastes contain stannous fluoride from between 850 and about 1500 ppm fluoride in an aqueous free substantivity agent. The toothpaste treatments of the present invention protect and repair enamel more effectively than toothpastes and toothpaste treatment containing comparable or substantially higher levels of fluoride as indicated by comparative EPF and ERF values reported herein.

The unexpected enamel protectant and enamel repair features of the stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention as detailed below in the Examples Tables and Drawings are attributed to unique aqueous free toothpaste composition treatments which feature 

The enamel protectant and enamel repair toothpaste composition treatments of the present invention form substantive mucoadhesive gels on enamel in the presence of saliva which mucoadhesive gels gradually release the stannous fluoride onto enamel. This slow release continues until the mucoadhesive gel is eventually totally solubilized by saliva. This gradual release minimizes the wash out effect traditionally experienced with fluoride brushing treatments. The resultant enamel protectant and enamel repair increases in EPF and ERF values resulting from the extended enamel residence time of stannous fluoride calcium and cation bridging associated with microbial fluoride binding to biofilm. This improved stannous fluoride efficiency treatment reduces risks associated with elevated fluoride levels.

Aqueous free stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention comprise substantivity agents that contain various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients. These substantivity agents function as carriers for various enamel protectant and repair ingredients. These substantivity agents are characterized by their ability in the presence of saliva to form mucoadhesive gels which are substantive to enamel with biofilm. These substantive mucoadhesive gels are further characterized by their ability to a gradually dissolve when exposed to saliva flow and b gradually release various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm as they dissolve. This gradual dissolution feature of these mucoadhesive gels minimizes saliva wash out of enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients by gradually releasing these ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm. The substantivity agents of the present invention extend the duration of enamel protectant and enamel repair treatments and support cation bridging associated with microbial fluoride binding thereby enhancing the EPF and ERF values of various toothpaste treatments of the present invention while simultaneously reducing the level of fluoride required to achieve the unexpected increases in EPF and ERF values.

In as preferred embodiment of the invention calcium and phosphate components are included in the toothpaste treatments. These are described by Ming Tung in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 037 639 5 268 167 5 427 768 5 437 857 5 460 803 5 562 895 by Tung in the American Dental Association Foundation publication ACP Technology by Schemehorn et. al. in The Journal of Clinical Dentistry Vol. XXII No 2. 51 54 2011 by the 19 references cited by Schemehorn et. al. and by the description of various Gantrez resins containing calcium including Gantrez M955 available from International Specialty Products Wayne N.J. USA.

The aqueous free substantivity agents of the present invention hold the various enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients including stannous fluoride calcium and phosphate components in a condition where these ingredients remain stable and unreacted. When this aqueous free substantivity agent is exposed to saliva it forms a mucoadhesive gel that is substantive to enamel with biofilm. This mucoadhesive gel continues to hold the enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto enamel surfaces with biofilm without the ingredients reacting. These ingredients eventually react upon being released onto saliva and biofilm coated enamel surfaces.

Eventually this mucoadhesive substantivity agent is totally dissolved by saliva releasing the balance of unreacted enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients onto saliva and biofilm coated enamel surfaces.

Aqueous free toothpaste treatments of the present invention contain enamel protectant and enamel repair ingredients suitable for protecting and repairing dental enamel wherein 

For purposes of the present invention saliva soluble aqueous free emulsions used as substantivity agents include those emulsions that are comprised of polydimethylsiloxane polymers in nonionic surfactants as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 032 387 5 098 711 5 538 667 5 651 959 having the structural formula HO CHO CHO CHO CHO CHO H wherein the sum of x y and z is between 120 and 150. In a preferred embodiment x 76 y 0 and z 56.

Preferred aqueous free saliva soluble emulsions for use as substantivity agents of the treatments of the present invention include aqueous free emulsions comprising a nonionic surfactant continuous phase and a discontinuous phase of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS at viscosities ranging from between about 1500 cs and about 2.5 million cs. Particularly preferred aqueous free emulsions include a nonionic surfactant continuous phase and a discontinuous phase PDMS at viscosities between 10 000 cs and 2.5 million cs.

Preferred polydimethylsiloxanes are selected from the group consisting of polydimethylsiloxane at 1500 cs at 10 000 cs at 100 000 cs at 250 000 cs at 500 000 cs at 750 000 cs at 1.5 million cs at 2.2 million cs at 2.5 million cs and combinations thereof.

Foam modulators are useful in the present invention. These include without limitation materials operable to control amount thickness or stability of foam generated by the composition e.g. dentifrice composition upon agitation. Any orally acceptable foam modulator can be used including polyethylene glycols PEGs also known as polyoxyethylenes. High molecular weight PEGs are suitable including those having an average molecular weight of about 200 000 to about 7 000 000 for example about 500 000 to about 5 000 000 or about 1 000 000 to about 2 500 000. One or more PEGs are optionally present in a total amount of about 0.1 to about 10 for example about 0.2 to about 5 or about 0.25 to about 2 .

Humectants useful for the present invention include without limitation polyhydric alcohols such as glycerin sorbitol xylitol or low molecular weight PEGs. In various embodiments humectants can prevent hardening of the toothpastes upon exposure to air. In various embodiments humectants also function as sweeteners.

Any other desired components may be added to the compositions of the treatments of the present invention including for example additional mouth feel agents pH modifying agents flavorants sweeteners additional anticalculus and Antiplaque agents abrasives polishing agents antimicrobial e.g. antibacterial agents such as those described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 776 435 saliva stimulants anti inflammatory agents Hantagonists nutrients vitamins proteins antioxidants colorants or additional active materials useful for the prevention or treatment of a condition or disorder of hard or soft tissue of the oral cavity the prevention or treatment of a physiological disorder or condition or to provide a cosmetic benefit.

EPF and ERF data for toothpaste treatments of the invention at varying compositions as described in Examples 1 through 5 compared with commercial fluoride brushing products 

In a preferred embodiment of the invention the toothpaste treatments of the present invention contain ingredients that substantially effect enamel protection factor EPF and enamel repair factor ERF values. These include 

The amount of stannous fluoride in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention applied to the toothbrush dose is not as important as the concentration of available stannous fluoride in the toothpaste treatment. Heretofore reducing fluoride concentration in brushing treatments has been reported not to be as effective as regular concentration fluoride products.

The extraordinary EPF and ERF values of the toothpaste treatments of the present invention allow for reducing stannous fluoride concentrations while effecting acceptable fluoride protection and uptake results.

The fluoride dose is important in regard to enamel fluorosis in children under six years of age due to fluoride toothpaste ingestion. For this reason reducing the amount of stannous fluoride applied with the toothpaste treatments of the present invention is a preferred strategy over lowering the dose of stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the invention intended for use by children under six years of age.

While fluoride brushing treatments have a long history of safety there is a continuing concern associated with dental fluorosis due to fluoride ingestion in children under age six. See Dendrys J. Am. Dent. Assoc. 2000 131 6 746 755.

Studies have shown that for children 1 3 years of age 30 to 75 of the fluoride brushing treatment is ingested and for children 4 6 years of age 14 to 48 is ingested. Warren and Levy Pediatr. Dent. 199 21 265 271.

Stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention with their improved efficacy can be used at reduced stannous fluoride levels and thereby substantially lower the risk of overdosing and the onset of fluorosis while delivering effective EPF and ERF results.

The present study demonstrates that the addition of fluoride produces Fs HAP as a major chemical species only at low concentrations of fluoride.

For purposes of the present invention substantivity agent refers to a composition or combination of compositions that when administered to oral cavity surfaces with biofilm via treatments of the present invention enhance the retention of stannous fluoride and calcium to said biofilm containing oral cavity surfaces.

The unexpected enamel protectant and enamel repair features of the aqueous free stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention are attributed to the unique substantivity properties indicated by the toothpaste treatments of the invention.

For purposes of the present invention preferred substantivity agents for the stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention include various aqueous free emulsions of polydimethylsiloxane polymers in nonionic surfactants at viscosities of at least about 10 000 cs.

These substantivity agents form mucoadhesive gels in the presence of saliva which are substantive to biofilm coated enamel and gradually dissolve under saliva flow releasing stannous fluoride onto the biofilm on the enamel at a pH of at least about 3 thereby effecting EP F and ERF values of at least about 2.5 and about 200 respectively.

For purposes of the present invention substantivity agents include saliva soluble aqueous free emulsions comprised of 

polydimethylsiloxane polymers in solid nonionic surfactants as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 032 387 5 098 711 5 538 667 5 645 841 5 651 959 having the following structural formula HO CHO CHO CHO CHO CHO H wherein y 0 and the sum of x and z is between 120 and 150. In a preferred embodiment x 76 y 0 and z 56.

Preferred aqueous free saliva soluble emulsions for use in the substantivity agents of the toothpaste treatments of the present invention include aqueous free emulsions comprising a nonionic surfactant continuous phase and a discontinuous phase of polydimethylsiloxane PDMS at viscosities ranging from between about 1500 cs and about 2.5 million cs. Particularly preferred are aqueous free emulsions with a nonionic surfactant continuous phase and a discontinuous PDMS phase at viscosities between 10 000 cs and 2.5 million cs.

Preferred polydimethylsiloxanes are selected from the group consisting of polydimethylsiloxane at 1500 cs at 10 000 cs at 100 000 cs at 250 000 cs at 500 000 cs at 750 000 cs at 1.5 million cs at 2.2 million cs at 2.5 million cs and combinations thereof.

In a preferred embodiment of the invention copolymers described below are useful as substantivity enhancers when combined with the aqueous free substantivity agents of the present invention. These substantivity enhancers include various linear polymeric polycarboxylates such as copolymers of sodium and calcium salts of methyl vinyl ether maleic acid including those copolymers available commercially as Gantrez MS 955 polymer a mixed sodium and calcium salt of methyl vinyl ether maleic acid copolymer where the cations form salt bridges which cross link the polymer chains.

Preferred are 1 4 to 4 1 copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid with another polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer preferably methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride having a molecular weight of about 30 000 to about 1 000 000.

Sodium and calcium salts of carboxymethyl cellulose ether polymers can also be used including sodium and calcium salts of carboxymethyl cellulose ether hydroxyethyl cellulose ether sodium cellulose ether etc.

The contribution of Ca from the copolymer substantivity enhancer to ERF values in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention is illustrated in of the Drawings and Tables 6 and 7.

In vitro determination of EPF values attributed to administration of various fluoride containing toothpastes and a test stannous fluoride toothpastes onto human enamel subjected to acid challenge.

The following study was carried out according to the FDA Monograph on Anticaries Drug Products for over the counter human use. The study was performed following FDA good laboratory practices.

Purpose of the following in vitro study to determine the effect of acid challenge to human enamel treated with various fluoride containing brushing products. The effect of the acid challenge was established by measuring the resistance of enamel specimens treated with various fluoride brushing products to an acid challenge before and after treatment with various fluoride brushing products.

Three sound human molars were placed in a disc of red boxing wax so that only the enamel surfaces were exposed. Twelve set of three teeth each were prepared for the study. All specimens were cleaned and polished with a flour of pumice slurry and a rag wheel to remove any deposits or stains.

Two moles 203.58 g of 88.5 pure lactic acid were diluted with approximately 500 ml of distilled water. To this was added a solution of 84 g NaOH dissolved in about 600 ml of distilled water. The total volume was then adjusted to 2000 ml. This was the buffered 1.0 M lactic acid challenge solution.

Another lactic acid solution was prepared by diluting two moles lactic acid to 2000 ml with distilled water. The solution of lactic acid and sodium hydroxide was placed in a 4000 ml beaker and pH electrodes placed in the solution. The 1.0 M lactic acid solution was used to adjust the pH of the buffered solution to 4.5. To obtain a 0.1 working concentration for all decalcifications the 1.0 M buffer was diluted by a factor of 10 with distilled water.

Before every use any residual anti solubility protection afforded by the previous treatment was eliminated. Deprotection of these specimens was accomplished by etching the teeth in the above prepared 0.1 M lactate buffer solution for a two hour period. Each disc of three specimens was agitated 450 rpm in about 50 ml of lactate buffer at room temperature during the deprotection period. The teeth were rinsed well with distilled water immediately following deprotection.

The test was performed using preheated 37 C. tooth sets and lactate buffer. The deprotected tooth sets were mounted on inch diameter acrylic rods with molten red boxing wax. Multiplaced stirrers were used for treatments and the etches. All slurries and solutions were pre heated to 37 C. The actual treatments and etches were carried out on the bench top with the preheated solutions. Plastic specimen containers 120 ml were used for the etching procedure. A inch hole was drilled in each container lid to accommodate the plastic rod to which the tooth sets were mounted. A 40 ml portion of 0.1 M lactic acid buffer was placed in each container along with a one inch magnetic stirring bar. The rod of the first tooth set was pushed through the hole in the lid placed in the first container and adjusted so that all enamel surfaces were immersed into the buffer solution. The container was then placed on the first magnetic stirrer and stirring was begun. The timer was started at this time. At 30 second intervals the other tooth sets were started in the same manner. After 15 minutes of exposure to the buffered lactate solution the first set was stopped and the lid and tooth set immediately removed from the container and placed in a tray of distilled water to terminate etching. The other sets were similarly removed at 30 second intervals in the same order that they were initiated and the lactate buffer solutions was retained for phosphorus analysis. The tooth sets were placed back in the 37 C. water bath in preparation for the fluoride treatment step.

The treatments were performed using slurries of the fluoride brushing products. The slurries consisted of 1 part fluoride brushing product and 3 parts preheated 37 C. distilled water 9 g 27 ml . Each slurry was mixed for exactly one minute after adding the water. The slurries were NOT prepared ahead of time. They were NOT centrifuged. All tooth sets were treated at the same time one for each fluoride brushing product . The treatment procedure was similar to the etching procedure with the exception of the slurry in place of the acid. A 30 ml portion of the preheated fluoride brushing slurry was added to the first tooth set the teeth were immersed in the slurry and the container placed on the first stirrer. The stirrer and timer were started. At 90 second intervals to allow time for stirring the other tooth sets were started in the same manner. At the end of the five minutes of treatment the first set was stopped the tooth set removed and rinsed well with distilled water. The other sets were removed at 90 second intervals and rinsed well. The treatment fluoride brushing slurries were discarded.

A second acid exposure was then performed by the same method as the pre treatment etch and the lactate buffer solutions were again retained for phosphorus analysis. The pre and post treatment solutions were analyzed using a Klett Summerson Photoelectric Colorimeter.

The tooth sets were deprotected and the procedure repeated additional times so that each fluoride brushing product was treated and assayed on each tooth set. The treatment design was a Latin Square design so that no treatment followed another treatment consistently.

The percent of enamel solubility reduction was computed as the difference between the amount of phosphorus in the pre and post acidic solutions divided by the amount of phosphorus in the pre solution and multiplied by 100.

D. Test stannous fluoride toothpaste treatment at 1100 ppm fluoride composition as described hereinafter in Example 1.

Statistical analyses of the individual means were performed with a one way analysis of variance model using Sigma Stat 3.1 Software. Since the ANOVA indicated significant differences the individual means were analyzed by the Student Newman Keuls SNK test.

The deionized water negative control was not effective in reducing enamel solubility. The positive fluoride containing controls and the test toothpaste were significantly more effective than the deionized water negative control. The Clinpro 5000 toothpaste was slightly significantly more effective than the negative control. The test toothpaste was comparable to the CREST PRO HEALTH Toothpaste in reducing enamel solubility.

In vitro determination of ERF values attributed to administration of various fluoride containing toothpaste treatments and a test toothpaste treatment onto incipient enamel lesions in bovine enamel.

The following study was carried out according to the FDA Monograph on Anticaries Drug Products for over the counter human use following FDA good laboratory practices.

Purpose of the following in vitro study to determine the fluoride uptake into incipient enamel lesions in bovine incisors treated with various fluoride containing brushing products.

The test procedure was identical to the procedure identified as Procedure 40 in the FDA anticaries Monograph except the lesions were formed using a solution comprising 0.1 M lactic acid and 0.2 Carbopol 907 wherein the solution was saturated with HAP hydroxyapatite at a pH of 5.0.

The fluoride uptake was established by analyzing fluoride and calcium levels of enamel pre treatment and enamel post treatment to determine the change in enamel fluoride attributed to treatment with fluoride containing brushing products.

Sound upper central bovine incisors were selected and cleaned of all adhering soft tissue. A core of enamel 3 mm in diameter was prepared from each tooth by cutting perpendicularly to the labial surface with a hollow core diamond drill bit. This was performed under water to prevent overheating of the specimens. Each specimen was embedded in the end of a plexiglass rod diameter 2 long using methylmethacrylate. The excess acrylic was cut away exposing the enamel surface. The enamel specimens were polished with 600 grit wet dry paper and then micro fine Gamma Alumina. The resulting specimens were a 3 mm disk of enamel with all but the exposed surface covered with acrylic. Twelve specimens per group were prepared.

Each enamel specimen was then etched by immersion into 0.5 ml of 1M HClO4 for 15 seconds. Throughout the etch period the etch solutions were continuously agitated. A sample of each solution was then buffered with TISAB fluoride ion probe buffer to a pH of 5.2 0.25 ml sample 0.5 ml TISAB and 0.25 ml 1N NaOH and the fluoride content of the solution determined by comparison to a similarly prepared standard curve 1 ml std 1 ml TISAB . For use in depth of each calculation the Ca content of the etch solution was determined by taking 50 l and analyzing for Ca by atomic absorption 0.05 ml qs to 5 ml . These data was the indigenous fluoride level of each specimen prior to treatment.

The specimens were once again ground and polished as described above. An incipient lesion was formed in each enamel specimen by immersion into a 0.1 M lactic acid 0.2 Carbopol 907 solution for 24 hours at room temperature. These specimens were then rinsed well with distilled water and stored in a humid environment until used.

The treatments were performed using slurries of the various fluoride containing brushing products. The flurries consisted of 1 part fluoride containing brushing product and 3 parts distilled water 9 g 27 ml . Each slurry was mixed for exactly one minute after adding the water. The slurries were NOT prepared ahead of time. They were NOT centrifuged. The 12 specimens of each group were then immersed into 25 ml of their assigned slurry with constant stirring 350 rpm for 30 minutes. Following treatment the specimens were rinsed with distilled water. One layer of enamel was then removed from each specimen and analyzed for fluoride and calcium as outlined above i.e. 15 second etch . The pretreatment fluoride indigenous level of each specimen was then subtracted from post treatment fluoride value to determine the change in enamel fluoride due to the last treatment.

The results are shown on attached tables. All raw data individual specimen Enamel Fluoride Uptake EFU values are reported. In addition the mean S.D. standard deviation and SEM scanning electron micrograph for each group was calculated. Statistical analysis were performed by a one way analysis of variance model using Sigma Stat Software 3.1 . Since significant differences are indicated the individual means were analyzed by the Student Newman Keuls SNK test.

In vitro determination of ERF values attributed to administration of various fluoride containing toothpaste treatments and a test toothpaste treatment onto incipient enamel lesions in human enamel was carried out following the Enamel Fluoride protocol described above for the results reported in Table 2. Some of the fluoride containing brushing treatments tested in this fluoride uptake study are different than those reported on in Table 2 above.

Preferred stannous fluoride toothpaste treatments of the present invention show substantial improvement in EPF and ERF values compared to commercial toothpaste treatments at various fluoride loads as reported in Tables 2 and 8 and of the Drawings.

For example the ERF values reported in Table 2 and for MI Paste Plus OTC Stannous Fluoride paste and Clinpro 5000 Toothpaste are 31 34 and 50 respectively compared to an ERF for the stannous fluoride toothpaste treatment of the present invention described in Example 1 of 540. This 10 plus improvement in ERF value over commercial toothpaste treatments represents a major advance in fluoride uptake and enamel hardening effectiveness. Such an advantage in enamel hardening efficiency is particularly critical to patients experiencing rampant caries coronal caries cancer therapy treatments mucositis treatments immune deficiency treatments bone marrow transplants etc.

The enamel protectant and or enamel repair EPF and or ERF data reported for treatments described in Examples 1 through 6 as detailed in Tables 1 through 8 and in of the Drawings suggest the substantivity of stannous fluoride and calcium to the biofilm present on enamel surfaces is enhanced by a shift from bidentate to monodentate calcium binding in the presence of stannous fluoride. This shift in calcium binding in the presence of stannous fluoride results in a most effective binding site configuration for the treatments of the present invention. See 

Calcium binding to biofilm shifts from a bidentate chelation to a monodentate chelation in the presence of fluoride freeing up Calcium to bind with fluoride CaF pairs thereby doubling the calcium binding capacity.

Stable fluoride in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention produces marked reduction in calcium binding affinity and approximately doubles calcium binding capacity. In the absence of fluoride calcium binding to biofilm is bidentate. Stable fluoride in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention compete with biofilm causing calcium binding to biofilm to become monodentate. This allows the binding of about double the quantity of calcium and of CaF bound to biofilm. Release of fluoride bound by calcium bridging into biofilm fluid as a result of fluoride clearance into saliva will be accompanied by a corresponding release of calcium which in turn potentiates the cariostatic effect of fluoride as indicated in the in vitro testing of the treatments of the invention described in Tables 2 through 80 and of the Drawings.

At least some of the stable fluoride present in the toothpaste treatments of the present invention is bound to calcium ions sourced from various calcium salts in the present invention and or calcium present in the copolymer substantivity enhancer such as Gantrez MS 955 . These calcium ions in turn are bound to biofilm associated with enamel.

A drop in pH follows exposure of plaque to sucrose which removes some anionic groups by neutralization thereby liberating calcium and fluoride as Car at the very sites where these moieties can do the most good.

Stannous fluoride produces a marked reduction in calcium binding affinity accompanied by an approximate doubling of the calcium binding capacity. In the absence of fluoride divalent cation binding to plaque is bidentate. Fluoride competes with macromolecular anionic groups causing binding to become monodentate. Release of fluoride formed by calcium bridging is accompanied by release of calcium which potentiates the cariostatic effect of fluoride in the treatments of the present invention.

The presence CaF is required to deliver the enamel protection and repair EPF and ERF results required for the toothpaste treatments of the present invention.

Fluoride binding produces a marked reduction in calcium binding affinity along with a doubling of calcium binding capacity. This indicates that calcium binding changes from bidentate to monodentate. This shift from bidentate to monodentate is a consequence of fluoride replacing an anionic group as one of the calcium ligends in the treatments of the present invention.

The anionic groups to which calcium is no longer bound are then free to bind a CaF ion pair resulting in a doubling of the calcium binding capacity. Release of fluoride bound by calcium bridging into plaque fluid may be accompanied by a release of calcium which will potentiate the cariostatic effect of fluoride.

CaF is taken up by hydroxyapatite and is responsible for the EPF and ERF in vitro data reported for the compositions of the present invention. The ERF values reported for the treatments of the present invention in Tables 3 through 8 and of the Drawings suggest that the CaF moiety is incorporated into the hydroxyapatite lattice during the remineralization treatment of the present invention.

The toothpaste treatments of the present invention set a new oral care STANDARD for Enamel Protection and Enamel Repair treatment while dramatically reducing exposure to elevated levels in various fluoride varnishes gels and toothpaste treatments.
