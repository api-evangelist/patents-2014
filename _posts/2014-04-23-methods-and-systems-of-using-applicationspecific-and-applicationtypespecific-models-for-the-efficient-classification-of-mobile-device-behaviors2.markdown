title: Methods and systems of using application-specific and application-type-specific models for the efficient classification of mobile device behaviors
abstract: Methods, and mobile devices implementing the methods, use application-specific and/or application-type specific classifier to improve the efficiency and performance of a comprehensive behavioral monitoring and analysis system predicting whether a software application is causing undesirable or performance depredating behavior. The application-specific and application-type specific classifier models may include a reduced and more focused subset of the decision nodes that are included in a full or more complete classifier model that may be received or generated in the mobile device. The locally generated application-specific and/or application-type specific classifier models may be used to perform real-time behavior monitoring and analysis operations by applying the application-based classifier models to a behavior/feature vector generated by monitoring mobile device behavior. The various aspects focus monitoring and analysis operations on a small number of features that are most important for determining whether operations of a software application are contributing to undesirable or performance depredating behavior.

To keep pace with these service enhancements mobile electronic devices e.g. cellular phones tablets laptops etc. have become more powerful and complex than ever.

The various aspects will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. References made to particular examples and implementations are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention or the claims.

In overview the various aspects include methods and mobile devices configured to implement the methods of using application specific and or application type specific classifier models i.e. data or behavior models to improve the efficiency and performance of a comprehensive behavioral monitoring and analysis system and to enable the mobile device to better predict whether a software application is a source or cause of an undesirable or performance depredating behavior of the mobile device. For ease of reference the term application based classifier models is used herein and in the claims to refer to either or both of application specific and application type specific classifier models as described below.

The comprehensive behavioral monitoring and analysis system may include a network server and a mobile device configured to work in conjunction with one another to intelligently and efficiently identify classify model prevent and or correct the conditions and or mobile device behaviors that often degrade the mobile device s performance and or power utilization levels over time. The network server may be configured to receive information on various conditions features behaviors and corrective actions from a central database e.g. the cloud and use this information to generate a full or robust classifier model e.g. a data behavior model that describes a large corpus of information e.g. behavior information in a format or structure that can be quickly converted into one or more lean classifier models by a mobile device. For example the network server may generate the full classifier model to include a plurality of decision nodes e.g. boosted decision trees boosted decision stumps etc. that each evaluate or test a feature of the mobile device and which may be included in a lean classifier model.

The network server may send the full classifier to the mobile device. The mobile device may be configured to receive and use the full classifier model to generate a lean classifier model or a family of lean classifier models of varying levels of complexity or leanness . To accomplish this the mobile device may trim cull or prune the decision nodes included in the full classifier model to generate lean classifier models that include a reduced number of the decision nodes and or evaluate a limited number of test conditions.

In addition the mobile device may also dynamically generate application specific and or application type specific classifier models that identify and test conditions or features that are relevant to a specific software application Google wallet and or to a specific type of software application e.g. games navigation financial news productivity etc. . In an aspect these application based classifier models i.e. the application specific and application type specific classifier models may be generated to include a reduced and more focused subset of the decision nodes that are included in the received full classifier model or of those included in lean classifier model generated from the received full classifier model.

In various aspects the mobile device may be configured to generate application based classifier models for each software application in the system and or for each type of software application in the system. The mobile device may also be configured to dynamically identify the software applications and or application types that are a high risk or susceptible to abuse e.g. financial applications point of sale applications biometric sensor applications etc. and generate application based classifier models for only the software applications and or application types that are identified as being high risk or susceptible to abuse. In various aspects the mobile device may be configured to generate the application based classifier models dynamically reactively proactively and or every time a new application is installed or updated.

The mobile device may be configured to use the locally generated lean and or application based classifier models to perform real time behavior monitoring and analysis operations. In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to use or apply multiple classifier models in parallel. In various aspects the mobile device may be configured to give preference or priority to the results generated from using or applying the application based classifier models to a behavior feature vector over the results generated from using applying a more generic lean classifier model to the same or different behavior feature vector when evaluating a specific software application. In the various aspects the mobile device may use the results of applying the classifier models to predict whether a software application process or complex mobile device behavior is benign or contributing to the degradation of the performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

By dynamically generating classifier models locally in the mobile device so that they are focused or based on application specific or application type specific features the various aspects allow the mobile device to focus its monitoring and analysis operations on a small number of features that are most important for determining whether the operations of a specific software application are contributing to an undesirable or performance depredating behavior of the mobile device. This improves the performance and power consumption characteristics of the mobile device and allows the mobile device to perform the real time behavior monitoring and analysis operations continuously or near continuously without consuming an excessive amount of mobile device resources e.g. processing memory or energy resources .

The word exemplary is used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.

The phrase application based classifier model is used generically herein to refer to both an application specific classifier model and an application type specific classifier model collectively and in the alternative. That is an application based classifier model may be an application specific classifier model or an application type specific classifier model. An application specific classifier model may be a classifier model that identifies or includes data information structures e.g. feature vectors behavior vectors component lists etc. and or decision criteria that may be used to evaluate an individual software application. An application type specific classifier model may be a classifier model that identifies or includes data information structures and or decision criteria that that relate to evaluating a particular class category or type of software application e.g. financial applications productivity applications etc. .

The terms mobile computing device and mobile device are used interchangeably herein to refer to any one or all of cellular telephones smartphones personal or mobile multi media players personal data assistants PDA s laptop computers tablet computers smartbooks ultrabooks palm top computers wireless electronic mail receivers multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones wireless gaming controllers and similar personal electronic devices which include a memory a programmable processor for which performance is important and operate under battery power such that power conservation methods are of benefit. While the various aspects are particularly useful for mobile computing devices such as smartphones which have limited resources and run on battery the aspects are generally useful in any electronic device that includes a processor and executes application programs.

Generally the performance and power efficiency of a mobile device degrade over time. Recently anti virus companies e.g. McAfee Symantec etc. have begun marketing mobile anti virus firewall and encryption products that aim to slow this degradation. However many of these solutions rely on the periodic execution of a computationally intensive scanning engine on the mobile device which may consume many of the mobile device s processing and battery resources slow or render the mobile device useless for extended periods of time and or otherwise degrade the user experience. In addition these solutions are typically limited to detecting known viruses and malware and do not address the multiple complex factors and or the interactions that often combine to contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time e.g. when the performance degradation is not caused by viruses or malware . For these and other reasons existing anti virus firewall and encryption products do not provide adequate solutions for identifying the numerous factors that may contribute to a mobile device s degradation over time for preventing mobile device degradation or for efficiently restoring an aging mobile device to its original condition.

Currently various solutions exist for modeling the behavior an application program executing on a computing device and these solutions may be used along with machine learning techniques to determine whether a software application is malicious or benign. However these solutions are not suitable for use on mobile devices because they require evaluating a very large corpus of behavior information do not generate behavior models dynamically to account for application specific or application type specific features of the computing device do not intelligently prioritize the features in the behavior model are limited to evaluating an individual application program or process and or require the execution of computationally intensive processes in the mobile device. As such implementing or performing these existing solutions in a mobile device may have a significant negative and or user perceivable impact on the responsiveness performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

For example a computing device may be configured to use an existing machine learning based solution to access and use a large corpus of training data derive a model that takes as input a feature vector and use this model to determine whether a software application of the computing device is malicious or benign. However such a solution does not generate a full classifier model i.e. a robust data or behavior model that describes the large corpus of behavior information in a format or information structure e.g. finite state machine etc. that may be used by a mobile device to quickly generate a lean classifier model. For at least this reason such a solution does not allow a mobile device to generate a lean classifier model that includes decision nodes that focus on or prioritize the conditions or features that are specific to an individual application or application type. In addition this solution does not allow a mobile device to generate a lean classifier model that intelligently identifies or prioritizes the features in accordance to their relevance to classifying a specific behavior software application or software application type in the specific mobile device in which the model is used. For these and other reasons such a solution cannot be used by a mobile device processor to quickly and efficiently identify analyze or classify a software application as contributing to a complex mobile device behavior that has significant negative or user perceivable impact on the responsiveness performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

In addition to the above mentioned limitations of existing solutions many behavior modeling solutions implement a one size fits all approach to modeling the behaviors of a computing device and are therefore not suitable for use in mobile devices. That is these solutions typically generate the behavior models so that they are generic and may be used in many computing devices and or with a variety of different hardware and software configurations. As such these generic behavior models often include test a very large number of features many of which are not relevant to and thus cannot be used for identifying analyzing or classifying a behavior of a specific software application or application type in the specific computing device in which they are actually used. In addition these solutions do not assign relative priorities to features based their relevance to classifying a specific behavior in the specific mobile device in which the model is used. Therefore these solutions typically require that a computing device apply behavior models that include a large number of disorganized improperly prioritized or irrelevant features. Such models are not suitable for use in resource constrained mobile devices because they may cause the mobile device processor to analyze a large number of features that are not useful for identifying a cause or source of the mobile device s degradation over time. As such these existing solutions are not suitable for use in complex yet resource constrained mobile devices.

Modern mobile devices are highly configurable and complex systems. As such the features that are most important for determining whether a particular mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading may be different in each mobile device. Further a different combination of features may require monitoring and or analysis in each mobile device in order for that mobile device to quickly and efficiently determine whether a particular behavior is benign or not benign. Yet the precise combination of features that require monitoring and analysis and the relative priority or importance of each feature or feature combination can often only be determined using application specific application type specific and or device specific information obtained from the specific mobile device in which the behavior is to be monitored or analyzed. For these and other reasons behavior models generated in any computing device other than the specific device in which they are used cannot include information that identifies the precise combination of features that are most important to classifying a software application or mobile device behavior in that device.

For example if a first mobile device is configured to use its biometric sensors e.g. fingerprint reader voice recognition subsystem retina scanner etc. to authorize financial transactions then features that test conditions relating to the access and use of the biometric sensors are likely to be relevant in determining whether an observed behavior of accessing financial software is malicious or benign in that mobile device. For example the access and use of the biometric sensors in the first mobile device may indicate that a malicious application is authorizing financial transactions without the user s knowledge or consent. On the other hand features that test conditions relating to the access and use of these sensors are not likely to be relevant in determining whether the observed behavior of accessing financial software is malicious or benign in a second mobile device which is not configured to use its biometric sensors to authorize financial transactions. That is since the first and second devices may be identical in all aspects i.e. are the same type model operating system software etc. except for their configuration for the use of their biometric sensors it would be challenging to generate a generic behavior model that accurately identifies features that evaluate conditions relating to the access and use of the biometric sensors for both devices. It would be even more challenging to generate a generic model that tests much more complicated conditions or features on hundreds of thousands or millions of similarly equipment yet independently configurable mobile devices.

In addition mobile devices are resource constrained systems that have relatively limited processing memory and energy resources. Modern mobile devices are also complex systems having a large variety of factors that may contribute to the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of the mobile device over time. Examples of factors that may contribute to performance degradation include poorly designed software applications malware viruses fragmented memory and background processes. Due to the number variety and complexity of these factors it is often not feasible to evaluate all of the various components behaviors processes operations conditions states or features or combinations thereof that may degrade performance and or power utilization levels of the complex yet resource constrained systems of modern mobile devices. As such it is difficult for users operating systems or application programs e.g. anti virus software etc. to accurately and efficiently identify the sources of such problems. As a result mobile device users currently have few remedies for preventing the degradation in performance and power utilization levels of a mobile device over time or for restoring an aging mobile device to its original performance and power utilization levels.

The various aspects include a comprehensive behavioral monitoring and analysis system for intelligently and efficiently identifying preventing and or correcting the conditions factors and or mobile device behaviors that often degrade a mobile device s performance and or power utilization levels over time. In an aspect an observer process daemon module or sub system herein collectively referred to as a module of the mobile device may instrument or coordinate various application programming interfaces APIs registers counters or other mobile device components herein collectively instrumented components at various levels of the mobile device system. The observer module may continuously or near continuously monitor mobile device behaviors by collecting behavior information from the instrumented component. The mobile device may also include an analyzer module and the observer module may communicate e.g. via a memory write operation function call etc. the collected behavior information to the analyzer module. The analyzer module may receive and use the behavior information to generate feature or behavior vectors generate spatial and or temporal correlations based on the feature behavior vectors and use this information to determine whether a particular mobile device behavior condition sub system software application or process is benign suspicious or not benign i.e. malicious or performance degrading . The mobile device may then use the results of this analysis to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix or respond to identified problems.

The analyzer module may also be configured to perform real time behavior analysis operations which may include performing executing and or applying data algorithms classifiers or models herein collectively referred to as classifier models to the collected behavior information to determine whether a software application or mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading . Each classifier model may be a behavior model that includes data and or information structures e.g. feature vectors behavior vectors component lists etc. that may be used by a mobile device processor to evaluate a specific feature or aspect of a mobile device s behavior. Each classifier model may also include decision criteria for monitoring a number of features factors data points entries APIs states conditions behaviors applications processes operations components etc. herein collectively features in the mobile device. The classifier models may be preinstalled on the mobile device downloaded or received from a network server generated in the mobile device or any combination thereof. The classifier models may be generated by using crowd sourcing solutions behavior modeling techniques machine learning algorithms etc.

Each classifier model may be categorized as a full classifier model or a lean classifier model. A full classifier model may be a robust data model that is generated as a function of a large training dataset which may include thousands of features and billions of entries. A lean classifier model may be a more focused data model that is generated from a reduced dataset that includes or prioritizes tests on the features entries that are most relevant for determining whether a particular mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading .

A locally generated lean classifier model is a lean classifier model that is generated in the mobile device. An application based classifier model may be an application specific classifier model or an application type specific classifier model. An application specific classifier model is a classifier model that includes a focused data model that includes or prioritizes tests on the features entries that are most relevant for determining whether a particular software application is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading . An application type specific classifier model is a classifier model that includes a focused or prioritized data model that includes or prioritizes tests on the features entries that are most relevant for determining whether a particular type of software application is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading .

As mentioned above there may be thousands of features factors and billions of data points that require analysis to properly identify the cause or source of a mobile device s degradation. Therefore classifier models may be trained on a very large number of features in order to support all makes and models of mobile devices and for each mobile device to make accurate decisions regarding whether a particular mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading . Yet because mobile devices are resource constrained systems it is often not feasible for the mobile device evaluate all these features. Further mobile devices come in many different configurations and varieties and may include a large number of different software applications or application types. Yet few mobile devices if any include every feature or functionality that may be addressed in full classifier models. The various aspects generate lean application based classifier models that the analyzer module may apply to evaluate a targeted subset of features that are most relevant to the software applications of a specific mobile device limiting the number of test conditions and analyses that would otherwise be performed if a generic or full classifier model was used when classifying a mobile device behavior.

The various aspects include mobile devices and network servers configured to work in conjunction with one another to intelligently and efficiently identify the features factors and data points that are most relevant to determining whether a mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading . By generating lean classifier models locally in the mobile device accounting for device specific features and or device state specific features the various aspects allow the mobile device processor to apply focused classifier models to quickly and efficiently identify analyze or classify a complex mobile device behavior e.g. via the observer and analyzer modules etc. without causing a significant negative or user perceivable change in the responsiveness performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

A full classifier model may be generated by a network server configured to receive a large amount of information regarding mobile device behaviors and states features and conditions during or characterizing those behaviors from a cloud service network. This information may be in the form of a very large cloud corpus of mobile device behavior vectors. The network server may use this information to generate a full classifier model i.e. a robust data behavior model that accurately describes the very large cloud corpus of behavior vectors. The network server may generate the full classifier model to include all or most of the features data points and or factors that could contribute to the degradation over time of any of a number of different makes models and configurations of mobile devices.

In an aspect the network server may generate the full classifier model to include a finite state machine expression or representation which may be an information structure that includes a boosted decision tree stump or family of boosted decision trees stumps that can be quickly and efficiently culled modified or converted into lean classifier models that are suitable for use or execution in a mobile device processor. The finite state machine expression or representation abbreviated to finite state machine may be an information structure that includes test conditions state information state transition rules and other similar information. In an aspect the finite state machine may be an information structure that includes a large or robust family of boosted decision stumps that each evaluate or test a feature condition or aspect of a mobile device behavior.

The mobile device may be configured to receive a full classifier model from the network server and use the received full classifier model to generate lean classifier models i.e. data behavior models that are specific for the features and functionalities of the mobile device.

In various aspects the mobile device may use behavior modeling and machine learning techniques to intelligently and dynamically generate the lean classifier models so that they account for device specific and or device state specific features of the mobile device e.g. features relevant to the mobile device configuration functionality connected included hardware etc. include test or evaluate a focused and targeted subset of the features that are determined to be important for identifying a cause or source of the mobile device s degradation over time and or prioritize the targeted subset of features based on probability or confidence values identifying their relative importance for successfully classifying a behavior in the specific mobile device in which they are used evaluated.

By generating classifier models in the mobile device in which the models are used the various aspects allow the mobile device to accurately identify the specific features that are most important in determining whether a behavior on that specific mobile device is benign or contributing to that device degradation in performance. These aspects also allow the mobile device to accurately prioritize the features in the lean classifier models in accordance with their relative importance to classifying behaviors in that specific mobile device.

The use of application specific application type specific device specific and or device state specific information allows the mobile device to quickly identify and prioritize the features that should be included in the lean classifier models as well as to identify the features that should be excluded from the lean classifier models. For example the mobile device may be configured to identify and exclude from the lean classifier models the features nodes trees stumps included in the full model that test conditions which do not pertain to a software application running on the mobile device based on its specific feature set and therefore are not relevant to the mobile device. For example a mobile device that does not include a biometric sensor may exclude from lean classifier models all features nodes stumps that test or evaluate conditions relating to the use of a biometric sensor by a software application.

Further since the lean classifier models include a reduced subset of states features behaviors or conditions that must be evaluated i.e. compared to the full classifier model the observer and or analyzer modules may use the lean classifier model to quickly and accurately determine whether a mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading without consuming an excessive amount of processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device.

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to use the full classifier model to generate a family of lean classifier models of varying levels of complexity or leanness . The leanest family of lean classifier models i.e. the lean classifier model based on the fewest number of test conditions may be applied routinely until a behavior is encountered that the model cannot categorize as either benign or malicious and therefore is categorized by the model as suspicious at which time a more robust i.e. less lean lean classifier model may be applied in an attempt to categorize the behavior as either benign or malicious. The application of ever more robust lean classifier models within the family of generated lean classifier models may be applied until a definitive classification of the behavior is achieved. In this manner the observer and or analyzer modules can strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy by limiting the use of the most complete but resource intensive lean classifier models to those situations where a robust classifier model is needed to definitively classify a behavior.

In various aspects the mobile device may be configured to generate one or more lean classifier models by converting a finite state machine representation expression into boosted decision stumps pruning or culling the full set of boosted decision stumps based on application states specific to a particular application or a type of application features behaviors conditions or configurations to include subset or subsets of boosted decision stumps included in the full classifier model and using the subset or subsets of boosted decision stumps to intelligently monitor analyze and or classify a mobile device behavior.

The use of boosted decision stumps allows the observer and or analyzer modules to generate and apply lean data models without communicating with the cloud or a network to re train the data which significantly reduces the mobile device s dependence on the network server and the cloud. This eliminates the feedback communications between the mobile device and the network server which further improves the performance and power consumption characteristics of the mobile device.

Boosted decision stumps are one level decision trees that have exactly one node and thus one test question or test condition and a weight value and thus are well suited for use in a binary classification of data behaviors. That is applying a behavior vector to boosted decision stump results in a binary answer e.g. Yes or No . For example if the question condition tested by a boosted decision stump is is the frequency of Short Message Service SMS transmissions less than x per minute applying a value of 3 to the boosted decision stump will result in either a yes answer for less than 3 SMS transmissions or a no answer for 3 or more SMS transmissions .

Boosted decision stumps are efficient because they are very simple and primal and thus do not require significant processing resources . Boosted decision stumps are also very parallelizable and thus many stumps may be applied or tested in parallel at the same time e.g. by multiple cores or processors in the mobile device .

As described below the network server or another computing device may generate a boosted decision stump type full classifier model from another more complex model of mobile device behaviors such as a boosted decision tree model. Such complex models may correlate the full or nearly full set of interactions among device states operations and monitored nodes that characterize mobile device behavior in a sophisticated classification system. As mentioned above the server or other computing device may generate a full complex classifier model by applying machine learning techniques to generate models that describe a cloud corpus of behavior vectors of mobile devices collected from a large number of mobile devices. As an example a boosted decision tree classifier model may trace hundreds of paths through decision nodes of testable conditions to arrive at a determination of whether a current mobile device behavior is malicious or benign. Such complex models may be generated in the server using a number of known learning and correlation modeling techniques. While such complex models can become quite effective in accurately recognizing malicious behaviors by learning from data from many hundreds of mobile devices their application to a particular mobile device s configuration and behaviors may require significant processing particularly if the model involves complex multilevel decision trees. Since mobile devices are typically resource limited using such models may impact device performance and battery life.

To render robust classifier models that are more conducive to use by mobile devices a server e.g. a cloud server or the network server or another computing device e.g. a mobile device or a computer that will couple to the mobile device may transform complex classifier models into large boosted decision stump models. The more simple determinations involved in decision stumps and the ability to apply such classifier models in parallel processes may enable mobile devices to better benefit from the analyses performed by the network server. Also as discussed below a boosted decision stump full classifier model may be used by mobile devices to generate a lean classifier model to include or exclude features based on device specific or device state specific information. This may be accomplished by configuring a mobile device processor to perform the aspect methods described below.

In further aspects the mobile device may include various components configured to incorporate features specific to the mobile device or the mobile device s current state into a lean classifier model or a set of lean classifier models used to detect malicious behavior on the mobile device.

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to generate a lean classifier model to include a subset of classifier criteria included in the full classifier model that prioritizes classifier criteria corresponding to the features relevant to the mobile device configuration functionality and connected included hardware. The mobile device may use this lean classifier model s to preferentially or exclusively monitor those features and functions present or relevant to the device. The mobile device may then periodically modify or regenerate the lean classifier model s to include or remove various features and corresponding classifier criteria based on the mobile device s current state and configuration.

As an example and in an aspect a behavior analyzer module operating on the mobile device may receive a large boosted decision stumps classifier model with decision stumps associated with a full feature set of behavior models and the behavior analyzer module may derive one or more lean classifier models from the large classifier models by selecting or prioritizing features from the large classifier model s that are relevant the mobile device s current configuration functionality operating state and or connected included hardware and including in the lean classifier model a subset of boosted decision stumps that correspond to the selected features. In this aspect the classifier criteria corresponding to features relevant to the mobile device may be those boosted decision stumps included in the large classifier model that test at least one of the selected features. In an aspect the behavior analyzer module may then periodically modify or regenerate the boosted decision stumps lean classifier model s to include or remove various features based on the mobile device s current state and configuration so that the lean classifier model continues to include device specific feature boosted decision stumps.

In an aspect a device state monitoring engine operating on the mobile computing device may continually monitor the mobile device for changes in the mobile device s configuration and or state. In a further aspect the device state monitoring engine may look for configuration and or state changes that may impact the performance or effectiveness of the behavior analyzer module or a classifier module to detect malicious behavior. For example the device state monitoring engine may monitor the mobile device s behaviors until a low battery state is detected at which point the behavior analyzer module may change the lean classifier model to analyze fewer features on the mobile device for malicious behavior in order to conserve energy.

In another aspect the device state monitoring engine may notify a device state specific feature generator when the device state monitoring engine detects a state change and the device state specific feature generator may signal the behavior analyzer module to add or remove certain features based on the mobile device s state change.

In another aspect the mobile device may include a device specific feature generator configured to determine features related to the mobile device itself. For example the device specific feature generator may determine that the mobile device includes near field communication Wi Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. In a further aspect the device specific feature generator may signal the behavior analyzer to include or remove features in the lean classifier models based on the features related to the mobile device itself. Thus various components on the mobile device may modify a lean classifier model to reflect features specific to the mobile device s configuration and or to the mobile device s current state which may enable the various components to better detect malicious behavior or improve the overall performance of the mobile device by prioritizing monitored features based on the mobile device s current state.

As noted above one example of a type of large classifier model that may be processed by a mobile device to generate a lean classifier model for use in monitoring behavior is a boosted decision stumps classifier model. In the detailed descriptions that follow references may be made to boosted decision stumps classifier models however such references are for example purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims unless a claim explicitly recites a boosted decision stumps classifier model.

In an aspect the mobile device may be configured to generate an application based classifier model by receiving a full classifier model that includes a plurality of test conditions from the network server identifying the mobile device features that are used by a software application of the mobile device or by a type of software application that may execute on the mobile device identifying the test conditions in the full classifier model that evaluate one of identified mobile device features determining the priority importance or success rates of the identified test conditions prioritizing or ordering the identified test conditions in accordance with their importance or success rates and generating a classifier model that includes the identified test conditions so that they are ordered in accordance with their determined priorities importance or success rates.

The mobile device may be configured to use the locally generated lean and or application based classifier models to perform real time behavior monitoring and analysis operations. For example the mobile device may use an application based classifier model to classify the behavior of the mobile device executing corresponding application by collecting behavior information from the mobile device using the collected behavior information to generate a feature vector applying the generated feature vector to the application based classifier model to evaluate each test condition included in the application based classifier model. The mobile device may also compute a weighted average of each result of evaluating test conditions in the application based classifier model and use the weighted average to determine whether a mobile device behavior is malicious or benign.

The various aspects may be implemented within a variety of communication systems such as the example communication system illustrated in .

In addition the mobile device may be configured to receive the full classifier model from the network server . The mobile device may be further configured to use the full classifier model to generate more focused classifier models that account for the specific features and functionalities of the software applications of the mobile device . For example the mobile device may generate application specific and or application type specific classifier models i.e. data or behavior models that preferentially or exclusively identify or evaluate the conditions or features of the mobile device that are relevant to a specific software application or to a specific type of software application e.g. games navigation financial etc. that is installed on the mobile device or stored in a memory of the device.

To reduce the number of factors monitored to a manageable level in an aspect the behavior observer module may be configured to monitor observe an initial or reduced set of behaviors or factors that are a small subset of all factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation.

The behavior analyzer module may receive and use the behavior information to generate behavior vectors generate spatial and or temporal correlations based on the behavior vectors and use this information to determine whether a particular mobile device behavior condition sub system software application or process is benign suspicious or not benign i.e. malicious or performance degrading .

The behavior analyzer module and or the classifier module may be configured to perform real time behavior analysis operations which may include performing executing and or applying data algorithms classifiers or models collectively referred to as classifier models to the collected behavior information to determine whether a mobile device behavior is benign or not benign e.g. malicious or performance degrading .

In an aspect the behavior analyzer module and or classifier module may include intelligence for utilizing a limited set of information i.e. coarse observations to identify behaviors processes or programs that are contributing to or are likely to contribute to the device s degradation over time or which may otherwise cause problems on the device. For example the behavior analyzer module may be configured to analyze information e.g. in the form of observations collected from various modules e.g. the behavior observer module external context information module etc. learn the normal operational behaviors of the mobile device and generate one or more behavior vectors based the results of the comparisons. The behavior analyzer module may send the generated behavior vectors to the classifier module for further analysis.

In an aspect the classifier module may be configured to apply or compare behavior vectors to a classifier model to determine whether a particular mobile device behavior software application or process is performance degrading malicious benign or suspicious. When the classifier module determines that a behavior software application or process is malicious or performance degrading the classifier module may notify the actuator module which may perform various actions or operations to correct mobile device behaviors determined to be malicious or performance degrading and or perform operations to heal cure isolate or otherwise fix the identified problem.

When the classifier module determines that a behavior software application or process is suspicious the classifier module may notify the behavior observer module which may adjust the adjust the granularity of its observations i.e. the level of detail at which mobile device behaviors are observed and or change the behaviors that are observed based on information received from the classifier module e.g. results of the real time analysis operations generate or collect new or additional behavior information and send the new additional information to the behavior analyzer module and or classifier module for further analysis classification. Such feedback communications between the behavior observer module and the classifier module enable the mobile device to recursively increase the granularity of the observations i.e. make finer or more detailed observations or change the features behaviors that are observed until a source of a suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior is identified until a processing or battery consumption threshold is reached or until the mobile device processor determines that the source of the suspicious or performance degrading mobile device behavior cannot be identified from further increases in observation granularity. Such feedback communication also enable the mobile device to adjust or modify the data behavior models locally in the mobile device without consuming an excessive amount of the mobile device s processing memory or energy resources.

In an aspect the behavior observer module and the behavior analyzer module may provide either individually or collectively real time behavior analysis of the computing system s behaviors to identify suspicious behavior from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the level of detail required for the observations.

Any or all of the modules may be a real time online classifier module and or included in the behavior analyzer module or classifier module illustrated in . In an aspect the application based classifier model generator module may be included in the lean classifier model generator module . In various aspects the feature selection and culling module may be included in the application based classifier model generator module or in the lean classifier model generator module .

The network server may be configured to receive information on various conditions features behaviors and corrective actions from the cloud service network and use this information to generate a full classifier model that describes a large corpus of behavior information in a format or structure that can be quickly converted into one or more lean classifier models by the mobile device . For example the full classifier model generator module in the network server may use a cloud corpus of behavior vectors received from the cloud service network to generate a full classifier model which may include a finite state machine description or representation of the large corpus of behavior information. The finite state machine may be an information structure that may be expressed as one or more decision nodes such as a family of boosted decision stumps that collectively identify describe test or evaluate all or many of the features and data points that are relevant to classifying mobile device behavior.

The network server may send the full classifier model to the mobile device which may receive and use the full classifier model to generate a reduced feature classifier model or a family of classifier models of varying levels of complexity or leanness. In various aspects the reduced feature classifier models may be generated in the feature selection and culling module lean classifier model generator module the application based classifier generator module or any combination thereof. That is the feature selection and culling module lean classifier model generator module and or application based classifier generator modules of the mobile device may collectively or individually use the information included in the full classifier model received from the network server to generate one or more reduced feature classifier models that include a subset of the features and data points included in full classifier model.

For example the lean classifier model generator module and feature selection and culling module may collectively cull the robust family of boosted decision stumps included in the finite state machine of the full classifier model received from the network server to generate a reduced feature classifier model that includes a reduced number of boosted decision stumps and or evaluates a limited number of test conditions. The culling of the robust family of boosted decision stumps may be accomplished by selecting a boosted decision stump identifying all other boosted decision stumps that test or depend upon the same mobile device feature as the selected decision stump and adding the selected stump and all the identified other boosted decision stumps that test or depend upon the same mobile device feature to an information structure. This process may then be repeated for a limited number of stumps or device features so that the information structure includes all boosted decision stumps in the full classifier model that test or depend upon a small or limited number of different features or conditions. The mobile device may then use this information structure as a lean classifier model to test a limited number of different features or conditions of the mobile device and to quickly classify a mobile device behavior without consuming an excessive amount of its processing memory or energy resources.

The lean classifier model generator module may be further configured to generate classifier models that are specific to the mobile device and to a particular software application or process that may execute on the mobile device. In this manner one or more lean classifier models may be generated that preferentially or exclusively test features or elements that pertain to the mobile device and that are of particular relevance to the software application. These device and application specific application type specific lean classifier models may be generated by the lean classifier model generator module in one pass by selecting test conditions that are relevant to the application and pertain to the mobile device. Alternatively the lean classifier model generator module may generate a device specific lean classifier model including test conditions pertinent to the mobile device and from this lean classifier model generate a further refined model that includes or prioritize those test conditions that are relevant to the application. As a further alternative the lean classifier model generator module may generate a lean classifier model that is relevant to the application and then remove test conditions that are not relevant to mobile device. For ease of description the processes of generating a device specific lean classifier model are described first followed by processes of generating an application specific or application type specific lean classifier model.

The lean classifier model generator module may be configured to generate device specific classifier models by using device specific information of the mobile device to identify mobile device specific features or test conditions that are relevant or pertain to classifying a behavior of that specific mobile device . The lean classifier model generator module may use this information to generate the lean classifier models that preferentially or exclusively include test or depend upon the identified mobile device specific features or test conditions. The mobile device may then use these locally generated lean classifier models to classify the behavior of the mobile device without consuming an excessive amount of its processing memory or energy resources. That is by generating the lean classifier models locally in the mobile device to account for device specific or device state specific features the various aspects allow the mobile device to focus its monitoring operations on the features or factors that are most important for identifying the source or cause of an undesirable behavior in that specific mobile device .

The lean classifier model generator module may also be configured to determine whether an operating system execution state of the software application process is relevant to determining whether any of the monitored mobile device behaviors are malicious or suspicious and generate a lean classifier model that includes identifies or evaluates features or behaviors that take the operating system execution states into account. The mobile device may then use these locally generated lean classifier models to preferentially or exclusively monitor the operating system execution states of the software applications for which such determinations are relevant. This allows the mobile device to focus its operations on the most important features and functions of an application in order to better predict whether a behavior is benign. That is by monitoring the operating system execution states of select software applications or processes threads etc. the various aspects allow the mobile device to better predict whether a behavior is benign or malicious. Further by intelligently determining whether the operating system execution state of a software application is relevant to the determination of whether a behavior is benign or malicious and selecting for monitoring the software applications or processes threads etc. for which such determinations are relevant the various aspects allow the mobile device to better focus its operations and identify performance degrading behaviors factors without consuming an excessive amount of processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device.

In an aspect the feature selection and culling module may be configured to allow for feature selection and generation of classifier models on the fly and without requiring that the mobile device to access the cloud data for retraining. This allows the application based classifier model generator module to generate create classifier models in the mobile device that allow the mobile device to focus its operations on evaluating the features that relate to specific software applications or to specific types classes or categories of software applications.

That is the application based classifier model generator module allows the mobile device to generate and use highly focused and lean classifier models that preferentially or exclusively test or evaluate the features of the mobile device that are associated with an operation of a specific software application or with the operations that are typically performed by a certain type class or category of software applications. To accomplish this the application based classifier model generator module may intelligently identify software applications that are at high risk for abuse and or are have a special need for security and for each of these identified applications determine the activities that the application can or will perform during its execution. The application specific classifier model generator module may then associate these activities with data centric features of the mobile device to generate classifier models that are well suited for use by the mobile device in determining whether an individual software application is contributing to or is likely to contribute to a performance degrading behavior of the mobile device .

The application specific classifier model generator module may be configured to generate application specific and or application type specific classifier models every time a new application is installed or updated in the mobile device. This may be accomplished via the application specific model generator module and or application type specific model generator module .

The application type specific classifier model generator module may be configured to generate a classifier model for a specific software application based on a category type or classification of that software application e.g. game navigation financial etc. . The application type specific classifier model generator module may determine the category type or classification of the software application by reading an application store label associated with the software application by performing static analysis operations and or by comparing the software application to other similar software applications.

For example the application type specific classifier model generator module may evaluate the permissions e.g. operating system file access etc. and or API usage patterns of a first software application compare this information to the permissions or API usage pattern of a second software application to determine whether the first software application includes the same set of permissions or utilizes the same set of APIs as the second software application and use labeling information of the second software application to determine a software application type e.g. financial software banking application etc. for the first software application when the first software application includes the same set of permissions or utilizes the same set of APIs as the second software application. The application type specific classifier model generator module may then generate update or select a classifier model that is suitable for evaluating the first software application based on the determined software application type. In an aspect this may be achieved by culling the decision nodes included in the full classifier model received from the network server based on the determined software application type.

The application specific classifier model generator module may be configured to generate a classifier model for a specific software application based on labeling information static analysis install time analysis or by determining the operating system file and or access permissions of the software application. For example the mobile device may perform static analysis of the software application each time the software application is updated store the results of this analysis in a memory of the mobile device use this information to determine the mobile device conditions or factors that are most important for determining whether that application is contributing to a suspicious mobile device behavior and cull the decision nodes included in the full classifier model to include nodes that test the most important conditions or factors.

In block the processing core may use information included in a full classifier model to generate a large number of decision nodes that collectively identify describe test or evaluate all or many of the features and data points that are relevant to determining whether a mobile device behavior is benign or contributing to the degradation in performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device over time. For example in block the processing core may generate one hundred 100 decision nodes that test forty 40 unique conditions.

In an aspect the decision nodes may be decision stumps e.g. boosted decision stumps etc. . Each decision stump may be a one level decision tree that has exactly one node that tests one condition or mobile device feature. Because there is only one node in a decision stump applying a feature vector to a decision stump results in a binary answer e.g. yes or no malicious or benign etc. . For example if the condition tested by a decision stump is is the frequency of SMS transmissions less than x per min applying a value of 3 to the decision stump will result in either a yes answer for less than 3 SMS transmissions or a no answer for 3 or more SMS transmissions . This binary yes or no answer may then be used to classify the result as indicating that the behavior is either malicious M or benign B . Since these stumps are very simple evaluations basically binary the processing to perform each stump is very simple and can be accomplished quickly and or in parallel with less processing overhead.

In an aspect each decision node may be associated a weight value that is indicative of how much knowledge is gained from answering the test question and or the likelihood that answering the test condition will enable the processing core to determine whether a mobile device behavior is benign. The weight associated with a decision node may be computed based on information collected from previous observations or analysis of mobile device behaviors software applications or processes in the mobile device. In an aspect the weight associated with each decision node may also be computed based on how many units of the corpus of data e.g. cloud corpus of data or behavior vectors are used to build the node. In an aspect the weight values may be generated based on the accuracy or performance information collected from the execution application of previous data behavior models or classifiers.

Returning to in block the processing core may generate a lean classifier model that includes a focused subset of the decision nodes included in the full classifier model . To accomplish this the processing core may perform feature selection operations which may include generating an ordered or prioritized list of the decision nodes included in the full classifier model determining a number of unique test conditions that should be evaluated to classify a mobile device behavior without consuming an excessive amount of processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device generating a list of test conditions by sequentially traversing the ordered prioritized list of decision nodes and inserting a test condition associated with each sequentially traversed decision node into the list of test conditions until the list of test conditions includes the determined number of unique test conditions and generating an information structure that preferentially or exclusively includes the decision nodes that test one of the test conditions included in the generated list of test conditions. In an aspect the processing core may generate a family classifier models so that each model in the family of classifier models evaluates a different number of unique test conditions and or includes a different number of decision nodes.

In block the processing core may trim cull or prune the decision nodes i.e. boosted decision stumps included in one of the lean classifier models to generate an application specific classifier model that preferentially or exclusively includes the decision nodes in the lean classifier model that test or evaluate conditions or features that are relevant to a specific software application i.e. Google wallet such as by dropping decision nodes that address API s or functions that are not called or invoked by the application as well as dropping decision nodes regarding device resources that are not accessed or modified by the application. In an aspect the processing core may generate the application specific classifier model by performing feature selection and culling operations. In various aspects the processing core may identify decision nodes for inclusion in a application specific classifier model based on labeling information associated with a software application the results of performing static analysis operations on the application the results of performing install time analysis of the application by evaluating the operating system file and or access permissions of the software application by evaluating the API usage of the application etc.

In an aspect in block the processing core may generate a plurality of application specific classifier models each of which evaluate a different software application. In an aspect the processing core may generate an application specific classifier model for every software application in the system and or so that every application running on the mobile device has its own active classifier. In an aspect in block the processing core may generate a family of application specific classifier models . Each application specific classifier model in the family of application specific classifier models may evaluate a different combination or number of the features that are relevant to a single software application.

In block the processing core may trim cull or prune the decision nodes i.e. boosted decision stumps included in one of the lean classifier models to generate application type specific classifier models . The generated application type specific classifier models may preferentially or exclusively include the decision nodes that are included in the full or lean classifier models that test or evaluate conditions or features that are relevant to a specific type category or class of software applications e.g. game navigation financial etc. . In an aspect the processing core may identify the decision nodes for inclusion in the application type specific classifier model by performing feature selection and culling operations. In an aspect the processing core may determine the category type or classification of each software application and or identify the decision nodes that are to be included in a application type specific classifier model by reading an application store label associated with the software application by performing static analysis operations and or by comparing the software application to other similar software applications.

In block the processing core may use one or any combination of the locally generated classifier models to perform real time behavior monitoring and analysis operations and predict whether a complex mobile device behavior is benign or contributing to the degradation of the performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device. In an aspect the mobile device may be configured use or apply multiple classifier models in parallel. In an aspect the processing core may give preference or priority to the results generated from applying or using application based classifier models over the results generated from applying using the lean classifier model when evaluating a specific software application. The processing core may use the results of applying the classifier models to predict whether a complex mobile device behavior is benign or contributing to the degradation of the performance or power consumption characteristics of the mobile device over time.

By dynamically generating the application based classifier models locally in the mobile device to account for application specific or application type specific features and or functionality the various aspects allow the mobile device to focus its monitoring operations on a small number of features that are most important for determining whether the operations of a specific software application are contributing to an undesirable or performance depredating behavior of the mobile device. This improves the performance and power consumption characteristics of the mobile device and allows the mobile device to perform the real time behavior monitoring and analysis operations continuously or near continuously without consuming an excessive amount of its processing memory or energy resources.

In an aspect a processing core in the mobile device may be configured to use the mappings between the decision nodes and the software applications App1 App5 to partition the classifier model into a plurality of application based classifier models. For example the processor may use the mappings to determine that an application based classifier for App1 should include decision nodes whereas an application based classifier for App1 should include decision nodes and . That is rather than generating and executing a different classifier model for each software application the processing core may apply a behavior vector to all the decision nodes included in the classifier model to execute the same set of decision nodes for all the classifiers. For each application App1 App5 the mobile device may apply a mask e.g. a zero one mask to the classifier model so that the decision nodes that are relent to the application App1 App5 are used or prioritized to evaluate device behaviors when that application is executing.

In an aspect the mobile device may calculate different weight values or different weighted averages for the decision nodes based on their relevance to their corresponding application App1 App5. Computing such a confidence for the malware benign value may include evaluating a number of decision nodes and taking a weighted average of their weight values. In an aspect the mobile device may compute the confidence value over the same or different lean classifiers. In an aspect the mobile device may compute different weighted averages for each combination of decision nodes that make up a classifier.

In block the processing core may perform joint feature selection and culling JFSP operations to generate a lean classifier model that includes a reduced number of decision nodes and features test conditions. In block the processing core may prioritize or rank the features test conditions in accordance with their relevance to classifying a behavior of the mobile device.

In block the processing core may derive or determine features test conditions for a software application by evaluating that application s permission set Fper. In block the processing core may determine the set of features or test conditions Finstall for a software application by evaluating the results of performing static or install time analysis on that application. In block the processing core may prioritize or rank the features test conditions for each application in accordance with their relevance to classifying a behavior of the mobile device. In an aspect this may be accomplished by via the formula Fapp FperUFinstall

In block the processing core may prioritize or rank the per application features Fapp by using JFSP as an ordering function. For example the processing core may perform JFSP operations on the lean classifier generated in block . In block the processing core may generate the ranked list of per application features Fapp. In block the processing core may apply JFSP to select the features of interest. In block the processing core may generate the per application lean classifier model to include the features of interest.

In block of method the processing core may receive a full classifier model that is or includes a finite state machine a list of boosted decision trees stumps or other similar information structure that identifies a plurality of test conditions. In an aspect the full classifier model includes a finite state machine that includes information suitable for expressing plurality of boosted decision stumps and or which include information that is suitable for conversion by the mobile device into a plurality of boosted decision stumps. In an aspect the finite state machine may be or may include an ordered or prioritized list of boosted decision stumps. Each of the boosted decision stumps may include a test condition and a weight value.

In block the processing core may determine the number unique test conditions that should be evaluated to accurately classify a mobile device behavior as being either malicious or benign without consuming an excessive amount of processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device. This may include determining an amount of processing memory and or energy resources available in the mobile device the amount processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device that are required to test a condition determining a priority and or a complexity associated with a behavior or condition that is to be analyzed or evaluated in the mobile device by testing the condition and selecting determining the number of unique test conditions so as to strike a balance or tradeoff between the consumption of available processing memory or energy resources of the mobile device the accuracy of the behavior classification that is to be achieved from testing the condition and the importance or priority of the behavior that is tested by the condition.

In block the processing core may use device specific or device state specific information to quickly identify the features and or test conditions that should be included or excluded from the lean classifier models. For example the processing core may identify the test conditions that test conditions features or factors that cannot be present in the mobile device due to the mobile device s current hardware or software configuration operating state etc. As another example the processing core may identify and exclude from the lean classifier models the features nodes stumps that are included in the full model and test conditions that cannot exist in the mobile device and or which are not relevant to the mobile device.

In an aspect in block the processing core may traverse the list of boosted decision stumps from the beginning to populate a list of selected test conditions with the determined number of unique test conditions and to exclude the test conditions identified in block . For example the processing core may skip ignore or delete features included in the full classifier model that test conditions that cannot be used by the software application. In an aspect the processing core may also determine an absolute or relative priority value for each of the selected test conditions and store the absolute or relative priorities value in association with their corresponding test conditions in the list of selected test conditions.

In an aspect in block the processing core may generating a list of test conditions by sequentially traversing the plurality of test conditions in the full classifier model and inserting those test conditions that are relevant to classifying the behavior of the mobile device into the list of test conditions until the list of test conditions includes the determined number of unique test conditions. In a further aspect generating the list of test conditions may include sequentially traversing the decision nodes of the full classifier model ignoring decision nodes associated with test conditions not relevant to the software application and inserting test conditions associated with each sequentially traversed decision node that is not ignored into the list of test conditions until the list of test conditions includes the determined number of unique test conditions.

In block the processing core may generate a lean classifier model that includes all the boosted decision stumps included in the full classifier model that test one of the selected test conditions and thus exclude the test conditions identified in block identified in the generated list of test conditions. In an aspect the processing core may generate the lean classifier model to include or express the boosted decision stumps in order of their importance or priority value. In an aspect in block the processing core may increase the number of unique test conditions in order to generate another more robust i.e. less lean lean classifier model by repeating the operations of traversing the list of boosted decision stumps for a larger number test conditions in block and generating another lean classifier mode. These operations may be repeated to generate a family of lean classifier models.

In block the processing core may use application specific information and or application type specific information to indentify features or test conditions that are included in the lean classifier model and which are relevant to determining whether a software application is contributing to a performance degrading behavior of a mobile device. In block the processing core may traverse the boosted decision stumps in the lean classifier model and select or map the decision stumps that test a feature or condition that is used by a software application to that software application and use the selected or mapped decision stumps as an application specific classifier model or an application type specific classifier model.

In block the processing core my perform observations to collect behavior information from various components that are instrumented at various levels of the mobile device system. In an aspect this may be accomplished via the behavior observer module discussed above with reference to . In block the processing core may generate a behavior vector characterizing the observations the collected behavior information and or a mobile device behavior. Also in block the processing core may use a full classifier model received from a network server to generate a lean classifier model or a family of lean classifier models of varying levels of complexity or leanness . To accomplish this the processing core may cull a family of boosted decision stumps included in the full classifier model to generate lean classifier models that include a reduced number of boosted decision stumps and or evaluate a limited number of test conditions.

In block the processing core may select the leanest classifier in the family of lean classifier models i.e. the model based on the fewest number of different mobile device states features behaviors or conditions that has not yet been evaluated or applied by the mobile device. In an aspect this may be accomplished by the processing core selecting the first classifier model in an ordered list of classifier models.

In block the processing core may apply collected behavior information or behavior vectors to each boosted decision stump in the selected lean classifier model. Because boosted decision stumps are binary decisions and the lean classifier model is generated by selecting many binary decisions that are based on the same test condition the process of applying a behavior vector to the boosted decision stumps in the lean classifier model may be performed in a parallel operation. Alternatively the behavior vector applied in block may be truncated or filtered to just include the limited number of test condition parameters included in the lean classifier model thereby further reducing the computational effort in applying the model.

In block the processing core may compute or determine a weighted average of the results of applying the collected behavior information to each boosted decision stump in the lean classifier model. In block the processing core may compare the computed weighted average to a threshold value. In determination block the processing core may determine whether the results of this comparison and or the results generated by applying the selected lean classifier model are suspicious. For example the processing core may determine whether these results may be used to classify a behavior as either malicious or benign with a high degree of confidence and if not treat the behavior as suspicious.

If the processing core determines that the results are suspicious e.g. determination block Yes the processing core may repeat the operations in blocks to select and apply a stronger i.e. less lean classifier model that evaluates more device states features behaviors or conditions until the behavior is classified as malicious or benign with a high degree of confidence. If the processing core determines that the results are not suspicious e.g. determination block No such as by determining that the behavior can be classified as either malicious or benign with a high degree of confidence in block the processing core may use the result of the comparison generated in block to classify a behavior of the mobile device as benign or potentially malicious.

In an alternative aspect method the operations described above may be accomplished by sequentially selecting a boosted decision stump that is not already in the lean classifier model identifying all other boosted decision stumps that depend upon the same mobile device state feature behavior or condition as the selected decision stump and thus can be applied based upon one determination result including in the lean classifier model the selected and all identified other boosted decision stumps that that depend upon the same mobile device state feature behavior or condition and repeating the process for a number of times equal to the determined number of test conditions. Because all boosted decision stumps that depend on the same test condition as the selected boosted decision stump are added to the lean classifier model each time limiting the number of times this process is performed will limit the number of test conditions included in the lean classifier model.

In an aspect the misclassified entries may be weighted based on their relatively accuracy or effectiveness. In operation the processor may boost or increase the weight of the entries that were misclassified by the generated second tree classifier h2 x to generate a third new tree classifier h3 x . In operation the operations of may be repeated to generate t number of new tree classifiers h x .

By boosting or increasing the weight of the entries that were misclassified by the first decision tree classifier h1 x the second tree classifier h2 x may more accurately classify the entities that were misclassified by the first decision tree classifier h1 x but may also misclassify some of the entities that where correctly classified by the first decision tree classifier h1 x . Similarly the third tree classifier h3 x may more accurately classify the entities that were misclassified by the second decision tree classifier h2 x and misclassify some of the entities that where correctly classified by the second decision tree classifier h2 x . That is generating the family of tree classifiers h1 x h x may not result in a system that converges as a whole but results in a number of decision trees classifiers that may be executed in parallel.

The observer mode module may receive control information from various sources which may include an analyzer unit e.g. the behavior analyzer module described above with reference to and or an application API. The observer mode module may send control information pertaining to various observer modes to the adaptive filter module and the high level behavior detection module .

The adaptive filter module may receive data information from multiple sources and intelligently filter the received information to generate a smaller subset of information selected from the received information. This filter may be adapted based on information or control received from the analyzer module or a higher level process communicating through an API. The filtered information may be sent to the throttle module which may be responsible for controlling the amount of information flowing from the filter to ensure that the high level behavior detection module does not become flooded or overloaded with requests or information.

The high level behavior detection module may receive data information from the throttle module control information from the observer mode module and context information from other components of the mobile device. The high level behavior detection module may use the received information to perform spatial and temporal correlations to detect or identify high level behaviors that may cause the device to perform at sub optimal levels. The results of the spatial and temporal correlations may be sent to the behavior vector generator which may receive the correlation information and generate a behavior vector that describes the behaviors of a particular process application or sub system. In an aspect the behavior vector generator may generate the behavior vector such that each high level behavior of a particular process application or sub system is an element of the behavior vector. In an aspect the generated behavior vector may be stored in a secure buffer . Examples of high level behavior detection may include detection of the existence of a particular event the amount or frequency of another event the relationship between multiple events the order in which events occur time differences between the occurrence of certain events etc.

In the various aspects the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observations and control the observation granularity. That is the behavior observer module may dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed. In this manner the behavior observer module enables the system to monitor the behaviors of the mobile device at various levels e.g. multiple coarse and fine levels . The behavior observer module may enable the system to adapt to what is being observed. The behavior observer module may enable the system to dynamically change the factors behaviors being observed based on a focused subset of information which may be obtained from a wide verity of sources.

As discussed above the behavior observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity based on information received from a variety of sources. For example the high level behavior detection module may receive information from the throttle module the observer mode module and context information received from other components e.g. sensors of the mobile device. As an example a high level behavior detection module performing temporal correlations might detect that a camera has been used and that the mobile device is attempting to upload the picture to a server. The high level behavior detection module may also perform spatial correlations to determine whether an application on the mobile device took the picture while the device was holstered and attached to the user s belt. The high level behavior detection module may determine whether this detected high level behavior e.g. usage of the camera while holstered is a behavior that is acceptable or common which may be achieved by comparing the current behavior with past behaviors of the mobile device and or accessing information collected from a plurality of devices e.g. information received from a crowd sourcing server . Since taking pictures and uploading them to a server while holstered is an unusual behavior as may be determined from observed normal behaviors in the context of being holstered in this situation the high level behavior detection module may recognize this as a potentially threatening behavior and initiate an appropriate response e.g. shutting off the camera sounding an alarm etc. .

The various aspects may provide cross layer observations on mobile devices encompassing webkit SDK NDK kernel drivers and hardware in order to characterize system behavior. The behavior observations may be made in real time.

The observer module may perform adaptive observation techniques and control the observation granularity. As discussed above there are a large number i.e. thousands of factors that could contribute to the mobile device s degradation and it may not be feasible to monitor observe all of the different factors that may contribute to the degradation of the device s performance. To overcome this the various aspects dynamically identify the relevant behaviors that are to be observed and dynamically determine the level of detail at which the identified behaviors are to be observed.

In determination block the mobile device processor may determine whether suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis. When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes in block the processor may initiate a process to correct the behavior and return to block to perform additional coarse observations.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems cannot be identified and or corrected based on the results of the behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No in determination block the mobile device processor may determine whether there is a likelihood of a problem. In an aspect the mobile device processor may determine that there is a likelihood of a problem by computing a probability of the mobile device encountering potential problems and or engaging in suspicious behaviors and determining whether the computed probability is greater than a predetermined threshold. When the mobile device processor determines that the computed probability is not greater than the predetermined threshold and or there is not a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block No the processor may return to block to perform additional coarse observations.

When the mobile device processor determines that there is a likelihood that suspicious behaviors or potential problems exist and or are detectable i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform deeper logging observations or final logging on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform deeper and more detailed observations on the identified subsystems processes or applications. In block the mobile device processor may perform further and or deeper behavioral analysis based on the deeper and more detailed observations. In determination block the mobile device processor may again determine whether the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis. When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems cannot be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block No the processor may repeat the operations in blocks until the level of detail is fine enough to identify the problem or until it is determined that the problem cannot be identified with additional detail or that no problem exists.

When the mobile device processor determines that the suspicious behaviors or potential problems can be identified and corrected based on the results of the deeper behavioral analysis i.e. determination block Yes in block the mobile device processor may perform operations to correct the problem behavior and the processor may return to block to perform additional operations.

In an aspect as part of blocks of method the mobile device processor may perform real time behavior analysis of the system s behaviors to identify suspicious behaviors from limited and coarse observations to dynamically determine the behaviors to observe in greater detail and to dynamically determine the precise level of detail required for the observations. This enables the mobile device processor to efficiently identify and prevent problems from occurring without requiring the use of a large amount of processor memory or battery resources on the device.
