The present application claims priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10 2014 0041815 filed on Apr. 8 2014 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Various embodiments of the present invention relate to a semiconductor design technology and more particularly to testing semiconductor devices.

In general semiconductor devices pass through various types of tests before shipment and the operations of the semiconductor devices are verified through the tests.

When various types of tests are performed on a semiconductor device failure information is generated during each of the tests. Based on the failure information the semiconductor device may be repaired in various manners to correct the failures so that the device performs operations normally.

As described above various types of tests need to be performed and various pieces of failure information may be generated whenever one test is performed. However it may be very inefficient to repair the semiconductor device by immediately providing failure information whenever each test is completed.

Thus a plurality of tests are sequentially and intensely performed plural pieces of failure information generated at each of the tests are collectively stored in a specific storage and repair operations for the respective tests are then performed.

For reference illustrates a method for storing information on a plurality of defective memory cells in a semiconductor memory device such as DDR SDRAM. However this is an example and various pieces of failure information may occur during a test process for the semiconductor device.

Since a plurality of memory cells are arranged in array a row address and a column address are needed to specify a defective memory cell in which a failure occurred.

Thus the conventional method stores a row address and a column address of the defective memory cell in storage of test equipment.

While a plurality of tests are performed on a plurality of memory cells failure determinations may be repetitively made on the same memory cell.

However since a plurality of tests are sequentially and intensely performed row addresses and column addresses of memory cells that fail any of the tests are stored regardless of whether the respective pieces of failure information overlap each other.

Thus the row addresses and the column addresses indicating the same memory cells may be repetitively stored. For example referring to column row addresses 1 2 4 4 and 7 8 are determined to be failure addresses and stored at the first test. Then column row addresses 1 2 4 4 and 7 8 are determined to be failure addresses and stored again at the second test. This occurs since an error is highly likely to repetitively occur in a defective memory cell when applying plural tests.

When plural pieces of failure information generated during the respective tests are repetitively stored storage space for storing the failure information needs to be increased resulting in the test cost inevitably increasing.

Various embodiments are directed to an integrated circuit that may minimize the increase of storage space caused by overlapping failure information when a plurality of tests are sequentially and intensely performed a tester including the same and an operation method thereof.

In an embodiment of the present invention an integrated circuit may include first to third failure information storage units an input selection unit suitable for alternately storing plural pieces of failure information in the first and second failure information storage units generated whenever each of a plurality of tests is performed on a device under test DUT and a storage selection unit suitable for relocating the plural pieces of failure information from the first or second failure information storage unit that was not selected by the input selection unit to the third failure information storage unit while excluding overlapping failure information from relocating.

In an embodiment of the present invention an integrated circuit may include first to third failure information storage units an input selection unit suitable for alternately storing plural pieces of failure information in the first and second failure information storage units generated whenever each of a plurality of tests is performed on a device under test DUT in a first operation mode and a storage selection unit suitable for relocating the plural pieces of failure information from the first or second failure information storage unit that was not selected by the input selection unit to the third failure information storage unit while excluding overlapping failure information from relocating during the first operation mode.

In an embodiment of the present invention there is provided a method of testing a semiconductor device. The method may include storing plural pieces of failure information in a first failure information storage space generated whenever an odd numbered test among a plurality of tests is performed on the semiconductor device storing plural pieces of failure information in a second failure information storage space generated whenever an even numbered test among the plurality of tests is performed on the semiconductor device relocating the plural pieces of failure information stored in the second failure information storage space to a third failure information storage space while the plural pieces of failure information is stored in the first failure information storage space wherein overlapping failure information that overlaps the plural pieces of failure information stored in the third failure information storage space is stored only one time and relocating the plural pieces of failure information stored in the first failure information storage space to the third failure information storage space while the plural pieces of failure information is stored in the second failure information storage space wherein the overlapping failure information is stored only one time.

Various embodiments will be described below in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. The present invention may however be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.

In the drawings thicknesses and lengths of components are exaggerated compared to actual physical thickness and lengths for convenience of illustration. In the following description a detailed explanation of known related functions and constitutions may be omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the subject manner of the present invention. Furthermore connected coupled represents that one component is directly coupled to another component or indirectly coupled through another component. In this specification a singular form may include a plural form as long as it is not specifically mentioned in a sentence. Furthermore include comprise or including comprising used in the specification represents that one or more components steps operations and elements exist or are added.

Referring to the integrated circuit may include a first failure information storage unit a second failure information storage unit a third failure information storage unit an input selection unit and a storage selection unit .

The integrated circuit may support a test operation. The integrated circuit may be implemented in one chip or multiple chips or may be implemented on a board or a module. The integrated circuit may be attached in a tester or in test equipment on which a semiconductor device to be tested is mounted that is a device under test DUT or may be separately provided outside the tester. Additionally a test operation unit and a test result processing unit as shown in may be included in the tester.

The first failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3. The number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated at one test TEST 1 or 3.

The second failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2. The number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated at one test TEST 2.

That is the first failure information storage unit and the second failure information storage unit are coupled in parallel to the input selection unit and designed in the same manner as each other.

For reference among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 the first test TEST 1 is performed to generate plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 the second test TEST 2 is performed to generate plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and the third test TEST 3 is performed to generate plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3. illustrates the configuration in which the plural pieces of first or third failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 are stored in the first failure information storage unit and the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 are stored in the second failure information storage unit . This configuration is based on the operation of the input selection unit which will be described below.

The third failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T. The third failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated without overlapping each other during the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3.

That is the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit may indicate failure information obtained by combining the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 while overlapping failure information is included only one time.

Thus the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit may be designed to be different from the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first or second failure information storage unit or . For example when the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit is set to M the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 2 stored in the first or second failure information storage unit or may be set to N. In this case M is a natural number larger than N.

For reference the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 which may be stored in the first and second failure information storage units and will be referred to as N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 and the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit will be referred to as M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T.

The test operation unit performs the plurality of test TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 in a preset order on a DUT and outputs N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed on the DUT to the input selection unit . Since the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 may not be performed at the same time N pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 N pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and N pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 may be inputted to the input selection unit at different time points.

For example as illustrated in the test operation unit may perform the first test TEST 1 to generate N pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 and then output the N pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 to the input selection unit . Furthermore as illustrated in the test operation unit may perform the second test TEST 2 to generate N pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and then output the N pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 to the input selection unit . Furthermore as illustrated in the test operation unit may perform the third test TEST 3 to generate N pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 and then output the N pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 to the input selection unit .

The input selection unit alternately stores the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed in the first and second failure information storage units and .

For example as illustrated in the input selection unit may store the N pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1 performed through the test operation unit in the first failure information storage unit . Then as illustrated in the input selection unit may store the N pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated as the result of the second test TEST 2 performed through the test operation unit in the second failure information storage unit . Furthermore as illustrated in the input selection unit may store the N pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 generated as the result of the third test TEST 3 performed through the test operation unit in the first failure information storage unit .

The storage selection unit selects the first or second failure information storage unit or in the opposite manner to selection of the input selection unit whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed. Then the storage selection unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the selected failure information storage unit or into the third failure information storage unit . The storage selection unit stores overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO only one time. That is the storage selection unit additionally stores or relocates only rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO in the third failure information storage unit and then initializes the selected failure information storage unit or . The rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO may be obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO which overlaps the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 1 N stored in the selected failure information storage unit or whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed.

The output selection unit selects the first or second failure information storage unit or in the opposite manner to selection of the input selection unit whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed. At a preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the output selection unit additionally selects the failure information storage unit or which was selected by the input selection unit when the last test TEST 3 was performed.

The storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the failure information storage units or selected by the output selection unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit and additionally stores the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO according to the comparison result in the third failure information storage unit .

For example the input selection unit stores N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever an odd numbered test TEST 1 or TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed in the first failure information storage unit . The input selection unit stores N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated whenever an even numbered test TEST 2 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed in the second failure information storage unit .

Whenever an even numbered test TEST 2 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed the output selection unit couples an output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple an output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit . Furthermore whenever an odd numbered test TEST 1 or TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit . Furthermore when the last test TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is an odd numbered test as illustrated in the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit at a preset period after all of the test. TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. Furthermore when the last test. TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is an even numbered test unlike the state illustrated in the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit at a preset period after all of the test TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed.

When the storage operation unit is coupled to the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit through the operation of the output selection unit the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit selects only the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO which does not overlap the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T with the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit and stores the selected information in the third failure information storage unit . Then the storage operation unit deletes all of the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit . Furthermore when the storage operation unit is coupled to the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit through the operation of the output selection unit the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit selects only the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO which does not overlap the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T with the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit and stores the selected information in the third failure information storage unit . Then the storage operation unit deletes all of the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit .

For reference since the first embodiment of the present invention is based on the supposition that the number of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is set to three the number of odd numbered tests TEST 1 and TEST 3 is two and the number of even numbered test TEST 2 is one. However this is only an example and a larger number of tests may be sequentially performed first to third failure information storage units and the input selection unit and the storage selection unit will now be described.

As illustrated in when the input selection unit selects the first failure information storage unit while the first test TEST 1 is performed the output selection unit selects the second failure information storage unit . However no failure information is stored in the second failure information storage unit while the first test TEST 1 is performed. Thus the storage operation unit performs no operation and no failure information is stored in the third failure information storage unit .

As illustrated in when the input selection unit selects the second failure information storage unit while the second test TEST 2 is performed the output selection unit selects the first failure information storage unit . While the second test TEST 2 is performed as illustrated in the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated when the first test TEST 1 was performed as illustrated in are already stored in the first failure information storage unit . Thus while the second test TEST 2 is performed as illustrated in the storage operation unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL. INFO 1 generated when the first test TEST 1 was performed as illustrated in into the third failure information storage unit from the first failure information storage unit . At this time no failure information is stored in the third failure information storage unit while the second test TEST 2 is performed as illustrated in . Thus the storage operation unit stores the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1 in the third failure information storage unit as it is. Therefore M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit when the second test TEST 2 is ended may be considered as the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1.

When the input selection unit reselects the first failure information storage unit while the third test TEST 3 is performed as illustrated in the output selection unit reselects the second failure information storage unit . While the third test TEST3 is performed as illustrated in the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated when the second test. TEST 2 was performed as illustrated in are already stored in the second failure information storage unit . Thus while the third test. TEST3 is performed as illustrated in the storage operation unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated when the second test TEST 2 was performed as illustrated in into the third failure information storage unit from the second failure information storage unit . While the third test TEST3 is performed as illustrated in the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated when the first test TEST 1 was performed are already stored in the third failure information storage unit . Thus while the third test TEST3 is performed as illustrated in the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated as the result of the second test TEST 2 to the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1 determines first rest failure information REST FAIL INFO by excluding the first overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 generated as the result of the second test TEST 2 and then additionally stores the first rest failure information REST FAIL INFO in the third failure information storage unit . As a result first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO is stored in the third failure information storage unit when the third test TEST 3 illustrated in is ended. The first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO is obtained by combining the first rest failure information REST FAIL INFO and the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1. Thus when the third test TEST 3 is ended the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit may be considered as the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO.

As illustrated in when the input selection unit performs no operation since all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 were performed the output selection unit additionally selects the first failure information storage unit . The N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 3 generated when the third test TEST 3 was performed as illustrated in are already stored in the first failure information storage unit at the preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed as illustrated in . Thus during the preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed as illustrated in the storage operation unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 3 generated when the third test TEST 3 was performed as illustrated in into the third failure information storage unit from the first failure information storage unit . During the preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed as illustrated in the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO 1 is already stored in the third failure information storage unit . Thus during the preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed as illustrated in the storage operation unit compares the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO 1 to the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 3 generated as the result of the third test TEST 3 determines second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO by excluding the second overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 3 generated as the result of the third test TEST 3 according to the comparison result and then additionally stores the second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO in the third failure information storage unit . As a result when the preset period is ended after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed as illustrated in second overlap failure information FAIL INFO is stored in the third failure information storage unit . The second overlap failure information FAIL INFO is obtained by combining the first rest failure information REST FAIL INFO the second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO and the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1.

As illustrated in the second overlap failure information FAIL INFO is finally stored in the second failure information storage unit as the result of the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3. Thus the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T which are finally stored in the third failure information storage unit may be considered as the second overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO. The configuration illustrated in is only an example. When a larger number of tests are sequentially performed M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T may be set in a different manner.

The test result processing unit repairs errors which occurred in the DUT using the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. That is the test result processing unit operates during a repair period that is performed after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. For example when information containing failures which occurred in a plurality of memory cells in a semiconductor memory device such as DDR DRAM is stored in the third failure information storage unit circuits for repairing the defective memory cells in the DUT with redundancy memory cells may be included in the test result processing unit.

For reference during the preset period which needs to be guaranteed for the operation illustrated in after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the repair period may be set so as not to overlap the preset period or set to overlap the preset period. For example when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit are transmitted to the test result processing unit the preset period and the repair period may overlap each other when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T are sequentially transmitted from the previously stored failure information. Moreover when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit are transmitted to the test result processing unit the test result processing unit needs to enter the repair period after the preset period when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T are transmitted in parallel. When the preset period and the repair period are set to not overlap each other the test result processing unit may enter the repair period in a predetermined time after the preset time as long as the condition that the repair period follows the preset period is maintained.

As described above when the first embodiment of the present invention is applied to an integrated circuit the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 occurring in each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are alternately stored in the two different storage spaces when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are sequentially and intensely performed. Then when the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in each of the two storage spaces and are transferred into the third storage space the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO is removed. Thus the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO is contained in the third storage space only once. Therefore when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the space for storing the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 1 N and FAIL INFO 3 may be minimized.

Referring to the integrated circuit may include a first failure information storage unit a second failure information storage unit a third failure information storage unit an input selection unit and a storage selection unit .

The integrated circuit may support a test operation. The integrated circuit may be implemented in one chip or multiple chips or may be implemented on a board or a module. The integrated circuit may be attached in a tester or test equipment on which a semiconductor device to be tested is mounted that is a device under test DUT or may be separately provided outside the tester. Additionally a mode control unit a test operation unit and a test result processing unit shown in may be included in the tester.

The first failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3. The number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated during one test TEST 1 TEST 3 or TEST 3.

The second failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3. The number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the second failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated during one test TEST 1 TEST 3 or TEST 3.

That is the first failure information storage unit and the second failure information storage unit may be coupled in parallel to the input selection unit and designed in the same manner as each other.

For reference among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 the first test TEST 1 is performed to generate plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 the second test TEST 2 is performed to generate plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and the third test TEST 3 is performed to generate plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3.

The third failure information storage unit may include a plurality of latches or flip flops not illustrated to store plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T. The number of pieces of failure information stored in the third failure information storage unit may be designed to store the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated without overlapping each other during the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3.

That is the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit may indicate failure information obtained by combining the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 while overlapping failure information is included only once.

Thus the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit may be designed to be different from the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first or second failure information storage unit or . For example when the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit is set to M the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first or second failure information storage unit or may be set to N where M is a natural number larger than N.

For reference to clarify a difference therebetween the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 which may be stored in the first and second failure information storage units and will be referred to as N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 and the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit will be referred to as M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T.

The test operation unit performs the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 on a DUT in a preset order and outputs N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 to the input selection unit generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed on the DUT. Since the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 may not be performed at the same time the N pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 the N pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 and the N pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 are inputted to the input selection unit at different time points.

The mode control unit generates a mode control signal MODE SEL for distinguishing between first and second operation modes and transmits the generated mode control signal MODE SEL to the first and second failure information storage units and . For example the mode control unit does not couple the first and second failure information storage units and such that the first operation mode is performed based on the mode control signal MODE SEL having a first logic level such as a logic high level. The mode control unit couples the first and second failure information storage units and such that the second operation mode is performed based on the operation mode signal MODE SEL having a second logic level such as a logic low level. Then the first and second failure information storage units and coupled to each other are set to an integrated failure information storage unit.

During the second operation mode set by the mode control unit a test may be normally performed even when the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed exceed the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated during one test TEST 1 TEST 2 or TEST 3. Since the integrated failure information storage unit is configured by coupling the first and second failure information storage units and the capacity is doubled. That is the test may be normally performed until the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 exceed double of the maximum number of pieces of failure information which are expected to be generated during one test TEST 1 TEST 2 or TEST 3.

During the second operation mode set by the mode control unit the first and second failure information storage units and are coupled to operate as an integrated failure information storage unit. Thus as described below operations of the input selection unit and the output selection unit relay not be required.

The input selection unit alternately stores the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 N or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed in the first failure information storage unit and the second failure information storage unit during the first operation mode.

In the second operation mode set by the mode control unit when an output terminal of the first failure information storage unit and an input terminal of the second failure information storage unit are coupled to each other such that the first and second failure information storage units and are set to an integrated failure information storage unit as illustrated in or an output terminal of the second failure information storage unit and an input terminal of the first failure information storage unit are coupled to each other such that the first and second failure information storage units and are set to the integrated failure information storage unit the input selection unit stores the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 in the integrated failure information storage unit that are generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed.

The storage selection unit selects the first or second failure information storage unit or in the opposite manner to the selection of the input selection unit whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed during the first operation mode. Then the storage selection unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the selected failure information storage unit or into the third failure information storage unit . The storage selection unit stores overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO only once. That is the storage selection unit additionally stores or relocates only rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO in the third failure information storage unit during the first operation mode and then initializes the selected failure information storage unit or . The rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO may be obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO which overlaps the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the selected failure information storage unit or whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed.

Furthermore the storage selection unit additionally stores only rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO in the third failure information storage unit in the second operation and then initializes the integrated failure information storage unit. The rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO may be obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO which overlaps the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the integrated failure information storage unit.

The output selection unit selects the first or second failure information storage unit or in the opposite manner to the selection of the input selection unit whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed during the first operation mode. At a preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the output selection unit additionally selects the failure information storage unit or which was selected between the first and second failure information storage units and by the input selection unit when the last test TEST 3 was performed.

Furthermore the output selection unit selects the integrated failure information storage unit whenever each of the of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed during the second operation mode.

The storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the failure information storage unit or the integrated failure information storage unit and selected by the output selection unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit and additionally stores rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO according to the comparison result the third failure information storage unit .

For example during the first operation mode the input selection unit stores N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3

Furthermore during the second operation mode the input selection unit stores N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 generated whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed in the integrated failure information storage unit.

The output selection unit couples an output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple an output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit whenever an even numbered test TEST 2 among the plurality of tests. TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed during the first operation mode. Furthermore the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit whenever an odd numbered test TEST 1 or TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed during the first operation mode. Furthermore when the last test TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is an odd numbered test in the first operation mode the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit at a preset period after all of the test TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. Furthermore when the last test TEST 3 among the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is an even numbered test in the first operation mode the output selection unit couples the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit and does not couple the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit to the storage operation unit at the preset period after all of the test TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed.

Furthermore the output selection unit couples an output terminal of the integrated failure information storage unit and to the storage operation unit whenever each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is performed or at the preset period after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed.

When the storage operation unit is coupled to the output terminal of the first failure information storage unit through the operation of the output selection unit the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit selects only the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO which does not overlap the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit and stores the selected information in the third failure information storage unit . Then to the storage operation unit deletes all of the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the first failure information storage unit . Furthermore when the storage operation unit is coupled to the output terminal of the second failure information storage unit through the operation of the output selection unit the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit selects only the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO which does not overlap the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit and stores the selected information in the third failure information storage unit . Then the storage operation unit deletes all of the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 2 stored in the second failure information storage unit .

When the storage operation unit is coupled to the integrated failure information storage unit and through the operation of the output selection unit the storage operation unit compares the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 FAIL INFO 3 stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and to the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit and selects only the rest failure information REST FAIL INFO or REST FAIL INFO which does not overlap the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T from the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and and stores the selected information in the third failure information storage unit . Then the storage operation unit deletes all of the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and .

For reference since the embodiment of the present invention is based on the supposition that the number of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 is set to three the number of odd numbered tests TEST 1 and TEST 3 is two and the number of even numbered test TEST 2 is one. However this is only an example and a larger number of tests may be sequentially performed.

The test result processing unit repairs errors which occurred in a DUT using the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. That is the test result processing unit operates during a repair period which is performed after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed. For example when information containing failures which occurred in a plurality of memory cells in a semiconductor memory device such as DDR DRAM is stored in the third failure information storage unit circuits for repairing the defective memory cells in the DUT with redundancy memory cells may be included in the test result processing unit.

For reference during the preset period which needs to be guaranteed for the operation illustrated in after all of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the repair period may be set to not overlap the preset period or set to overlap the preset period. For example when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit are transmitted to the test result processing unit the preset period and the repair period may overlap each other when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T are sequentially transmitted from previously stored failure information. When the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit are transmitted to the test result processing unit the test result processing unit needs to enter the repair period after the preset period when the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T are transmitted in parallel at a time. Furthermore when the preset period and the repair period are set to not overlap each other the test result processing unit may enter the repair period in a predetermined time after the preset period as long as the condition that the repair period follows the preset period is maintained.

Except that the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 are alternately stored in the first and second failure information storage units and during the first operation mode but the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 are stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and during the second operation mode the first and second embodiments seem to have no difference in operation since the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO overlapping the information stored in the third failure information storage unit is removed in both of the first and second operation modes.

However the operations of the first and second operation modes are different from each other considering that the operation of the input selection unit to store the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 and the operation of the storage selection unit to transfer the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 may not be performed at the same time.

Specifically during the first operation mode the operation of the input selection unit to store the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 in the first failure information storage unit may be performed during the operation of the storage selection unit to transfer the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the second failure information storage unit . Thus while the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are sequentially performed in the first operation mode a separate address transmission operation does not need to be performed between the respective tests.

In the second operation mode however while the input selection unit stores the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 in the integrated failure information storage unit and the storage selection unit may not operate and while the storage selection unit transfers the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and the input selection unit may not operate. Thus when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are sequentially performed in the second operation mode a separate address transmission operation needs to be performed between the respective tests.

Thus in the second operation mode the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 may be normally performed even through the number of N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 exceeds the maximum value which may be set in the first operation mode. The time required for sequentially performing the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 in the second operation mode becomes larger than the time required for sequentially performing the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 in the first operation mode.

Specifically when the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 are generated as the result of the first test TEST 1 the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 are stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and and then transferred into the third failure information storage unit through an address transmission operation 1. As a result the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO  T stored in the third failure information storage unit may be considered as the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 when the first test TEST 1 is ended. Furthermore after the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 are transferred to the third failure information storage unit and then stored the integrated failure information storage unit and is initialized.

Furthermore when the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 are generated as the result of the second test TEST 2 the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 are stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and and then transferred into the third failure information storage unit through an address transmission operation 2. Since the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 are already stored in the third failure information storage unit only the first rest information REST FAIL INFO is additionally stored in the third failure information storage unit . The first rest information REST FAIL INFO may be obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO which overlaps the plural pieces of first failure information FAIL INFO 1 from the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2. Thus first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO is stored in the third failure information storage unit . The first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO may be obtained by combining the first rest failure information REST FAIL INFO and the N pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 generated as the result of the first test TEST 1. As a result the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit when the second test TEST 2 is ended may be considered as the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO. Furthermore after the plural pieces of second failure information FAIL INFO 2 are transferred into the third failure information storage unit and then stored the integrated failure information storage unit and is initialized.

Furthermore when the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 are generated as the result of the third test TEST 3 the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 are stored in the integrated failure information storage unit and and then transferred into the third failure information storage unit at a preset period. Since the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO is already stored in the third failure information storage unit only second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO is additionally stored in the third failure information storage unit . The second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO may be obtained by excluding the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO which overlaps the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO from the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3.

Thus second overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO is stored in the third failure information storage unit . The second overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO may be obtained by combining the second rest failure information REST FAIL INFO and the first overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO. As a result the M pieces of failure information FAIL INFO T stored in the third failure information storage unit when the third test TEST 3 is ended may be considered as the second overlap removed failure information FAIL INFO. Furthermore after the plural pieces of third failure information FAIL INFO 3 are transferred into the third failure information storage unit and then stored the integrated failure information storage unit and is initialized.

As described above when the second embodiment of the present invention is applied to an integrated circuit the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 occurring in each of the tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are alternately stored in the two different storage spaces and when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are sequentially and intensely performed. Then when the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 stored in each of the two storage spaces and are transferred into the third storage space the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO is removed. Thus the overlapping failure information OVER FAIL INFO is contained in the third storage space only once. Therefore when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the space for storing the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 may be minimized.

Furthermore the two storage spaces each capable of storing the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 may be controlled to be used as one integrated storage space according to the operation mode. Thus even when the number of pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 exceeds an expected number the test operation may be normally performed. Therefore when the plurality of tests TEST 1 TEST 2 and TEST 3 are performed the space for storing the plural pieces of failure information FAIL INFO 1 FAIL INFO 2 or FAIL INFO 3 may be minimized and efficiently used.

Although various embodiments have been described for illustrative purposes it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.
