title: Commercially subsidized mobile communication devices and services
abstract: Mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones, may be capable of recommending to a user various providers of one or more solicited services, e.g., by identifying a user location and identifying providers near the user location that provide the services, and by initiating a call between the user and a selected provider. However, the equipment and service costs of such devices may be prohibitive, particularly for mid-range mobile communication devices that may appeal to cost-conscious users. The prohibitive costs may be diminished by redirecting part or all of the cost of providing the recommendation service from the providers, e.g., by charging the provider a service cost upon initiating a call from the user to the provider, or upon representing the provider in a provider database. In one such embodiment, all service costs may be borne by providers, providing to the user a free recommendation service via the mobile communication device.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 706 997 filed on Dec. 6 2012 titled COMMERCIALLY SUBSIDIZED MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND SERVICES which is in turn a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 701 539 filed on Feb. 6 2010 titled COMMERCIALLY SUBSIDIZED MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND SERVICES and the entirety of both such patent applications are incorporated by reference herein.

In the field of mobile computing a mobile device may be capable of providing recommendations for local services. For example a global positioning system GPS device may be configured to receive a query from a user for a particular type of service such as a particular type of food or the sale of fuel and to display the names and locations of nearby providers of such services. Similarly a cellphone phone may permit users to call an information line and receive recommendations for a particular type of service in a specified city and to contact the providers e.g. to inquire about the provided services and the hours of operation. A GPS equipped cellphone device may provide both such capabilities by locating the current position of the user displaying nearby providers of selected services and allowing the user to contact the providers.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

While mobile communication devices may be configured both to locate nearby providers of a desired service and to contact the providers the provision of such services to the user may be costly. As a first example such capabilities may entail comparatively sophisticated hardware and software including a GPS receiver or other geolocation device mapping hardware or software a high quality display that may render useful maps and cellular communications hardware. Moreover the user may wish to communicate with providers of such services in other ways such as by visiting the websites of the providers and the mobile communication device may comprise a robust processor a significant amount of higher performance memory Internet communications infrastructure e.g. a TCP IP protocol stack a general purpose web browser and various input mechanisms e.g. a hardware keyboard or a touchscreen coupled with a software keyboard. This equipment may result in a higher cost of the mobile communication device that is too expensive for some users. As a second example such capabilities involve comparatively high service charges e.g. communications with providers of the solicited services may be charged against a user s per minute metered call plan for the duration of a call to a service provider or a per kilobyte metered internet access plan for visiting the websites of various providers. This consumption of the user s metered data services may be too expensive for many users thereby diminishing or preventing these users participation in the provider search services. As a third example the mobile communication device may not even have a general purpose communication interface that is accessible to the user or the costs associated therewith but may be configured to communicate only with providers of a solicited service.

One technique that may be implemented to address these cost problems involves a subsidization of the search service by the potential providers of such services. For example part or all of the costs of the mobile communication device may be subsidized by the providers of such services and or the charge of a metered data plan for a communication session established between a user and a provider of a solicited service may be partly or wholly charged to the provider instead of to the user. The mobile communication device may therefore be configured to support the charging of some portion of the service charge of the device to the providers of solicited services thereby rendering the device and the search service more affordable for the users. This improved affordability may consequently promote the acquisition of such devices and the utilization of the service by more cost conscious users. Moreover the charges to a particular provider may be computed proportionally to the benefit of the utilized service to the provider such as per impression e.g. upon recommending a provider of a solicited service to a user or per click through e.g. upon initiating a communication session between the user and the provider relating to the solicited service. Alternatively these techniques may be utilized in a mobile communication device e.g. a GPS receiver that does not have a data plan or a general purpose communication interface but that is capable of communicating with providers of solicited services.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In the field of mobile computing many scenarios may involve a solicitation of a user of a mobile device for a service. For example a user may request the locations of fuel depots vehicle repair services lodging or restaurants serving a particular type of food. The user might enter such queries into a global positioning system GPS receiver which may locate relevant providers of such services near the user may display the locations of the providers on a map of the locale of the user and may provide directions from the user location to a provider selected by the user. Alternatively the user might enter such queries into a mobile phone which may call a human or automated service e.g. a 411 or information service for a list of recommendations of providers of the desired service s within a desired location and which may assist the user in calling a selected provider of such services e.g. to inquire about the provided services the costs thereof or the hours of operation of the provider. A hybrid mobile device might comprise both a mobile phone and a GPS receiver and might assist the user both in locating nearby services and in contacting the recommended providers in order to negotiate the provision of the solicited services.

The exemplary scenario of also illustrates a second user who may similarly solicit services from various providers using a mobile communication device . However this mobile communication device may be configured to permit communication with providers through a web interface e.g. a web browser through which may be viewed the provider websites of various providers . In exchange for this enhanced capability the second user may pay a device cost for the mobile communication device by contrast with the first user who may pay little or no device cost for the simpler mobile communication device . The second user submits the user query soliciting the service to the mobile communication device which processes the user query against the provider database and provides a set of recommendations of various providers that may be able to provide the service . Instead of calling a selected provider as performed by the first user the second user may use the mobile communication device to access the provider website of the selected provider in regard to the service e.g. in order to examine the menu of the restaurant or to place a food order online. This accessing may be handled by the communications service provider which may provide internet access e.g. web service to the mobile communication device according to a metered data plan such as a cap on the number of megabytes of data that may be transferred in browsing sessions within a particular period. Accordingly the communications service provider may receive the request to visit the provider website and may initiate a communication session e.g. a browser session with access to the internet between the second user and the provider website which may e.g. be hosted by a third party on behalf of the provider . The second user may therefore communicate with the service provider and the data exchange involved in the communication session may be deducted from the metered data plan of the second user e.g. as a service charge deducted from the service allotment of the second user or as an overage charge to be assessed against the second user for exceeding the service allotment of the metered data plan . In this manner the mobile communication devices facilitate the user in selecting recommended providers of solicited services .

These scenarios illustrate a few techniques for interfacing a user with the providers of various services through a mobile communication device . However these scenarios illustrate some drawbacks that may discourage or preclude more cost conscious users from participating in these scenarios. As a first example the service cost may deter users who have metered data plans with low data limits or who use a significant portion of their data limits within the designated period and who may therefore decline to utilize the provider recommendation service in order to avoid service overage charges. As a second example more sophisticated mobile communication device may have a comparatively high device cost to the user . While simpler mobile communication devices might be provided by the communications service provider at a free or reduced price more sophisticated devices may be prohibitively expensive to acquire for cost conscious users . For example in order to provide internet access in lieu of and or in addition to phone communication the second mobile communication device features a hard keyboard a larger or higher quality display communications hardware and software that together implement a network communication protocol e.g. a TCP IP protocol stack an implementation of a web browser and a more sophisticated processor and memory that are utilized in executing the web browser and rendering the provider website . This hardware and software often entails a higher device cost for acquiring the mobile communication device . Moreover the communications service provider may charge additional fees for data access which may be additional to service fees for mobile phone service. Thus even if a user wishes to acquire and use a mobile communication device that is capable of presenting recommendations for providers of solicited services the costs of the mobile communication device and the communications service may be prohibitive for cost conscious users thereby reducing participation in the recommendation service and the patronage of the providers by the users .

Conversely the providers of such services may achieve higher patronage and greater profit by promoting the acquisition and utilization of recommendation providing mobile communication devices by users . Providers may therefore be interested in promoting the uptake of such devices by subsidizing the acquisition and service costs. For example a provider may be willing to pay the service cost for a communication session with the user ensuing from a recommendation of the provider for the solicited service and a group of such providers may together contribute a subsidy to reduce the costs of mobile communication devices that are capable of recommending such providers in response to user queries submitted by the users of such devices. As a result the user may receive a better mobile communication device at a reduced cost and may freely or more cheaply access the recommendation service the communications service provider may benefit by offering more sophisticated equipment and additional services to its users at more affordable rates and the providers may benefit from greater patronage of services resulting from the recommendations to the users .

Still another embodiment involves a computer readable medium comprising processor executable instructions configured to apply the techniques presented herein. An exemplary computer readable medium that may be devised in these ways is illustrated in wherein the implementation comprises a computer readable medium e.g. a CD R DVD R or a platter of a hard disk drive on which is encoded computer readable data . This computer readable data in turn comprises a set of computer instructions configured to operate according to the principles set forth herein. In one such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to perform a method of connecting a user of a mobile communication device with at least one provider of a service solicited by the user such as the exemplary method of . In another such embodiment the processor executable instructions may be configured to implement a system for connecting a user of a mobile communication device with at least one provider of a service solicited by the user such as the exemplary system of . Many such computer readable media may be devised by those of ordinary skill in the art that are configured to operate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the exemplary method of and the exemplary system of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios within which such techniques are implemented. As a first variation of this first aspect many types of mobile communication devices may be capable of establishing many forms of communication sessions with which these techniques may interface. A mobile cellphone device or two way radio device may be advantageous for establishing voice based communications with various providers . A mobile camera device may provide a visual and or audiovisual communication session with such providers . Various text based mobile communication devices may establish various types of textual communication sessions with providers such as via SMS message instant message or other form of textual chat or email communication. A mobile network communications device such as a mobile device featuring a web browser may establish interactive communication sessions with various automated services offered by a provider such as a website hosted by a webserver on behalf of the provider . Other types of communication sessions or combinations thereof may also be initiated and established by such mobile communication devices .

As a second variation of this first aspect these techniques may be utilized with mobile communication devices having many types of architectures. As a first example the mobile communication device may comprise many types of input components through which a user query may be received e.g. a text entry component such as a hardware keyboard a touchscreen component which may be associated with a software keyboard or a handwriting or voice recognition component capable of parsing written or spoken user queries . As a second example the mobile communication device may comprise many types of presenting components that may be capable of presenting the recommendations arising from a user query e.g. a display that may visually present providers in a text or pictorial manner or a speaker that may audibly present the providers . For example the mobile communication device may comprise a mobile phone having a display which may be configured to present providers to the user by displaying the providers on the display and may initiate communication sessions comprising a call initiated to a telephone number associated with a selected provider .

As a third example of this second variation the provider database may be partly or wholly stored in a local database memory of the mobile communication device which may be configured to store locally at least a portion of the provider database . For example the provider database may be wholly stored in a static or flash RAM or an optical or magnetic disc. In this architecture a provider presenting component may be configured to identify the at least one provider by searching the provider database stored in the local database memory which may enable comparatively quick searches that do not rely on communication with a remote database server. Alternatively the mobile communication device may comprise a local cache which may store a portion of the provider database that is hosted remotely e.g. the set of providers of a service that were previously sent in response to a previous execution of a similar user query or the set of providers of various services within a particular range of the location of the user . The inclusion of a local cache may permit quicker and out of band evaluation of searches based on previously executed queries or on predicted queries. As another alternative the provider database may be stored on a remote server with which the mobile communication device may be capable of interacting.

As a third variation of this first aspect the mobile communication devices many forms of communication service providers may assess various forms of service costs in relation to the establishment of communications services. The communication service provider may offer cellular satellite and or other wide area communication services or may offer communication services via more localized services such as WiFi Bluetooth Ethernet or fiber optic. The service costs may also be calculated in many ways such as by duration e.g. a limit of minutes used during communication sessions per month by data volume e.g. a limit of data transferred during communication sessions or a maximum data rate that may be utilized by the mobile communication device or by cost e.g. a prepaid communication service that permits various forms of communication at different rates while deducting such service costs from a prepaid account. Alternatively the communication service provider may not offer general purpose communications through the mobile communication device and may not charge any service costs to the user but may permit the mobile communication device to initiate communication sessions with the providers of solicited services and may accordingly charge all of the service costs of such communication sessions to the providers .

As a fourth variation of this first aspect the relationship of the communication service provider with the mobile communication device may take many forms. The communication service provider may have no particular relationship with or control over the mobile communication device e.g. the communication service provider may simply offer communication services to any compatible device presented by a user and in fact may not know the type of mobile communication device utilized by the user . Alternatively the communication service provider may provide mobile communication devices to users e.g. in conjunction with a service contract having a specific duration. This type of arrangement is frequently offered by communication service providers who may e.g. subsidize part or all of the acquisition cost of the mobile communication device and may recoup the subsidy throughout the life of the service contract with the user thereby reducing the user s initial barrier to entry into the service contract. The techniques discussed herein may be particularly useful in this context where the subsidy of the acquisition cost of the mobile communication device may be partly or wholly paid by the providers of potentially solicited services instead of the communication service provider . These techniques may also be advantageous in this context for mid range mobile communication devices . It may be appreciated that low cost mobile communication devices e.g. simple cellular phones may feature a comparatively low per unit price such that the subsidization is too small to warrant the use of these techniques and high cost mobile communication devices e.g. full featured smartphones and mobile computers may be coupled with fixed rate unmetered data plans such that the user may not face the prospect of service costs that incentivize participation in the recommendation system. Therefore mid range mobile communication devices may be sufficiently expensive to provide an advantage to the implementation of the techniques discussed herein while also being coupled to metered data plans that users may wish to economize through participation in the recommendation service. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many scenarios within which these techniques may be utilized.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of detecting the user query for one or more solicited services . As a first example the user may directly input a query to the mobile communication device such as through an input component . As a second example the user may perform a user action from which a query may be inferred e.g. while traveling on a long highway trip the user may exit at an exit ramp near a mealtime and the mobile communication device may infer that the user may wish to find providers such as restaurants that match the food preferences of the user . As a third example the mobile communication device may detect a feature pertaining to the user e.g. the fuel status of a vehicle operated by the user and may perform a search for related services that match the preferences of the user e.g. nearby fuel depots with low prices or a particularly preferred type of fuel. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many ways of detecting a user query pertaining to the user while implementing the techniques discussed herein.

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of identifying providers of solicited services from the set of providers in a provider database which may be a comprehensive list of all known providers of all known services . As a first example the mobile communication device may have access to a user profile wherein the preferences of the user may be stored e.g. either specified explicitly by the user or inferred from prior user actions and upon receiving a user query for a solicited service the mobile communication device may search the provider database for providers of the service that match the user preferences stored in the user profile. As a second example the mobile communication device may include a location identifying device that may be used to identify a user location and the mobile communication device may search the provider database for providers of the service that are located near the user location. The location identifying device may comprise e.g. a geolocating device such as global positioning service GPS receiver that is capable of determining the user location according to the detected latitude and longitude. The mobile communication device may then search the provider database for providers that are located near the user location. Alternatively or additionally the location identifying device may comprise e.g. a reference point locating component which may be capable of identifying nearby landmarks of known locations. For example the location identifying device may be able to identify wireless networks that are within range of the mobile communication device and may be able to identify a location specified by the wireless network broadcaster. Alternatively or additionally the location identifying component might be capable of detecting the locations of nearby cellular network towers with known and specified locations and of triangulating the current location of the mobile communication device based on the signal strengths of such cellular network towers. The mobile communication device may therefore be able to identify in the provider database at least one nearby provider offering the solicited service that is located near the nearby reference point.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of presenting selected providers to a user in response to a user query . As a first example the set of recommendations may simply be presented to the user as a list of providers and may also include e.g. telephone numbers and addresses. As a second example the provider database may comprise advertisements of services offered by varies providers and the set of recommendations may be presented to the user as a set of advertisements of the solicited services offered by the providers upon retrieval from the provider database . As a third example upon detecting a selection of a provider by the user the mobile communication device may identify a user location compute a route from the user location to the provider and present the route to the user in order to facilitate the user in reaching the provider . As a fourth example the timing of the presentation of the set of recommendations may provide additional advantages.

In another such scenario the user query may comprise a communication session initiated by the user with a contacted provider . The mobile communication device may be configured to while initiating the communication session with the contacted provider present to the user a set of other providers of the services offered by the contacted provider . For example if the user initiates contact with a restaurant offering a particular type of food the mobile communication device may identify the type of food offered by the contacted restaurant and may search the provider database for other restaurants offering the same type of food but that may be more highly preferred by the user e.g. that may be nearer more affordable or of higher quality. Moreover the set of recommendations may be presented while the user during the initiation of the communication session with the called provider . If the user then selects one of the other providers the mobile communication component may terminate the communication session with the contacted provider and may initiate a new communication session between the user and the selected provider . In this manner the mobile communication device may promote the recommendation to the user of more preferable providers of a solicited service in a timely manner and at a pertinent moment when the attention of the user may be available and focused on selecting a provider of the solicited service . Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many techniques for presenting recommendations of providers of one or more solicited services to a user while implementing the techniques discussed herein.

A fifth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of calculating the service cost to be charged to the at least one provider . In some embodiments of these techniques the service cost may be based on the establishment of the communication session by the communication service provider between the provider and the user . However in other embodiments of these techniques additional service costs maybe chargeable to at least one provider based on additional services that may be performed by the communication session provider on behalf of one or more providers .

As a first example of this fifth aspect the communication session provider may provide many types of additional services on behalf of the one or more providers . As a first variation the communication session provider may advertise a provider e.g. by presenting an advertisement generated by the provider or by promoting the advertiser within the search results generated in response to the user query . As a second variation after the user selects a particular provider the communication session provider may facilitate the patronizing of the provider e.g. by displaying directions from the current location of the user to the provider or by adding the provider to a route currently followed by the user .

As a second example of this fifth aspect with respect to various additional services that maybe provided by the communication session provider on behalf of one or more providers the communication session provider and a provider may agree upon the service costs of such services in various ways. As a first variation the communication session provider may establish a set of rates for various additional services e.g. an advertising rate for presenting an advertisement and a routing rate for adding the location of a provider to a route of a user that one or more providers may accept. The communication session provider may then provide such additional services to various users on behalf of the providers who have accepted the established rates and may charge such providers included in a service charge upon providing the additional service to a user . As a second variation one or more providers may solicit various additional services at particular rates and the communication session provider may accept such solicitations by providing the solicited service s to one or more users and by including the advertised rates in the service charges assessed to such providers . In one such embodiment the communication session provider may even endeavor to achieve a revenue stream from such providers by offering many solicited services and might even select among a combination of such solicited services that achieves a desirably high revenue stream e.g. in response to a user query of a particular service search results may be presented by selecting corresponding providers and may be ordered based on the rate offered by each provider for inclusion in the search results. In another such variation the services may be performed only under certain conditions e.g. presenting an advertisement or recommendation of a provider only if the user is within a convenient distance of the provider and or may condition payment of service costs for such services upon various conditions e.g. a higher service cost may be payable by the provider if the user is closer to the provider at the time of a recommendation such that the user may be more likely to patronize the provider in response to the recommendation . 

A sixth aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the manner of charging at least a portion of the service cost once calculated as per the fifth aspect discussed herein to the at least one provider . In these embodiments of the techniques discussed herein the providers of the various services may cover part or all of the service cost to the communication service provider of providing the communication session . This coverage may enable the user to partake of the recommendation service at a reduced or no cost while also promoting the patronage of the services of the providers .

As a first example the mobile communication device may be coupled with a metered data plan of the user . Ordinarily when the user initiates a communication session with a party the communication service provider may assess the service cost by deducting the usage of the communication session from the metered data plan of the user . However when a communication session is initiated between the user and a provider of a solicited service where the provider has been recommended to the user in a set of recommendations in response to a user query the mobile communication device may initiate the communication session outside of the metered data plan. In this manner the user may not be billed for utilizing the recommendation service. Moreover in a further embodiment the communications service provider may charge to the provider at least a portion of the service cost of the communication session initiated between the user and the provider . In this manner the provider may cover the cost of the communication session with the user arising from the recommendation by the mobile communication device while the user may not be charged. In a further embodiment the mobile communication device may not even have a general purpose data plan and the user may be able to use the mobile communication device free of service costs to utilize solicited services of recommended providers .

As a second example the mobile communication device may compile and charge to respective providers a set of per instance service costs related to various recommendation services provided by the mobile communication device on behalf of the provider . In these embodiments the retailer of the mobile communication device and or the communication service provider may negotiate with providers to establish a per activity service cost that is to be paid by the provider in exchange for promoting the patronage of the provider by various users . In a first such embodiment the mobile communication device may charge a service cost to a provider upon storing a representation of the provider in the provider database such as when a representation of the provider is first created or when the representation of the provider is updated or maintained. In a second such embodiment the mobile communication device may charge a service cost to a provider upon presenting the provider to the user in response to the user query e.g. within a set of recommendations of providers of the solicited services . This arrangement may resemble a per impression advertising payment relationship that is often developed for online advertisements. In a third such embodiment the mobile communication device may charge a service cost to a provider upon initiating the communication session between the user and the provider . This arrangement may resemble a click through advertising payment relationship wherein the provider is charged for user actions that indicate an interest of the user in partaking of the services of the provider . In a further such embodiment the service cost may be computed proportionally to the duration of the communication session between the user and the provider . This computation may be helpful e.g. for charging a provider more for communication sessions that are likely to have resulted in a sale of a service and or for encouraging providers to handle solicitations by users promptly thereby improving the user experience with the recommendation service. Those of ordinary skill in the art may devise many techniques for computing and charging service costs to providers in exchange for inclusion in the recommendation service while implementing the techniques discussed herein.
