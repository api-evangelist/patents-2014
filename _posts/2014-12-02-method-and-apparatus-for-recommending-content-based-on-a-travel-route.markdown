title: Method and apparatus for recommending content based on a travel route
abstract: An approach for rendering one or more graphical elements associated with one or more content items recommended for consumption during travel based on travel times associated with one or more travel routes is described. A content item recommendation platform determines travel times associated with travel routes. The content item recommendation platform determines content recommendations, content items, or a combination thereof based, at least in part, on a comparison of the travel times and duration times associated with the content recommendations, the one or more content items, or a combination thereof. The content item recommendation platform further causes, at least in part, a rendering of a user interface depicting one or more icons, one or more markers, one or more graphical elements, or a combination thereof associated with the content recommendations, the content items, or a combination thereof along the travel routes based, at least in part, on the comparison.

This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 427 439 titled Method and Apparatus For Recommending Content Based On A Travel Route filed on Mar. 22 2012 the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

Service providers and device manufacturers e.g. wireless cellular etc. are continually challenged to deliver value and convenience to consumers by for example providing compelling route planning applications and services. For example device users often consume content items such as movies music multimedia and books as they travel along a given route. Typically the content items are manually selected by the user and depending on their size and or duration may or may not be enjoyed in full within the time required to reach a destination along the travel route. Unfortunately there is currently no convenient means for enabling a user to dynamically identify and select content items best suited for consumption along a travel route based on the approximate time required to reach a travel destination.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Although various embodiments are described with respect to routing applications it is contemplated the approach described herein may be used with any mapping application destination planning service location based system or any other utility for generating routes maps travel directions and data regarding various travel routes. Still further while various embodiments are described with respect to content items such as music or videos it is contemplated the approach described herein may apply to any data capable of being executed by a computing device.

It is typical for travelers to employ laptop computers tablets smartphones and other mobile devices as they travel to retrieve local or network stored content items. In the latter case the mobile device connects to a private public or permission based data source that houses the various content items via a communication network as initiated by way of a calling application or service. Resultantly the user is able to consume content items even as they travel along a given route by car bus train or foot. Typically the content items to be consumed during travel are manually selected by the user such as from a playlist or directory. Depending on the size and duration the selected content items may or may not able to be consumed in full within the time required to reach a destination along the travel route. Furthermore changes in the travel route or travel conditions may further impact the time required to reach a destination and hence the amount of content required for consumption during travel.

Unfortunately there is currently no convenient means for enabling a user to dynamically identify and select content items best suited for consumption along a travel route based on the approximate time required to reach a travel destination. Still further there is currently no solution for enabling the rendering of one or more content item recommendations or content items concurrent with a mapping application.

To address this problem a system of introduces the capability to generate recommendations i.e. messages featuring individual content items or lists thereof for selection by the user based on timing information. In addition one or more activity recommendations and incentives may also be presented to the user for selection based on timing information pertaining to the travel route. The timing information may correspond to an amount of time required to reach a destination along a travel route generated by a mapping application an amount of time remaining to reach a destination along a travel route generated by a mapping application or a combination thereof. By way of example the system includes a content item recommendation platform that operates in connection with the mapping service respective mapping applications of user equipment UE respectively or a combination thereof to facilitate rendering of the one or more recommendations to the user via their UE .

Under this approach the content item recommendations or activity recommendations are rendered within a user interface of the mapping application in connection with routing information corresponding to one or more travel routes. Routing information may include for example directions maps images representative of various landmarks waypoints coordinates and other data for traversing a given geographical terrain from a point of origin to a destination point. The routing information may also include based on a user selected level of granularity an image or map representative of a general area region or location.

In one embodiment the content item recommendation platform is configured to detect the generation of routing information including one or more travel routes based on input provided by the user via the mapping application . The mapping application may be a standalone application or widget operable at the UE or alternatively a browser based application. The mapping application may also operate in connection with a mapping service . By way of example the mapping application receives a request for routing information suggestive of one or more travel routes based on or in connection with one or more user inputs. The inputs include for example data for representing a point of origin a final or intermediate destination one or more points of interest POI a travel modality e.g. car public bus pedestrian transport type a travel condition e.g. preferred arrival time preferred road type or other specified criteria. The mapping application then transmits this input along with the request to the mapping service . This also triggers execution of the content item recommendation platform .

In response to the request the content item recommendation platform operates in connection with the service to perform one or more of the following 1 determine user selection of at least one of the travel routes generated by the mapping application 2 identify an amount of time and or distance required for the user to complete the travel route based on various factors including the user provided input context information for the user e.g. current travel speed historical average travel times etc. 3 persistently monitor the current or remaining travel time and or distance traversed by the user along a travel route 4 identify one or more data sources for maintaining the one or more content items associated with a user of the UE 5 identify one or more content items corresponding to the one or more data sources that are capable of being consumed within the determined travel time associated with the one or more travel routes 6 persistently monitor the consumption of one or more content items relative to a selected travel route including the starting stopping discontinuing and full play e.g. end point of content consumption and 7 cause the rendering and persistent updating of one or more recommendations of one or more content items relative to the determined monitoring of the travel times and or distance traversed the content consumed or a combination thereof.

It is noted that the content item recommendation platform may also cause generation and rendering of one or more activities recommendations for the user during travel along a given route based on the same above described processes. In the case of a content item or activity recommendation a selected recommendation may be rendered at the device by way of a content execution application . The content execution application may include any application or service for processing playing displaying or otherwise enabling execution of the content items. In certain embodiments the content execution application may include for example a media player a photo viewer a book reader a game platform a word processor an audio player a podcast platform a video player or the like. It is further noted similar to the mapping application that the content execution application may also be a browser based application.

The above described processes of the content item recommendation platform are carried out to enable the mapping application and or mapping service to associate optimal content items with a selected travel route to support a contiguous contextually relevant content consumption experience during travel. For example the content item recommendation platform automatically identifies content that is best suited for complete consumption by the user within the time required to reach a destination point associated with the travel route. As such the user is prevented from having to manually select the appropriate content items. Still further the content item recommendation platform may automatically sequence multiple content items for execution and consumption during the travel route. Resultantly the user needs not continually toggle between or initiate different content items as they are already queued for seamless execution or selection. Hence the user experience with respect to the various content items available for download stream feed transmission exchange or receipt by UE is optimized relative to the characteristics conditions and timing factors pertaining to a travel route.

In one embodiment the one or more data sources are repositories maintained by different entities or parties. As noted previously the various data sources can be accessed based on one or more established access and or security permissions at the discretion and or prompting of the user etc. By way of example the user of the mapping application may serve as a host of a data source by providing one or more photo albums or video libraries as content items. In this case the user stores the data to a private data source including a social networking site shared video collection or document repository. Album names such as Fun in Toronto or Party in Vegas may also be established as metadata for associating the content items with known location information of the user. As another example when the user wishes to watch a movie while traveling the movie may be accessed from a cloud based service to which the user is subscribed. Under this scenario instead of downloading the movie to a local device or accessing it from a dedicated media data source the user receives streaming content from their own network service the cloud .

Similarly other user data can be provided by one or more other users or hosts including images and videos digital books and games. In addition the various data sources may include a service maintained by a provider of a mapping service push application service exchange service data feed or other content provider.

Still further a content provider or media outlet may store media items such as videos music books and images regarding various POIs corresponding to a given location. For example a streaming movie service may be maintained for supporting UE execution of movies. As another example a representative of a given POI may also serve as a media data source for providing incentives promotions and other information related to activities to be performed by the user along a travel route. Under this scenario a specific restaurant may provide one or more coupons for discounted food and beverages. The coupons may be maintained for a period of time corresponding to the specific duration of travel of the user a date of travel or other expiry period. Of note the coupons may also be retrieved in accordance with context information pertaining to the particular user to which a request for routing information is generated.

It is noted that the media outlet or content provider of data sources may be a direct partner of the provider of the content item recommendation platform . In other instances the data source may be provided by a third party designee non partner subscribed with the service provider for making content item recommendations available to users. The content items and recommendations thereof provided by the various users partners and designees enables users of UE to better customize and retrieve relevant content items.

In addition the data sources may also specify one or more recommendations reviews feedback information ratings or other indicators of satisfaction with respect to the one or more POI incentives and offers etc. For example a satisfaction rating of Superior may be associated with a well liked restaurant while a Terrible rating is associated with a restaurant deemed to be of lesser quality. As such the activity recommendation may appear more or less compelling to the user based on the rating. Regardless of the type of content item or activity information being retrieved it is noted that the data sources may be accessed by or referenced by the platform in accordance with any known data mining and or data exchange protocols languages and network methodologies. In addition the platform may be integrated for use in connection with the mapping service and or mapping application to permit the rendering of content item selections in connection with routing information corresponding to one or more travel routes. Still further in certain embodiments the mapping service and platform may be implemented as an integrated service. As such the platform and service communicate with each other directly without reliance upon the communication network while facilitating interaction with the various UE via the network .

In one embodiment the content item recommendation platform also processes metadata associated with the one or more travel routes or points of interest along a given travel route. The metadata may include for example a tag for specifying a current location name or identifier of a given point of interest and or venue encountered by the user of UE during travel. As another example the metadata may include timestamp information for indicating a current date and time associated with a picture of a given point of interest. It is noted that the metadata may pertain to any contextual data including location data position data activity data temporal data and other information useful for determining the current state or context of the user UE one or more other UE various points of interest e.g. buildings landmarks encountered by the user during travel. In certain instances the metadata may be collected by one or more sensors of the UE for processing by the service the platform or a combination thereof.

In addition the metadata may also be used to enable the identification of one or more content items that correspond to the context of the user the UE one or more other UE or a combination thereof. By way of example when it is determined the location information of the user corresponds a particular city the location data may be used as a filter for narrowing the search for one or more content items corresponding to the city. Under this scenario movies featuring scenes or actors related to the current city of travel of the user may be recommended or activities pertaining to the user s present locale may be established.

In one embodiment the content item recommendation platform also causes the rendering of a content item selection list in connection with user interface of the mapping application . By way of example the user may select one or more content items to consume e.g. download stream play in connection with a travel route graphically represented via said user interface. Under this scenario the content items correspond to one or more navigation elements presented as routing information based on the one or more travel routes. In addition the platform may cause the rendering of one or more icons markers or other graphical elements for depicting relative locations points or times of execution of the one or more content items along a given travel route. For example a marker featuring an icon of a movie reel may be placed at a specific point along a travel route to depict a start time or end time of consumption of a selected movie. Under this scenario the placement location point or distance of the marker along the travel route corresponds to the relative timing information associated with the movie. Still further timing information may be rendered to the user interface of the mapping application in connection with the one or more content items for depicting an amount of time remaining for consumption of a content item an amount of time remaining for completion of the travel route a start time an end time or a combination thereof.

It is noted in one embodiment that the routing information pertaining to one or more travel routes may be presented in conjunction with the execution of a content item. For example a movie selected for consumption may be presented in a frame or window as a data view concurrent with the user interface of the mapping application. Under this scenario updates to the one or more travel routes travel times distances content recommendations activity recommendations etc. are shown to correspond to a specific point of play stoppage of the movie. As another example specific scenes of the movie featuring a particular POI e.g. a landmark may be depicted to a map featuring the travel route for further depicting the relationship between the travel route and the content item being consumed.

In one embodiment the content item recommendation platform also detects a travel modality selected by a user in connection with generation of one or more travel routes. Based on the travel modality the platform can adapt and or update the recommended content items. By way of example the travel modality may specify a mode of transport of the user including train transport bus transport car transport pedestrian travel or a combination thereof. In the case of a public transportation system the content item recommendation platform may also account for route scheduling information for enabling in the determining of travel times and or the time required for consumption of a content item.

In one embodiment the content item recommendation platform also determines whether the amount of time and or distance required to traverse a travel route exceeds a predetermined threshold. For example the threshold may be established by the user as one or more user preferences or as a default setting e.g. 2.5 hours . Based on this determination the platform then generates and or recommends one break periods to associate with the travel route. The break period corresponds to a time and or location along the travel route wherein the consumption of content items is temporality ceased i.e. an intermission. During this intermission various activities may be recommended to the user and the content may be resumed upon completion of the activity or at the user s discretion. It is noted that the break periods may be generated to correspond to one or more points of interest rest stops or a combination thereof. For example in the case of train transport the content item recommendation platform may correlate a given activity recommendation with a scheduled stop at a train station at a halfway point of the trip e.g. an advertisement for the user to visit the train snack shop .

In one embodiment the content item and activity recommendation capabilities of the platform are offered by a service provider as a managed or hosted solution. Alternatively the content item recommendation platform may be implemented for direct execution by UE or the mapping application i.e. as a widget or in application service. In the case where the platform is integrated for local execution via UE the locally executed mapping application or other application requiring routing information e.g. a word processing application that supports location based services may provide content recommendations. For either implementation the content item recommendation platform enables any registered UE to integrate content item selections with routing information related to various travel routes as they use a mapping application or service . It is noted that the user may establish one or more user profile settings in connection with the registration process for affecting the interaction of the UE with the platform including establishing various content preferences and types break periods etc.

As shown in the system comprises a user equipment UE having connectivity to the content item recommendation platform via a communication network . By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network a wireless network a telephony network or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UE is any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UE can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

By way of example the UE mapping service content item recommendation platform and one or more data sources communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

In addition the platform accesses profile data regarding one or more registered users as well as one or more data sources for housing content items. In addition the platform accesses a mapping service for retrieving routing information i.e. maps travel routes various navigation elements for use in connection with one or more content item recommendations.

In one embodiment the authentication module authenticates users and user devices for interaction with the access rights platform . By way of example the authentication module receives a request to generate routing information based on one or more inputs provided by a mapping application. In addition the request corresponds to a triggering of various other modules of the platform for generating one or more content item recommendations in association with the routing information. Input is received on the basis of a registered or subscribed user with the platform . The subscription process may include a specification of data sources for accessing of various content items including a network resource location of the data source an access password and other credentials.

In addition various preferences and settings information may be established including a preferred travel mode content category or type default origin and destination information etc. Content item viewing preferences may also be established for affecting how content items and or activity recommendations are presented to the user. For example the user may specify that content items be presented in tandem with routing information. Under this approach the user may view their progress as they traverse a given travel route concurrent with the playing of a movie reading of a book viewing of a presentation etc. In certain embodiments the routing information may be presented within the same interface as one or more independent data views etc. As another example the user may also establish a cutoff period i.e. an amount of time a content item should end prior to arrival at a destination along a travel route. By way of example a cutoff period may be set by the user such that movie content ends five minutes prior to an estimated arrive time. In the case of rail or bus transportation the cutoff period may correspond to an amount of time for the user to gather their belongings in preparation for exiting the vehicle.

The authentication process performed by the module may also include receiving and validating a login name and or user identification value as provided or established for a particular user host during a subscription or registration process with a provider of the platform . The login name and or user identification value may be received as input provided by the user from UE via a graphical user interface to the platform e.g. as enabled by user interface module . Profile data for respective subscribers may be cross referenced as part of the login process. Alternatively the login process may be performed through automated association of profile settings maintained as registration data with an IP address a carrier detection signal of a user device mobile directory number MDN subscriber identity module SIM e.g. of a SIM card radio frequency identifier RFID tag or other identifier.

In one embodiment the travel monitor interacts with the mapping service to maintain information regarding the current travel of the user along the one or more travel routes. By way of example the travel monitor determines a distance travelled by the user relative to their current location as well as the amount of distance remaining to reach an intermittent or final destination of the travel route. In addition the travel monitor correlates the distance information with timing information including an approximation of an amount of time to reach the intermittent or final destination. The time and or distance information is persistently maintained by the travel monitor to enable selection of content by the content selector that is appropriate for consumption for the duration of travel. It is also noted that the travel monitor may process context information metadata etc. for indicating the current location and speed of the user and or the UE for approximating the timing information.

In one embodiment the consumption monitor determines a rate or amount of consumption of a selected content item during travel. The consumption is facilitated by way of a content execution application i.e. a media player. As such the consumption monitor receives feedback from the content execution application of respective UE for indicating consumption. For example in the case of a media player the amount of consumption may correspond to the amount of time elapsed due to viewing of a movie by the user a current time of playback of the movie an amount of data streamed and or viewed in connection with the movie versus a known full amount of the movie or a combination thereof. In the case of a book reader as the content execution application for example the amount of consumption may correspond to a number of pages read or viewed by the user a location of a bookmark etc. It is noted that the consumption monitor may interface with any context execution application for monitoring consumed content items as well as determining user input for affecting consumption such as a stopping pausing initiating or restarting of content items and or content streams.

The consumption monitor also interacts with the travel monitor to convey a consumption status of a selected content item including a starting and or stopping of the content. As such the travel monitor is able to maintain a consistent record of the amount of time remaining before reaching of a travel destination relative to the current consumption of the content item. For example the travel monitor interacts with the consumption monitor to validate an estimated arrival time of fifty three minutes to a destination corresponds to an equivalent amount of time required to consume the content item in full. Hence in the case of movie content the movie would also have fifty three minutes remaining for full viewing assuming no cutoff period was specified by the user. In the case of a cutoff period i.e. a ten minute cutoff the amount of time remaining for full viewing of the movie would be forty three minutes.

In addition the consumption monitor may trigger the updating of one or more content items recommendations by the content selector based on the determined amount of time remaining before the reaching of the travel destination. For example when it is determined the amount of time required to reach a destination is less than the amount of time remaining for full viewing of a movie a different content item requiring less time may be recommended by the content selector based on the timing information received from the consumption monitor . In this case a notification message may also be generated by the user interface module for display to the user for indicating that the current selected content item will exceed the estimated arrival time. The user may then opt to continue viewing of the current content item or select from the one or more updated recommendations.

In one embodiment the content selector operates in connection with the travel monitor and consumption monitor to determine one or more content items to be associated with a travel route. The content selector carries out various functions including for example selecting of one or more content items to be presented and or recommended to the user based on the timing and consumption information determined by the travel monitor and consumption monitor respectively. In addition the content selector may be configured to process content item metadata associated with a particular content item for determining a content item recommendation. The content item metadata associated may include for example a content format length size authoring ownership information digital rights information etc. In addition the metadata may include corresponding description information user feedback information ratings information usage statistics data etc. Under this scenario the content selector processes the one or more content sources as well as any associated content item metadata to 1 determine an amount of travel time required for consumption of one or more content items relative to the one or more travel routes and 2 identify the one or more content items having or associated with a playback time that is within the amount of time for the user of the mobile device to reach the destination.

By way of this approach the content selector may determine multiple content items to recommend to the user relative to a given travel route as well as a sequence for enabling playback of the content items during travel. It is noted that the content selector may operate in connection with the user interface module to cause a rendering of one or more recommendations to a user interface of the mapping application . The integration module enables the recommendations and content to be integrated for use with the mapping application or service including coordinating the execution of various application programming interfaces APIs required of the mapping application.

To facilitate the retrieval and or referencing of content items per a recommendation the content selector also determines one or more data sources associated with the user the mobile device or a combination thereof. The data sources maintain various content items of various types. Furthermore the data sources may include those specified by the user via their profile data those recommended by a service affiliated with the user e.g. a movie streaming service those recommended by a vendor affiliate of the content item recommendation platform those recommended by one or more social networking contacts of the user or a combination thereof. Of note the content items may be retrieved by the content selector based on various criteria or filter settings including content preferences of the user permission levels ratings criteria contextual details e.g. current location of the user or a combination thereof.

The content selector may also determine one or more break periods to be recommended to the user for affecting consumption of content items. The break periods may include for example one or more periods wherein a content item is paused discontinued or changed based on a length of time associated with a selected travel route. Under this scenario when it is determined the travel route exceeds a predetermined threshold a number of break periods may be introduced accordingly. It is noted that the number or frequency of break periods may be adapted by the user based on settings indicated in their profile data .

Still further in certain embodiments the content selector may also process metadata and other context data including location data or activity data for supporting the selection of one or more content items to recommend. By way of this approach when it is determined the user is travelling abroad the data source selected for retrieval of content may correspond to a source located in the country of travel rather than a source in the user s home country. As another example when it is determined the user is listening to music content the content selector may access a data source corresponding to a popular local radio station based on the current location of the user.

In one embodiment the activity selector determines one or more activities to recommend to the user based on the one or more travel routes the metadata and or context information or a combination thereof. Activities may include for example one or more games promotional offers or travel services to be taken advantage of by the user during or in association with a travel route. In addition the activity may correspond to a point of interest along the travel route. In certain instances the activity recommended may be based on an amount of travel remaining an amount of consumption of a content item a predetermined break period as established by the content selector or an interruption change in the travel route. As such activities involving the user of one or more travel services or promotional items may be presented to the user after the pausing or stopping of a movie music or other content items.

The activity selector may operate in connection with the mapping service and user interface module to permit one or more navigation elements corresponding to the activity to be presented in connection with one or more travel routes. For example in the case of a coupon for the purchase of food items in a dining car of an interstate train an icon representing the food item may be presented to the display or along the travel route at a time and or distance corresponding to the generating of the recommendation e.g. during a break period . Still further the activity may be presented in connection with a determined context of the user i.e. a recommendation of a local activity based on the determined location of the user. It is noted that the activity selector interacts with the travel monitor consumption monitor and content selector to coordinate presentment of activities as content within the user interface of the mapping application accordingly.

In one embodiment a communication module enables formation of a session over a network between the content item recommendation platform and the mapping service and or mapping application of a UE . By way of example the communication module executes various protocols and data sharing techniques for enabling collaborative execution between a subscriber s UE e.g. mobile devices laptops smartphones tablet computers desktop computers and the platform over the network . It is noted that the communication module is also configured to support a browser session i.e. the retrieval of content as referenced by a resource identifier during a specific period of time or usage of the browser.

In one embodiment the user interface module enables presentment of a graphical user interface for presenting the content recommendations activity recommendations routing information including one or more travel routes or a combination thereof. In addition the user interface module enables generation of an interface for associating content items with a particular travel route. The user interface module generates the interface in response to application programming interfaces APIs or other function calls corresponding to operating system of the user devices thus enabling the display of graphics primitives. It is noted that user interface module may operate in connection with the integration module for incorporating the content items within the user interface of the mapping application etc. By way of this approach the user may consume content items and routing information within the same view.

In step or process the content item recommendation platform determines one or more travel routes associated with at least one device and or at least one user of the at least one device. In step the platform causes a recommendation of one or more content items based on one or more travel times associated with the one or more travel routes. As noted the travel times may be determined as timing information and may include a determining of an amount of time to travel from a point of origin to a destination point along the travel path. The timing information may be based on historical and or average travel times the current speed of travel of the user or a combination thereof.

In step the platform causes a rendering of a user interface depicting the one or more travel routes. Still further in step the platform causes a rendering of one or more portions of the one or more travel routes in the user interface to represent a respective one or more distances along the one or more routes that are traveled during one or more time periods for consuming the one or more content items. By way of example the portion of the travel route traversed by the user relative to an amount of consumption of a content item is depicted accordingly.

In step of process the content item recommendation platform determines a selection of at least one of the one or more travel routes. Hence under this scenario the platform is made aware of a recommended content item e.g. a movie or music item being initiated by the user for consumption. Per step the platform causes an update of the one or more content items the rendering of the user interface depicting the one or more travel routes and or the rendering of the one or more portions of the one or more travel routes based on the selection. Still further in step the platform also causes a monitoring of the one or more travel times during travel along the one or more travel routes. Per step the platform causes an update of the recommendation and or another recommendation of one or more other content items based on the monitoring.

It is noted that the updating steps and correspond to the real time execution and presentment capabilities of the content item recommendation platform . For example by monitoring the specific items being consumed by the user in connection with current travel conditions of the user the most relevant routing information and content is presented to the user at all times. Furthermore a rate of consumption of a given content item during travel may be correlated directly with a speed of travel of the user a relative distance traversed by the user along the travel route or a combination thereof. The content item recommendation platform may employ the use of various algorithms or proportional assessment methods for maintaining an accurate accounting of such relationships as well as for regulating content items recommendations based on discrepancies.

In step of process the content item recommendation platform determines an input for specifying the one or more content items. In step the platform processes one or more time periods for consuming the one or more content items to determine the one or more travel routes and or one or more other travel routes. By way of this approach the amount of time determined for traversing a travel route is associated with a specific time required for consumption of the content items.

In another step the platform determines metadata associated with the one or more travel routes and or one or more points of interest associated with the one or more travel routes. As noted previously the metadata may be used for determining the relevance of a location along with additional context information for the user. The one or more content items are determined based at least in part on the metadata. Still further per step the platform causes a recommendation of one or more activities based on one or more travel times one or more break periods and or one or more rest stops associated with the one or more travel routes. As noted the activities may pertain to one or more points of interest one or more travel services one or more venues one or more incentives or a combination thereof.

In step of process the platform determines a travel modality associated with the one or more travel routes. Still further per step the platform causes a rendering of the one or more travel times based on the travel modality. By way of example the travel modality may be specified by the user as train transport bus transport car transport pedestrian travel or a combination thereof. As a result of the specified travel modality the timing information regarding a travel route may be adjusted accordingly.

It is contemplated in certain embodiments that the content item recommendation platform may process contextual information in connection with real time travel condition data for affecting generation of content item recommendations routing information or a combination thereof. For example travel condition data may include weather data traffic data news data and road condition data. By way of example real time traffic data for indicating heavy traffic build up along a suggested route may trigger a recommending of an alternate set of content items i.e. a longer movie due to extended travel times. As another example the content item recommendation platform may access train or bus schedule information for use in generating timing information for use in selecting one or more content item recommendations.

In routing information including at least one travel route is presented to the user interface in response to activation of the mapping application and or service i.e. based on selection of the Get Directions action button . As a result the content item recommendation platform processes the input provided by the user e.g. the destination location or origin location context information as gathered by the UE of the user or a combination thereof to determine timing information. For example the platform may determine a travel modality selection option of the user corresponds to that of car transport. Also the platform may determine the time of day corresponds to a heavy traffic period that the user is presently located in Germany based on geospatial data and that the user prefers science fiction related content based on the established subscription user preferences. Based on this as well as computed timing information the platform renders one or more content item recommendations via a selections window .

Under this scenario the selections window indicates the various content items determined to be consumed within the amount of time required for travel via the travel route . For instance a content item corresponding to a movie is presented to include the name of the movie and a brief description of the movie. Due to processing of context information and or relevant metadata content item is described as being a movie that is related to the city of travel of the user Berlin . Similar information is presented for other types of content which include a digital book and one or more music albums featuring various audio content items. The user may select a particular item to activate and or download by way of a Download action button which initiates accessing of the content from a data source . Of note each content item type is preceded by a message for indicating an amount of time i.e. time available to the user for consuming the data relative to the travel time required. The amount of time required for consumption of the content item will generally be less than or equal to the amount of time required to complete the travel route unless otherwise specified by the user.

It is noted in certain instances that the rate of consumption of certain content types may vary. For example in the case of content that is to be read the amount of time required to read the book may vary from one user to the next. Also in the case of content requiring direct user input or stimulus such as gaming related content or trivia content e.g. crossword puzzles Sudoku the time required for a user to enjoy the content will vary depending on their skill level familiarity etc. In such cases the content item recommendation platform may recommend these types of content items based on feedback information provided by others regarding the content or based on an average time of use consumption as gathered over time.

For example feedback information by other users may indicate a particular book as being consumed in whole or in part in four hours time. This feedback information may be conveyed to the provider of the data source by prior readers of the book and subsequently conveyed as metadata i.e. in conjunction with the description of the content e.g. Most users reported reading chapters 1 6 of this book in 2 hours time. . Similarly usage statistics regarding an online game for indicating an average completion time of 2 hours may be collected by the game provider and thus presented in association with the content as it is retrieved from a data source . Under this scenario the content item recommendation platform processes the statistic information i.e. via the content selector in deriving a content item recommendation. It is noted that the content item recommendation platform may also render subsequent to consumption of a particular content item an interface for gathering feedback from the user regarding a particular content item. This may be prompted by the platform upon completion of the content item during a break point at the end of the travel route etc. and subsequently provided to the provider of the selected content item.

The selections window also features one or more filter option buttons such as button for restricting the list of recommended content items to a specific type of content. For example while the selection window of shows all content item recommendation types the user may select the book filter to view only book content item recommendations. Still further one or more links and may be selected to enable further actions to be performed including expanding the list to present more content item recommendation or cancelling the selections window altogether.

Also presented are one or more markers for specifying a distance and or time associated travel of the user along the travel route . By way of example a first marker corresponds to where a proposed or selected movie or other content item would or could start playing. A second marker corresponds to where a second proposed or selected movie or other content would or could start playing. Under this scenario the entire time required to complete the travel route is associated with at least two content items to be consumed. The user may further optimize their selections accordingly based on additional recommendations. It is noted that the markers and are placed along the travel route in accordance with an estimated distance traversed by the user relative to the point of play of the movies. Also placement location point or distance of the marker along the travel route corresponds to the relative timing information associated with the movie.

In addition the platform may cause the rendering of one or more icons or other graphical elements in connection with a marker and . For example marker features icons of a movie reel for indicating movie content may be viewed. In addition an icon of a book and music note may be presented to indicate book content and musical content is available as well. As depicted the book icon is only shown in connection with the first marker it corresponds to the only book recommendation presented. Hence only one book content item is determined to be recommended for consumption as it features enough pages graphics etc. for review by the user along the travel route.

In the selections window is shown when filtered to present only movie related content items. This is based on activation of a movie items filter button . As a result only movie icons e.g. icon are shown in connection with the markers and . Also the user is presented with various links to enable further actions to be performed. This includes for example a See More link for expanding the number of movie content item selections presented in the selection window . Also an All Types link causes presentment of all content types recommended by the platform e.g. unfiltered as in . Still further a Cancel link may be selected to cancel the selection window.

In a third marker is presented along the travel route . The third marker marks where the second selected movie or other content item would stops playing or stop. Under this scenario the content may be stopped due to a predetermined break or as a result of full consumption of the content e.g. the movie ends . As depicted the movie is set to stop prior to completion of the entire travel route . As a result the content item recommendation platform operates in connection with the mapping application to render a timing indicator . The timing indicator indicates how much time is left for travel after the movie ends. During this time the user may opt to select more content items to consume or may re select previously viewed content. As per execution of the integration module the indicator may be dynamic and thus subject to change as the user travels about the travel route .

In other instances the user may place a mouse cursor over the proposed movie for causing display of the timing information. It is noted that timing information may be rendered to the user interface of the mapping application in connection with the one or more content items for depicting an amount of time remaining for consumption of a content item an amount of time remaining for completion of the travel route a start time an end time or a combination thereof.

In a break period icon is presented to the user interface to represent a relative time and or distance along the travel route for a break period to occur. In this example the travel modality is indicated as train travel. Resultantly the timing information is adjusted to accommodate this modality i.e. a different travel time is depicted in connection with the one or more content item recommendation . Also the status of the action buttons within the selection window are adapted as a result of the user having started consumption of one or more of the movie items i.e. time elapsed since the location of the first marker . By way of example action button indicates the movie is in a Paused state such as due to the occurrence of the break period. Another action button indicates the second movie has been downloaded and is queued for execution at a point and time corresponding to the second marker

As noted previously the break period may be automatically established by the platform in response to a determination of a predetermined overall time travel threshold being determined. Alternatively the user may specify a time period for the occurrence of one or more break periods. In certain instances the break period may also correspond to the generation of one or more activity recommendations. A first recommendation includes for example an offer for the user to enjoy free coffee in the dining car of the train. A second recommendation includes a link for advertising one or more online video games that may be enjoyed by children travelling with the user. In the latter scenario the recommendation is generated based on profile data for the user that indicates they have children or as a result of input to the mapping application for indicating the presence of children on the trip. Hence as noted previously the platform may propose contextually relevant content wherein the context is based on the user the travel route the UE the travel provider or the like.

In a movie is shown to be displayed within the user interface of the mapping application concurrent with the display of routing information. In the movie is rendered to the selections window and corresponds to the first movie of the list i.e. corresponding to the first marker . The user has the option of pausing the movie by selecting a Pause link selecting a different movie to view e.g. skipping to the second movie recommended by the platform by selecting a Select New link or exiting from the movie by selecting an Exit Movie View link . It is noted that upon selection of link the selection window resorts to presenting movie content item recommendations in the manner shown in . A location marker for representing the current location of the user along the travel route may also be dynamically updated concurrent with execution of the movie .

In the movie is rendered as a thumbnail view that extends from or references the location marker . In this scenario the thumbnail view is dynamically updated concurrent with updates to the placement of the location marker . For example as the user proceeds further along the travel route as detected via global positioning system tracking the marker is updated accordingly. Consequently the movie content displayed via the thumbnail view is depicted as moving across the user interface in the same manner i.e. at the same rate or pace as the marker .

By way of this approach the movie appears to the user as dynamically moving content concurrent with real time changes in the position and location of the user due to movement of the train. In the case where the speed of the train increases for example the marker would be shown to traverse the travel route at a greater pace as would the thumbnail view . Similarly the increased speed reduces the amount of time required to reach an intermediate of final destination of the travel route . Resultantly the location of the second marker may be adjusted to reflect this change in travel time. Furthermore the user may be presented with additional content item recommendations that correspond to the newly determined timing information. It is noted that dynamic adjusting as described herein may be limited to specific conditions being determined such as a determination that the amount of travel time is reduced or increased by a specific threshold e.g. more than 10 minutes compromised .

It is contemplated in one embodiment that a change in direction of the user during travel along a recommended travel route may also affect how content items are consumed during travel. For example when it is detected that the user changes direction to proceed away from the travel destination the content item recommendation platform causes the movie shown in to stop or rewind commensurate with the speed and distance of travel of the user. Alternatively the movie may be paused and queued to resume at the same point it left off once the user comes back to the appropriate point along the travel route . These features may be chosen at the discretion of the user and established via the content viewing preferences of their profile data.

The processes described herein for generating one or more travel routes based on experience information related to one or more travelers may be advantageously implemented via software hardware firmware or a combination of software and or firmware and or hardware. For example the processes described herein may be advantageously implemented via processor s Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

A processor or multiple processors performs a set of operations on information as specified by computer program code related to recommend one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes. The computer program code is a set of instructions or statements providing instructions for the operation of the processor and or the computer system to perform specified functions. The code for example may be written in a computer programming language that is compiled into a native instruction set of the processor. The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set e.g. machine language . The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information shifting positions of units of information and combining two or more units of information such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR exclusive OR XOR and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor such as a sequence of operation codes constitute processor instructions also called computer system instructions or simply computer instructions. Processors may be implemented as mechanical electrical magnetic optical chemical or quantum components among others alone or in combination.

Computer system also includes a memory coupled to bus . The memory such as a random access memory RAM or any other dynamic storage device stores information including processor instructions for recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. The computer system also includes a read only memory ROM or any other static storage device coupled to the bus for storing static information including instructions that is not changed by the computer system . Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus is a non volatile persistent storage device such as a magnetic disk optical disk or flash card for storing information including instructions that persists even when the computer system is turned off or otherwise loses power.

Information including instructions for recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes is provided to the bus for use by the processor from an external input device such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user a microphone an Infrared IR remote control a joystick a game pad a stylus pen a touch screen or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system .

Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links the communications interface sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical acoustic or electromagnetic signals including infrared and optical signals that carry information streams such as digital data. For example in wireless handheld devices such as mobile telephones like cell phones the communications interface includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments the communications interface enables connection to the communication network for recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes to the UE .

The signals transmitted over network link and other networks through communications interface carry information to and from computer system . Computer system can send and receive information including program code through the networks among others through network link and communications interface .

In this manner computer system may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA one or more controllers or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to recommend one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of recommending one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to recommend one or more content items for consumption during travel based on one or more travel times associated with one or more travel routes. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .
