This invention relates generally to communication between a plurality of network domains or zones and more particularly to network platforms and apparatus systems and methods that utilize or employ internetworking platforms to provide cyber security protection across security zones typically having different levels of security therebetween.

The architecture of modern industrial operations such as that found in modern oil and gas field applications is enabled at the field level process level application level system level and plant level by various networked devices. These devices monitor control and collect data such as measurements reflective of the operations of the automated process. These devices are connected to or in communication with electronic devices and machines known as controllers that operate at different levels to process the data collected and issue commands back to or to other networked devices.

In a typical configuration these components form plant networks and systems. The more mission critical remote or local plants facilities systems networks applications controllers computers or other data management devices sensors or other data collecting or transmitting devices including I O devices equipment things and or other assets are located in what can be termed a mission critical Secured Zone SZ . These industrial networks and systems can be connected to multiple networks within the SZ or non mission critical networks external to the facility such as a corporate or other enterprise network located within a Less Secured Zone LSZ having less cyber security which may also be connected to public networks such as the Internet. This makes such industrial networks extremely susceptible to external cyber attacks and other security threats. Such cyber attacks can result in among other things a loss of view and or a loss of control of individual components or entire network or system structures. A loss of view occurs when the user automated controller is unable to access a system either partially or fully and thus has no view of the process operation. A loss of control occurs when the user automated controller is unable to send and or receive control messages to the process control system to invoke a function and or a procedure.

Cyber security measures applied to communication between such mission critical industrial networks and systems and have taken the form of those applied to Information Technology IT systems arguably because known conventional intra network deployments require full Internet Protocol IP communication end to end between the data source and destination. Other methodologies include the employment of the need for a Firewall and or DMZ between the SZ and LSZ. These methods however have not been sufficiently effective given the potential loss of capital life and product in the event of a failure of a control system or industrial process.

As such the inventors have recognized the need for apparatus systems network platforms and methods that can provide cyber security protection for industrial processes for Energy Power and Utilities systems and networks and other industrial and non industrial systems that require for example security and protection from a less secure corporate or Internet connectivity. Also recognized is the need for apparatus systems platforms and methods that can provide secure communications between the different zones such as for example a mission critical SZ interfacing with facilities systems networks computers or other user interface devices including those of end users located in an LSZ and that account for the full IP communication requirement of both data sources and data destinations.

Further recognized by the inventors is the need for apparatus systems platforms and methods which provide for data exchange from the SZ to the LZ without full unbroken and anti evasion IP communication end to end that can eliminate the exchange of vulnerable files and malwares between the SZ and LSZ and vice versa that can eliminate active links or sessions bidirectional between the SZ and LSZ provide for controlled data exchange between SZ and LSZ that can prevent active files those files having executable code and or macros that cannot be transferred as a text file s or binary data e.g. URL links object oriented executable file among others which can be carriers of computer worms or viruses from being exchanged between the SZ and LSZ vice versa by eliminating them from any data being exchanged that can provide data exchange capabilities preferably at the storage drive I O level between two different zones and that can eliminate the need for network communication such IP communications physical Firewall s and or DMZ s between the SZ and LSZ.

Once there is a system compromise of the Enterprise Resource Planning ERP storage for example or a compromise either in the corporate network or corporate LAN any streaming data is generally lost en route or must be stored by the data source.

As such recognized by the inventors is the need for an en route storage capacity to retain the data should the ERP storage become compromised or if data being transferred to the LSZ is being lost. Correspondingly also recognized by the inventors is the need for apparatus systems platforms and methods which provide for central data aggregation and delivery to the LSZ s systems and LZ systems and or for manual data upload or download for disaster situations such as for example a central hub for data aggregation and exchange which provide central data aggregation to be used in a disaster recovery plan and which provide a central data aggregation for the SZ and LSZ systems to be used for data archiving and historization.

In view of the foregoing various embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide apparatus systems network platforms and methods that can provide cyber security protection for industrial processes for Energy Power and Utilities systems and networks and other industrial and non industrial systems that require for example security and protection from a less secure corporate or internet connectivity. Various embodiments also provide apparatus systems network platforms and methods that can provide secure communications between the different zones such as for example a mission critical Secured Zone SZ interfacing with facilities systems networks computers or other user interface devices including those of end users located in a Less Secured Zone LSZ and that account for the full IP communication requirement of both data sources and data destinations.

Various embodiments also provide apparatus systems platforms and methods which provide for data communications exchanges from the SZ to the LZ without full unbroken and anti evasion IP communication end to end that can eliminate the exchange of vulnerable files between the SZ and LSZ and vice versa that can eliminate active links or sessions bidirectional between the SZ and LSZ provide for controlled data exchange between SZ and LSZ that can prevent active files those files having executable code and or macros that cannot be transferred as a text file e.g. URL links object oriented executable file among others which can be carriers of computer worms or viruses from being exchanged between the SZ and LSZ vice versa by eliminating them from any data being exchanged that can provide data exchange capabilities preferably at the hard drive I O level between two different zones and or that can eliminate the need for a Firewall and or DMZ between the SZ and LSZ.

Additionally various embodiments of the invention advantageously provide apparatus systems network platforms and methods that provide data availability and integrity by completely hiding the means of data transport to prevent unauthorized access to the entire data stream regardless of its data classification. Additionally the various embodiments break the IP address reachability at the lowest level i.e. I O hard drive and retransmit the data utilizing the data transmission at the storage drive level coupled with intermediate servers for actual raw data translation and formatting by adjacent servers e.g. DSMs rather than the concept of TCP IP proxy server model used between different networks.

Various embodiments also provide apparatus systems platforms and methods which provide for an en route storage capacity to retain the data should the ERP storage become compromised or if data being transferred to the LSZ is being lost which provide for central data aggregation and delivery to the LSZ s systems and LZ systems and or for manual data upload or download for disaster situations such as for example a central hub for data aggregation and exchange which provide central data aggregation to be used in a disaster recovery plan and or which provide a central data aggregation for the SZ and LSZ systems to be used for data archiving and historization.

More specifically an example of an embodiment of an apparatus for securing communication data exchanges between multiple networks utilizing storage area network internetworking platforms. The exemplary apparatus can include an exemplary platform that can function to eliminate IP connections between a secured zone or SZ and less secured zone or LSZ for bi direction data exchange. The platform function according to an exemplary configuration is based on exchanging data between a first network typically including mission critical assets members to form the SZ and a second network typically including non mission critical members to form the generally less secured LSZ. Data transfer between zones can be at the storage level such as for example at the virtual block level input output I O level plain text or binary file storage level. The platform storage is designated to be accessed from one side of the communications pathway between zones by systems or components associated with the SZ and accessed from the other side by systems or components associated with LSZ.

The exemplary platform can include the following major components a centralized facility and or a Secured Dedicated Communication Link Module SDCLM coupled with the respective centralized facility. According to alternative embodiments a distributed facility can be used.

The centralized facility can form non shared hybrid IP packet network including IP communications interrupted by non IP communications across the SAN storage and exchange systems allowing data exchange.

The data exchange through the SAN system is based on storage exchange virtual block I O layer i.e. storage drive layer to provide data exchange based non IP communications between two different layers networks systems plants facilities and or other data sources data originators and data destinations data terminators . This is in contrast to providing data exchange based on the software application API layer or IP network layer. This data exchange form can advantageously provide for communications between both data originators and data terminators that utilize IP communications as their communication base while still preventing active files those files having executable code and or macros that cannot be transferred as a text or binary file e.g. URL links object oriented executable file among others which can be carriers of computer worms or viruses from being exchanged between the data sources and data destinations located within the SZ and LSZ vice versa automatically eliminating them as part of the between zones exchange process.

The method can include the steps of preventing uninterrupted application to application layer communications between the one or more secured networked members and the one or more networked enterprise members by employing a network platform configured to interrupt IP based data communications with non IP based communications. The step of preventing uninterrupted application to application layer communications can include the steps of translating native files from at least one member of the one or more secured network members into one or more flat files the translating step performed by a first computer server communicating at least copies of the one or more flat files between a pair of SAN storage volumes the first of the pair of storage volumes assigned to the SZ the second of the pair of SAN storage volumes assigned to the LSZ the LSZ having a security level less than that of the SZ and re translating the at least copies of the one or more flat files into a form usable by the second LSZ the step of re translating performed by a second computer server with the communication between the two SAN volumes being in the form of a virtual block data volumes communication of virtual block data volumes containing the at least copies of the one or more flat files.

The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate embodiments of the invention. This invention may however be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the illustrated embodiments set forth herein. Rather these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout. Prime notation if used indicates similar elements in alternative embodiments.

In order to provide cyber security protection for such systems and networks various embodiments of the invention beneficially include apparatus systems network platforms and methods that provide for eliminating the exchange of vulnerable files between the SZ and LSZ and vice versa eliminating active links or sessions bi directional between the SZ and LSZ and or provide for controlling data exchanges between SZ and LSZ central data aggregation and delivery to the LSZ systems and LZ systems for manual data upload or download for disaster situations and or central data aggregation for the SZ and LSZ systems to be used for data archiving and historization. Such embodiments can also or alternatively provide secure data transmission methodologies that can utilize data flow translations between different databases and that utilize the data layer I O to exchange the data between networks. Note although the terms secured zone or SZ and less secured zone or LSZ are utilized throughout one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the embodiments of the invention described herein are directly applicable to the provision of cyber security protection across networks having the same or similar security levels forming separate zones being equally or approximately equally secured.

The platform can provide for data exchange based at the storage device level provide for data exchange from the SZ to the LSZ without full uninterrupted IP communication end to end elimination of IP communication across interfaces between two different networks systems and or facilities within the SZ and the LSZ and a data aggregation and data recovery center described later . According to an exemplary configuration the platform includes intermediate sets of computer servers in each zone such as for example an aggregator and or a data server see described later positioned at both sides of a Storage Area Network SAN to translate and retranslate the native files to applications and servers of end systems e.g. plant systems and corporate systems . The SAN can beneficially be used to interrupt what would otherwise be a full IP network connection between the plant systems associated with the SZ and corporate systems associated with the LSZ resulting in the elimination of the need for a firewall and or a DMZ between the SZ and LSZ.

The SAN can include an SZ SAN interface and an LSZ SAN interface residing in the same storage enclosure or different storage enclosures. Each SAN interface contains at least one but typically a plurality of SAN volumes or logical drives each providing a single accessible storage area to the respective server .

The SAN can also include one or more switches. In a preferred configuration the one or more switches are part of a switched fabric or more typically a switched fabric in Fiber Channel defining a Fiber Channel SAN fabric comprising one or more Fiber Channel SAN switches not separately shown . The data exchange can be between two SAN volumes residing in the same storage enclosure or different storage enclosures utilizing for example the small computer system interface SCSI and or Fiber Channel protocols. Other protocols providing similar functionality are however within the scope of the present invention.

The platform can beneficially utilize a dedicated communications conduit or circuit based on dedicated channels such as Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH Synchronous Optical Networking SONET Wave Division Multiplexing dedicated cable Digital Subscriber Line DSL dedicated fiber and or e.g. various forms of other non shared IP packet networks as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to establish independence from the public and or private shared IP network for plant data. The platform can provide for data exchange between the SZ and the LSZ utilizing a centralized SAN data exchange model see and or a distributed SAN data exchange model see .

According to the illustrated embodiment the functionality of the exemplary network platform is based primarily upon a non shared hybrid IP packet network extending between a dedicated LAN and an Enterprise e.g. corporate other LAN and is used to exchange the data between SZ and the LSZ platform storage designated to be accessed from one side by systems or components associated with the SZ and accessed from the other side by systems or components associated with LSZ and optionally a dedicated communication circuit channel used for linking various data sources to the non shared hybrid IP packet network directionally or bi directionally. The data sources can include for example critical or non critical remote or local plants facilities systems networks applications controllers computers servers or other data management devices sensors or other data collecting or transmitting devices including I O devices equipment things and or other assets or a combination thereof collectively referred to as data sources or plant systems for simplicity. The linking can be either directly with the plant system or via an interface with their respective LANs . Note the non shared hybrid IP packet network is referred to as being a hybrid because it can include both IP communications interrupted by non IP communications.

The exemplary network platform includes a centralized facility in the form of an exemplary baseline centralized SAN data exchange model that contains the dedicated LAN a set of Storage and infrastructures and an Enterprise LAN . The Storage and infrastructures collectively include Data Staging Modules DSMs and a SAN Inter Networking Module SAN IM extending therebetween and used to exchange the data between the SZ and the LSZ. Together the components of the centralized facility form the non shared hybrid IP packet network which can perform the data exchange between zones using a non IP non Ethernet form of data exchange. Additionally the centralized facility in conjunction with the dedicated communication channel form a secured link .

The exemplary centralized facility is bounded on one side by the dedicated circuit channel and on the other side by a non dedicated circuit i.e. corporate shared IP packet communication network forming at least substantial portions of LSZ. Other configurations of the baseline centralized facility model however are within the scope of the present invention. For example according to an alternative embodiment the non shared hybrid IP packet network can instead be bounded by two different non dedicated circuits i.e. packet communication networks .

Other alternative centralized facility models are also within the scope of the present invention. For example according to an alternative embodiment the centralized facility includes the dedicated LAN with the Storage infrastructure in communication with a remote facility with the Storage infrastructure and enterprise LAN . Also for example according to another alternative embodiment the centralized facility includes the dedicated LAN and Storage infrastructure and Storage infrastructure and a remote facility with the corporate LAN .

Still referring to the network platform can also include a Secured Dedicated Communication Link Module SDCLM . The hardware components of the SDCLM can include for example an Ethernet switch to establish the dedicated LAN a network security device such as for example one or more Firewalls to protect the LAN a dedicated communication circuit channel including for example a transmission network bounded by the network security device e.g. the four firewalls and a set of transmission access egress nodes and corresponding optical or electric cables and or wireless transmitters and receivers. The software components include centralized software having the capability to interface into the different SDCLM hardware that collects performance events. The software also has the capability to track events monitor correlates and identify abnormalities. The software can also alert cyber security compromises locally on a system display and or remotely to a centralized Security operation center as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

According to an exemplary embodiment the dedicated communication circuit is based on dedicated channels such Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH Synchronous Optical Networking SONET Wave Division Multiplexing WDM dedicated fiber strand Digital Subscriber Line DSL and or cable. The SDCLM utilizes non public or shared private IP. It implies a secured conduit based on either a dedicate IP over Ethernet and or Serial communication over the communication link. The dedicated communication circuit channel is bounded by the network security device e.g. firewalls . The four firewalls typically hardware based or a combination of both hardware and software are positioned to restrict access to and securely isolate the transmission network allowing only those protocols and data that are authorized to enter the transmission network preventing the spread of malicious code. The SDCLM beneficially provides the required capability to connect the plant systems to the network platform .

Referring to as briefly introduced above according to an exemplary embodiment the network platform includes one or more first zone DSMs each defining an SZ DSM is are placed at the first zone or SZ and one or more second zone DSMs each defining an LSZ DSM is are placed at the second zone or LSZ. The SZ and LSZ DSMs are data hubs to collect all data that needs to be exchanged between the different zones. Each DSM will collect the data corresponding to the networks and systems or other data sources belonging to a single one of at least two Security Zones that it is associated with. The SZ DSM for example is connected to various local and or remote plant systems or other data sources via the SDCLM and is used as a buffer and staging area for all data entering or exiting that SZ. The LSZ DSM can but need not utilize a less secure network connection such as a shared packet switched network to include the Internet to carry the data to the end users. Each DSM is bounded by a security apparatus e.g. a firewall from one communication side and the SAN storage infrastructure e.g. SAN IM on the other. The SAN storage infrastructure is located in between the SZ DSM and the LSZ DSM .

Each DSM has the function of transferring data such as time series data from one data source to destination. The data sources can be single threaded multi thread and or multi session data sources originating from a single and or multiple application programming interfaces APIs . The SZ DSM communicates with the SZ data sources e.g. plant systems using one or more dedicated communication circuits channels or other preferably secure circuits or conduits that can be based on IP or serial communication. The SZ data sources include for example one or more servers located at or otherwise associated with the plant systems remote or local. The data sources typically within or constituting the respective plant systems can include for example oracle SQL or other database servers as known to one of ordinary skill in the art serving the respective plant systems . The data sources can also be for example a server running an application that exchanges data templates based on TCP IP or UDP IP.

According to an exemplary configuration the SZ DSM and LSZ DSM forming part of the exemplary centralized facility can each include one or more aggregators and or one or more data servers respectively and corresponding DSM software stored thereon to provide for a broad range of different data types and communication characteristics of the various plant systems . The aggregators which can be servers are responsible for collecting data from the different plant systems or other data sources by establishing communications databases templates quarries data exchanges a data filing library or libraries for each plant facility or alternatively each individual plant system component and data transmission management. The primary means of data exchanges is generally based on standard database formats such as SQL database interfaces. The complementing data servers are responsible for supporting data exchanges at the Application to Application layers based on utilizing standard protocols support for example by TCP IP or UDP IP ports.

According to an exemplary configuration and function the source and destination servers are at the SZ DSM or at the remote or local location of the respective plant systems depending on the traffic direction. For example data originating from an SZ data source to be sent to LSZ destinations is sent to the aggregator or data server as a destination for data exchange using standard APIs. Data retrieved from the LSZ DSM via SAN volumes that needs to be sent to the SZ plant systems will typically have the servers associated with the respective plant LAN at or otherwise associated with the respective local or remote plant systems as the destination or alternatively the actual plant system component itself.

With respect to data originating from an LSZ data source e.g. corporate networks systems and end users collectively referred to as corporate systems the SZ DSM retrieves data from the SZ DSM SAN volume and sends the retrieved data to the respective destination server or servers associated with the respective destination plant system . With respect to data transitioning from SZ data sources the respective server or servers at the SZ DSM retrieves or receives data from the respective SZ data source.

According to an exemplary configuration the SZ DSM provides for concurrent data access from different sources in a uniform manner. The SZ DSM servers and or workstations save the data to a SZ DSM SAN volume for example located on or otherwise associated with the SZ SAN storage typically in the form of flat files containing printable characters for transfer replication to an LSZ DSM SAN volume for example located on or otherwise associated with an LSZ SAN storage for acquisition by the LSZ DSM and access by or re transmission to the ultimate destination. In an exemplary data transfer scheme the flat files are transferred or replicated transparently in a write only method utilizing the SAN infrastructure e.g. SAN fabric to the LSZ DSM SAN volume. By converting the files into flat files prior to transfer between zones active files those files having executable code and or macros that cannot be transferred as a text or binary file e.g. URL links object oriented executable file among others which can be carriers of computer worms or viruses are eliminated from the data preventing them from being exchanged between the SZ and LSZ vice versa.

According to an exemplary configuration mirror volumes of the LSZ DSM SAN volumes can be utilized for respective LSZ applications requiring read and write access to the volume hosting their data. An example where both read and write access is required includes a scenario where data is being exchanged with an Oracle database on plant side to another Oracle database on the enterprise network e.g. corporate shared packet network . Another example includes a scenario where a plant information PI system inside the plant exchanges data with the corporate network at the API level but uses the SZ DSM e.g. data server and SAN IM to transfer the data at the I O layer i.e. using a non IP protocol network connection. This mirror volume can be synchronized and broken from the LSZ DSM SAN volume in a timely interval depending on the SAN IM s capability and required overall time latency between the data source and end users. The LSZ DSM can manage the time to complete sync allotted for synchronizing mirrored volumes based on both elapsed time for file generation and elapsed time for file read.

According to an exemplary configuration multiple SAN volumes can be utilized. For example each SZ DSM server can utilize a different single volume on the SAN storage as means for data transportation. Additionally multi thread data flowing within a single DSM can utilize either a single volume or a separate volume per data thread. Each DSM server can include a DSM Loader as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to manage data retrieval and transfer to the respective destination server within a preselected target window. Additionally multiple DSMs can be used to support different remote locations and or different applications and can provide the required scalability for data processing and storage exchange time delay and storage capacity requirements.

According to an exemplary configuration each LSZ DSM server mounting the read only volume and or the mirror volume can read the flat data file. For time sensitive data the data includes a timestamp typically at the record level to provide for advancing the priority of processing the file to the final destination. According to an exemplary processing process the LSZ DSM servers read the data from the mounted volumes and ensure that the records are synchronized with end users servers or clients and are up to date. This function can be supported by standard API technologies such as for example a SQL service pack and or standard protocol such as Object Linking and Embedding Database OLEDB . The required snapshot event rate will depend on the SAN capabilities and on the required data latency between source and destination. The SAN snapshot event rate in exchanging the data between the two data volumes is configured to be within the application tolerance of recalling and uploading the flat file to the application layer.

Each DSM can include one or more flat file checkers or governors that check that only flat files are written or read from or to the SAN volumes and or can include other software modules for checking of files network communication systems and volumes for freeness from computer or network worms viruses or compromised data sessions and for performing advanced data transform and cleansing operations. Advantageously the aggregator servers and data servers can provide an environment to cleanse the data before it is moved to the SAN IM i.e. an advanced process before exchanging the data through the SAN IM . The ability to capitalize on data cleansing at the aggregator servers data servers and SAN IM provides an environment for secure data transmission.

The various DSM functions can also include managing a queued events count and an archive event rate which helps to ensure a sustainable data transmission and data integrity in the event of a component failure during the data transmission upon the resumption of the data communication. Other DSM functions normally supported by standard API technologies such as for example those supported by an SQL service pack and or standard application APIs include applying context to information to relate and visualize the information generating advanced analytic data structures creating dashboards for KPI analysis and visualization through integration of end user s required key performance induction for the different functions e.g. queries data transmission data storage etc. supporting the data flow transmission and creating and scheduling reports performing online analytic processing and data mining performing advanced data validation and data transformations and controlling validation and transformation through runtime configuration data by integrating such functions in support of the data flow transmission integrity as understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Still referring to as discussed above according to an exemplary embodiment the network platform includes a SAN storage and data exchange system comprising a SAN Inter Networking Module SAN IM positioned functionally between the SZ DSM and the LSZ DSM to provide for exchanging data between the SZ and the LSZ. According to an exemplary SAN IM architecture the SAN IM infrastructure hardware of the SAN IM includes an SZ SAN storage labeled Storage Plant SAN and an LSZ SAN storage labeled Storage Enterprise SAN each including one or more storage media providing at least one but more typically a plurality of volumes to thereby form individual data centers assessable by their associated DSMs . The SAN IM also includes at least one SAN Switch typically in the form of one or more network switches and more typically in the form of a switched fabric comprising a plurality of network switches and more preferably in the form of the switched fabric in SCSI fiber channel. Particularly an exemplary SAN IM baseline architecture is based on a single SAN storage system Storage Storage utilizing a single and or multiple storage enclosures and the SAN switched fabric including one or more SAN switches which can provide a fault tolerant system design whereby each component is fully redundant.

An exemplary SAN IM configuration includes several unique functionalities. One of the various functionalities includes the ability of the SAN IM to provide both storage capacity and data retention for both the SZ and LSZ. The SAN IM data storage capability can advantageously be used for example to retain the data should the Enterprise Resource Planning ERP storage become compromised or if data being transferred to the LSZ is being lost. The functionalities can also or alternatively include virtual block data volumes exchange between storage based real time data snapshots data storage replications managed read and write capabilities between storage volumes to service the objectives of the data flow for end to end applications data exchange remote replication functionality that can include both synchronous and asynchronous modes to provide the flexibility for the data exchange transmission functions between different types of applications and or an ability to write the output file directly to any SAN storage volume e.g. writing an output file comprising a virtual block of data to a flat file on a SAN storage volume for transfer across networks having either the same or disparate security levels.

The functionalities can also or alternatively include the provision of database synchronization across systems an ability to generate the processes necessary to transport and store the information an ability to maintain failover and continued access depending upon the base operating system and database and or application capabilities an ability to access data from disparate data sources such as process historians relational databases web services and third party applications for example through application of the SAN storage and or an ability to access and transport large amounts of information on a global i.e. large data volume scale implemented for example by interconnecting distributed remote facilities with the SDCLM .

The functionalities can further or alternatively include an ability to utilize non IP communication such as for example a fiberchannel protocol in communication over the fabric within the SAN IM between the hosts e.g. aggregators and data servers of the SZ and LSZ DSMs and their respective storage volumes at . The DSMs can be physically located in close proximity or can be far apart as far as the SAN fabric capability can provide for.

Still further the functionalities can also or alternatively include the ability to create develop and assign values to perform bulk copy to extract retries based on failure between the DSM and data source to log retry exceptions to transform retries and or to provide for dynamic and site specific control of extract transform load ETL packages utilizing available API technologies such SQL service pack and or standard application APIs.

Referring also to each DSM system of the SZ and LSZ DSMs requiring access to the data source or destination can have one or more Host Bus Adapters HBAs configured to provide connectivity with its associated SAN IM storage also having at least a corresponding one or more HBAs . Additionally each SAN IM storage can also have at least one HBA to connect to the SAN fabric switch . Zones as would be understood by person of ordinary skill in the art in the SAN fabric switch can be created to ensure that each DSM system has access only to the storage volume that it is assigned to.

Although described primarily in relation to a centralized SAN data exchange model various embodiments provide platforms that utilize a distributed SAN data exchange model. For example illustrates an apparatus comprising an exemplary network platform including a distributed facility in the form of a distributed SAN data exchange model. The distributed SAN data exchange model is similar to the centralized SAN data exchange model illustrated in except at least some of the SZ plant systems are connected from different locations to the corporate shared packet network via multiple geographically separated pathways to communicate with corporate systems . Additionally three separate secure zones are provided between the SZ firewalls and the firewalls adjacent the three corporate LAN interfaces to the LSZ.

In the model illustrated in the three corporate LANs represent either three separate portions of the same corporate LAN illustrated in being accessed at three separate locations or represent three separately located different Enterprise e.g. corporate LANs typically in the form of shared packet networks interfacing with three corresponding separate Storage infrastructures commonly interfacing with the same Storage infrastructure to connect to the plant systems and each connected to the corporate network via different pathways to provide a communication pathway to the corporate systems to provide for enhanced data exchange between the corporate systems and the plant systems .

The first of the three LSZ SAN fabric switches is interfaced with the LSZ SAN storage to provide for file acquisition by the LSZ DSM i.e. aggregator and or data server and access by or retransmission to the ultimate destination via the corporate LAN and the corporate network as described with respect to . The second of the three LSZ SAN fabric switches is interfaced with a second LSZ SAN storage to provide for file acquisition by a second LSZ DSM i.e. aggregator and or data server and access by or retransmission to the ultimate destination via the corporate LAN or LAN segment and the corporate network to provide a second pathway to the corporate systems . The third of the three LSZ SAN fabric switches is interfaced with a third LSZ SAN storage to provide for file acquisition by a third LSZ DSM i.e. aggregator and or data server and access by or retransmission to the ultimate destination via the corporate LAN or LAN segment and the corporate network to provide a third pathway to the corporate systems .
