title: System and method for managing devices over a content centric network
abstract: A device can process commands from a remote device that manages the local device over a content centric network. During operation, the device can receive an Interest for managing a device resource, such that the Interest's name includes a name or a name prefix associated with the device resource, and includes a command for managing the resource. If the device determines that the name prefix corresponds to the local device, the device analyzes the Interest's command to determine a device resource and performs the resource-managing operation on the device resource. If the name prefix does not correspond to the local device, the device performs a longest-prefix-matching lookup using the Interest's name prefix to determine a destination for the Interest. If the Interest's destination corresponds to a component of the local device, the device forwards the Interest to the component or a local agent for the component.

This disclosure is generally related to remote device management. More specifically this disclosure is related to monitoring or controlling devices over a Content Centric Network.

In a content centric network CCN a client device can obtain data by disseminating an Interest message that includes a name for this data. Intermediate routers in CCN propagate this Interest toward any content producer associated with the Interest s name prefix. The content producer that receives the Interest can generate and return a Content Object that satisfies the Interest e.g. the name of the Content Object exactly matches the name in the Interest packet . The routers then forward the Content Object to the client device along the reverse path traversed by the Interest message leveraging reverse path information left in the routers by the Interest message.

The CCN architecture is designed to allow a client to obtain data efficiently and securely without regard to where the data comes from. However a typical CCN network does not allow an administrator to efficiently monitor or configure a hierarchy of devices in a network.

One embodiment provides a methodology for managing devices over a content centric network CCN . These devices can include a computer e.g. a laptop a server a mobile device a networking device e.g. a switch or an appliance e.g. a smart TV thermostat etc. . During operation a device e.g. a router or a data forwarding device can receive an Interest for managing a device resource such that the Interest s name includes the name or a name prefix associated with the device resource and includes a command for managing the device resource. The device performs a longest prefix matching lookup using the Interest s name to determine a destination for the Interest. If the Interest s destination includes a component of the local device the device forwards the Interest to an agent for the component of the local device.

In CCN each piece of content is individually named and each piece of data is bound to a unique name that distinguishes the data from any other piece of data such as other versions of the same data or data from other sources. This unique name allows a client to request the data by disseminating a request or an Interest that indicates the unique name and can obtain the data independent from the data s storage location network location application and means of transportation. The following terms describe elements of a CCN architecture 

Content Object A single piece of named data which is bound to a unique name. Content Objects are persistent which means that a Content Object can move around within a computing device or across different computing devices but does not change. If any component of the Content Object changes the entity that made the change creates a new Content Object that includes the updated content and binds the new Content Object to a new unique name.

Unique Names A name in CCN is typically location independent and uniquely identifies a Content Object. A data forwarding device can use the name or name prefix to forward a packet toward a network node that generates or stores the Content Object regardless of a network address or physical location for the Content Object. In some embodiments the name may be a hierarchically structured variable length identifier HSVLI . The HSVLI can be divided into several hierarchical components which can be structured in various ways. For example the individual name components parc home ccn and test.txt can be structured in a left oriented prefix major fashion to form the name parc home ccn test.txt. Thus the name parc home ccn can be a parent or prefix of parc home ccn test.txt. Additional components can be used to distinguish between different versions of the content item such as a collaborative document.

Interest A packet that indicates a request for a piece of data and includes a name or a name prefix for the piece of data. A data consumer can disseminate a request or Interest across an information centric network which CCN routers can propagate toward a storage device e.g. a cache server or a data producer that can provide the requested data to satisfy the request or Interest.

A description of a CCN architecture is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 338 175 entitled CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF INTERESTS AND CONTENT IN A CONTENT CENTRIC NETWORK by inventors Van L. Jacobson and Diana K. Smetters filed 18 Dec. 2008 which is hereby incorporated by reference.

In some embodiments the longest prefix matching lookup results can include a plurality of components. Also the device can forward the Interest to the plurality of components and receives a Content Object CO from each of the plurality of components such that a respective Content Object provides status information for a corresponding component. The device then generates a Content Object that includes a status information summary for the status information from plurality of Content Objects and returns the Content Object to satisfy the Interest.

In some embodiments the status information summary can include a compilation of status information from the plurality of components and or can include one or more aggregate values that aggregate the status information for the plurality of components.

In some embodiments the component maintains status information that includes a component variable a counter value and or a configuration state.

In some embodiments the component includes a hardware component of the local device and the agent can run on the local device on behalf of the hardware component.

In some embodiments the component includes a software component or a hardware component that includes the agent for processing the Interest.

In some embodiments the component can include a line card a temperature sensor a fan controller a forwarding information base FIB a pending Interest table PIT or a content store CS .

One embodiment provides a device that facilitates managing one or more device resources based on their name prefix. During operation the device can receive a first Interest for managing a device resource such that the Interest s name includes a name or a name prefix for the device and a command for monitoring or configuring the device resource. If the device determines that the first Interest s name corresponds to the local device the device analyzes the first Interest s command to determine a device resource of the device and to determine a resource managing operation to perform on the device resource. The device then performs the resource managing operation on the device resource.

In some embodiments the resource managing operation causes the device to configure a configuration parameter for the device resource.

In some embodiments the resource managing operation causes the device to monitor an attribute of the device resource.

In some embodiments the command includes a detailed aggregation command and the resource managing operation causes the device to monitor an attribute of a plurality of resources of the local device.

In some embodiments the command includes an aggregation summary command and the resource managing operation causes the device to compute an aggregated attribute from a plurality of resources of the local device.

In some embodiments the command includes an alert configuring command and the resource managing operation configures the device to issue an alert in response to detecting that a predetermined condition is satisfied.

In some embodiments when the device determines that the alert s condition is satisfied the device processes the alert to generate an alert message and sends the alert message to a predetermined target device over the content centric network.

In some embodiments while sending the alert message the device determines from the first Interest a routable prefix for the predetermined target device. The device generates a second Interest that includes the routable prefix and the alert message and disseminates the second Interest over the content centric network.

In some embodiments the first Interest originated from the predetermined target device that is to receive the alert message. While sending the alert message the device generates a Content Object with a name that includes the first Interest s name and with a payload that includes the alert message. The device then returns the Content Object over the content centric network to satisfy the first Interest and to provide the alert message to the predetermined target device.

The following description is presented to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the embodiments and is provided in the context of a particular application and its requirements. Various modifications to the disclosed embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Thus the present invention is not limited to the embodiments shown but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein.

Embodiments of the present invention provide an agent or daemon running on a device that solves the problem of monitoring or configuring the device remotely over a CCN network. The devices can build or join a hierarchical namespace in a way that each device that is to be managed or controlled has a unique routable prefix in the namespace hierarchy.

A computer or an application on any device that is to remotely manage these devices can disseminate an Interest toward a specific device or device component by generating the Interest s name to include the routable prefix to the device. The Interest s name can also specify a query for monitoring or configuring parameters or attributes of the device or component. For example a system administrator can use a CCN application or a service on a personal computer or a server to configure a plurality of devices across an organization s namespace. Also a computer or server can disseminate device monitoring Interests over the Content Centric Network to collect real time statistics from a plurality of devices in the namespace and across the organization s network. The device can issue an alert if problems are detected in the collected information and can periodically generate a report that describes the network s performance.

In some embodiments a device or component can generate a unique name prefix for itself based on the routable prefix to a neighboring node such as to a local area network LAN or wide area network WAN router. Alternatively the device can obtain a unique routable prefix from an organization s server that is responsible for assigning unique routable prefixes to devices in the organization s namespace such as based on their location in the organization s network. Each routable prefix is unique to a device which allows other devices to send packets e.g. CCN Interests directly to the desired device.

Also the routable prefixes include a hierarchical name structure which routers along the network can use to forward the packet to a specific target device based on the device s unique routable prefix. Note that unlike Internet Protocol IP networks the routable prefixes are hierarchical in nature and do not have a fixed length. Also note that the routable prefixes are not IP prefixes as in the current Internet but are based on the name of the device. For example a router or gateway to a device can have a routable prefix that is a subset a name prefix to the target device s routable prefix. Hence an Interest for the target device can be first propagated to the router or gateway based on a portion of the Interest s name prefix that matches the router or gateway s routable prefix. The router or gateway then performs a local longest prefix matching lookup in a local Forwarding Information Base FIB to determine an interface for forwarding the Interest and uses this interface to forward the Interest to the target device.

Also note that the CCN routable prefixes can be used directly to forward an Interest to the target device. Unlike Internet domain names a computer does not need to first resolve the CCN routable prefixes to a fixed length IP address before sending an Interest to the target device. Also unlike IP networks CCN routers do not need to perform network address translation NAT to forward an Interest from outside a local area network LAN to a device in the LAN. Rather the Interest is forwarded along a network path defined by the routable prefix starting from a device associated with the Interest s highest level name prefix and ending at a device or device component whose name matches the Interest s routable prefix.

For example routers may be components in a network named PARC. A router . can include a subscriber edge router which can interface CCN to an Internet service provider ISP . The ISP can forward any Interest with the name prefix parc to router . hence router . can have a root routable prefix parc A client device for example can disseminate an Interest to devices in CCN by including the routable prefix parc in the Interest s name.

A set of routers . . may reside in the computer science laboratory CSL at PARC. The routable prefix to routers . . and any other devices in this lab may begin with the name prefix parc csl. Specifically router . may be an edge router for CSL and can have the routable prefix parc csl. Another router . in the CSL lab may provide network access to one or more offices or rooms for a group named group2 and may be configured to have the routable prefix parc csl group2. A router for one of these rooms may have the routable prefix parc csl group2 router1. Devices in this room of the CSL lab may be assigned the routable prefix parc csl group2 router1 device name where device name corresponds to a local name for the device.

Router can also include CCN related resources such as a Forwarding Information Base FIB a Pending Interest Table PIT and a Content Store CS . The agent running on router can use FIB PIT and CS to process the incoming Interests and Content Objects. In addition when this agent receives an Interest that includes commands for managing a local resource the agent at router can process these commands to monitor and or configure the local resource. For example the agent may process an Interest to monitor or control a temperature sensor or a fan or even a local CCN resource e.g. FIB PIT or CS .

If the Interest is directed to a resource that has its own agent the agent local to router can forward the Interest to the resource s dedicated agent. For example each of line cards can include a processor and a memory and can include an agent that executes on the processor and memory. If the agent at router receives an Interest with a name prefix directed to line card . the local agent can forward the Interest to line card . for further processing.

While the example above is directed to a router the techniques presented herein can also apply to any electronic device now know or later developed. For example a server a personal computer or a networked appliance can execute an agent or daemon that monitors and controls various local resources and that allows these local resources to be managed remotely over a content centric network.

The router can include a set of internal components e.g. line cards that each has an agent that can accept Interests for monitoring or managing the component. For example each line card in router 1 can include a processor that runs an agent for the line card. The router can assign a local name to each internal component and can forward an Interest to the internal component whose local name is specified in the Interest s name. This allows the router to forward an Interest parc csl group2 router1 LineCard2 to a line card named LineCard2. Also each line card can run an agent for each of its ports such that a port s agent can be assigned a local name by the line card itself.

Once the router is assigned a unique routable prefix the router or a remote device can control or monitor the router s resources over the content centric network. For example an administrator can use his personal computer to monitor or configure port P1 of LineCard2 by disseminating an Interest to the prefix parc csl group2 router1 LineCard21 1 The Interest can configure a port parameter by specifying a query that includes the parameter and the value. In some embodiments the Interest s name can be structured as prefix parameter new value 2 where prefix includes prefix 1 and q parameter new value specifies the query with the parameter and value. In some embodiments the Interest can include the parameters and new values as a payload in the Interest message. The Interest s name can be prefix and the Interest can include an explicit payload that specifies the query parameters and value.

In some embodiments the query can configure a port speed an available bandwidth virtual LAN VLAN information a Power over Ethernet PoE state e.g. enabled disabled and Quality of Service QoS parameters. For example the Interest can configure the port s port speed using the query parc csl group2 router1 LineCard21 port speed 10 mbps 3 Once this Interest reaches router 1 the agent at router 1 performs a longest prefix matching lookup e.g. on a local FIB to identify LineCard2 and forwards the Interest to the agent running on LineCard2. Similarly the agent running on LineCard2 performs a longest prefix matching lookup to forward the Interest to a local agent for port P1. The agent for port P1 then processes the Interest to set the port speed to 10 mbps and can return a Content Object that acknowledges the operation.

In some embodiments an Interest can monitor a measurement or counter value from one or more devices or resources. For example the Interest s name can be structured as prefix of device or component parameter 4 An Interest directed to a router or line card can monitor for example a counter value for a number of packets forwarded a number of dropped packets an average packet size or any other router specific measurement or parameter. Hence once the Interest parc csl group2 router1 LineCard21 dropped packets 5 reaches the agent for port P1 of LineCard2 this agent reads the local dropped packets value that specifies the total number of packets that have been dropped at port P1. The agent then generates and returns a Content Object that includes the Interest s name and includes the number of dropped packets in the Content Object s body.

In some embodiments an Interest can query aggregate data from a plurality of components. The aggregate data can list the individual values from each of the plurality of components or can include a single value that quantifies the aggregate value from the set of components. The aggregate values can be collected and or summarized at the router level at the line card level at the port level or at the virtual port level.

For example the Interest parc csl group2 router1 LineCard2 dropped packets detailed 6 includes the reserved word detailed which informs the agent at LineCard2 to generate a detailed report that lists the number of packets dropped at each of the ports. LineCard2 processes the Interest by generating an Interest similar to 6 for each of the ports to query the dropped packets value from each port. If a port itself includes a virtual port the port can generate and return a detailed report of the dropped packets value across all virtual ports. Once LineCard2 obtains the individual values from each port LineCard2 can generate and return a Content Object that includes the Interest name 6 and includes the individual dropped packets value received from each port in the Content Object s body.

As another example the Interest parc csl group2 router1 LineCard2 packets summary 7 Includes a query with the reserved word summary which informs the agent at LineCard2 to generate a summary of the number of dropped packets across all ports of LineCard2. LineCard2 processes the Interest by querying each of the ports for the dropped packets value from the port and its virtual ports and computes a new dropped packets value that sums the number of dropped packets from each port and virtual port of LineCard2. Once LineCard2 computes the aggregate dropped packets value LineCard2 can generate and return a Content Object that includes the Interest name 7 and includes the aggregate dropped packets value in the Content Object s body.

In some embodiments a system administrator can disseminate an Interest that queries a collection of devices within a CCN name hierarchy. For example the Interest parc csl  packets detailed 8 can reach a router for the CSL department with the routable prefix parc csl . This CSL router can process Interest 8 by iterating across the devices at one level lower in the CCN name hierarchy to query these devices for a detailed report of the number of dropped packets. The CSL router can do so by generating new Interest packets for each of the devices or components in the CCN name hierarchy and receiving matching Content Objects from each device or component. The CSL router then parses the Content Objects it receives generates a new Content Object that summarizes the information from the Content Objects it receives and responds to the original Interest using this newly created Content Object.

The devices in the CCN hierarchy can include the line cards and or ports local to the CSL router and can include other routers or devices with the name prefix parc csl device name. These routers also query the routers at one level below them as well as each local line card and or port. Each line card then queries each port to obtain a detailed report for the number of dropped packets at each port and virtual port. This way if an organization has a large number of devices in a network a system administrator can issue one Interest to obtain a detailed report from the collection of devices within a CCN name hierarchy.

The agents can also monitor or configure CCN related resources such as a Forwarding Information Base FIB a Pending Interest Table PIT or a Content Store CS . An administrator s computing device can send an Interest to a device to query a number of entries in the PIT. For example the device can disseminate the query parc csl group2 PIT 9 The query in Interest 9 queries the router with the routable prefix parc csl group2 for a number of pending Interests for the name prefix bbc headlines. 

The administrator s computer can also disseminate Interests to change or configure a CCN resource on a remote device. In some embodiments Interest can configure a FIB PIT or CS resource to create modify or delete entries in the resource. For example the administrator can modify the FIB entry for a router at the namespace parc csl group2 to change the outbound interface for the namespace bbc headlines to the interface set 2 3 using the Interest parc csl group2 FIB bbc headlines InterfaceSet 2 3 10 

As another example the administrator can modify the Content Store for a router at the routable prefix parc csl group2 to change the maximum cache size for the namespace bbc headlines to 2 GB using the Interest parc csl group2 CS bbc headlines CS 2 11 This configures the router to limit the amount of content with the name prefix bbc headlines that is cached to 2 GB. The administrator can also disseminate other cache configuring Interests to limit the amount of content that is cached for other name prefixes. For example the administrator can disseminate the following Interest to configure the Content Store to limit the cache size for all content to 10 GB by specifying the root name prefix in the query parc csl group2 CS 2 12 Processing Device Managing Interests

The agent determines whether the Interest s name prefix matches a routable prefix to the local agent operation . If not the Interest is not intended to be processed by the local agent. Hence the agent determines a target device or component associated with the Interest s name prefix operation and forwards the Interest to an agent for the target device or resource operation . This target agent may execute on a different device or component or can be an agent that runs on the local device and manages one or more resources of the local device. For example the local device may include a set of components that each includes a processor executing an agent. As another example the local device may execute a set of sub agents that each manages a set of resources for the local device. A router s sub agent may manage resources such as a sensor e.g. a thermometer a fan a line card a graphics card and or any other component of the device. A personal device s sub agent may manage resources such as a smartphone s image sensor global positioning system GPS sensor accelerometer and or any application running on the device. Other exemplary resources can include for example a device s FIB PIT or CS.

On the other hand if the Interest s name prefix matches the local device s routable prefix the Interest has arrived at the target device that is being managed. To process the Interest the device s agent determines one or more resources being managed by the Interest operation and determines an operation to perform on the resource s operation . The device performs the operation on the one or more resources operation and can return a Content Object that includes results from performing the operation on the resource s operation .

In some embodiments the Interest may specify a command for configuring or monitoring resources across various sub agents that span one or more levels of a CCN namespace hierarchy. For example the command may request a router to monitor network statistics from a plurality of ports across multiple line cards. In some embodiments these line cards can include a processing unit that executes an agent. Alternatively the local device can execute an agent for each line card. These line card agents correspond to a lower level of the CCN namespace hierarchy and function as sub agents to the router s agent.

The local agent can perform the Interest s operations on the resources operation by generating and disseminating an Interest directed to each of the multiple sub agents. These sub agents then process the Interest to configure or monitor the resources at or below their segment of the CCN namespace. Continuing the example above a sub agent for each of these line cards gathers the statistics information for the line card and returns a Content Object that includes this statistics information. Once the local agent receives the Content Objects from the sub agents the local agent can generate another Content Object that aggregates or summarizes the results from the various sub agents.

Otherwise the device obtains forwarding information from the lookup results operation and determines whether the matching entry corresponds to a locally managed resource operation . A locally managed resource can include any component that does not include its own agent. The device can assign a name prefix to each of these components and can launch and execute an agent for each of these components. If the Interest s name prefix corresponds to a locally managed component the device identifies the agent for the component operation and forwards the Interest to this agent operation .

On the other hand if the Interest s name prefix is not for a locally managed resource the device forwards the Interest to the target component associated with the Interest s name prefix operation . The target component s agent can then forward the Interest or processes the Interest locally.

The agent at a device or component can also send alert messages when a predetermined condition is detected. An administrator can configure the agent to generate an alert by disseminating an alert configuring Interest to the agent. In some embodiments the alert configuring Interest can have the form component prefix alert attribute attribute value 13 In the alert configuring Interest component prefix includes routable prefix to the component being configured to issue alerts. Also the combination of attribute and attribute value specify the criteria for issuing an alert for the attribute. Alternatively the alert configuring Interest can specify an explicit expression for the condition that triggers the alert and can specify an explicit set of attributes to return in the alert message.

In some embodiments an administrator s computing device can disseminate the alert configuring Interest to query alert messages from the component. For example the agent at the computing device can periodically disseminate an Interest to the component s routable prefix to query for alerts. The target component and the agent at the component can ignore the alert configuring Interests unless an alert has been triggered or is triggered before the alert configuring Interest times out. If an alert is triggered the component can return a Content Object in response to the most recent or the next alert configuring Interest. The Content Object can include the alert Interest s name and can include the alert message in the payload.

In some embodiments the target component may require the administrator to have valid permission to query certain attributes or counter values or to set certain configuration parameters. Hence the administrator s computing device can generate the alert configuring Interest to include security information for the administrator. The security information can include encrypted user credentials e.g. a user identifier and password at the end of the Interest s name or as a name component of the Interest s name. The agent at the target component then verifies the administrator s permission to read or modify a restricted attribute prior to responding to a query Interest or an alert configuring Interest.

If the agent determines that the alert s condition is satisfied the agent proceeds to generate an alert message e.g. by executing the alert s instructions for generating the message operation . In some embodiments the alert message can include a predetermined message or may include a message that is generated dynamically using data available to the agent. Furthermore the alert s instructions may configure the agent to gather data from the local resources and or from other agents to include a detailed log in the alert message. The detailed log may be a part of the alert s message or may be included as an attachment to the alert s message.

The agent can then return the alert message to the source of the Interest or to a predetermined routable prefix. For example the agent can determine whether the alert configuring command specifies a routable prefix operation . If so the agent generates an Interest whose name includes the routable prefix and the alert message operation . The alert configuring Interest can have the form routable prefix alert component prefix alert message 14 In Interest 14 routable prefix includes the predetermined routable prefix for the Interest s destination and component prefix includes the routable prefix to the device or component that is issuing the alert. Also alert message includes the alert message being reported to the predetermined routable prefix. The agent can create the Interest to include a marshalled alert message. In some embodiments the agent can create an Interest that includes an explicit payload carrying the alert message. The agent then disseminates the Interest over the content centric network operation . Other CCN nodes then forward the alert s Interest to one or more secure devices associated with the routable prefix. These secure devices may or may not include the device that disseminated the initial Interest.

If the alert configuring command does not specify a routable prefix the agent can return the alert message to the device from which the Interest was received. The agent can generate a Content Object that includes the initial Interest s name and whose payload includes the alert message operation . The agent then returns the Content Object to satisfy the Interest operation . Other CCN nodes propagate the Content Object along a reverse path established by the initial Interest. For example an administrator can use a personal computing device to periodically disseminate an Interest that includes the local agent s routable prefix and which queries the agent for a certain type of alert. The agent can ignore the Interest until either the alert s condition is satisfied or the Interest times out. If the alert s condition becomes satisfied after one Interest times out the agent can return the alert message using a Content Object for the next Interest.

In some embodiments communication module can receive an Interest for managing a device resource such that the Interest includes a name prefix and a command for the device resource. Lookup module can perform a longest prefix matching lookup using the Interest s name prefix to determine a destination for the Interest. Interest processing module can process an Interest directed to apparatus to perform a resource managing operation on a resource of apparatus . Interest forwarding module can forward an Interest directed to an agent for a component of apparatus or for another device within the namespace of apparatus . Alert generating module can issue an alert in response to detecting that a predetermined condition is satisfied.

Agent can include instructions which when executed by computer system can cause computer system to perform methods and or processes described in this disclosure. Specifically agent may include instructions for receiving an Interest for managing a device resource such that the Interest includes a name prefix and a command for the device resource communication module . Further agent can include instructions for performing a longest prefix matching lookup using the Interest s name prefix to determine a destination for the Interest lookup module .

Agent can also include instructions for processing an Interest directed to agent to perform a resource managing operation on a resource of agent Interest processing module . Agent can also include instructions for forwarding an Interest directed to an agent for a component of agent or for another device within the namespace of agent Interest forwarding module . Agent can also include instructions for issuing an alert in response to detecting that a predetermined condition is satisfied alert generating module .
