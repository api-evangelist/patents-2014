This application is a non provisional application that claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 842 252 filed Jul. 2 2013.

A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

The field of the invention relates to gaming devices methods and systems which accumulate a progressive prize and award the same to one or more players upon occurrence of a trigger condition. More particularly it relates to gaming devices methods and systems which accumulate a mystery progressive prize.

Various types of gaming devices have been developed with features designed to captivate and maintain player interest. In general a gaming machine allows a player to play a base game of chance in exchange for a wager. In pay to play P2P gaming the wager has value such as wagering currency or credits representing currency. For novelty or entertainment only play the wagers are fictitious credits having no redemption value. Las Vegas style slot machines are an example of P2P gaming devices. Depending on the outcome of the base game the player may be entitled to an award which is awarded to the player by the gaming machine normally in the form of currency or game credits. Gaming devices may include flashing displays lighted displays or sound effects to capture a player s interest in a gaming device.

Many modern gaming devices incorporate a secondary feature or bonus game. These secondary games may be triggered by one or more outcomes from the base game such as for example a predefined symbol combination. These types of triggers are sometimes referred to as symbol driven triggers since they are determined by base game symbols. When the symbol combination occurs the gaming device processor enables the display for play of a secondary game. The secondary game may take the form of a number of free plays of the base game a random selection game where the player selects from displayed offerings to reveal prizes the play of a secondary game or the like.

In addition to symbol driven triggers there is also known to provide mystery prizes to players over and above any awards from the play of the base game or any base game symbol triggered feature. Often these mystery prizes are progressive prizes which may be arranged in triggered in a variety of manners. For example in Olive U.S. Pat. No. 7 108 603 issued Sep. 19 2006 and titled Slot Machine Game and System with Improved Jackpot Feature there is a disclosed networked gaming machines contributing from the wagers for the play of the base games to a progressive jackpot. Based upon the value of the wager W at a gaming device to play a base game and the predetermined turnover for the jackpot virtual lottery is conducted out of sight of the player with each base game play where the odds of winning relate to the wager W and jackpot turnover amount. When the feature is triggered play of a feature game determines the size of the award based upon a score from the feature game. Torango U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 460 issued Jul. 15 2003 and titled Progressive Wagering System discloses a similar type of hidden lottery type of mystery prize. In Acres et al U.S. Reissued patent RE38 812 reissued Oct. 4 2005 and titled Method and Apparatus for operating Networked Gaming Devices the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference there is disclosed a system based mystery jackpot which is triggered when the progressive pool reaches a selected and unrevealed amount.

A drawback to these prior mystery award techniques is that they either simply award an amount as determined by the system and or progressive controller for example the amount of the progressive jackpot pool when the mystery is triggered or provide for the play of a single feature game. For example in Olive U.S. Pat. No. 7 108 603 when the feature is triggered the player plays a feature spin and hold game and based upon the score range a selected award is issued to the player.

It would be advantageous to provide a progressive prize which has a prize value PV when the prize is triggered where the PV is awarded by a series of free game plays each play resulting in a random winning or losing outcome awards for winning outcomes and an expected value EV and where the number of free plays at least approximates PV EV. It would further be advantageous where EV is not an aliquot of PV to provide a system apparatus and method for accounting for any remainder of a fraction of free plays where EV is not an aliquot of PV. It would further be advantageous to provide one or more feature trigger types in such apparatus systems and methods.

There is therefore set forth according to the present invention a gaming device is set forth which includes a display. The gaming device may be a gaming machine such as found in a casino venue or may be a computer or mobile device. The display may be a video display electro mechanical display or a combination. More than one display may be provided. One or more data structures such as a flash memory and or hard drive stores software code for the operation of the play of one or more base games and one or features as well a corresponding graphics sound and text. The feature includes a series of free plays each having an expected value EV. A processor such as the game processor is configured to access the one or more data structures to control the one or more displays for display of the base game and feature to the player. One or more of the processor and progressive controller accumulates a progressive jackpot pool P which may have a minimum value Vand a maximum value V. A feature trigger is provided such as a trigger occurring from the play of the base game or other event. In an embodiment the trigger is a mystery trigger. When the trigger condition is satisfied and feature is triggered and a progressive jackpot amount value PV is determined to be awarded to the player. Based upon PV and EV the feature awards a number of free plays approximately equal to PV EV. Where EV is not an aliquot of PV i.e. PV EV Integer remainder R R

In an embodiment the feature may be free spins of a spinning reel game a roulette game Keno or Bingo game or the like.

Also set forth a system for a plurality of gaming devices each including a display for displaying one or more base games and one or more features. The gaming devices are linked on a network a progressive prize pool P is provided. The progressive prize pool P may be accumulated from portions of P2P wagers at the gaming devices fictitious credits or by external sources such as marketing dollars for a casino or hosting site. Each feature includes a series of free plays where each free play has an expected value. When a feature trigger condition is detected one or more of a game processor and progressive controller awards a progressive jackpot prize value PV through a number of free plays where the number is substantially equal to PV EV. Where EV is not an aliquot of PV i.e. PV EV Integer remainder where R R

In various embodiments a method is set forth wherein a portion of wagers from networked gaming devices is allocate to a progressive jackpot pool. When a jackpot award trigger condition is determined the method includes enabling a feature of a number of free plays substantially equal to PV EV where PV is the award prize value when the feature is enabled and EV is the expected value of each feature free play. Based upon the theoretical EV and the number of free plays the total award for the series of free plays should theoretically substantially equal the prize value PV but in actuality for any feature the total feature award may greater or lesser than PV.

Where the award value PV and expected value EV are such that EV is not an aliquot of PV i.e. PV EV Integer remainder where R R

In various embodiments the trigger condition may be based upon a coin in mystery a stand alone mystery a lottery based mystery or any other mystery trigger.

When a player has inserted a form of currency such as for example and without limitation paper currency coins or tokens cashless tickets or vouchers electronic funds transfers or the like into the currency acceptor a signal is sent by way of bus to the I O board and to EGM processor board which in turn assigns an appropriate number of credits for play in accordance with the game program. The player may further control the operation of the gaming machine by way of other peripherals for example to select the amount to wager via the buttons . The game starts in response to the player operating a start mechanism such as the handle button such as a SPIN RESET button or a touch screen icon. The game program includes a random number generator to provide and display randomly selected video indicia at the primary game display as shown in . In some embodiments the random generator may be physically separate from gaming device for example it may be part of a central determination host system which provides random game outcomes to the game program. Finally EGM processor board under control of the game program and OS compares the outcome to an award schedule. The set of possible game outcomes may include a subset of outcomes related to the triggering and play of a feature or bonus game. In the event the displayed outcome is a member of this subset EGM processor board under control of the game program and by way of I O Board may cause feature game play to be presented on the primary game display and or any legacy secondary display s .

Video content and predetermined payout amounts for certain outcomes including feature game outcomes are stored as part of the game program. Such payout amounts are in response to instructions from processor board provided to the player in the form of coins credits or currency via I O board and a pay mechanism which may be one or more of a credit meter a coin hopper a voucher printer an electronic funds transfer protocol or any other payout means known or developed in the art.

In various embodiments game programs including video content for the plural displays are stored in a memory device not shown connected to or mounted on the gaming motherboard. By way of example but not by limitation such memory devices include external memory devices hard drives CD ROMs DVDs and flash memory cards. The memory device includes game programs for at least a base game including any associated bonus games. In an embodiment as described below the memory may also include a feature program.

The gaming device may access the remote storage device via a network connection including but not limited to a local area network connection a TCP IP connection a wireless connection or any other means for operatively networking components together. Optionally other data including graphics sound files and other media data for use with the gaming device are stored in the same or a separate memory device not shown . Some or all of the game programs and its associated data may be loaded from one memory device into another for example from flash memory to random access memory RAM .

In one or more embodiments peripherals may be connected to the system over Ethernet connections directly to the appropriate server or tied to the system controller inside the gaming terminal using USB serial or Ethernet connections. Each of the respective devices may have upgrades to their firmware utilizing these connections.

GMU Game Monitoring Unit includes an integrated circuit board and GMU processor and memory including coding for network communications such as the G2S game to system protocol from the Gaming Standards Association Las Vegas Nev. used for system communications over the network. As shown GMU may connect to the card reader through bus and may thereby obtain player information and transmit the information over the network through bus . Gaming activity information may be transferred by the EGM Processor Board to GMU where the information may be translated into a network protocol such as S2S for transmission to a server such as a player tracking server where information about a player s playing activity may be stored in a designated server database.

PIB includes an integrated circuit board PID processor and memory which includes an operating system such as Windows CE a player interface program which may be executable by the PID processor together with various input output I O drivers for respective devices which connect to PID such as player tracking module and which may further include various games or game components playable on PID or playable on a connected network server and PID is operable as the player interface. PID connects to card reader through bus player tracking display through video decoder and bus such as an LVDS or VGA bus.

As part of its programming the PID processor executes coding to drive player tracking display and provide messages and information to a player. Touch screen circuitry interactively connects PTM display and video decoder to PID such that a player may input information and causes the information to be transmitted to PID either on the player s initiative or responsive to a query by PID . Additionally soft keys connect through bus to PID and operate together with the player tracking display to provide information or queries to a player and receive responses or queries from the player. PID in turn communicates over the CMS SMS network through Ethernet switch and busses and with respective servers such as a player tracking server.

PTMs are linked into the virtual private network of the system components in gaming device . The system components include the player tacking module e.g. Bally iVIEW device iView is a registered trademark of Bally Gaming Inc. processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board . These system components may connect over a network to the slot management system such as a commercially available Bally SDS SMS and or casino management system such as a commercially available Bally CMP CMS .

The GMU system component has a connection to the base game through a serial SAS connection and is connected to various servers using for example HTTPs over Ethernet. Through this connection firmware media operating system software gaming machine configurations can be downloaded to the system components from the servers. This data is authenticated prior to installation on the system components.

The system components include the PTM processing board and game monitoring unit GMU . The GMU and PTM can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally GTM iVIEW device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iVIEW display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

The PTM may also interface with a switcher and router device of the type described in U.S. Pub. App. 2009 0149253 entitled Video Switcher and Touch Router Method for a Gaming Machine filed Jan. 8 2009 and incorporated by reference. Instead of providing the PTM display the switcher and router device e.g. DM provides for the content normally display at the PTM display to be displayed at and share display real estate with one or more of the primary or secondary displays .

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of gaming terminal processor board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of an operating system layer such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel executes at the user level of the operating system layer and itself contains a major component called the I O board server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O board server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system layer s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system layer and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system layer which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library routines and I O board server or between library routines and certain drivers in operating system layer . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating board server layer is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an industry standard EGM processing board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O board server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional game application API as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The game event log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in manager and cash out manager call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Thus where the progressive is a WAN based progressive the progressive controller may be incorporated into the progressive manager . Event manager is generic like game event log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. Random number generator manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O board server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O board server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM manager thread within I O board server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O board server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O board server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

According to the present invention a progressive jackpot pool P is provided. Preferably the progressive jackpot pool P is a jackpot which is funded from the wagers of the base game such as by assigning a percentage of each qualifying base game wager to the jackpot. It should be understood that the progressive jackpot pool could be funded additionally or alternatively from other sources such marketing dollars i.e. from the provider s revenue third party funding or a combination of several of the foregoing sources. As but an example a casino enterprise may provide initial funding for a progressive jackpot pool P from marketing dollars and then progress the jackpot with both marketing and a share of the wagers from qualifying gaming devices . The progressive jackpot pool P preferably has a starting or minimum value V. The progressive jackpot pool P may also have a maximum value Vor alternative will simply grow until won. As an example for purposes of explanation only Vmay be 10 and Vmay be 20. Where a percentage of the wagers are used to aggregate the jackpot pool P this percentage may include amounts necessary to seed the starting value e.g. 10 for the next jackpot pool P.

The progressive pool may also be a virtual value such as credits where the underlying play is not P2P i.e. play for fun and not money. This virtual pool could be increased based upon for example the amount of play a percentage of virtual value wagered time advertising impressions delivered or the like.

The progressive jackpot pool P may be a standalone progressive. This type of progressive is confined to a single gaming device . The progressive jackpot pool P may be a LAN local area network based progressive played among one or several banks of gaming devices . For example a LAN based progressive may link ten gaming devices together to contribute to the progressive and to play for the progressive. A LAN based progressive typically includes a processor controlled local jackpot controller for example a progressive jackpot controller installed in the cabinet of one of the linked gaming devices which amasses the progressive jackpot pool P determines when an award of at least a portion of the jackpot is triggered and determines the jackpot value PV to be awarded. Cava US Pub App 2009 0117972 published May 7 2009 and titled Systems and or Methods for Distributing Bonus Rewards Based on Accumulated Gaming Device Wins the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference discloses a LAN based jackpot controller. The progressive jackpot pool P may also be a WAN wide area based progressive for example linking all or many of the gaming devices across one or more casino floors. Acres et al U.S. Reissued patent RE38 812 incorporated by reference discloses an example of a WAN based sometimes referred to herein as a systems based progressive jackpot. For a wager funded progressive it can be appreciated that LAN and WAN based progressives grow faster and if a trigger is so designed to a large V. Where the system is for example operated in an Internet environment participating devices can be identified and linked to the progressive.

All or a portion of the progressive jackpot pool P is awarded upon satisfaction of a trigger condition. The trigger condition may be predefined randomly defined or pseudo randomly defined. According to the present invention and since the progressive prize is a mystery prize the trigger is not satisfied by any symbol combination on the base game. While base game symbol driven progressive jackpots are well known inclusion of such progressives must be accounted for in the base game math. Thus such progressive jackpots cannot be added to base games without 1 reconfiguring the base game to account for the odds of a symbol combination triggering the progressive and the theoretical payout or 2 requiring a separate progressive jackpot wager. Where the underlying games are played on a free entertainment only basis reconfiguration of the base games is not required since there is there is no financial risk to the host associated with the free play.

Preferably the progressive jackpot trigger according to the present invention may be any mystery trigger condition. For example the trigger condition may be an nth coin in trigger where when the contributions cause the progressive jackpot to achieve a random trigger value the jackpot is awarded. Acres et al U.S. Reissued patent RE38 812 incorporated by reference discloses such as type of trigger. The trigger may also be arranged to be a virtual lottery such as described in Olive U.S. Pat. No. 7 108 603 issued Sep. 19 2006 and titled Slot Machine Game and System with Improved Jackpot Feature and Torango U.S. Pat. No. 6 592 460 issued Jul. 15 2003 and titled Progressive Wagering System the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.

The trigger may also be a random trigger where the odds of the trigger occurring increase from a minimum at V odds still greater than 0 toward unity as the progressive jackpot P VIn this fashion the trigger is guaranteed to occur at a jackpot P value not greater than V. and the Appendix attached hereto and incorporated by reference described below sets forth such a trigger.

According to the present invention the game CPU and or progressive jackpot controller is are configured to accrue the progressive jackpot pool P and to provide a mystery jackpot trigger. The progressive jackpot controller may be of the type described above and where a WAN based progressive controller may be included in the progressive server .

Turning to the operation of an embodiment of the present invention will be described in connection. At the player plays the base game by making value wagers P2P gaming or by wagering fictitious credits. Based upon the wagers at a percentage of the value is allocated to a progressive jackpot pool P. As stated above the progressive jackpot pool P may have at least a minimum value V. In the example given above V 10. At the then current progressive jackpot value may be displayed at for example the secondary display or where the progressive is a systems controlled jackpot at the PTM display or in a window created at the primary display . Preferably however the pool value in currency is not displayed inasmuch as the present invention as configured may award more or less than a displayed jackpot value. There may be displayed a range of awards such as a message Win a Progressive Jackpot Between 10 and 20 . At a determination is made if a feature trigger condition is satisfied. If not the progressive is not triggered and play of the base game at continues. If at the progressive jackpot is triggered at the game CPU and or progressive controller determines the then current progressive jackpot value PV. In this example PV may be 17.32. At a number of feature free plays is determined based upon PV EV where EV is the expected value of a free game play. Expected Value EV wager expected theoretical win expected loss . For example if a player were to wager 1 on the flipping of a coin where each side heads or tails has theoretical odds of 50 0.5 of occurring and if the player were awarded 1 for each winning bet and would lose the 1 bet for a losing wager the EV would be as follows 1 0.5 1 0.5 1 1.0

In an embodiment the free play feature described herein may only be available where the player makes a required level of wager e.g. a maximum base game wager of 1. If the player wagers 0.50 for the base game they would not be eligible for the feature. Alternatively the player may be required to make one or both of a maximum wager or separate wager in the base game to be eligible for the feature. Thus in this example where PV is 17.32 and EV 1 the player would be awarded 17.32 free plays. The fractional remainder R of 0.32 free plays may be handled by one or more techniques. In one embodiment R is ignored and only the integer component amount of the free spins 17 in this example is awarded. The number of free games can thus be rounded off to a nearest integer either up or down . At one or more of the game CPU and or progressive controller controls the primary display or display free plays of a feature game. The feature game may be a spinning reel slot machine game roulette type of game a spinning wheel a flip a coin game a pick a hidden prize game or other type of game resulting in outcomes. The feature game may be free plays of the base game or may be free plays of a different game or a combination of the two. For example where PV 17.32 and the base game has an EV of 0.9 the number of free plays would be calculated based upon the base game EV. Where there is a different game having an EV of 1 a first portion of the PV for example 10 may be free plays of the base game and the remaining 7.32 as free plays of the different game. In an embodiment the free plays are displayed serially one after the other but in another embodiment all or a portion of the free plays may be displayed simultaneously to increase the speed of play of the free game feature e.g. 17 hands of stud poker displayed simultaneously.

Each feature free play results in an outcome. In an embodiment each outcome may one of a losing or winning outcome. Winning outcomes may have various awards such as in a slot machine game or each winning award may have the same award value. In another embodiment each free play may result in a winning outcome whose values have a range so long as for each free play the EV is substantially equal to the desired EV. In this regard it should be noted that EV can have some variance from the target EV in this example 1 . For example EV used in the calculation may be 1 as in the example given but the true EV may be 0.98 or 1.02.

At any awards from the feature free plays are awarded to the player. A meter at the gaming device displays the awards. A free play meter may also be provided to display to the player the number of free plays awarded and to decrement the number as free plays are conducted. When all free plays have been concluded the feature is ended and the process returns to the player playing the base game.

Because the EV is used to determine the number of free plays theoretically the player should be awarded the full value of PV through the feature. In reality the player may win more or less than PV during the free play session. If the player wins more that amount is awarded to the player and is deducted from the progressive pool P. If the player wins less than PV and surplus is retained in the progressive jackpot pool P.

As can be appreciated the process illustrated in and described above accounts for any fractional remainder R from the determination PV EV. Further the expected amount of the progressive jackpot PV is awarded through the series of feature free plays. However as stated above since the number of feature free plays has expected values theoretically determined it can be seen the player may receive more or less than PV during the feature free plays. In the example given above where PV is 17.32 the player may actually win 19.00 or 16.50 depending upon the outcomes and awards from the feature free play games. But theoretically over numerous plays of the feature the sum of the awards should be substantially equal to the PV.

As stated above the features of the present invention may be incorporated and used in connection with P2P games. Also for novelty or entertainment only style games the features may also be used where virtual valueless credits may be wagered and virtual valueless awards given.

Turning to the Appendix and an example of a mystery jackpot trigger according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown. At the operator for the progressive jackpot selects the values of V Vand r where Vis the minimum value of the jackpot pool such as the rest value after the progressive pool has been won Vis the desired maximum value of the pool by which the award must be issued and r is the pool contribution percentage from each wager w in the contributing base games. For example Vmay be 10 Vmay be 20 and r may be 2 . These numbers as from the example above. It should be understood that the values may be much higher where for example the trigger is used for a WAN based progressive having dozens if not hundreds of contributing gaming machines. At one or more of the game CPU and progressive controller monitors the wagers w at the contributing gaming devices and contributes rw e.g. 0.02w in the example to the pool and at the new pool value PV is calculated for each contribution rw. Thus as each contribution rw is received from the Appendix at the new probability of triggering winning the progressive is determined from the function f x . As shown in the graph of f x leads to an arrangement where the probabilities for triggering the jackpot increase from a small value 0 to 1 as the pool increments toward V. Should the pool reach Vthe probabilities are 1 and the jackpot must be triggered when the last contribution of rw is contributed. After determining the probabilities f x as each contribution is received at one or more of the CPU and progressive controller randomly selects a number z where 0 z

Regardless of the mystery trigger mechanism upon a trigger condition either the gaming device whose contribution caused the trigger is selected to receive the bonus or a recipient selection may take place. In the example above where a contribution results in Z f x that gaming device would be triggered into the feature. Alternatively when a trigger condition is detected a gaming device to receive the feature may be for example randomly selected from participating and qualifying gaming devices .
