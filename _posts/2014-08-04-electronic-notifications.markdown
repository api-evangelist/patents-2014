This disclosure generally relates to evaluating electronic notifications for a user of a social network.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Particular embodiments of this disclosure relate to determining whether to send a user of a social network a notification about the social network. Whether to send a notification may be determined by scoring each of one or more notifications based on whether the user is likely to interact with the social network if the notification is provided to the user. The interaction may be any interaction may be a specific interaction and or may be an interaction related to information in the notification. In addition to the score a decision to send any or no notification may depend on any suitable factors such as a prediction of the likelihood of a user unsubscribing to notifications due to the notification and or the length of time since a previous notification was sent to the user. A threshold may be associated with each factor and the threshold and each factor may vary based on any suitable information such as user demographics or other suitable information a user s previous social network activity as a function of time the content of the notification the user s relationships in a social network or any suitable combination thereof. Not sending a notification may itself be scored along with the candidate notifications.

In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more webpages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a webpage which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. check in causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. a check in type edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship including e.g. liking etc. follower relationship visitor relationship including e.g. accessing viewing checking in sharing etc. subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to an edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of an observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.

A user of a social network may receive notifications that describe the social network users of the social network activity on the social network changes to the social network suggestions related to the social network and the like. For example a notification may describe activity relevant to the user such as that a friend on the social network has posted a picture or has liked one of the user s posts. As another example notifications may describe one or more users who have viewed a profile page created or posted content interacted with content been tagged in images joined groups are listed as attending or confirmed attendance at events checked in at locations liked particular content created pages or any other activity related to the social network. Notifications may take any suitable form such as an email a push notification or short message service message. In particular embodiments notifications may relate to activity persons concepts or relationships that a user has a relatively higher affinity for. For example a notification may describe activity by the friends that a user interacts most often with.

Notifications may describe discrete activities or may describe multiple activities. For example a notification may describe that a user has received one friend request or that a user has received multiple friend requests. In either example the notification may or may not include an identification of all or some of the requesting individuals. A notification may describe one type of information related to the social network or may describe multiple types of information. For example one notification may identify friend requests while another notification identifies users that have interacted with content that the user receiving the notification has posted while yet another notification may describe photos that the user has been tagged in. Those previous examples describe notifications that describe one type of information related to the social network. In contrast a notification may describe that a user has friends requests and that a user has been tagged in a photo or other suitable combination of types of information describing activity persons concepts or relationships of the social network. In particular embodiments and as described more fully herein a notification may be scored based on the number and kind of events or information that the notification includes. Whether to aggregate or separate information in a notification may be determined based on any suitable information including any suitable information used to score a notification as described more fully herein. Notifications may be sent according to the user s privacy settings and the content of the notifications may be determined based on one or more other users privacy settings. For example another user s activity may or may not appear in a notification based on that user s privacy settings.

A user may respond to a notification in a number of different ways. For example if the notification includes an interactive element such as a link to social network content the user may select the link. As another example the user may view the notification and at some later time interact with the social network as a result of the notification. For example a user who sees a notification that a friend has posted content may view the content may view the friend s profile or may recall that he needs to respond to an invitation to a party that the friend is going to and reply to that invitation. In each example the notification may be the event that spurred the user to interact with the social network. In some of the examples the interaction may relate to the information described in the notification. In other examples the interaction may be any interaction with the social network.

A user may respond to a notification by doing nothing. At times a user may respond negatively to a notification. For example the user may unsubscribe to future notifications may suspend or cancel their social network account or may be annoyed by the notification and be less likely to interact with the social network.

At step a score is determined for each notification accessed. The score represents an estimate of whether a user interaction will result if the notification is provided to the user. For example the estimate may be a probability. As another example an estimate may be a range of probabilities such as for example 50 75 . This disclosure contemplates any suitable expression for an estimate of whether a user interaction will result if the notification is provided to the user. In particular embodiments the user interaction may be any interaction with the social network. In other words the score estimates whether the user will have any interaction with the social network or may estimate whether the user will have particular interactions with the social network. In particular embodiments the user interaction may be related to the content of the notification. In other words the user interaction with the social network may be an interaction that with a portion of the social network that the notification describes or identifies. For example in particular embodiments a user interaction may be any interaction related to a user identified in the notification such as visiting a profile of a user that a notification describes as tagging the user receiving the notification in a photo. In particular embodiments a user interaction may be closely tailored to the content in the notification. For example for a notification that describes a friend request the user interaction may be responding to that specific friend request. In particular embodiments step may include determining whether a user interaction will result within a predetermined time period of providing the user with the notification or of the user viewing the notification. For example step may include determining a score estimating whether a user interaction will occur within one day from when the user is provided with the notification. In particular embodiments step may include determining whether a user interaction will result if the notification is sent at the current time within a predetermined time period or at a specific future time. In particular embodiments a score may be associated with sending a notification at each or any suitable current or future time.

A score for a notification may be determined based on any suitable information. For example a user may be more likely to respond to a notification if they have not received a notification in a predetermined period of time or if they have not interacted with the social network or engaged in a specific interaction with the social network for a predetermined period of time. In particular embodiments the score may be based on demographic information about the user for whom the notification is being scored. Example demographic information may include the user s age gender residence sex and any other suitable demographic including those described more fully herein. In particular embodiments the score may be based on one or more previous interactions between the user and the social network. For example a notification that describes an activity that the user frequently or recently engages in or a user or concept that the user frequently or recently interacted with may receive a relatively higher score. As another example a user that interacts frequently with a social network may be more receptive in general to notifications about the network. As another example the type of interaction such as liking photos in which a user has been tagged may indicate that a notification that describes a photo in which the user was tagged should receive a higher score. In particular embodiments the score may be based on a previous interaction that occurred within a predetermined time after a previous notification was sent to the user. For example if the user has in the past accessed content that was referenced in a notification with 2 hours of being sent the notification a notification with similar content or identifying a user that generated the content may receive a relatively high score. As another example if a user regularly views photos from particular friends shortly after receiving a notification that those photos have posted then the a notification describing that photos have posted from that friend or from any connection may receive a relatively higher score. In particular embodiments previous interactions may be relevant to a score based on the length of time since the previous interaction the frequency of the previous interaction the time of the interaction the user s characteristics such as e.g. location during the interaction characteristics of one or more other users that the user interacted with or that generate or were referenced in content that the user interacted with or the like. In particular embodiments the score may be based on the time of day a timezone a user is in the user s location e.g. as determined by GPS cell phone signal strength the kind of communication a user s mobile device is using e.g. via a WiFi network via communication with a cellular telephone network etc. whether the user s mobile device is powered on or off the amount of power remaining on the user s mobile device or any suitable combination thereof. In particular embodiments the score may be based on one or more devices that the user may receive the notification at such as a mobile device or a desktop computer. In particular embodiments the score may be based on how the notification is communicated to a user s device. For example the score may be based on whether the notification will be sent via one or more a text message a push notification an email or any other suitable communication method. in particular embodiments the score may be based on explicit user preferences. While this disclosure describes specific examples of what the score may be based on this disclose contemplates basing the score on any suitable criteria including any suitable combination of the examples described above and or below.

In particular embodiments a score may be based at least in part on a relationship between the user and another user or content that the notification identifies. For example a user may have a first degree connection to another user e.g. an edge connecting the two respective user nodes in the graph and notifications regarding that other user may receive a relatively higher score. As another example a relatively closer relationship between content and the user in the social graph may result in a relatively higher score for a notification that includes or identifies the content compared to a notification that references content that the user has a relatively more remote relationship with or no relationship with. This disclosure contemplates any suitable relationships and any suitable measure for evaluating the strength of a relationship including the disclosure herein regarding affinity coefficient and relationships.

In particular embodiments a score may be based at least in part on the information about the notification itself. Such information may include the type of notification the amount of content in the notification the amount of detail in the notification the time the notification is provided to the user the activity users concepts or relationships referenced in the notification or any other suitable information about the notification or that the notification includes. For example a user s affinity for information referred to in a notification may be used to score the notification.

At step an action to take with respect to the notifications is determined with the determination being based at least in part on the scores. For example the highest scoring notification may be selected and provided to the user. In particular embodiments step may include determining an action to take based both on the scores and on an elapsed time since a previous electronic notification was provided to the user. For example a user that has been sent a notification within the past hour or day may be less likely to respond positively to another notification and thus the relatively short elapsed time since the previous notification may weigh against providing a notification that even scores relatively highly. In particular embodiments the score and the elapsed time may be separate variables that are used to determine the action to take. In particular embodiments a score may be a function of elapsed time. For example in particular embodiments the score may increase as any suitable function of elapsed time. As indicated by these examples in particular embodiments the action to take may include selecting a notification to provide to a user may include selecting notifications to evaluate again at a later time or may include deciding that no notifications should be sent at the moment or for a predetermined time period. In particular embodiments not sending a notification may itself be scored and compared to the scores for the notifications. If the score associated with not sending a notification is the highest score or exceeds a threshold then not sending a notification may be the action taken.

In particular embodiments the action to take may be determined at least by the score and by a value estimating whether the user will unsubscribe to future notifications if one of the notifications being scored is provided to the user. The value may be determined based on any suitable information such as the user s characteristics characteristics of users or concepts that the notification relates to the user s past interactions with the social network the user s relationships or affinities an elapsed time since a notification was sent the user s past response to previous notifications the notification itself and the information about the social network that it communicates or any other suitable combination thereof. For example if a user has previously unsubscribed to notifications sent in a certain format e.g. via text message or within a certain time period after a certain kind of notification then similar notifications may have a relatively higher chance of causing the user to unsubscribe to future notifications. This disclose contemplates determining the value based on any of the suitable information that may be used to determine the score as described more fully herein.

In particular embodiments the action to take may be determined based on the score the elapsed time and the value estimating whether a user is likely to unsubscribe to future notifications. In particular embodiments a threshold may be associated with each of those variables and each notification may be evaluated based on comparing the variable to its appropriate threshold. This disclosure contemplates any suitable algorithm for determining an action to take with respect to one or more notifications. For example in particular embodiments a notification may be provided to a user if at least one of the notifications satisfies score OR elapsed time AND value

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates an example method for evaluating notification for a user of a social network including the particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable method for evaluating notification for a user of a social network including any suitable steps which may include all some or none of the steps of the method of where appropriate. Furthermore although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

As described more fully herein in particular embodiments an action to be taken with respect to one or more notifications may be based on a score estimating whether a user will interact with a social network if the user is provided the notification. A user interaction may be inferred to be caused by or related to the notification by for example attributing any interaction to a notification if that interaction occurs within a predetermined time period of the user being provided with or viewing the notification. In particular embodiments the interaction may be attributed only if it has some relationship to the information provided in the notification. In particular embodiments a notification may include an interactive element through which a user can initiate an interaction with the social network. In those embodiments attributing an interaction to a notification may be more readily measurable but may not attribute all interactions such as when the user views the notification and simply accesses the social network through a channel other than by interacting with the notification. In particular embodiments step of the example method illustrated by may include determining an action based on the score and on a value estimating the likelihood of a user interacting with an interactive element on a notification. As for the score in particular embodiments that value may be based on any suitable information about the user the user s relationships or any other information describing the user s social context. In particular embodiments the score and the value may be combined and compared to a single threshold. For example the score and the value may be weighted or non weighted and may be combined linearly or non linearly. In particular embodiments the score and the value may be compared to separate thresholds and the determination may be based on either or both those variables exceeding their respective thresholds.

In particular embodiments a user s interaction with a social network may be observed and used to improve the notifications sent to the user and or the determination of whether to send a notification to the user. For example user s interactions with a social network may be observed attribute to one or more notifications as described more fully herein and input into one or more machine learning models. This disclosure contemplates any suitable machine learning model such as a linear model non linear model a decision tree model e.g. a boosted decision tree logistic regression or any suitable combination thereof. A user s interaction may be given Boolean values e.g. indicating that they user did or did not interact with the social network or may have more values e.g. an interaction gets higher score when the interaction is liking a post specifically referenced in a notification rather than simply logging in to the social network . Training of machine learning models may be on any suitable schedule. For example training may be performed daily and may be based on any suitable set of data such as for example a sample of the user s behavior over the last week month or year. In particular embodiments more recent interactions may be given a relatively higher weight than less recent interactions.
