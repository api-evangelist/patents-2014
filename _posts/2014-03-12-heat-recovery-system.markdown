title: Heat recovery system
abstract: A system for the recovery of heat from gases. A heat recovery system uses a wetted heat transfer surface to recover heat from a bulk gas, such as a flue gas. The system utilizes wetted heat transfer tubes which are sprayed in a manner to minimize the film thickness of the wetting on the heat transfer tubes. To improve efficiency, the contact liquid used to wet the heat transfer tubes is maintained at a temperature between the temperature of the exiting cooled gas and the temperature of the inlet (cool) process fluid to be heated. Such heat recovery system design criteria enhance performance, and thus enable more efficient heat recovery to be practiced, particularly in systems where combustion gases are encountered.

This application claims priority from prior U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 777 706 filed Mar. 12 2013 entitled HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEM the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety including the specification drawing and claims by this reference.

The patent owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This application relates to systems and methods for the design construction and operation of apparatus for the recovery of heat and the transfer of the heat to a process fluid while using a wetted heat transfer surface such as when condensing water vapor from a hot gas stream.

Various methods and structures have been provided for recovery of waste heat from gas streams. However in so far as is known to me various conventional heat recovery systems have generally not optimized the recovery of heat available from the incoming gas stream. For example traditional prior art indirect coil economizers are relatively inefficient. And prior art condensing systems for combustion gas streams have not optimized various process elements. Thus it would be advantageous if a heat recovery system were provided that enabled use of a much higher overall heat transfer coefficient than is presently found in prior art devices such as a standard dry coil economizer.

A novel heat recovery system design has been developed and is disclosed herein. The heat recovery system includes a containment chamber or other process vessel which houses a heat exchanger in which cold process liquid to be heated is flowingly contained. In an embodiment the heat exchanger may be provided in the form of a coil or tube bundle having a plurality of heat exchange tubes therein. In an embodiment the tubes in the heat exchanger may be oriented generally horizontally. The process liquid to be heated may be input to the heat exchanger at the upper reaches thereof for processing in a downward flow configuration. In an embodiment an incoming hot gas which in an embodiment has condensable vapors therein is routed in an upflow configuration which is counter current with respect to the process liquid in the heat exchanger. A portion of contact liquid where the contact liquid may include at least a portion of liquids condensed from condensable vapors in a hot bulk gas is recirculated from a lower reservoir through a pre cooler which adjusts the temperature of the contact liquid downward to the outer surface of the heat exchanger. The cooling of the contact liquid ensures that a temperature gradient from cold contact fluid at the top to hot contact fluid at the bottom is maintained from top to bottom over the heat exchanger. After cooling the contact fluid is sprayed on the outer surface of the heat exchanger. By wetting the outer surface of the heat exchanger but minimizing the thickness of the liquid film on the outer surface of the heat exchanger heat transfer is optimized. Also in an embodiment the contact liquid flows in the same downward direction as the process fluid to be heated to provide an optimal temperature gradient for heat transfer with respect to up flowing hot bulk gas. The contact liquid is collected in the liquid reservoir below the heat exchanger is normally at the saturation temperature of the hot gas entering system. In general by wetting the exterior surface of the heat transfer coil and by managing the thickness of the resulting liquid film of contact liquid on the outside of the heat transfer coil to keep the liquid film as thin as possible it has been found possible to reduce the overall resistance to heat transfer by converting the outside heat transfer coefficient from a convective heat transfer limited mechanism to a condensing heat transfer mechanism.

In an embodiment an innovative condensing heat recovery system is provided in a dual countercurrent flow design. In various embodiments the heat recovery system may be provided in an dual operating mode wherein the water to be heated is contained within the heat transfer coils and does not directly contact the hot gas stream but wherein the contact liquid wets the outer surface of the heat exchanger so that the contact liquid directly contacts the incoming gas stream.

The foregoing figures being merely exemplary contain various elements that may be present or omitted from actual systems that may be constructed or methods that may be implemented for design and operation of a system to recover heat while in part condensing a fluid from a hot gas or to various configurations for installation thereof or to methods for use thereof. An attempt has been made to draw the figures in a way that illustrates at least those elements that are significant for an understanding of the components of an embodiment for a useful condensing heat recovery system for capturing heat from an incoming hot gas stream and heating a process fluid such as water.

Various other elements of the exemplary heat recovery systems or for the design installation and use of the same may be utilized in order to provide a useful reliable and efficient condensing heat recovery system according to the concepts disclosed herein.

A novel condensing heat recovery system has been developed. In various embodiments such a system provides a tremendous upgrade in performance especially when compared to a traditional prior art indirect coil economizer. The condensing heat recovery system described herein unique due to use of a dual countercurrent flow pattern wherein both a a contact liquid e.g. recirculated condensate and b process fluid e.g. a cold process water stream to be heated move countercurrent to incoming hot gas e.g. a hot exhaust gas containing water vapor . In an embodiment such a design may hereinafter be identified using the term Dual Countercurrent Flow or DCF heat recovery system. It has been found that a Dual Countercurrent Coil condensing heat recovery system as described herein provides an improvement in the art and for example has a much higher overall heat transfer coefficient than a standard dry coil type economizer.

In the DCF heat recovery system design a contact liquid flows in the same direction as the bulk process liquid to be heated to insure that an optimum temperature gradient is developed for heat transfer. In an embodiment as depicted in such direction is downward. In such case the contact liquid collected in the reservoir below the heat exchanger is at or very near the saturation temperature of the gas entering the heat exchanger. In an embodiment the contact liquid is cooled prior to being sprayed over the heat exchanger which ensures that a selected temperature gradient is maintained from bottom to top over the heat exchanger.

By wetting the exterior surface of the heat transfer coil and providing a spray system to manage the thickness of the resulting liquid film in order to provide a liquid film thickness profile which is as thin as possible the thermal heat resistance is minimized through the liquid film adjacent the metal heat transfer surface. In effect maintenance of a thin liquid film thickness profile of the contact liquid converts the outside heat transfer coefficient the coefficient through the thin liquid film between the metal heat transfer surface and the incoming hot bulk gas from a convective heat transfer mechanism to a condensing heat transfer mechanism.

At entry to the heat transfer system the incoming hot bulk gas stream is initially saturated with vapor by way of contact with contact liquid. This is accomplished through adiabatic cooling by using a spray header to spray a portion of contact liquid from the reservoir into the incoming hot bulk gas. This process converts sensible heat to latent heat in the hot bulk gas stream. In the process the temperature of the hot bulk gas is reduced and the humidity of the hot bulk gas increases while the enthalpy of the hot bulk gas stream remains constant. To obtain optimum results the incoming gas should be saturated with vapor and the heat exchanger which may be provided in the form of a bundle of horizontally disposed tubes must be wetted with a thin film of contact liquid in order to obtain a condensing heat transfer coefficient on the outer surface of the heat exchanger. If the hot bulk gas is not saturated with vapor such as by way of direct contact spray using a spray header and spraying the incoming hot bulk gas with contact liquid then the thin liquid film which is wetting the outer surface of the heat exchanger will evaporate into the hot bulk gas stream.

In an embodiment some of the unique characteristics of the novel heat recovery system described herein include 

In an embodiment the hot bulk gas flows upward around the heat exchanger which may be provided in the form of a tube bundle. In an embodiment the tubes of the heat exchanger may be oriented horizontally which is nominally perpendicular to the direction of flow of the hot bulk gas which is being cooled. The bulk process liquid flows inside the heat exchanger and in an embodiment when using tubes may serpentine downward from top to bottom. The contact liquid may be sprayed over the outer surface of the heat exchanger for example wetting the outer surface of the tubes with a very thin liquid film. The contact liquid flows downward from the upper tubes progressively dripping down from the upper tubes toward the lower tubes. In an embodiment such a configuration provides for flow of contact liquid that is countercurrent to the flow of the gas stream and which is driven by gravity. In various embodiments the path of flow of the gas stream may be configured or controlled to enter the heat exchanger section of one or more containment chambers with a generally vertical orientation with minimal residual horizontal component of gas flow.

Attention is directed to which provides an overview of the mechanism for heat transfer for a simplified heat recovery system as described herein. For illustrative purposes only and not by way of limitation the apparatus is depicted as if heat is transferred through a flat plate of metal. Note for example that heat exchangers may be provided in various configurations whether metal tubes coils flat plates or other configurations as will be understood by those of skill in the art. As illustrated in the bulk process liquid to be heated at the right flows downward and hot bulk gas to be cooled flows upward at the left on either side of a heat transfer medium such as a metal plate as shown or alternately for example a tube. Also a contact liquid and accompanying condensate flow will flow downward as a film on the gas side at the left of the heat transfer medium which again as illustrated is a metal plate.

The flow of heat as depicted in is thus from left to right and may be appreciated by reference to the temperature curve where the temperature at five different places is noted with decreasing temperatures from 

As just noted the temperature drop from Tto Tis from the hot bulk gas to the edge of the contact liquid film at the gas contact liquid film interface. The heat transfer in this region includes a combination of convective and condensing heat transfer mechanisms.

The temperature drop from Tto Tis through the contact liquid film from the gas liquid film interface to the outer surface of the heat exchanger. The liquid film is flowing downward along the outer surface of the heat exchanger metal wall. Importantly the contact liquid film is in laminar flow and thus the heat transfer mechanism is mainly conductive through the liquid film.

The temperature drop from Tto Tis through the metal wall of the heat exchanger. Heat transfer through the metal is primarily conductive.

The temperature drop from Tto Tis from the interior surface of the metal wall of the heat exchanger to the bulk of the process liquid. In this region the heat transfer mechanism is convective.

Heat flux through each of the above noted regions is a function of differential temperatures between the noted locations. For example the expression T T T indicates that such delta T is the differential between the temperature at Tas compared to the temperature at T. As used the subscripts indicate specific points in the system as just noted above. Such differential temperatures occur either across a specific distance through a solid or through a laminar fluid where a conductivity heat transfer mechanism is at work expressed as q k X T further discussed below or across an unspecified distance between solid and fluid interface wherein a convective heat transfer mechanism is at work expressed as q h T further discussed below. In any event refer to Appendix A for definitions of various constants and variables.

In the heat recovery system described herein these four 4 differential temperatures as just described above correspond to a series of four 4 resistances. In each of the four cases both the heat transfer flux that is the amount of heat transferred see below and the heat transfer area are constant. Thus the heat transfer q may be expressed at each case as follows 

Equating the above noted thermal resistance for each case to the overall thermal resistance may be done according to the following equations 1 1 1

The individual resistances combine to produce an overall resistance. Thus it can be seen that the highest individual resistance to heat transfer will dominate the overall heat transfer achievable. This is analogous to the situation in a series of electrical resistors where the resistor with the highest resistance will control current flow.

Here 1 h and is where h is a function of Prandtls number and Reynolds number. These items are dependent of the physical conditions of incoming hot gas and the condensing vapor specifically heat capacity thermal conductivity viscosity dry components humidity gas mass flow rate and contact liquid flow rate. The geometry of the heat exchanger whether a coil or other shape and direction of incoming hot gas flow can be manipulated to reduce the resistance in 1 hbut physical characteristics of the gas are fixed the only exception being humidity. The incoming hot gas can be saturated with contact liquid typically this may be carried out adiabatically and this increases the h but reduces inlet gas temperature . The reduction in inlet temperature is overcome by a greater increase in h i.e. reducing resistance 1 h . Increase of contact liquid flow increases h .

Here X k and where liquid thermal conductivity is basically fixed the film thickness controls resistance. The thermal conductivity is dependent on film temperature as constrained by conditions. The thickness of the contact liquid film X is directly proportional to the mass flow rate of the contact liquid.

Here X k and the metal thickness and metal conductivity are fixed. The metal thermal conductivity is dependent on the material and the thickness is dependent on structural requirements.

Here 1 h is where h is a function is Prandtls number and Reynolds number. These items are dependent on the physical conditions of the process liquid heat capacity thermal conductivity viscosity and liquid mass flow rate of the process liquid to be heated.

A number of variables are at work in any given heat recovery system. For a process like that described herein which utilizes a condensing heat transfer a key variable is the heat transfer which occurs across the contact liquid film at which vapors are condensed. Overall the fluid thickness of the contact liquid film has a large impact on the amount of heat transfer which can be accomplished with a particular apparatus. However it appears that in prior art heat recovery systems little or no consideration has been given to the contact liquid flow rates or to the contact liquid film thickness. Thus it appears that other designers of indirect contact condensing heat recovery systems have not appreciated the importance of the thickness of the contact liquid film where condensation of vapors from the bulk gas occurs.

Additionally to ensure that the heat exchanger has a high outer surface condensing heat transfer coefficient as described above the outer surface of the heat exchanger must be thoroughly wetted with contact liquid. In an embodiment such wetting may be accomplished by spraying the outer surface of the heat exchanger. Such contact liquid may be recirculated from a reservoir located below the heat exchanger.

The contact liquid captured in the reservoir is normally at or slightly below the wet bulb temperature of the incoming gas stream. That web bulb temperature is much higher than that of the cool gas stream leaving the heat exchanger. Thus if contact liquid removed from the reservoir is not cooled prior to being sprayed over the heat exchanger and thus into the cool gas stream leaving the heat exchanger then both the temperature and the humidity of the cool gas stream will be increased as it mixes with the spray of contact liquids to the outer surface of the heat exchanger transferring both sensible and latent heat to the cool gas stream. Additionally if the liquid droplets which are sprayed on the heat exchanger were hotter than the outgoing cool gas that is contacting the contract liquid film on the outer surface of the heat exchanger then the thermal driving force would be disrupted.

In order to avoid the possible design difficulties just mentioned above in an embodiment it has been determined that the contact liquid used to wet the outer surface of the heat exchanger as described above should have its temperature maintained between a first temperature at which the process fluid to be heated enters the heat recovery system and a second temperature at which the cool gas stream exits the heat recovery system. In an embodiment such temperature range control is provided with an external heat exchanger normally described as a contact liquid precooler. In so far as I am aware it appears that others have not considered the value of maintaining the temperature within these temperature ranges evidently not appreciating its significance.

In the design of various embodiments for heat recovery systems as described herein it is preferable that the options for various components are thoroughly considered in order to optimize heat transfer actually achieved. Such considerations and options include 

In addition to detailed design with respect to the items just mentioned above in order to optimize a condensing heat recovery system the design should specify how to manage the delivery of contact liquid to the outer surface of the heat exchanger where condensation occurs. Thus considerations in the design of a spray system for the spray of contact liquid may include 

Turning now to a heat recovery system is provided. A hot gas stream is sent to the heat recovery system for removal of heat therefrom and for heating a cold process liquid such as cold process water supply water. In various embodiments the hot gas stream may be from a boiler or from an engine or from a process gas stream in an industrial plant or from any other hot gas source in which condensable vapors are provided within a suitable operational condensing temperature range. Such hot gas may include as primary constituents water vapor carbon dioxide nitrogen and a little oxygen for example in a typical boiler stack application. The hot gas is provided to one or more containment chambers of the heat recovery system through a hot gas conduit . Heat recovery system containment chambers may be fabricated using conventional fabrication techniques in variety of configurations such as in a vertically standing generally parallelepiped shaped structure or in a vessel structure such as a generally cylindrical housing. However any convenient and cost effective shapes may be utilized and any of such equivalent structures may be utilized according to the teachings herein in a method of achieving heat recovery using condensation on heat exchanger in a heat recovery system.

The hot gas stream arrives at the heat recovery system at an inlet located in the lower portion of the heat recovery system containment chambers . The hot gas stream is met with an adiabatic cooling spray delivered by first spray header . The hot gas is adiabatically cooled and humidified by the spray . The incoming path of the hot gas after the spray header is indicated by reference numeral . Below the incoming path of the hot gas is a contact liquid reservoir that acts to contain a pool of condensate. The contact liquid is removed from the reservoir by recirculation pump and sent through a precooler . From the precooler the contact liquid is sent to a second spray header which is the contact surface film control spray header . A plurality of spray nozzles each send a spray which may be provided as selected pattern of cooled contact liquid downward toward an outer surface of heat exchanger .

After entry into heat transfer system containment chamber the hot gas gas turns upward in the direction of reference arrows and enters the contact section where it a passes through spray or droplets of contact liquid and b through the tubes of heat exchanger in counter current fashion with respect to 1 the downwardly falling spray or droplets of contact liquid and 2 the process liquid that is being heated in the heat exchanger . Droplets fall by gravity into the reservoir and are recycled as contact liquid . Excess contact liquid i.e. accumulated condensate may be discharged at exit pipe and sent to a suitable process for use or to a sewer or other appropriate point for discharge in order to maintain a selected level of contact liquid in the reservoir . Since the contact liquid may in an embodiment be substantially made up of clean condensate formed at said thin film and when water is the condensate the water quality of contact liquid may be quite good.

At the upper end of the one or more containment chambers a mist eliminator is provided. The mist eliminator may have a plurality of baffle s such as chevrons or the like to assist in impinging and or intercepting droplets by providing a tortuous gas pathway through which the exiting cooled gas must flow in order to minimize loss of moisture such as droplets via entrainment. A cleaned cool gas stream exits the one or more containment chambers at outlet .

The heat exchanger has an interior fluid passageway see and an outer surface see . The outer surface is wetted with a contact liquid via spray nozzles to establish a thin film of contact liquid on the outer surface . The cold process liquid is provided a first temperature T. The process liquid is passed through the heat exchanger to heat the process liquid while passing the incoming gas stream upward past the outer surface of the heat exchanger is shown by reference arrows in a manner counter current to the direction of flow of the process liquid to cool the incoming gas stream and forming at least some condensate at the thin film to produce a cool gas stream at a second temperature T. In an embodiment the thin film of contact liquid and associated condensate flows in a direction counter current to the upwardly incoming hot bulk gas .

As noted above at least some of the contact liquid from the reservoir is recycled to the spray nozzles . The recycled contact liquid is cooled while in transit between reservoir and spray nozzles to a spray temperature Twhich temperature is between the first temperature Tof the process liquid and a second temperature Tof the cool gas stream .
