In some implementations the location based information can be indexed e.g. an inverse index in the content repositories by geographic location or region such as for example by metropolitan region county town zip code or telephone area code.

The information service block can receive from the mobile device through the wired and or wireless networks preferences and location information e.g. user preferences and user geographic location information. The geographic location information can be provided by the mobile device using GPS or other positioning systems e.g. systems using Wi Fi access points television signals cellular grids or URLs . The geographic location information can be received for example as latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates as a region associated with a Wi Fi access point or as a metropolitan region a county or a town. In some implementations the mobile device pushes geographic location information to the information service block through the wired and or wireless networks .

In some implementations user preferences can define the types of location based information the user of the mobile device wishes to receive. For example the user can choose to receive certain categories of information. Setting preferences for information services is described in more detail with reference to . In some implementations if the user preferences have not been set the information service block can use default settings for the mobile device .

The filter of the information service block can receive as an input user preferences location information and or location based information from the content repositories . In some implementations the filter also receives location based information from content repositories or servers remote to the information service block . The output of the filter and the information service block is categorical information that conforms to the input preferences and that can be location specific based on the input location information. In some implementations the location based information is stored on the mobile device and filtering of the location based information is performed by the mobile device .

In this example a user of the mobile device can choose to receive categorical information corresponding to restaurants hotels movie theaters information and listings sports venues information and schedules and museums . The user can select the types of categorical information to be retrieved by checking the corresponding checkbox for the desired topic. In the example the user has set the preferences for the location based information services by choosing to receive categorical information related only to museums . In some implementations more than one category can be selected or a new category can be input by the user using e.g. the touch sensitive display of the mobile device . In some implementations one or more of the categories shown in can have subcategories that can be selected to further refine the information to be provided to the mobile device. The subcategories can be accessed through menus or other control structures.

In some implementations the user sets the preferences at the time the mobile device is configured or activated. The user can modify the preference settings at a later date. In some implementations the first time a user requests location based information services e.g. by selecting the information services object of the user is presented with the information services selection interface such as the tabbed window in example .

In an implementation automatic updates to the categorical information can be provided to the mobile device . For example if a user selects museums and a new museum opens or updates its content the categorical information provided to the mobile device can be updated automatically to reflect the updated information.

Referring now to an example of user interface that displays graphical objects and representing the locations of items of interest that satisfy a request for categorical information e.g. museums . In an implementation the graphical objects and appear as push pins that are pinned to a map at their corresponding locations. In one implementation the user can define a setting within the mobile device to specify a proximity condition that must be satisfied by an item before a push pin is shown on the map representing an item that satisfies a condition. In an example the proximity condition can specify that the item s location be within a certain radius of the current location of the mobile device in order to be displayed on the map . In some implementations the categorical information can be manually updated in response to a user selection of an update option.

In yet another example the proximity condition can specify that the item s location be within the geographic parameters of the map displayed to the user in order to be displayed on the map . In such an example if the user selects to zoom out the map to display a larger geographical area then multiple other push pins may appear corresponding to locations within the larger geographical area. In another implementation the proximity condition can specify that the graphical objects are displayed and or removed from the map as the displayed map changes to indicate movement of the mobile device .

As mentioned above each pushpin and represents an item that satisfies a condition e.g. a request for categorical information . If the user desires to retrieve information about a particular item represented by a push pin the user can select the push pin and information included in the address book is retrieved and provided to the user. For example in one implementation where the mobile device includes a touch sensitive display e.g. touch sensitive display shown in the user can touch a push pin to select the push pin and the contact information for the item of interest corresponding to the push pin is displayed or otherwise presented to the user e.g. as an audio and or video presentation .

In one implementation a single touch of the push pin e.g. a tap on the touch sensitive display can yield a first result and a sustained touch of the push pin can yield a second result examples of first and second results are described below . In another implementation where a user can interact with the map using a pointing device e.g. a joystick hovering a cursor over the push pin can yield the first result and clicking the push pin can yield the second result.

Referring now to an example of information that can be provided to the user upon selecting a push pin is shown. In this example the user selected the push pin and a first result is displayed. The first result is displayed in an information balloon superimposed on the map . The information balloon includes contact information e.g. the name address and telephone number of the item represented by the push pin . In this example the user tapped on the touch sensitive display in the vicinity of the push pin to yield this first result being the contact information for this particular item.

The configuration of the graphical user interface presenting the information balloon can be configured differently and can include different or more or less information about the item in other implementations.

Another example of selecting a graphical object such as a sustained touch of the push pin can result in an initiation of a telephone call to the contact telephone number presented as the first result. For example a sustained touch of the push pin can result in a telephone call being initiated to item of interest represented by the push pin . In another implementation driving directions can be provided from the current location of the mobile device to the item of interest. In yet another implementation an e mail can be sent to contacts on a buddy list inviting others to meet the user of the mobile device at the item of interest.

In an implementation the data at the information service can be shared with others in accordance with access rights as described above regard to . Other users can retrieve the data from the information service and display the categorical information as graphical objects using another mobile device personal computer set top box gaming device portable video player or portable image viewer.

In an implementation according to e.g. a user selection or system setting data that satisfies the request for categorical information can be manually updated in response to an input. Manual updates can be retrieved from the information service and provided to the mobile device as new or updated information that satisfies the request for categorical information becomes available at the information service .

Optionally at stage the categorical data is updated. For example in response to a user input or a system setting updates to the categorical information can be communicated to or synchronized with the mobile device to update the display shown in the touch sensitive display or the data stored at the information service . The updating synchronization can be automatic or manually initiated by user input.

At stage a responsive collection of categorical information is determined. For example in response to the request made by a user the information service can assemble categorical data responsive to the categorical topic selected by the user in the interface shown in using a system such as shown in .

The categorical information can be uploaded from the mobile device to an information service or the information service can retain a version of the categorical data that is made accessible to others.

At stage a request is received. For example the information service can receive a request from a second user for the collection of categorical information specified by the user of the mobile device . The second user can be authenticated against the access rights set by the user of the mobile device .

At stage the collection of categorical information is provided. For example the requester of the categorical information can receive the collection created by the user of the mobile device at another mobile device personal computer set top video player or image viewer.
