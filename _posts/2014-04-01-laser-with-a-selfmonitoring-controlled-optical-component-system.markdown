The disclosure relates to diagnostic systems and more particularly to systems for self diagnosing or monitoring optical components.

Controlled optical component systems include an optical component such as a mirror that is controlled by an actuator. The actuator may be an electrostrictive actuator which may include a dielectric that changes its shape under application of an applied electric field. A common form of electrostrictive actuator is a piezoelectric actuator. In some applications the electrostrictive actuator may take the form of a piezoelectric stack actuator PZT which is a stack of individual piezoelectric actuators. The purpose of the stack is to magnify the displacement effect of the individual piezoelectric actuator in response to the applied electric field. The mirror may be bonded to the end of the PZT so that it moves when the PZT is actuated.

Such optical component systems may comprise the only moving part of a laser such as a Frequency Addition Source of Optical Radiation FASOR sodium guidestar laser. The optical component systems are used to actively control the laser cavity dimensions.

A problem inherent in such controlled optical component systems is that in the event of a laser system malfunction it is necessary to completely dismantle the controlled optical component system in order to determine the cause of the malfunction. Accordingly there is a need for a self monitoring controlled optical component system that provides an indication of the nature of a malfunction without need of dissembling the controlled optical component system or removing the controlled optical component from the system such as a laser in which it is mounted.

In an embodiment a self monitoring controlled optical component system may include an electrostrictive actuator a capacitor matched in capacitance to the electrostrictive actuator a current source connected to the electrostrictive actuator and to the capacitor that supplies electric current to the electrostrictive actuator and to the capacitor an optical element connected to be moved by the electrostrictive actuator and a comparator connected to receive a first output current from the electrostrictive actuator and a second output current from the capacitor and output a differenced sensoriactuator signal proportional to the difference between the first output current and the second output current the sensoriactuator signal representing a current associated with movement of the optical element by the electrostrictive actuator.

In another embodiment a sodium guidestar laser may include an optical cavity a mirror mounted at an end of the optical cavity a piezoelectric actuator attached to the mirror the mirror and piezoelectric actuator forming a controlled optical component system a capacitor matched to the piezoelectric actuator in capacitance a current source connected to the piezoelectric actuator and to the capacitor that supplies an electric current to the piezoelectric actuator and to the capacitor at a frequency that varies over a pre set frequency range such that the mirror moves when the piezoelectric actuator is actuated by the electric current a comparator connected to receive a first output current from the piezoelectric actuator and a second output current from the capacitor an output of differenced sensoriactuator signal proportional to the difference between the first output current and the second output current the sensoriactuator signal representing a current associated with the piezoelectric actuator moving the mirror and a display device connected to receive the sensoriactuator signal and display a baseline signature and provide a real time transfer function to display the sensoriactuator signal as a transfer curve indicative of a condition of the controlled optical component system.

In yet another embodiment a method for self monitoring a controlled optical component system of a type having an electrostrictive actuator coupled to an optical component may include passing a current from a current source through the electrostrictive actuator and through a capacitor connected to the current source and matched in capacitance to the electrostrictive actuator receiving a first output current from the electrostrictive actuator and a second output current from the capacitor and outputting a differenced sensoriactuator signal proportional to the difference between the first output current and the second output current the sensoriactuator signal representing a current associated with movement of the optical component by the electrostrictive actuator applying a transfer function to the sensoriactuator signal and displaying the sensoriactuator signal as a transfer curve indicative of a condition of the controlled optical component system and comparing the transfer curve to a baseline transfer curve to determine a condition of the controlled optical component system.

Other objects and advantages of the disclosed self monitoring controlled optical component system will be apparent from the following description the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

As shown in in an embodiment the self monitoring controlled optical component system generally designated may include an electrostrictive actuator a capacitor and a current source connected to the electrostrictive actuator and to the capacitor by conductors respectively. An optical element may be connected to be moved by the electrostrictive actuator . A comparator may be connected to receive a first output current from the electrostrictive actuator over conductor and a second output current from the capacitor over conductor . A display may be connected to receive a sensoriactuator signal over conductor from comparator . In an embodiment the capacitor may be matched in capacitance to the electrostrictive actuator . In an embodiment the current source may be an amplifier and in an embodiment may take the form of the power source for the controlled optical component which may consist of the electrostrictive actuator and the optical element .

In an embodiment the comparator may be an operational amplifier and may take the form of a differential amplifier. The comparator may output a differenced sensoriactuator signal that may be proportional to the difference between a first output current from the electrostrictive actuator received by the comparator over conductor and a second output current over conductor received by the comparator from the capacitor . The sensoriactuator signal that is transmitted over conductor may be proportional to the difference between the first output current and the second output current. Accordingly the sensoriactuator signal may represent a current associated only with movement of the optical element by the electrostrictive actuator because the current associated with the inherent capacitance of the electrostrictive actuator is subtracted by the comparator as a result of receiving the output current of the matched capacitor .

As shown in in an embodiment the display device applies a transfer function to display the sensoriactuator signal received over the conductor from the comparator and displays the sensoriactuator signal in real time as a transfer curve indicative of a condition of the optical component system . In an embodiment the transfer curve may be indicative of a condition or health of the controlled optical component . As will be described in greater detail the display shown in generally designated may display a transfer curve representative of a frequency response of the controlled optical component and the display shown in generally designated may display a transfer curve representative of a resonant frequency of the controlled optical component. In an embodiment the current source may provide electric current to the electrostrictive actuator and the capacitor in a pre set pattern.

In an embodiment the pre set pattern may vary in frequency as shown in . In that embodiment the transfer curve shown in the display may show frequency response across a pre set frequency range. In an embodiment the pre set range may be below the resonant frequency of the controlled optical component . In one specific embodiment the pre set frequency range may be between 0 and 40 kilohertz kHz . In an embodiment the transfer curve shown in the display may show frequency response as a rato of voltage input to the electrostrictive actuator over conductor from amplifier to a voltage of the sensoriactuator signal from comparator over conductor plotted against frequency across the preset frequency range.

In another embodiment the pre set pattern may take the form of a square wave shown as in in the display device of . In that embodiment the curve shows the resonant frequency of the electrostrictive actuator and optical element of the controlled optical component . In the embodiment of an error condition may be detected when a spacing between the peaks of the transfer curve changes from a spacing between peaks of a baseline transfer curve such as the transfer curve shown in .

As shown in the electrostrictive actuator may take the form of a piezoelectric actuator. In another embodiment the electrostrictive actuator may take the form of a piezoelectric stack actuator PZT . The optical element may take the form of a mirror and in embodiments the mirror may be selected from a focus mirror a deformable mirror and a tip tilt mirror.

The PZT may be mounted on a holder generally designated that also holds the optical element . As shown in the holder in an embodiment may be received in a static adjustment retainer which in turn is mounted on a bracket . The bracket may be attached to a base . In an embodiment the holder static adjustment retainer PZT electrostrictive actuator and mirror optical element may form part of a laser generally designated which in embodiments may be a FASOR sodium guidestar laser. The mirror optical element may be positioned at an end of the optical cavity of the laser . The mirror optical element may be moved by the PZT to control a length dimension of the optical cavity of the laser .

As shown in the electrostrictive actuator and the capacitor may be connected to ground by conductors respectively. In an embodiment the system may include a first resistor connected on conductor between the electrostrictive actuator and ground and a second resistor on the conductor between the capacitor and ground . In an embodiment the resistors may be low resistance resistors and may be matched in resistance.

In an embodiment a method for monitoring the controlled optical component system which may include a controlled optical component having an electrostrictive actuator coupled to an optical component may include transmitting a direct current from the amplifier through conductors and to the electrostrictive actuator and the matched capacitor and receiving the first output current from the electrostrictive actuator over a conductor and a second output current from the capacitor over conductor by the comparator . The comparator may output a differenced sensoriactuator signal over conductor proportional to the difference between the first output current and the second output current. The sensoriactuator signal transmitted over conductor represents a current associated only with movement of the electrorestrictive actuator and the attached optical element .

The substraction of the current traveling through the electrostrictive actuator by the comparator caused by the current from matched capacitor over conductor removes that portion of the current transmitted over conductor from the electrostrictive actuator . The sensoriactuator signal outputted over conductor in an embodiment may be received by the display device and shown on display as transfer curve A. In this embodiment the display plots the transfer curve A over a pre set frequency range which in the embodiment shown is a sine wave having frequencies between 0 and 40 kHz.

On the ordinate that is the Y axis of the display the values represent a dimensionless ratio of the magnitude of the voltage inputted to the electrostrictive actuator over conductor from amplifier and the sensoriactuator signal transmitted over conductor from comparator . In embodiments the value for the voltage inputted into the electrostrictive actuator may be a stored value in the display device or may be transmitted to the display device from the voltage source over conductor . In the embodiment shown in if an error condition occurs the transfer curve may appear as curve B which may include a peak indicated at C that is not present in curve A. This peak at C may indicate a malfunction or error condition existing with either the electrostrictive actuator the mirror optical component or both. In an embodiment the curve indicated at A may be in the form of a baseline transfer curve that may be developed by performing a first iteration of the aforementioned method.

In the embodiment shown in the display device may display a square wave that results in a transfer curve indicated at D. Transfer curve D may consist of the resonant frequency of the controlled optical component which may consist of the electrostrictive actuator and the optical element as well as the current flowing through the electrostrictive actuator. The curve E represents the current flowing through matched capacitor . The two are differenced and the resulting resonant frequency transfer curve shows the resonant frequency of the electrostrictive actuator and optical component . The curve in display device in may represent a resonant frequency of the controlled optical component functioning normally. A subsequent iteration of the square wave after use of the laser may result in a second curve not shown that may be similar in appearance to the transfer curve except that the peaks may differ in spacing from the peaks shown in curve . Such a difference spacing of peaks may indicate that an error condition exists with the controlled optical component .

With either embodiment the method and system may be used to indicate an error condition existing with a controlled optical component of a type having an electrostrictive actuator coupled to an optical component . This may enable error detection of the electrostrictive actuator and or optical component without the necessity of dissembling the device in which the components are mounted such as the device laser shown in . This in situ self diagnostic method and system may provide a cost saving and time saving system and method for diagnosing malfunctions in controlled optical component systems.

Embodiments of the invention include a health monitoring technique for the only moving part of the sodium guidestar laser. This laser design recently recorded record breaking power and quality of a sodium laser to provide a guidestar for a terrestrial telescope. The guidestar enables the telescope to achieve close to diffraction limited performance without the need for a natural guidestar at or near the target of interest. As the only moving part in the guidestar the piezoceramic actuated mirror is a critical component to both qualify and monitor health and status of. A self sensing technique is described to provide in situ monitoring of the device.

Embodiments of this invention help to assess initial builds of the device for quality and to establish a healthy frequency response for comparison throughout the device lifetime as the piezoceramic actuator in a guidestar is the most likely part to have issues. Embodiments of the present invention provide in situ health monitoring of a critical device that is the least reliable part in a complex system. The present invention does not require an expensive complex optical sensor like an interferometer or a laser vibrometer which would be necessary to get similar quality measurements. These are expensive and require de integration of a part that is buried in the guts of a complex laser system.

While the forms of apparatus herein described constitute preferred embodiments of the disclosed controlled optical component system it is to be understood that the system is not limited to these precise forms of apparatus and that changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention.
