Mobile communication devices may be purchased at service provider retail stores electronics retail stores and or at general retail stores. A variety of activities may be performed to bring a new mobile communication into service. To use a mobile communication device on a cellular network it may first be provisioned and or activated. Provisioning a mobile communication device e.g. a mobile phone to operate on a wireless network involves defining and or adjusting the mobile communication device s settings that are stored in the device and the settings stored on the network so that the mobile communication device may properly access communication services and or execute one or more desired applications and the network may recognize the mobile communication device as authorized to receive service for those applications.

In an embodiment a mobile communication device is disclosed. The mobile device comprises a processor a memory an activation application stored in the memory. When executed by the processor the activation application detects available connection options between the mobile communication device and a network and determines the quality of the available connection options. The activation application also makes a first attempt to complete the activation process over the best quality connection option. If the first attempt is unsuccessful the activation application also makes a second attempt to complete the activation process over the next best quality connection option and completes the activation process on the mobile device over one or more of the connection options wherein the mobile communication device communicates with a provisioning server via the connection to the network.

In an embodiment a method for completing an activation process on a mobile device is disclosed. The method comprises detecting available connection options between the device and a network and determining the quality of the available connection options ranking the available connection options according to quality. The method further comprises making a first attempt to complete the activation process over the first ranked connection option and if the first attempt is unsuccessful making a second attempt to complete the activation process over the second ranked connection option. The method further comprises completing the activation process over one or more of the connection options.

In an embodiment a method for completing an activation process on a mobile device is disclosed. The method comprises detecting available connection options between the device at a network determining the quality of the available connection options and making a first attempt to complete the activation process over the best quality connection option. The method also comprises detecting a request for credentials from the connection presenting an input screen to a user to input the credentials and if the credentials are correct completing the activation process over the best quality connection option. If the first attempt is unsuccessful the method comprises making a second attempt to complete the activation process over the next best quality connection option and completing the activation process over one or more of the connection options.

These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods and systems for completing an activation process on a mobile device. After a mobile device is purchased by a user the activation process may be completed where custom settings and information or customization content may be delivered to or accessed on the mobile device. Customization content may include graphics images audio files splash screens opening screens backgrounds and tones. Customization content may also include customer service numbers links to messaging platforms IP addresses and port numbers client identification and market catalogs. The customization content may be used to complete the activation process on the mobile device where the customization content may be installed downloaded and or otherwise accessed during the activation process. In some cases the activation process may be completed by an application on the mobile device such as an activation application. In some cases the activation process may be initiated when an activation payload is delivered to the mobile device. The activation payload may comprise instructions for completing the activation process.

To download customization content and or an activation payload to a mobile device the mobile device may first establish a connection to a cellular network. An activation application of the mobile device or another communication application may be operable to detect available network connection options or communication channels between the mobile device and the network. The application may also determine the quality of each of the connection options and rank them based on quality. Quality may be defined based on signal strength throughput rate interference and current traffic load for each of the connection options. For example channel quality may be considered higher when the channel signal strength is higher when the channel throughput rate is higher when channel interference is lower and current traffic load on the channel is lower.

In an embodiment the quality of a plurality of alternative available channels may be quantified based on measured and or indicated values of channel signal strength channel throughput rate channel interference and or current traffic load on the channel. The quantification may be determined as a linear combination of the several separate metric values or by some other logical operation. In an embodiment the ranking of quality may be based on such a linear combination of the several separate metric values. In an embodiment the ranking of quality may be determined based on one or two of the metrics and if a tie exists the remaining metrics may be taken into consideration to break the tie.

The application may then attempt to establish a connection to the network using the best connection option wherein if the attempt is unsuccessful the next best option may be attempted. Additionally if a connection option entails the input of credentials such as a security code an authorization code a password a pin or a key to establish the connection the application may provide an input screen to the user without navigating away from or interrupting the activation process. In some cases if a first connection to the network is lost for some reason the application may continue to detect available connection options and attempt to reestablish connection with the network over a different connection. In some cases the activation process may be completed over multiple connections or over multiple connection sessions to the network and may be paused and reinitiated as desired.

In an embodiment the application may attempt to complete the activation process or a portion of the activation process over a channel for a predefined period of time. When the predefined period of time expires the application may attempt to complete the activation process or portion of the activation process over the next best channel again for a predetermined period of time. The application may ultimately time out on the lowest ranked channel and may then retry the highest ranked channel. In this way the application keeps trying to complete activation or the next portion of activation without blocking indefinitely based on the failure or unavailability of one channel while another alternative channel may in fact be available for continuing the activation or portion of the activation process.

Current systems may typically download the activation payload during the initial startup of the mobile device in one attempt through a single communication channel or connection option with no capability for pausing and restarting the download i.e. using a multi stage download or using multiple communication channels to complete the download. This may create irritating delays and problems if the channel is blocked or slow. Additionally current systems may not have the option to provide credentials for a communication channel within the initial startup process. For example systems may not provide the option for the user to input a security code or authorization code to access the activation payload or a portion of the activation payload through an access point for example through a WiFi access point. Enabling a device to work with a partial download while also creating a multiple channel and in some cases a multiple staged download may improve timing and efficiency during the initial startup of the mobile device. Because these capabilities may result in some use of a partially activated device data from the activation payload may be preserved once the activation process is completed. To accomplish this multiple memory partitions on the mobile device may be used to preserve data and or restrict access to data.

The mobile communication device may have memory established as a system memory partition and a user memory partition. An operating system of the mobile communication device may restrict write access to the system memory partition and may prevent the contents of the system memory partition being erased during reset operations for example resetting to factory defaults. For example a user may be prevented from writing to the system memory partition and or from causing writing to the system memory partition. By contrast the operating system of the mobile communication device may allow unrestricted write access to the user memory partition. For example a user of the mobile communication device may be permitted by the operating system to write information into the user memory partition at least indirectly by exercising user interface control selections for example entering personal contacts installing third party applications downloading ring tones and the like. During a reset for example during a reset to factory defaults the information in the user memory partition may be deleted by the operating system. The ANDROID operating system used by some mobile communication devices may establish a system memory partition and a user memory partition.

The operating system may further provide write access to a carrier memory partition to privileged users or automated processes. For example an individual providing a carrier memory partition key or password for example an employee or contractor associated with a wireless communication service provider may be allowed by the operating system to write to the carrier memory partition. Alternatively instructions that execute on the mobile communication device may be granted the privilege to write to the carrier memory partition by the operating system based on the instructions providing the key or password. In an embodiment the key or password is unavailable and unknown to a user of the mobile communication device for example the key or password may only be known to the wireless service provider and or carrier. In some cases this may be used when the activation payload and or customization content is delivered to the device to prevent unwanted access to the secure information. For example if the mobile device is reset for any reason the activation payload may be retained in the carrier partition.

In an embodiment the instructions may invoke an application programming interface API provided by the operating system to write to the carrier memory partition and the API call may entail providing the key or password associated with the carrier memory partition. In some contexts this may be referred to as a carrier memory partition key or a carrier memory partition password. An automated procedure or function executed on the mobile communication device that presents a carrier memory partition key or password for example a script wirelessly transmitted to the mobile communication device may be permitted to write to the carrier memory partition. The carrier memory partition may be used to store branding information. The carrier memory partition further may be used to store other information unrelated to branding and or customization content. For further details about carrier memory partitions see U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 763 428 filed Feb. 8 2013 entitled System and Method of Storing Service Brand Packages On a Mobile Device by Brandon C. Annan et al. which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The communication applications may be any of a variety of applications. One of the communication applications may be a telephone application that receives dialed digits and attempts to originate a voice call for example a voice over IP VoIP call to a called telephone. The telephone application may also promote receiving voice calls originated by another communication device. One of the communication applications may be a web browser application that requests content from the network for example by sending out a hypertext transport protocol HTTP message embedding a universal reference locator URL . One of the communication applications may be a media player that requests streaming or downloading media from the network . Many of the communication applications may depend upon communication service provided by an IMS network to deliver their functionality to an end user of the mobile communication device . One of the communication applications may comprise a mobile transaction interface where a user may complete a purchase using the application and secure information such as credit card information may be communicated through the application. In some embodiments the communication applications may be stored in a system memory partition of the memory of the mobile communication device .

In some embodiments the mobile communication device may comprise a memory system divided into one or more partitions. The partitions may include a system memory partition a carrier memory partition and a user memory partition . In some embodiments content may be stored and or executed in one or more of the memory partitions. In some embodiments the content stored in the memory of the mobile communication device may be associated with the manufacturer of the device or may be content that is pre loaded onto the device. In some embodiments the communication applications may be stored in the system memory partition .

Additionally an activation application may be stored and or executed in the system memory partition wherein the activation application may be operable to complete customization or activation processes for the mobile communication device . In some embodiments one or more of the memory locations may comprise non volatile or persistent memory. In some embodiments the activation process may comprise provisioning the mobile communication device wherein provisioning may comprise setting up the mobile communication device for communication and or service with the network . In other words provisioning may enable the mobile communication device to connect to the network to allow communication to and from the mobile communication device .

In some embodiments an activation payload may be delivered to the mobile communication device during the initial activation of the device or during a subsequent activation process such as if the mobile communication device is reset or returned to factory settings. The activation payload may contain information and or instructions for completing the activation process. In some embodiments the activation payload may be delivered in accordance with OMA DM open mobile alliance device management protocol or framework.

The activation payload may communicate with the activation application wherein the activation application may use the data of the activation payload to complete the activation process.

In some embodiments during the initial out of the box operation of the mobile communication device the mobile communication device may attempt to establish a connection with the network to begin the activation process. For example the activation application may search for a connection to the network in order to request the activation payload . There may be various connection options available to the mobile communication device such as cellular WiFi Bluetooth near field communication and other wireless connections. Additionally the mobile device may optionally be connected to the network via a wired connection. In some embodiments the activation application or another communication application on the mobile communication device may be operable to detect available connection options between the mobile communication device and the network . Additionally the activation application may be operable to determine the quality of each of the connection options based on strength speed interference and traffic for example. The activation application may also rank the available connection options based on the determined quality wherein the rank may be used when attempting connections. The activation application may then attempt to complete the activation process using the available connection options wherein the best available connection may be attempted first.

In some embodiments a connection option may entail the input of credentials such as a password pin key or other identifying information to use the connection. In this case the activation application may present the user with a screen or other interface in which to input the credentials. Instead of redirecting the user out of the activation process to input the credentials the activation application may integrate the presentation of the input screen into the process such that the activation process is not interrupted. In some embodiments the user may not have access to the required credentials such as a password for a WIFI hot spot and may be given the option to skip that particular connection option and move on to the next best option to attempt to complete the activation process. Additionally if a connection to the network is lost for any reason the activation application may continue to detect and attempt connection over multiple options during the activation process for example over a different communication channel and or using a different communication protocol wherein the process may be paused and reinitiated at any time.

In an exemplary embodiment a user may be at their home when they initiate the activation of the mobile communication device . The connection options available may comprise the user s home WIFI network a cellular radio connection and possibly a neighbor s WIFI network. The mobile communication device may attempt to establish a connection with the home WIFI network wherein a screen may be presented to the user to input the password for the WIFI. At some point during the activation process the user s home WIFI network may be compromised for some reason. The device may then attempt to make a connection via the neighbor s WIFI network and present the user with a screen to input the password. However the user may not have the password and may therefore choose to skip or reject the connection via the neighbor s WIFI network. Instead of getting stuck trying to connect to the neighbor s WIFI network the application may then move on and attempt other available connection options such as the cellular connection and or the user s home WIFI network if it is reestablished .

Turning now to a method for activation of a mobile communication device is described. At block available connection options may be detected between the mobile communication device and a network.

In some embodiments the method may optionally comprise at block inputting credentials for one or more of the connection options. At block the activation process may be completed over one or more of the connection options. In some embodiments the quality of the available connection options may be determined based on signal strength throughput rate interference and current traffic load. In some embodiments the first attempt may be unsuccessful because the connection entails the input of credentials that the user does not have or know. In some embodiments the method may be completed by an activation application on the mobile device. In some embodiments the activation application may detect the request for credentials for a particular connection and may provide an input screen to the user to input the credentials. In some embodiments successive attempts to connect to the network may be made until the activation process is completed. In some embodiments the activation process may be paused if the connection to the network is lost and the process may continue if the connection to the network is reestablished.

Another input mechanism may be the touch screen LCD which may also display text and or graphics to the user. The touch screen LCD controller couples the DSP to the touch screen LCD . The GPS receiver is coupled to the DSP to decode global positioning system signals thereby enabling the mobile device to determine its position.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM is a non volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage . The RAM is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM and RAM is typically faster than to secondary storage . The secondary storage the RAM and or the ROM may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and or non transitory computer readable media.

I O devices may include printers video monitors liquid crystal displays LCDs touch screen displays keyboards keypads switches dials mice track balls voice recognizers card readers paper tape readers or other well known input devices.

The network connectivity devices may take the form of modems modem banks Ethernet cards universal serial bus USB interface cards serial interfaces token ring cards fiber distributed data interface FDDI cards wireless local area network WLAN cards radio transceiver cards such as code division multiple access CDMA global system for mobile communications GSM long term evolution LTE worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX and or other air interface protocol radio transceiver cards and other well known network devices. These network connectivity devices may enable the processor to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection it is contemplated that the processor might receive information from the network or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above described method steps. Such information which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.

Such information which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor for example may be received from and outputted to the network for example in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed may be generated according to several methods well known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.

The processor executes instructions codes computer programs scripts which it accesses from hard disk floppy disk optical disk these various disk based systems may all be considered secondary storage ROM RAM or the network connectivity devices . While only one processor is shown multiple processors may be present. Thus while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor the instructions may be executed simultaneously serially or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions codes computer programs scripts and or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage for example hard drives floppy disks optical disks and or other device the ROM and or the RAM may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory instructions and or non transitory information.

In an embodiment the computer system may comprise two or more computers in communication with each other that collaborate to perform a task. For example but not by way of limitation an application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of the instructions of the application. Alternatively the data processed by the application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and or parallel processing of different portions of a data set by the two or more computers. In an embodiment virtualization software may be employed by the computer system to provide the functionality of a number of servers that is not directly bound to the number of computers in the computer system . For example virtualization software may provide twenty virtual servers on four physical computers. In an embodiment the functionality disclosed above may be provided by executing the application and or applications in a cloud computing environment. Cloud computing may comprise providing computing services via a network connection using dynamically scalable computing resources. Cloud computing may be supported at least in part by virtualization software.

The computer program product may comprise instructions that promote the loading and or copying of data data structures files and or executable instructions to the secondary storage to the ROM to the RAM and or to other non volatile memory and volatile memory of the computer system .

In some contexts the secondary storage the ROM and the RAM may be referred to as a non transitory computer readable medium or a computer readable storage media. A dynamic RAM embodiment of the RAM likewise may be referred to as a non transitory computer readable medium in that while the dynamic RAM receives electrical power and is operated in accordance with its design for example during a period of time during which the computer system is turned on and operational the dynamic RAM stores information that is written to it. Similarly the processor may comprise an internal RAM an internal ROM a cache memory and or other internal non transitory storage blocks sections or components that may be referred to in some contexts as non transitory computer readable media or computer readable storage media.
