This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 413 333 filed Mar. 6 2012 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 471 558 filed Apr. 4 2011. The entire contents of each of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 413 333 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 471 558 are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

The present invention generally relates to a system and method for efficient delivery of alarm system event data and audio over hybrid telecommunications networks. Audio call activity is minimized between an alarm system and a central alarm monitoring station reducing costs as compared to conventional systems and methods.

Historically security alarm systems have relied upon the Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN to connect an alarm system to a central alarm monitoring station so that alarm event data may be communicated from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station. These conventional alarm systems are configured to place an audio band voice call to the central alarm monitoring station and transmit alarm event data to the central alarm monitoring station using DTMF touch tone codes for example. Alarm systems equipped with two way voice or ambient sound listening functionality have relied upon the same PSTN connection to connect a two way audio band voice call between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station. In this manner an agent at the central alarm monitoring station is able to listen to ambient sounds captured by microphones at the premises where the alarm system is installed via the audio band voice call. Similarly the voice of the agent is communicated via the audio band voice call and amplified by speakers and associated circuitry of the alarm system.

Some alarm systems substitute wireless radio communications services such as cellular radiotelephone service for the PSTN. In these systems both alarm event data and voice are communicated over a two way audio band voice channel between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring system using the cellular radiotelephone service. Other alarm systems substitute Voice over IP VoIP communications services for the PSTN. These systems also communicate both alarm event data and voice over a two way audio band voice channel established using the VoIP service.

It is noted that for conventional alarm systems equipped with two way voice functionality a two way voice channel may be automatically and or necessarily established upon the occurrence of every alarm event. That is the voice channel is established by the alarm system regardless of the type of the alarm event or any other considerations. Especially for alarm systems that substitute cellular radiotelephone service for the PSTN costs associated with establishing and maintaining the voice channel are high.

Further while conventional alarm systems are configured to establish and maintain a voice channel upon the occurrence of every alarm event flexibility is lost because the necessity to establish and maintain the voice channel is not evaluated by any means. In some systems a service provider of alarm system monitoring services may have no ability to modify the configuration of monitored alarm systems for example if subscribers desire to terminate two way voice monitoring services for lower costs.

The present invention is directed to addressing the deficiencies of the above discussed conventional systems and methods by efficiently delivering alarm system event data and audio over hybrid telecommunications networks.

In one embodiment the communications module communicates data using a packet based mobile data service such as General Packet Radio Service GPRS for example. It is noted that especially for cellular communications networks the cost of communicating data over a data channel may vary as compared to the cost of communicating voice over a voice channel because the resources required for communicating data in discrete amounts is generally lower than the resources required to open and maintain a voice channel.

In operational aspects the alarm system is configured to detect an alarm event using one or more of the sensors of the alarm subsystem or the alarm panel and communicate associated alarm event data to the message processing gateway using a data channel established between the alarm system and the message processing gateway .

The dialer bank may be further configured to communicate data including alarm event data received from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station using DTMF signaling over the voice channel.

The database comprises one or more computer readable storage devices that store computer executable program code as well as data related to alarm systems accounts of alarm monitoring subscribers alarm system event data and other associated data. For example the database may store data associated with a plurality of alarm monitoring subscriber accounts for billing and other purposes. The account data and other associated information stored in the database may be maintained and updated via a network interface by account owners such as alarm services dealers. The alarm system event data may be maintained and updated by the post processor . It is noted that the message processing gateway provides and facilitates alarm monitoring services for a plurality of alarm systems in addition to the alarm system . As such the database stores data related to a plurality of alarm systems in addition to the alarm system .

In operational aspects the message processing gateway is configured to receive alarm event data representative of an alarm event from the alarm system evaluate service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data and forward the alarm event data along with associated information to the private branch telecommunications switch if certain service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data are met. A more detailed description of the processes of the message processing gateway are provided below.

The private branch telecommunications switch comprises one or more proxies and at least one bank of communications modules. Particularly the private branch telecommunications switch as illustrated includes three communications banks and . The private branch telecommunications switch may comprise additional or fewer communications banks among embodiments. In one embodiment the message processing gateway and the private branch telecommunications switch comprise separate computing devices and the private branch telecommunications switch is communicatively coupled to the message processing gateway via the communications link . The communications link may comprise one or more wired or wireless communications links. The private branch telecommunications switch and the message processing gateway may communicate using Application Programming Interface API web services over the Internet or other public and or private networks. In other embodiments the private branch telecommunications switch and the message processing gateway may be integrated into a single computing device as designated by the hashed outline .

The communications banks and are configured to establish a voice channel to the central alarm monitoring station over the communications link which may comprise one or more wired or wireless communications links including the PSTN. It is noted that the communications link may comprise communications links other than the PSTN such as the Internet. As compared to the dialer bank the communications banks and may comprise additional circuitry firmware and or software to facilitate two way voice communications over the voice channel established between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station . For example the dialer bank may comprise circuitry for establishing a voice channel and communicating data using the limited number of DTMF tones but not circuitry for facilitating a two way audio band voice conversation between individuals.

In operational aspects the private branch telecommunications switch is configured to open a voice channel to the central alarm monitoring station and communicate the alarm event data and associated information received from the message processing gateway to the central alarm monitoring station . In additional aspects the private branch telecommunications switch is further configured to determine whether the voice channel between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station remains open after the alarm event data and associated information is communicated to the central alarm monitoring station . The private branch telecommunications switch is further configured to generate and forward a routing code to the alarm system in response to a determination that the voice channel between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station remains open and bridge a voice channel between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station .

The central alarm monitoring station comprises at least one agent console and a plurality of receiver modules and . The central alarm monitoring station is staffed by personnel including agent . As illustrated in the agent is able to view the agent console which displays information associated with received alarm event data from alarm systems. For example after receiving alarm event data and associated information from the alarm system and the message processing gateway the agent console may display details related to an alarm event occurring at a location where the alarm system is installed. For example based on alarm event data received from the alarm system the agent console may indicate that a fire panic burglary or medical emergency is occurring at a home or office where the alarm system is installed. Additionally the agent console may display a street address or geographic coordinates of the home or office with contact information for fire police and medical services. Based on the display the agent is able to assess the event where the alarm system is installed. Generally the central alarm monitoring station facilitates monitoring alarm systems installed at a plurality of locations by one or more agents that assess alarm events and sometimes contact service personnel based upon alarm event data received from the alarm systems. For example the agents monitoring alarm systems at the central alarm monitoring station may call for fire police or medical service personnel to be dispatched based on alarm event data received from a plurality of monitored alarm systems.

When an alarm system includes two way voice functionality a voice channel may be established between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . As such the agent at the central alarm monitoring station is able to listen to ambient sounds captured by microphones of an alarm system for example at a location where the alarm system is installed. The sounds may be communicated over a voice channel established between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . The agent is also able to speak into a handset or headset microphone for example at the central alarm monitoring station and the agent s voice may be communicated over the voice channel and amplified over speakers at the location where the alarm system is installed. As described herein an alarm system comprising two way voice functionality is capable of establishing a full duplex voice band audio link between the alarm system and an alarm monitoring station. Using the two way voice functionality the agent is able to assess any ambient sounds captured at a location where an alarm system is installed in connection with received alarm event data. For example the agent may be able to hear one or more persons committing a crime in connection with alarm event data indicating a burglary event and warn those persons that police have been dispatched. In another example the agent may be able to hear an individual s request for medical assistance.

As compared to conventional alarm systems the exemplary system of the present invention is configured to establish a voice channel using a method that reduces an amount of time the two way voice channel is established and maintained between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . Further the exemplary system is configured to establish the voice channel only if certain service parameters of the alarm system and conditions of the alarm event data are met.

As described in further detail below when an alarm event is detected the alarm system is configured to establish a data connection to the message processing gateway using the communications module and communicate alarm event data to the message processing gateway before a voice channel is established. In turn the message processing gateway is configured to forward the alarm event data to the central alarm monitoring station via the private branch telecommunications switch if certain service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data are met before the voice channel is established. The voice channel is established at a later time after the alarm system receives a routing code from the private branch telecommunications switch as described in further detail below with reference to .

Before turning to the process flow diagrams of it is noted that the present invention may be practiced using an alternative order of the steps illustrated in . That is the process flows illustrated in are provided as examples only and the present invention may be practiced using process flows that differ from those illustrated. Additionally it is noted that not all steps are required in every embodiment. In other words one or more of the steps may be omitted or replaced without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In alternative embodiments steps may be performed in different orders in parallel with one another or omitted entirely and or certain additional steps may be performed without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention.

Turning to a method for delivering alarm system event data and connecting a two way voice channel is illustrated. At step the alarm system detects an alarm event. For example the alarm system may detect a fire burglary or medical emergency using one or more of the sensors of the alarm subsystem or according to a button pressed on the keypad of the alarm panel . In other words the alarm event may be responsive to the sensors of the alarm system or an individual s request for attention using the alarm panel . At step the alarm system communicates alarm event data associated with the detected alarm event to the message processing gateway using a data channel established by the communications module . For example the alarm system may communicate the alarm event data as one or more packets of data using a data communications protocol over the communications channel without relying on the establishment of a voice channel. In one embodiment the alarm event data is formatted in the industry standard Contact ID format. The alarm system may also communicate information in addition to the alarm event data such as a device ID of the alarm system . The device ID may be a serial number of the alarm system a serial number of the communications module an IP address assigned to the communications module or other unique identification data associated with the alarm system .

At step the message processing gateway evaluates service parameters of the alarm system and the data received from the alarm system . Based on the evaluation at step the message processing gateway determines whether to open a two way voice channel at step . As described in further detail below with reference to the message processing gateway evaluates service parameters of the alarm system and the data received from the alarm system to determine whether the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station are to be connected via a two way voice channel. For example the message processing gateway determines whether to open the voice channel based on whether certain service parameters of the alarm system and conditions of the data received from the alarm system are met. The parameters of the alarm system and conditions of the data may be determined with reference to data stored in the database as described in further detail below.

If the message processing gateway determines that a voice channel is not to be opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station at step the message processing gateway proceeds to step and communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station via the communications link . That is the message processing gateway establishes a communications channel to the central alarm monitoring station via communications link using the dialer bank and the receiver module . After establishing the communications channel the message processing gateway communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station using DTMF tones for example. It is noted that the message processing gateway may communicate data to the central alarm monitoring system in addition to the alarm event data. For example the message processing gateway when evaluating the service parameters of the alarm system at step may query the database to gather account data associated with the alarm system such as associated phone number s of central alarm monitoring station s account numbers billing information subscriber names serial numbers and IP addresses of the alarm system . In turn the message processing gateway may communicate one or more of these additional data items such as account number s to the central alarm monitoring station when communicating the alarm event data.

Based on the alarm event data and any other associated information received from the message processing gateway the agent console is updated with a display of the alarm event detected by the alarm system and the process ends at step after the central alarm monitoring station has received the alarm event data. In this case according to the evaluation of the service parameters of the alarm system and conditions of the data received from the alarm system at step no voice channel is connected between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring system . As such the agent determines whether to contact emergency personnel such as police fire or medical personnel based on the updated display of the agent console without the additional benefit of the voice channel. The agent may alternatively or additionally determine whether to contact service personnel for example if the event data indicates a building system failure.

On the other hand if the message processing gateway determines that a voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station at step the message processing gateway proceeds to step and forwards the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the central alarm monitoring station via the communications link . In other words the message processing gateway establishes a communications channel to the private branch telecommunications switch via the communications link using a web services API link over the Internet for example. After establishing the communications channel the message processing gateway communicates the alarm event data received from the alarm system to the private branch telecommunications switch . It is noted that among embodiments the message processing gateway may communicate the alarm event data to the private branch telecommunications switch using communications channels and or protocols other than the web services API link. Also the message processing gateway may forward data to the private branch telecommunications switch in addition to the alarm event data. For example the message processing gateway when evaluating the parameters and data of the alarm system at step may query the database to gather account data associated with the alarm system such as phone and or account numbers billing information subscriber names serial numbers and IP addresses of the alarm system . In turn the message processing gateway may forward one or more of these additional data items to the private branch telecommunications switch .

In one aspect as compared to when the message processing gateway communicates the alarm event data to the central alarm monitoring station via the communications link the message processing gateway also forwards a voice channel code to the private branch telecommunications switch when forwarding the alarm event data via the communications link . Particularly in one embodiment the voice channel code is inserted among data forwarded to the private branch telecommunications switch so that the voice channel code may be communicated to the central alarm monitoring station by the private branch telecommunications switch . As described herein the voice channel code comprises a code recognized by the central alarm monitoring station as a command to maintain an open voice channel. As described in further detail below the central alarm monitoring station maintains the open voice channel so that a two way voice channel may be established between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . In other words the voice channel code comprises a code which identifies to the central alarm monitoring station that the alarm system comprises two way voice functionality and is requesting a two way voice channel.

In another aspect the message processing gateway also forwards a routing number of the central alarm monitoring system to the private branch telecommunications switch when forwarding the alarm event data. The routing number of the central alarm monitoring system may comprise a PSTN telephone number of one of the receiver modules and or a Session Initiation Protocol SIP address or IP address of the central alarm monitoring station for example. The private branch telecommunications switch may use the routing number to establish a communications channel with the central alarm monitoring station via the communications link .

Turning to at step the telecommunications switch opens a voice channel with a receiver module of the central alarm monitoring station using the communications bank via the communications link . The private branch telecommunications switch may open the voice channel with reference to the routing number of the central alarm monitoring station received from the message processing gateway for example. After opening the voice channel the private branch telecommunications switch communicates the alarm event data and other associated information received from the message processing gateway to the central alarm monitoring station . In one embodiment the private branch telecommunications switch communicates the alarm event data an account number of the alarm system and the voice channel code. Among embodiments the private branch telecommunications switch may communicate any portion or all of the data received from the message processing gateway to the central alarm monitoring station .

At step the private branch telecommunications switch determines whether the voice channel between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring system remains open after a kiss off or other acknowledgement from the central alarm monitoring system . In other words the private branch telecommunications switch determines whether the central alarm monitoring station has maintained an open communications channel via the communications link after the central alarm monitoring station acknowledges receipt of the alarm event data and other associated information from the private branch telecommunications switch .

If the private branch telecommunications switch determines at step that the voice channel does not remain open after communication of the alarm event data to the central alarm monitoring station the process ends at step . In alternative embodiments the private branch telecommunications switch may indicate to the message processing gateway that the central alarm monitoring station disconnected the voice communications channel before the process ends at step .

Alternatively if the private branch telecommunications switch determines at step that the central alarm monitoring station maintains an open voice channel after receipt of the alarm event data the process proceeds to step where the private branch telecommunications switch generates and sends a routing code to the message processing gateway . The routing code may be determined based upon a routing address of the private branch telecommunications switch an ID of the alarm system and the particular one of the communications modules and used to open the voice channel to the central alarm monitoring station for example. The routing code is used by the alarm system to establish a voice channel between the alarm system and the private branch telecommunications switch .

At step the message processing gateway forwards the routing code to the alarm system via the communications link . The message processing gateway forwards the routing code to the alarm system using a data channel between the message processing gateway and the alarm system . Proceeding to step after the alarm system receives the routing code from the private branch telecommunications switch the alarm system opens a voice channel to the private branch telecommunications switch with reference to the routing code. Particularly the alarm system uses the communications module to open a voice channel to the private branch telecommunications switch via the communications link . In one embodiment the routing code comprises a telephone number of the private branch telecommunications switch and an ID of the alarm system . In another embodiment the routing code may also include an identification number that identifies the bank of communications modules that maintains the open voice channel between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station .

At step the private branch telecommunications switch determines whether the voice channel remains open between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station . If the private branch telecommunications switch determines that the voice channel is no longer open at step the private branch telecommunications switch indicates to the alarm system that the central alarm monitoring station has disconnected at step . As one indication that the central alarm monitoring station has disconnected the private branch telecommunications switch may provide a busy signal to the alarm system indicating that the central alarm monitoring station is unavailable.

If the private branch telecommunications switch determines at step that the voice channel remains open between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station the private branch telecommunications switch bridges the voice channel established between the alarm system and the private branch telecommunications switch with the voice channel established between the private branch telecommunications switch and the central alarm monitoring station . Thus a voice channel between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station is created. After the voice channel is bridged between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station the agent is able to speak into a headset or handset microphone at the central alarm monitoring station and the agent s voice may be amplified over the speakers of the alarm system . Additionally the agent is able to listen for sounds at a location where the alarm system is installed using a microphone of the alarm system . The bridged voice channel continues until it is disconnected at step . The process ends at step when the bridged voice channel is disconnected.

It is noted that for some time after the central alarm monitoring station receives data from the private branch telecommunications switch at step the agent may not be available to listen for ambient sounds captured by the alarm system due to other priorities. By the time that the voice channel is bridged between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station however the agent is more likely to be available to listen for the ambient sounds. It is further noted that the exemplary system helps to reduce costs associated with maintaining a voice channel between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station while the agent is busy with other priorities.

Turning to an exemplary evaluation of the service parameters of the alarm system and the alarm event data by the message processing gateway is described in further detail. Generally the evaluation is relied upon to determine whether a two way voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . The decision blocks in the evaluation illustrated in are provided by way of example only and embodiments may be implemented using fewer or additional factors decisions or considerations.

At step the post processor of the message processing gateway queries data associated with the alarm system from the database . Particularly the post processor of the message processing gateway queries the database for various types of data associated with the alarm system such as account numbers billing information subscriber names serial numbers IP addresses other service parameters of the alarm system . At step the message processing gateway evaluates the alarm system event data.

After the query at step and the evaluation at step the post processor determines whether a two way voice channel is to be opened at decisions blocks and . At step the post processor determines whether the alarm system is provisioned in the database . In other words the post processor determines whether the alarm system is registered among a known group of serviced alarm systems of the message processing gateway. To determine whether the alarm system is registered the post processor may reference an IP address or serial number of the alarm system and cross reference that information with information in the database . If the alarm system is not among the known group of serviced alarm systems of the message processing gateway the post processor proceeds to step and it is determined that no two way voice channel is to be opened. In this case no voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring system because the alarm system is not a provisioned customer of the system . Alternatively if the alarm system is among the known serviced alarm systems the process proceeds to step .

At step the post processor determines whether the alarm system is associated with an active alarm monitoring account. In other words the post processor determines whether the alarm system is associated with a customer account in good standing for example. Among other aspects the standing of a customer s account may be dependent upon an account balance for services rendered or a payment schedule of the customer. If the alarm system is not associated with a customer account in good standing the post processor proceeds to step and it is determined that no two way voice channel is to be opened. In this case no voice channel is to be opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring system because the alarm system is associated with a customer account that is not in good standing. Alternatively if the alarm system is associated with a customer account in good standing the process proceeds to step .

At step the post processor determines whether the alarm system is capable of and configured for establishing a two way voice channel between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station . In one aspect the post processor determines whether the alarm system comprises the hardware necessary to facilitate the establishment of a voice channel. The post processor may cross reference a serial number of the alarm system with data stored in the database to determine whether the alarm system comprises the hardware required to establish a voice channel. In this context the database may store a list of hardware configurations of several different models of alarm systems which comprise the hardware necessary to establish a voice channel for reference by the post processor .

In another aspect the post processor determines whether the alarm system is configured for two way voice functionality. It is noted that although an alarm system may comprise the hardware necessary to establish a voice channel customers and or service providers may choose not to use the two way voice functionality of the alarm system. Even for alarm systems comprising the hardware for establishing a voice channel the voice feature may be disabled at the alarm panel of the alarm system or according to one or more parameters stored in the database for example. If the alarm system does not comprise the hardware necessary for establishing a voice channel or is not configured for two way voice functionality the post processor proceeds to step and it is determined that no two way voice channel is to be opened. Alternatively if the alarm system comprises the hardware necessary for establishing a voice channel and is configured for two way voice functionality the process proceeds to step .

At step the post processor determines whether the alarm event requires a voice channel. In other words the post processor evaluates the alarm event data to determine whether the alarm event data includes an alarm event code such as a fire burglary or other medical emergency code for which a voice channel may be desirable. In some cases the alarm event data may indicate that the alarm event is associated with a system failure such as a furnace or air conditioner failure. In these cases a voice channel is unlikely to be beneficial to the agent because of the lack of ambient sounds to interpret and individuals to speak with. In one embodiment the post processor determines that a voice channel is required for any alarm event data associated with a fire panic burglary or medical emergency. If the alarm event data is not associated with a fire panic burglary or other medical emergency the post processor proceeds to step and it is determined that no two way voice channel is to be opened. Alternatively if the alarm event data is associated with a fire panic burglary or other medical emergency the process proceeds to step and it is determined that the two way voice channel is to be opened.

Thus a voice channel is opened between the alarm system and the central alarm monitoring station based on the evaluation by the message processing gateway of the service parameters and the alarm event data of the alarm system . As noted above the voice channel is not opened automatically for all alarm events. For example as discussed above even if a burglary is detected no voice channel is opened if the alarm system is configured not to open a voice channel according to the decision at step . As another example even if a burglary is detected no voice channel is opened if an account of the alarm system is inactive or not in good standing according to the decision at step . As such customers and service operators of alarm systems according to the system and method described herein are able to carefully define the conditions under which voice channels are opened reducing costs as compared to conventional systems and methods.

With reference again to the process turns to either step when no voice channel is to be opened or to step when a voice channel is to be opened according to the evaluation at step and the decision at step . As compared to step the alarm event data is forwarded at step with a voice channel code as discussed above to direct the central alarm monitoring station to maintain an open voice channel which is later bridged to the alarm system .

The message processing gateway and the private branch telecommunications switch may be located at separate geographic locations.
