The field generally relates to data processing and in particular to systems and methods for automatically adjusting content composition rules based on evaluation of user feedback information obtained through a haptic interface.

In general a haptic interface is a system that enables individuals to interact with a computing system through bodily movements tactile feedback and bodily sensations to perform actions or processes on a computing device. A haptic interface is primarily implemented and applied in virtual reality environments where an individual can interact with virtual objects and elements. A haptic interface relies on sensors that send signals to the computer based on different sensory movements or interactions by the user. These sensor signals are processed by the computing system to initiate and execute a process or action. Haptic technology is utilized in various types of applications and computing systems.

Embodiments of the invention generally include systems and methods for automatically adjusting content composition rules based on evaluation of user feedback information obtained through a haptic interface. For example in one embodiment a method is provided which includes accessing user feedback information collected by a haptic interface executing on a computing device wherein the user feedback information comprises information indicative of a user s reaction towards digital content rendered by the computing device. The digital content includes content that is automatically generated using content composition rules. The method further includes evaluating a quality of the digital content based on the user feedback information generating an evaluation report that includes information regarding the quality of the digital content and automatically adjusting one or more content composition rules based on the evaluation report.

Other embodiments of the invention will be described in the following detailed description of embodiments which is to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The content generation system is configured to automatically generate digital content for a given type of application. In particular the automatic composition module is configured to automatically generate digital content e.g. digital educational material using a data store of composition rules a data store of digital content components a data store of haptic feedback markers and a data store of profile information . In one embodiment of the invention the content generation system is configured to generate digital educational content which can be accessed and utilized by group of students for a given educational subject. While embodiments of the invention can be implemented with other types of digital content for illustrative purposes exemplary embodiments of the invention will be discussed in the context of digital education material.

The composition rules provide a set of rules for composing digital content using a set of digital content components e.g. multimedia components . In general the composition rules specify what material is to be presented and how the material is to be constructed positioned and otherwise presented when rendered on a computing device. For example the composition rules may specify that a given picture be displayed on a given page with a certain description wherein the picture is displayed at a given size and the text description displayed in a given font and size etc. Methods for automatically constructing digital content based on composition rules are well known in the art and thus a detailed explanation of the content generation process is not necessary for understanding embodiments of the invention.

The automatic composition module applies profile information to guide the composition process and generate digital content that is customized for a target individual or a target group of individuals. For example the profile information comprises individual profile information for various types of individuals and group profile information for a given target social setting e.g. groups of students the way the student are disposed in classes parameters related to their social relationships etc. . The profile information is utilized in conjunction with the composition rules to customize the content generation e.g. educational content for a given individual or a target group of individuals e.g. schools in a given region individual schools classrooms other group formation etc. based on the profile information associated with the given individual or target group of individuals. For example the composition rules may specify what specific digital content components should be used to generate digital content for delivery to a specific individual or group of individuals based on various factors including but not limited to their demographics gender ages etc.

The pages of digital content are generated using various content components included in the data store of content components along with one or more haptic feedback markers included in the data store of haptic feedback markers . The haptic feedback markers include various interaction components such as like dislike buttons check lists and other types of interaction elements which implement a haptic interface that allows a user to provide feedback as to whether the user likes or dislikes a given content component within a given page of the digital content which is accessed and viewed by the user. The haptic feedback markers are customized for the given haptic interface and contextualized within pages of the digital content .

The content access and delivery module is configured to enable individual users or groups of users to register with the content generation system provide relevant profile information and download digital content either push or pull that is automatically generated by the content generation system . The content access and delivery module can be implemented using known front end API techniques for accessing and interacting with web applications for example The content access and delivery module is configured to communicate with the user computing device and deliver pages of digital content for rendering and presentation to a user.

The user computing device is may be any type of computing device such as a desktop computer electronic tablet smart phone etc. which is configured to execute an application to render and present pages of the digital content and to provide a haptic interface to collect intentional user feedback resulting from user interaction with haptic feedback markers that are presented within the rendered content pages. As shown in the digital content comprises a rendered content pages that comprises a plurality of n content components Component . . . Component n and a plurality of m haptic feedback markers Haptic Marker . . . Haptic Marker m . It is to be understood that while shows a single user computing device the same digital content can be downloaded to a plurality of computing devices that are used by different individuals within a given group e.g. a plurality of students within a given classroom studying a given topic such as History . As an individual or group of individuals review and interact with pages of the digital content presented on their respective computing device the individual s can provide intentional feedback regarding their opinion on the quality of the digital content e.g. feedback regarding particular components through interaction with the haptic feedback markers .

The user computing device comprises a haptic interface which captures and stores the user interaction events with the haptic feedback markers for access by the user feedback processing system . In general the user feedback processing system implements methods to collect index group and analyze the distinct characteristics of the intentional user interaction with haptic feedback markers and correlate such information to individual profiles of the users and social setting information e.g. the groups of students the way they are disposed in classes and parameters related to their social relationships . The process generates a report of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content in terms of organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and others factors. The report can be utilized to evaluate the quality of the digital content and thus validate the quality of the composition rules being applied to generate digital content.

Overall the system of implements a protocol to validate the process of automated composition of digital content by providing methods to validate the parameters being applied by the composition rules. This process leads to possible reconsideration optimization and adjustment of parameters of the composition rules with the goal of continually improving the content generation process through subjective evaluation of composition rules by analyzing the intentional feedback input obtained through the haptic feedback markers inserted in the digital content during the composition phase.

In the user feedback processing system the data analytics module receives the user interaction events e.g. interaction with the haptic interface from the computing device and stores indexes and aggregates the interaction events in the form of intentional user feedback data that is maintained in a data store of intentional user feedback data . The data analytics module further maintains a data store of profile information which includes profile information maintained in the data store of profile information utilized in the content generation system .

The intentional user feedback evaluation engine utilizes a data store of classification rules and data to process the intentional user feedback data and profile data provided by the data analytics module and generate information that is stored and maintained in a data store of evaluation results and reports . The intentional user feedback evaluation engine compiles distinct features of intentional user feedback obtained through haptic feedback markers within pages of digital content and the group behavior towards the digital content which is maintained and stored in the data store of intentional user feedback data . The intentional user feedback evaluation engine correlates this information to the profile data and social setting information used by the composition rules to generate reports of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content in terms of e.g. organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and other factors.

As noted above embodiments of the invention can be implemented in the context of digital educational material. For example assume that a private school implements an educational program to deliver digital educational content to its students. In the context of the system of the digital educational content is generated by the content generation system . In this embodiment the digital content components would include various components of digital educational material related to one or more subjects. The automatic composition module would compose the digital educational content using relevant composition rules and profile information to create customized educational material for the students based on profiles of the individual students and based on their social setting e.g. the groups of students the way the students are disposed in classes and parameters related to their social relationships . Moreover the automatic composition process would insert one or more relevant haptic feedback markers within the digital educational material to provide an interface for the students to intentionally evaluate content components of the digital educational content pages.

The digital educational content is delivered to computing devices that are used by the students to access and view the digital educational content. For example the students within a given classroom could use electronic tablet computing devices or laptop computers which would have an application for accessing and rendering the digital educational content as well as a haptic interface for processing user feedback provided by user interaction haptic feedback markers that are displayed or otherwise rendered on pages of the digital educational content pages. For example a student could click on a given region on a screen display of a haptic interface or upon a specific portion of displayed digital education material to open a feedback input screen where the student can make a selection. It is expected that a variation in context such as the individual s profile and social setting will influence how the individual interacts with the haptic feedback markers. For example individuals of different ages and or from diverse socio educational and cultural backgrounds e.g. level of education previous knowledge about the content social pressures education environment etc. will interact with the haptic interface distinctively e.g. an elderly person either being more precise and soft while pushing a positive feedback button or being more aggressive in the same movement for negative feedback due to distress.

The haptic interface executing on the user computing device registers the intentional user feedback being input as well interaction information with regard to how individual interacts with the haptic feedback markers . This interaction information may include for example a position where the user taps on a screen surface in a region of a haptic interface the tap pressure finger movements upon the feedback markers and other types of interaction information that would provide a unique signature of the intentional feedback by an individual. Such information could be indicative of the individual s distress anxiousness satisfaction or some other feeling toward certain content which can be used to further evaluate the individual s interaction with the digital educational material. For instance a user can select a like button haptic feedback marker to provide intentional feedback regarding the user s satisfaction with certain digital content. If the user taps hard on the like button high pressure tap on interactive screen this can be indicative of the user being highly satisfied with the given digital content.

These feedback events are registered and processed by the data analytics module in the user feedback processing system . The intentional user feedback evaluation engine implements statistical analysis methods to cross relate the intentional user feedback data and the profile data to generate utilization reports that summarize intentional reactions from the group of students towards the digital educational content in terms of organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and other factors. Thereafter system administrators educators and or other individuals can apply this information to manually fine tune the parameters in the composition rules that are applied to generate the digital educational content for the specific target group of students. By repeating this process the quality of the digital educational content being provided to the students can be improved over time.

Next the intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes a method to evaluate each gesture on a per user basis block . For this process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the intentional user feedback data A as well as gesture classification rules B rules to classify gestures per profile C and user profile data D. This process generates evaluation results E that provide an evaluation of the feedback results and gestures per user per component. This process will be further explained with reference to the data structures shown in .

Referring back to the information within tables A B C and D is processed by the intentional user feedback evaluation engine in block to generate the evaluation results E shown in . In particular shows a table data structure E having various fields to store the computed feedback results and the gestures used to select the associated user feedback grouped per user for the interaction to each component of the digital content. The fields include the same User index field the Component field and feedback index field FB included in the data structure A shown in as well as Gesture Evaluation field. In the Gesture Evaluation field specifies the evaluation results as or 0 symbols wherein denotes like denotes dislike and 0 denotes neutral.

Next the intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes a method to evaluate the user feedback on a per component basis block . For this process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the evaluation results E and the intentional user feedback data A to generate evaluation results F that provide a user evaluation of each component in the digital content. The process block cross relates the evaluation results E with the intentional user feedback data A to generate the evaluation results F shown in . In particular shows a table data structure F having various fields to store the results of the component evaluation. The fields include the same User index field and the Component field as shown in as well as Component Evaluation field. In the Component Evaluation field specifies the evaluation results as or 0 symbols wherein denotes like denotes dislike and 0 denotes neutral.

Referring back to as a next step in the process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes a method to evaluate each component on a per group basis block . For this process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the evaluation results F the user profile data D as well as group profile data G shown in to thereby generate evaluation results H . The process block cross relates the evaluation results F with user profile data D and group profile data G to generate the evaluation results H .

Referring back to as a next step in the process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the evaluation results H to determine a quality of the composed digital content block . With this process the intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes method to determine an overall rating for the composed digital content considering the evaluation results H to generate quality data I. The quality data I provides a rating of the quality of the composed digital content e.g. Low Averages Good etc.

The intentional user feedback evaluation engine then executes a report generating process block to generate a report J using the quality data I and the evaluation results H. In one embodiment of the invention the report J summarizes the information provided by the quality data I and the determined group evaluations per component as set forth in the evaluation results H. Thereafter the report J can be utilized by system administrators educators and other parties to evaluate the quality of the digital content thus validating the quality of the composition rules that are used to generate the digital content. If desired the system administrator etc. can manually modify the composition rules with the goal of improving the quality of the digital content being generated by the automated content generation process to specific individuals or specific groups of individuals etc.

The system of provides for non subjective evaluation of automatically generated digital content e.g. education material based on non intentional signals obtained through a haptic interface implemented by the user computing device . The user computing device in this embodiment comprises a haptic interface that is configured to capture and collect non intentional signals generated by user manipulation of the digital content . The non intentional signals include for example finger interaction with components of the digital content such as gestures tactile manipulation contact zooming actions tapping and others interactions. The user computing device outputs this information as utilization events to a user feedback processing system .

In the exemplary embodiment of the user feedback processing system implements methods to collect index group and analyze the distinct characteristics of the non intentional user interaction with components of the digital content and then correlate this information to individual user profiles and social setting information e.g. the groups of students the way they are disposed in classes and parameters related to their social relationships . Similar to the system of the process of generates a report of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content in terms of organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and others factors. In particular the system of implements a protocol to validate the process of automated composition of digital content by providing methods to validate the parameters being applied by the composition rules based on non intentional user feedback. This process leads to possible reconsideration optimization and adjustment of parameters of the composition rules with the goal of continually improving the content generation process through non subjective evaluation of composition rules through analyzing the non intentional feedback input obtained through user interaction with components of the digital content via the haptic interface.

More specifically in the user feedback processing system a data analytics module receives the user utilization events from the computing device and stores indexes and aggregates the utilization events in the form of non intentional user feedback data that is maintained in a data store of non intentional user feedback data . The data analytics module further maintains a data store of profile information which comprises information that is maintained in the data store of profile information utilized in the content generation system .

A non intentional user feedback evaluation engine utilizes a data store of classification rules and data to process the non intentional user feedback data and profile data provided by the data analytics module and generate information that is stored and maintained in a data store of evaluation results and reports . The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine compiles distinct features of non intentional user feedback obtained through user interaction and manipulation of components of the digital content via the haptic interface and group behavior towards the digital content . The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine correlates this information to the profile data and social setting information used by the composition rules to generate reports of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content in terms of e.g. organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and other factors.

As noted above embodiments of the invention can be implemented in the context of digital educational material. An illustrative scenario for processing non intentional user feedback signals is similar to that discussed above with regard to a private school that implements an educational program to deliver digital educational content to its students. In this example the educational digital content is delivered to students who interact and manipulate the digital content while viewing the content on an laptop computer or electronic tablet for example. A haptic interface executing on the computing device of each student registers non intentional signals generated by the manipulation of the digital educational material such as tactile manipulation gesture the way students tap upon specific components the components that students zoom in on and give more attention to time to change pages clicks on hyperlinks for alternative content and others types of interaction. In this scenario it is expected that variation of context such as end users profile and social setting will influence on how the end user interacts with the digital educational material. For example a student in distress and or with previous knowledge of the content being presented will tend to turn the pages faster and avoid zooming in on specific parts. Whereas students with interest and no previous knowledge of the content will interact with more elements stay longer in specific pages and so on.

These non intentional user feedback events are acquired and registered by the data analytics module as non intentional user feedback data . The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine implements methods to cross relate the non intentional user feedback data derived from i the student s non intentional signals acquired through the manipulation of the digital educational material via the haptic interface and Digital Content Material through the Haptic Interface and 2 the profile data of the students. The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine generates utilization reports that summarize non intentional signals from groups of student towards the generated digital educational material in terms of organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and others. Thereafter system administrators educators and other parties can apply this information to fine tune the parameters in the composition rules being applied to generate the digital educational material for the specific group of students. This process will continuously improve the quality of educational digital content being provided to the students over time.

Next the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes a method to evaluate each gesture on a per user basis block . For this process the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the non intentional user feedback data A as well as gesture classification rules B rules to classify gestures per profile C and user profile data D. This process generates evaluation results E which provides an evaluation of the feedback results and gestures per user per component. This process will be further explained with reference to the data structures shown in for example.

Referring back to the information within tables A B C and D is processed by the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine in block to generate the evaluation results E shown in . In particular shows a table data structure E having various fields to provide information regarding the evaluation results for the non intentional gestures per user per component. The fields include the User index field the Component field and a Gesture Evaluation field. In the Gesture Evaluation field specifies the evaluation results as or 0 symbols wherein denotes like denotes dislike and 0 denotes neutral.

Referring back to as a next step in the process the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes a method to evaluate each component on a per group basis block . For this process the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the evaluation results E the non intentional user feedback data A as well as user profile data D and group profile data G to thereby generate evaluation results H. The process block cross relates the non intentional user feedback data A with the group profile data G e.g. to generate the evaluation results H. In one embodiment of the invention the evaluation results H are similar in content and structure to the evaluation results H shown in and therefore a detailed discussion need not be repeated.

Next the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine uses the evaluation results H to determine a quality of the composed digital content block . With this process the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine executes method to determine an overall rating for the composed digital content considering the evaluation results H to generate quality data I. The quality data I provides a rating of the quality of the composed digital content e.g. Low Averages Good etc.

The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine then executes a report generating process block to generate a report J using the quality data I and the evaluation results H. In one embodiment of the invention the report J summarizes the information provided by the quality data I and the determined group evaluations per component as set forth in the evaluation results H. Thereafter the report J can be utilized by system administrators educators and other parties to evaluate the quality of the digital content thus validating the quality of the composition rules that are used to generate the digital content. If desired the system administrators etc. can manually modify the composition rules with the goal of improving the quality of digital content material being generated by the automated content generation process.

The system of comprises a user feedback processing system that is configured to process intentional user feedback data and non intentional user feedback data using techniques such as discussed above with reference to for example. More specifically as shown in the user feedback processing system comprises a data analytics module an intentional user feedback evaluation engine a non intentional user feedback evaluation engine and an engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules . Similar to the embodiments of the systems and discussed with reference to for example the data analytics module receives the user interaction events from the computing device and stores indexes and aggregates the interaction events in the form of intentional user feedback data obtained through user interaction with haptic feedback markers which is maintained in a data store of intentional user feedback data A as well as non intentional user feedback data obtained through user interaction with content components which is maintained in a data storage of non intentional user feedback data B. The data analytics module further maintains a data store of profile information comprising user and group profile data .

For example in the context of the above illustrative scenario where students interact with the digital educational content a haptic interface of the computing device captures intentional user feedback through the haptic feedback markers and registers non intentional user feedback signals generated by the manipulation of the digital educational material. Such non intentional user feedback signals can be signals generated as a result of tactile manipulation gesture based on the manner in which students tap up specific displayed elements the elements that students zoom in on and give more attention to the time spent on certain content pages clicks on hyperlinks for accessing alternative content and others types of interactions of non intentional user feedback indicative of an individual s reaction interest or lack of interest neutrality etc. towards digital content rendered by the computing device.

Again as noted above it is expected that the variation of context such as an individual s profile and social setting will influence on how the individual interacts with the digital educational content or other content. For example an individual in distress and or with previous knowledge of content being presented will tend to turn the pages faster and avoid zooming in on specific elements. Whereas in individual with interest and no previous knowledge of the content will interact with more elements stay longer on specific content pages and so on. As a further example individuals of different ages and from diverse socio education and cultural backgrounds e g influenced by level of education previous knowledge about the content social pressures education environment etc. will interact with the haptic interface touch screen surface distinctively for example an elderly person either being more precise and soft while pushing a positive feedback button or being more aggressive in the same movement expressing negative feedback due to distress.

The intentional user feedback evaluation engine utilizes information within a data store of classification rules and data to process the intentional user feedback data A and profile data provided by the data analytics module using methods discussed above with reference to for example to generate information that is stored and maintained in a data store of evaluation results and reports . In particular as noted above the intentional user feedback evaluation engine generates reports of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content based on the intentional user input data captured through haptic feedback markers and the group behavior towards the digital content.

The non intentional user feedback evaluation engine utilizes information within the data store of classification rules and data to process the non intentional user feedback data B and profile data provided by the data analytics module using methods discussed above with reference to for example to generate information that is stored and maintained in a data store of evaluation results and reports . In particular as noted above the non intentional user feedback evaluation engine generates reports of summarized group reaction towards the generated digital content based on non intentional user feedback signals generated by the manipulation of the digital content through a haptic interface of a computing device.

The engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules is configured to utilize information contained within evaluation reports generated by the intentional and non intentional user feedback evaluation engines and to automatically adjust the composition rules that are used to generate the digital content. In particular as explained in further detail below the engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules implements methods to process and analyze the summary reports e.g. reports J and J showing group reaction towards the generated digital content based on i the intentional user feedback data obtained through the haptic feedback markers e.g. buttons check lists and other interaction elements in haptic interfaces and ii the non intentional user feedback data e.g. gestures tactile manipulation contact zooming actions tapping and others .

The engine is configured to analyze and cross relate the summary report information with parameters used by the composition rules and the components of the generated digital content . The engine utilizes statistical analysis techniques to evaluate distinct characteristics of the interactions in the summary report information output from the evaluation engines and classifies their meaning and infers the users perception of the quality of the digital content in terms of organization of memory and learning focus and attention perception categorization and preference motivation and performance learning and others. The engine applies advanced algorithms for optimization and machine learning to adjust the parameters utilized by the composition rules with the goal of improving the quality of material being generated by this process. In this regard the user feedback processing system is configured to dynamically adjust and optimize the automated content composition process implemented by the content generation system through the automatic optimization and adjustment of parameters of the composition rules .

For example in the system depicted in the engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules will access the intentional and non intentional user feedback data A and B and collect information from the reports of summarized group reaction for haptic feedback markers and non intentional gestures generated by the user feedback evaluation engines and . This information comprises for example a table of evaluation results per component per group of users e.g. information in data structure H and a table of evaluation results of non intentional signals per component per group of users. The computation in block yields a table of overall rating evaluation per group per component.

Next the engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules will determine an evaluation rating for each composition rule block . This process cross relates information from the table of overall rating evaluation per group per component as determined in block with a table of composition rules per component A as shown in and generates a table of component evaluation per composition rule B as shown in . In particular shows a data structure A in the form of a table which includes various fields to store composition rules that are applied to generate each component of the digital content being analyzed. The fields include a Rule field that lists composition rule index or Rule and a Component field that list an index of the associated component that was generated using the given composition rule. For example indicates that rule R was used to compose Component and that rule R was used to compose Components and for example.

Moreover shows a data structure B in the form of a table which includes various fields to store an overall evaluation of each component per a composition rule applied to that component. This data structure B indicates for example that the application of composition rule R to compose Component is favorable i.e. evaluation indicator whereas the application of composition rule R to compose Components and is unfavorable.

Referring back to the process in block generates an evaluation rating per composition rule in particular an overall evaluation rating per composition rule. For each composition rule whose evaluation rating is not negative negative determination in block e.g. the evaluation rating is positive no adjustment is made to that composition rule block . On the other hand for each composition rule with a negative evaluation affirmative decision in bock a process is executed to determine an adjustment to that composition rule block . In this process the engine for self adjustment of composition rules will process the data structure B identify composition rules with negative evaluations.

In one embodiment of the invention the process in block to determine an adjustment to a composition rule is implemented using a method which calculates an adjustment to be applied for a selected composition rule as a variation of a weight value associated with the composition rule applied to compose specific components for a target group profile. The process generates an estimate in an amount in which the given weight value is reduced taking into consideration the negative feedback that results based on the use of the given composition rule applied to compose the digital content.

The engine for automatic adjustment of composition rules will use the adjustment value for a given composition rule to modify a table of composition rules C as shown in . In particular illustrates a data structure C in the form of a table of composition rules comprising fields to store information regarding a list of composition rules classified by weight to be applied to generate specific components of digital content provided to a given group of users with certain group profiles. In particular as shown in the composition rules table C comprises a Rule index field a Component index field a Group Profile field and a Weight value field. The Weight value field specifies a weight value to be used in selecting a given composition rule to apply to compose a given component of content for a given group profile.

In the system of by automatically adjusting a parameter e.g. weight value utilized by the composition rules the process implemented by the automatic composition module will utilize dynamically updated composition to improve the quality of the digital content that is delivered to a target group of users. Over time an iterative update and adjustment of the composition rules will serve to continuously improve the quality of digital content being delivered to various groups of users.
