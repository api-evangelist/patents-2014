Embodiments are generally related to information processing and more particularly to a data distribution fabric for use in scalable graphics processors.

Multi core graphics processing units have become normalized among computing systems ranging from system on a chip SOC integrated circuits to high end discrete graphics processors. In the real of high end graphics multi core solutions are the primary method of increasing graphics processing performance. For SOC solutions the use of multi core graphics processors allows a reduction in system power while allowing high performance during periods of high graphics processor workload.

However the increase in the number of graphics cores within a component creates scalability issues when developing graphics processing solutions that span multiple power and performance segments. The multi core communication solutions used in high end graphics products are not suitable for low power products due to issues of cost and power consumption. The communication solutions used in low power graphics generally do not provide sufficient performance for high end graphics solutions. For example one graphics core communication solution is to couple the various graphics processors via unique data distribution channels. However using unique communication channels presents difficulties for designing graphics processors that are intended to span multiple power and performance segments.

In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a block image transfer BLIT engine to perform two dimensional 2D rasterizer operations including for example bit boundary block transfers. However in one embodiment 2D graphics operations are performed using one or more components of the graphics processing engine GPE . The graphics processing engine is a compute engine for performing graphics operations including three dimensional 3D graphics operations and media operations.

The GPE includes a 3D pipeline for performing 3D operations such as rendering three dimensional images and scenes using processing functions that act upon 3D primitive shapes e.g. rectangle triangle etc. . The 3D pipeline includes programmable and fixed function elements that perform various tasks within the element and or spawn execution threads to a 3D Media sub system . While the 3D pipeline can be used to perform media operations an embodiment of the GPE also includes a media pipeline that is specifically used to perform media operations such as video post processing and image enhancement.

In one embodiment the media pipeline includes fixed function or programmable logic units to perform one or more specialized media operations such as video decode acceleration video de interlacing and video encode acceleration in place of or on behalf of the video codec engine . In on embodiment the media pipeline additionally includes a thread spawning unit to spawn threads for execution on the 3D Media sub system .

In one embodiment the 3D Media subsystem includes one or more internal caches for thread instructions and data. In one embodiment the subsystem also includes shared memory including registers and addressable memory to share data between threads and to store output data.

In one embodiment the GPE couples with a command streamer which provides a command stream to the GPE 3D and media pipelines . The command streamer is coupled to memory which can be system memory or one or more of internal cache memory and shared cache memory. The command streamer receives commands from the memory and sends the commands to the 3D pipeline and or media pipeline . The 3D and media pipelines process the commands by performing operations via logic within the respective pipelines or by dispatching one or more execution threads to the execution unit array . In one embodiment the execution unit array is scalable such that the array includes a variable number of execution units based on the target power and performance level of the GPE .

A sampling engine couples with memory e.g. cache memory or system memory and the execution unit array . In one embodiment the sampling engine provides a memory access mechanism for the scalable execution unit array that allows the execution array to read graphics and media data from memory. In one embodiment the sampling engine includes logic to perform specialized image sampling operations for media.

The specialized media sampling logic in the sampling engine includes a de noise de interlace module a motion estimation module and an image scaling and filtering module . The de noise de interlace module includes logic to perform one or more of a de noise or a de interlace algorithm on decoded video data. The de interlace logic combines alternating fields of interlaced video content into a single fame of video. The de noise logic reduces or remove data noise from video and image data. In one embodiment the de noise logic and de interlace logic are motion adaptive and use spatial or temporal filtering based on the amount of motion detected in the video data. In one embodiment the de noise de interlace module includes dedicated motion detection logic e.g. within the motion estimation engine .

The motion estimation engine provides hardware acceleration for video operations by performing video acceleration functions such as motion vector estimation and prediction on video data. The motion estimation engine determines motion vectors that describe the transformation of image data between successive video frames. In one embodiment a graphics processor media codec uses the video motion estimation engine to perform operations on video at the macro block level that may otherwise be computationally intensive to perform using a general purpose processor. In one embodiment the motion estimation engine is generally available to graphics processor components to assist with video decode and processing functions that are sensitive or adaptive to the direction or magnitude of the motion within video data.

The image scaling and filtering module performs image processing operations to enhance the visual quality of generated images and video. In one embodiment the scaling and filtering module processes image and video data during the sampling operation before providing the data to the execution unit array .

In one embodiment the graphics processing engine includes a data port which provides an additional mechanism for graphics subsystems to access memory. The data port facilitates memory access for operations including render target writes constant buffer reads scratch memory space reads writes and media surface accesses. In one embodiment the data port includes cache memory space to cache accesses to memory. The cache memory can be a single data cache or separated into multiple caches for the multiple subsystems that access memory via the data port e.g. a render buffer cache a constant buffer cache etc. . In one embodiment threads executing on an execution unit in the execution unit array communicate with the data port by exchanging messages via a data distribution interconnect that couples each of the sub systems of the graphics processing engine .

The graphics processor receives batches of commands via the ring interconnect . The incoming commands are interpreted by a command streamer in the pipeline front end . The graphics processor includes scalable execution logic to perform 3D geometry processing and media processing via the graphics core s A N. For 3D geometry processing commands the command streamer supplies the commands to the geometry pipeline . For at least some media processing commands the command streamer supplies the commands to a video front end which couples with a media engine . The media engine includes a video quality engine VQE for video and image post processing and a multi format encode decode MFX engine to provide hardware accelerated media data encode and decode. The geometry pipeline and media engine each generate execution threads for the thread execution resources provided by at least one graphics core A.

The graphics processor includes scalable thread execution resources featuring modular cores A N sometime referred to as core slices each having multiple sub cores A N A N sometimes referred to as core sub slices . The graphics processor can have any number of graphics cores A through N. In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a graphics core A having at least a first sub core A and a second core sub core A. In another embodiment the graphics processor is a low power processor with a single sub core e.g. A . In one embodiment the graphics processor includes multiple graphics cores A N each including a set of first sub cores A N and a set of second sub cores A N. Each sub core in the set of first sub cores A N includes at least a first set of execution units A N and media texture samplers A N. Each sub core in the set of second sub cores A N includes at least a second set of execution units A N and samplers A N. In one embodiment each sub core A N A N shares a set of shared resources A N. In one embodiment the shared resources include shared cache memory and pixel operation logic. Other shared resources may also be included in the various embodiments of the graphics processor.

In one embodiment the execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In one embodiment the execution units in the array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in the execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical ALUs or FPUs for a particular graphics processor. The execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements quad word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements double word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements . However different vector widths and register sizes are possible.

One or more internal instruction caches e.g. are included in the thread execution logic to cache thread instructions for the execution units. In one embodiment one or more data caches e.g. are included to cache thread data during thread execution. A sampler is included to provide texture sampling for 3D operations and media sampling for media operations. In one embodiment the sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to the thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. The thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to the thread execution logic . The thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects have been processed and rasterized into pixel data the pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In one embodiment the pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. The pixel shader then executes an API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program the pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via the thread dispatcher . The pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in the sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In one embodiment the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In one embodiment the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In one embodiment the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format varies by embodiment. In one embodiment the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format an instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. An instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. The exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src src and one destination . In one embodiment the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC where the instruction opcode JJ12 determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In one embodiment instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits and allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is exemplary. In one embodiment a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. mov cmp . The move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb e.g. 0x0x and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb e.g. 0x01 . A flow control instruction group e.g. call jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 . A miscellaneous instruction group includes a mix of instructions including synchronization instructions e.g. wait send in the form of 0011xxxxb e.g. 0x30 . A parallel math instruction group includes component wise arithmetic instructions e.g. add mul in the form of 0100xxxxb e.g. 0x40 . The parallel math group performs the arithmetic operations in parallel across data channels. The vector math group includes arithmetic instructions e.g. dp4 in the form of 0101xxxxb e.g. 0x50 . The vector math group performs arithmetic such as dot product calculations on vector operands.

The command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher component that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by the command streamer . The vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. The vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to the execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the execution units A B are an array of vector processors having an instruction set for performing graphics and media operations. The execution units A B have an attached L1 cache that is specific for each array or shared between the arrays. The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In one embodiment the graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. A programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of the hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to the graphics pipeline . If tessellation is not used the tessellation components can be bypassed.

The complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to the execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . The geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . The geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Prior to rasterization vertex data is processed by a clipper which is either a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions. In one embodiment a rasterizer in the render output pipeline dispatches pixel shaders to convert the geometric objects into their per pixel representations. In one embodiment pixel shader logic is included in the thread execution logic .

The graphics engine has an interconnect bus interconnect fabric or some other interconnect mechanism that allows data and message passing amongst the major components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the execution units A B and associated cache s texture and media sampler and texture sampler cache interconnect via a data port to perform memory access and communicate with render output pipeline components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the sampler caches and execution units A B each have separate memory access paths.

In one embodiment the render output pipeline contains a rasterizer and depth test component that converts vertex based objects into their associated pixel based representation. In one embodiment the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render and depth buffer caches are also available in one embodiment. A pixel operations component performs pixel based operations on the data though in some instances pixel operations associated with 2D operations e.g. bit block image transfers with blending are performed by the 2D engine or substituted at display time by the display controller using overlay display planes. In one embodiment a shared L3 cache is available to all graphics components allowing the sharing of data without the use of main system memory.

The graphics processor media pipeline includes a media engine and a video front end . In one embodiment the video front end receives pipeline commands from the command streamer . However in one embodiment the media pipeline includes a separate command streamer. The video front end processes media commands before sending the command to the media engine . In one embodiment the media engine includes thread spawning functionality to spawn threads for dispatch to the thread execution logic via the thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the graphics engine includes a display engine . In one embodiment the display engine is external to the graphics processor and couples with the graphics processor via the ring interconnect or some other interconnect bus or fabric. The display engine includes a 2D engine and a display controller . The display engine contains special purpose logic capable of operating independently of the 3D pipeline. The display controller couples with a display device not shown which may be a system integrated display device as in a laptop computer or an external display device attached via an display device connector.

The graphics pipeline and media pipeline are configurable to perform operations based on multiple graphics and media programming interfaces and are not specific to any one application programming interface API . In one embodiment driver software for the graphics processor translates API calls that are specific to a particular graphics or media library into commands that can be processed by the graphics processor. In various embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL supported by the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or in one embodiment both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

The client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In one embodiment a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In one embodiment the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in the data field of the command. For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In one embodiment the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode. In one embodiment commands are aligned via multiples of a double word.

The flow chart in shows a sample command sequence . In one embodiment software or firmware of a data processing system that features an embodiment of the graphics processor uses a version of the command sequence shown to set up execute and terminate a set of graphics operations. A sample command sequence is shown and described for exemplary purposes however embodiments are not limited to these commands or to this command sequence. Moreover the commands may be issued as batch of commands in a command sequence such that the graphics processor will process the sequence of commands in an at least partially concurrent manner.

The sample command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In one embodiment the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. A pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

A pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. A pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In one embodiment a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

A pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . The pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

Return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. The graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. The return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

The 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. The 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders the 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

The 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In one embodiment a register write triggers command execution. In one embodiment execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

The sample command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. The media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

The media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . The media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. The media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

Media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In one embodiment all media pipeline state must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from the media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In one embodiment GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In one embodiment the 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions .

A hybrid data distribution fabric may be used as interconnecting logic for an embodiment of a graphics processor featuring scalable GPUs. In one embodiment the hybrid fabric includes one or more physical data channels operating over a shared bus with one or more programmable virtual channels on each physical channel. The virtual channels may be arbitrated independently with channel access negotiated separately per virtual channel. Traffic over the virtual channels may be classified into one or more traffic classes. In one embodiment a prioritization system allows virtual channels and traffic classes to be assigned a relative priority for arbitration. In one embodiment traffic balancing algorithms operate to maintain substantially equal bandwidth and throughput to each node coupled to the fabric. In one embodiment the hybrid fabric data distribution logic operates at a higher clock rate than the nodes couples to the fabric allowing a reduced bus width while maintaining bus throughput. In one embodiment each shared bus is separately clock gated when idle and sends an early indication of upcoming activity to trigger a bus wake event.

The fabric connector is a fabric node that can receive buffer transmit and re transmit packets of data along the hybrid fabric . The hybrid fabric connector in one embodiment receives a packet on one channel of the hybrid fabric and switches the packet by re transmitting the packet over a different channel. An embodiment of the hybrid fabric connector couples with the graphics core cache . The connector writes data destined for the graphics core into the graphics core cache and reads data from the graphics core cache for transmission to shared memory or to a different graphics core. Each graphics core has a core identifier and a hash identifier that are used to address data packets on the hybrid fabric and to perform traffic load balancing across the fabric nodes.

The hybrid fabric bus may include a single bus line or multiple bus lines. In one embodiment the hybrid fabric bus includes multiple programmable data channels over which packet based data messages are transmitted for each graphics core . The multiple channels of the hybrid fabric bus are shared between the multiple graphics cores and support multiple traffic classes of data. The number of channels is configurable based on the number of graphics cores the graphics core workload and the utilization and capacity of the memory in the graphics processing system e.g. local shared cache system memory etc. .

In the exemplary block diagram of sixteen graphics cores are assembled in a mesh topology. In one possible configuration four layers each having four graphics cores are stacked. A first layer includes four graphics cores where each graphics core couples with a counterpart graphics core in a second layer . Next each graphics core in the second layer couples with a counterpart graphics core in the third layer . Next each graphics core in the third layer couples with a counterpart graphics core in a fourth layer . Finally each graphics core in the fourth layer couples with shared resources including shared memory. The number of layers and the number of cores per layer is exemplary and embodiments are not so limited and multiple topologies are supported. The hybrid fabric may be configured to enable communication between multiple graphics cores arranged in differing topologies based on die size bandwidth and throughput requirements.

An example arbitration algorithm is the stack optimization algorithm used for memory bound traffic. The graphics processor cores shown in each couples with a respective hybrid fabric connector e.g. hybrid fabric connector of . The hybrid fabric connectors couple the interconnected cores with a region of shared memory . Table 1 below illustrates the results of an exemplary channel arbitration algorithm to balance memory bound traffic between five graphics cores and shared memory.

As shown in the Channel 0 column of Table 1 each core is configured to originate memory bound data on channel 0 while switching pass through traffic from other cores to other channels. For example a memory bound data packet is transmitted from graphics core zero on channel 0. Core one switches the packet to channel four because the stack optimization algorithm specifies that memory bound traffic from core zero is to pass through on channel four. Thus core two switches the packet to channel three. Core three switches the packet to channel two. Core four switches the packet to channel one. While and Table 1 illustrate an exemplary algorithm for an exemplary type of traffic on the hybrid fabric. Other algorithms may be used for other types of traffic. In one embodiment differing types of traffic are grouped into differing traffic classes to better facilitate traffic management.

Each virtual channel may be assigned multiple traffic classes. A traffic class e.g. is a division of traffic that is related for arbitration. Each virtual channel may carry up to N traffic classes. Each class of traffic is assigned to a specific virtual channel through programming fuses configuration registers etc. . Up to L classes of traffic types may be assigned to a given virtual channel.

Table 2 above shows an exemplary traffic class to virtual channel assignment as illustrated in . The hybrid fabric classifies each unit of incoming traffic and may include logic to ensure that the incoming unit travels within its assigned virtual channel. In one embodiment data transmission over the channels occurs in first in first out FIFO order and channel arbitration occurs based on virtual channels. Traffic within a virtual channel may block the transmission of additional traffic on the same virtual channel. However a given virtual channel will not block a different virtual channel. Accordingly traffic on different virtual channels is arbitrated independently.

In one embodiment coherency is maintained during data transmission for individual threads operating on a graphics core at both the graphics core cache and at the hybrid fabric connector node for the graphics core. The hybrid fabric nodes route traffic originating from a single thread within the same traffic class and the traffic classes are assigned to a specific virtual channel. Data within a single traffic class on a single virtual channel is transmitted in FIFO order. Thus data from a single thread is strictly ordered when transmitted via the hybrid fabric and per thread coherency is maintained to avoid read after write or write after read data hazards. In one embodiment thread group coherency is maintained via a global synchronization mechanism with shared memory.

Table 3 above shows an exemplary traffic class prioritization. A priority algorithm may be programmed to determine the priority to assign to each of the traffic classes. The programmable traffic class priorities allow the traffic classes to be used as an arbitrary traffic grouping mechanism where traffic may be grouped within a class merely to maintain coherency or specific traffic can be assigned a high priority and dedicated to high priority data. For example class 1 and class 4 each assigned to virtual channel one B may be assigned a priority of 2. Class 2 and class 5 each assigned to virtual channel zero A may be assigned a priority of 1. A traffic class N may be assigned to virtual channel two C with a priority of 3. Traffic in class 2 may be latency sensitive data that should be transmitted as soon as possible or should not be blocked by other traffic classes while traffic in class 1 may be moderately latency sensitive traffic from a single thread that is grouped to maintain coherency.

A traffic class may be assigned a priority relative to all traffic classes or relative to the priority of traffic classes on the same virtual channel. In one embodiment the priority scheme is designed by assigning weights to the traffic classes where a higher weight indicates a higher priority. A fair prioritization algorithm may be employed where each participant is guaranteed a minimum amount of bandwidth to prevent starvation. In one embodiment an absolute priority algorithm is used under certain circumstances where higher priority traffic always blocks lower priority.

Where absolute priority is in use additional algorithms are in place to prevent a communication deadlock. The use of virtual channels and traffic classes in combination reduces the likelihood of a deadlock as a single traffic class having absolute priority on a given virtual channel does not block traffic on a different virtual channel. In one embodiment if a starvation condition or a potential deadlock is detected on one virtual channel blocked traffic classes may be re assigned to a different virtual channel.

Table 4 below shows an exemplary virtual channel prioritization. As with traffic classes each virtual channel may also receive a priority and channel arbitration can factor the relative priorities of the virtual channels. For example data traffic on virtual channel 2 may have a higher relative priority than data on other virtual channels. A weighted priority system may be employed with virtual channel prioritization where a higher weight indicates a higher priority. A fair priority system or an absolute priority system may be used.

Having determined that a first channel is available the source node can transmit the message from the source node towards a target node as shown at block . The message can be received by a first node on the shared bus of the hybrid fabric as shown at block . The first node may be coupled to one of multiple graphics processors coupled by the hybrid fabric. Based on several factors such as the source node the target node the traffic class and the channel in which the message is received the first node may switch the message from the first node to the second node on the shared bus as shown at block . The first node may switch the message as part of a traffic balancing protocol such as the stack optimization algorithm of Table 1 or as part of a directional routing protocol depending on the graphics core topology served by the hybrid fabric. In one embodiment channel access is determined based on multiple virtual channels carried across a shared bus where channel access for each virtual channel is arbitrated separately from other virtual channels.

In one embodiment the hybrid fabric interconnect logic operates at a higher clock frequency than the nodes connected by the interconnect logic. A single message between nodes may be divided into a number of separate messages based on the frequency ratio between the fabric interconnect and the nodes. A fabric node may transmit a message during each of the node s clock cycles and the message is divided into multiple messages to be sent between clock cycles. The division of the message is transparent to the fabric node allowing a reduction in the width of the physical layer of the interconnecting logic while maintaining performance.

In one embodiment the interconnect logic of the hybrid fabric is power managed and clock gated. A distributed approach may be used for clock gating where each bus line uses a local gated clock that is disabled when the bus is idle. Each bus issues an early indication of incoming activity which enables the clock when a message is to be received along the bus or a virtual channel associated with the bus. Accordingly power is dissipated only on active buses. While idle a bus consumes only static power and is otherwise in a low power state.
