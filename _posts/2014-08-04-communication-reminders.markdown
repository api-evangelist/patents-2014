This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 123 923 filed May 20 2008 and entitled COMMUNICATION REMINDERS assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8 798 249 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

This application is also related to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 123 818 filed May 20 2008 and entitled CONVEYING CALL SUBJECT MATTER WITH VOICE DATA which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Telephony generally refers to the use of equipment to provide voice communication over distances. Digital telephony uses digital features for telephone services and systems. Internet protocol IP telephony uses the Transmission Control Protocol Internet Protocol TCP IP to provide digitized voice data communications. Computer Telephony Integration CTI enables computers to make and receive voice fax and data calls which can also include telephone directory voicemail and caller identification ID services. Users can become overwhelmed with the amount of information made available by various communication methods which can lead to missed opportunities. For example a user may not be able to answer a call from an external network that is directed to the user s desktop device on a Voice Over IP VOIP network while in a meeting or on a cellular call.

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Embodiments are configured to provide reminders associated with communications and other events. In an embodiment components of a communication system can operate to generate maintain and implement reminders associated with communications and other events. A reminder can be automatically generated and scheduled for one or more users of the communication system when a user is unavailable or unable to take a call. Reminders can be generated to include information which can be used to establish a communication event for a subsequent communication associated with each reminder.

These and other features and advantages will be apparent from a reading of the following detailed description and a review of the associated drawings. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed.

Embodiments are configured to provide reminders associated with communications and other events. In an embodiment components of a unified communication UC system can operate to generate maintain and implement reminders associated with communications and other events. Various client devices and applications of the UI system can be configured to enable access to multiple systems application devices and also be used to communicate with one another including generating and implementing reminders associated with communication events. For example a user associated with the UC system can use a computer telephony device to decline or otherwise defer a call wherein a future call can be automatically scheduled for a time when the user is available to take a call.

In another embodiment a reminder application which includes executable instructions can be included with each communication device of a UC system. The reminder application or component can be used to automatically reschedule a call when a called party is unavailable or unable to take a call. The reminder application can also be used to schedule other events and to trigger notifications at scheduled times. For example the reminder application can be used to schedule one or more appointments wherein an associated reminder or notification can be presented on a user device to alert the user of each appointment.

Call reminders can be used for users who receive numerous incoming calls and other communications during the typical day wherein the users may not be in a position to take all calls. As described below call reminders can be used to reschedule calls and or complete the rescheduled calls at some subsequent time. Call reminders can be used in conjunction with calendar and contact applications and data repositories to make calls to designated parties wherein the time for calls can be specified by a designated party or some other party. Call reminders can also be set on a recurring basis and include a snooze property of alarms. Other embodiments are described below.

As shown in the communication system includes device systems associated with a user and devices systems associated with an nth user user N . That is the communication system can include a plurality of users and associated devices systems. For example the devices systems can include advanced computerized telephony devices desktop computing devices handheld mobile devices applications and or other communication and computing devices. Each user may have multiple devices systems at his her disposal. The devices systems can be configured to execute communication applications to implement voice communications data communications video communications etc. The devices systems can also be configured to facilitate traditional phone calls through an external connection such as through a private branch exchange PBX and a public switched telephone network PSTN .

The devices systems associated with user include web service client s . For example user can use email applications calendar applications contact and other applications for business and personal uses. The devices systems also encompass communication device s . For example user can use a computerized telephony device that includes advanced functions as part of a networked environment. Additionally user may be using a cellular phone personal data assistant PDA laptop and desktop computers for business and personal needs.

As shown in communication device s includes a reminder component and a session initiation protocol SIP stack . In an embodiment the reminder component can be configured as a web services sub component which can be used to create retrieve modify and or delete call reminders but is not so limited. In one embodiment the reminder component can be configured to generate CREATE ITEM GET ITEM and other messages which can be used to create and populate call reminders with information associated with a subsequent communication event.

The SIP stack can operate to create and parse SIP messages. Business logic for each client is built on top of the SIP stack to assist in establishing communications between user devices systems. As described below the SIP stack can operate to communicate an invite request parse the incoming provisional 1xx responses and any final response such as 486 Busy Here for example. Client diagnostic information can be included in an additional header of a SIP message. The client diagnostic information can be used to communicate a reason for failure of establishment of the invite dialog. The additional header can also be used to pass on pertinent information that can be used to create call reminders.

The devices systems associated with user N also include web service client s such as email applications calendar applications contact and other applications for example. The devices systems also encompass communication device s such as a computerized telephony device that includes advanced functions as part of a networked environment. User N also may be using a cellular phone personal data assistant PDA laptop and desktop computers for business and personal needs. Communication device s also includes a reminder component and a session initiation protocol SIP stack . As described above in an embodiment the reminder component can be configured as a web services sub component that can operate to create retrieve modify and or delete call reminders. Operation and use of the SIP stack has been described above in conjunction with SIP stack for the user devices systems . A more detailed description of the functionality and operation of the reminder components is described further below.

With continuing reference to the communication system also includes a communication server which operates to facilitate communications between end users but is not so limited. In an embodiment the communication server can be configured as a UC server which includes registration presence instant messaging routing conferencing VOIP and other functionality. For example the communication server can be implemented using the functionality of the Microsoft Office Communications Server. The communication server also includes real time conferencing hosted on servers inside a firewall and full featured VOIP functionality that can be integrated with a PBX infrastructure. The communication server can operate to communicate SIP requests to clients at all registered endpoints including performing reverse lookup operations when extensions are dialed.

The communication system also includes a collaboration server . For example the collaboration server can be deployed to include the functionality of the Microsoft Exchange Server . The collaboration server can be configured to manage user email mailboxes scheduling calendar information and contact information but is not so limited. As an example the collaboration server can be deployed using functionality and features of the Microsoft Exchange Server email messaging and communication infrastructure to manage user calendars contacts email etc. According to an embodiment and as shown in the collaboration server includes a web services component and an auto attendant .

In one embodiment the web services component includes a number of sub components which can include but are not limited to a managed folder service component an exchange data service component an availability service component a synchronization service component a notification service component and or an auto discover service component. One or more components can be configured to be responsible for different services and roles of the collaboration server . The auto attendant can be configured as an auto attendant menu system which can operate to transfer callers to an extension of a user or department without the intervention of a receptionist or an operator.

In one embodiment the auto attendant can assist in creating a call reminder when a call is redirected to a user s voicemail. For example the auto attendant can be used when a user calls a number from the PSTN or a non IP based network into an enterprise which has a communication server deployed with a PBX and a media gateway and or a mediation server. Incoming calls can be re directed to the auto attendant component which can be hosted on the collaboration server or the communication server . The auto attendant can be configured as an interactive voice response system IVRS which can includes an interactive voice menu and calendar integration. Correspondingly call reminders can be created if a call issues from a non intelligent or non SIP device.

The collaboration server can also operate to generate manage and or maintain reminders including call reminders for users of the communication system . For example the collaboration server can use information associated with a declined call to create a call reminder for a subsequent call. Call reminders can be stored in a database component associated with the collaboration server stored locally with the devices systems of each user and or stored in a dedicated store. Each reminder component can also operate to create call reminders for each user or both users depending upon a particular configuration. For example reminder component can automatically operate to create a call reminder for user when user N declines to take a call or is otherwise unavailable. Continuing with the example the reminder component can also be configured to create a call reminder for user N or can request the collaboration server to create a reminder for one or both users of the system .

As described briefly above call reminders can be generated or created to include information associated with a communication event. For example call reminders can include contact scheduling and other information for identifying one or more parties and a scheduled time to participate in a subsequent call. In an embodiment a call reminder can be created to include but not limited to user contact card details such as display name URIs phone numbers address title company etc. reminder time s e.g. GMT local time etc. reminder type such as one way for calling party two way for calling and called party recurring etc. recurring reminder settings snooze option settings preferred end point details such as which devices systems to call at a particular time etc. For example a user may want to receive calls on a cellular phone at certain times at an office phone at other times and at a home phone for all other times.

Call reminders can be used to remind one or more communication parties of a communication event. For example a scheduled call reminder can be used to inform a user of a scheduled call or some other event. When a scheduled time associated with a call reminder occurs or is to occur visual audible tactile and or other cues can issue from an associated communication or computing device to alert or inform a user of a scheduled call or event. For example a user may configure a communication device to issue a distinct audible cue to alert the user of a call reminder. When a call reminder notification issues a user may choose to take the call delay the call further by selecting a snooze period cancel the call or reschedule and create a call reminder for some subsequent time.

As described above according to an embodiment call reminders can be created using the call reminder component which can be associated with a communication device. For example a call reminder component can be installed and activated for use on each communication or computing device of a user. In one embodiment each call reminder component can use information associated with a communicated diagnostic message to obtain information for use in creating call reminders. Each call reminder component can also be configured to use the functionality of a web service client to request information for use in creating call reminders. For example a web service client can be used to generate an extensible markup language XML request message that complies with the simple object access protocol SOAP standard to the collaboration server when requesting information that can be included in a call reminder.

Upon receiving an information request the collaboration server can operate to verify credentials provided by a requesting client. Once the credentials are verified the collaboration server can automatically parse the XML included in the request to identify the information requested by the client. The collaboration server can then generate a SOAP response that contains XML data that represents the requested information including any strongly typed objects and the associated properties. For example SOAP requests can be used as part of modification creation and or deletion operations for call reminders associated with a user s mailbox being managed and maintained by the collaboration server . The collaboration server can then communicate SOAP responses which include the XML data to the requesting client in an HTTP response. The requesting client can then operate to deserialize the SOAP response or responses and use XML data to reconstruct any strongly typed objects.

In one embodiment the web services component of the collaboration server can be deployed to include a client access server role to obtain information for inclusion in a call reminder. For example clients can connect to the collaboration server using an hypertext transfer protocol secure HTTPS connection wherein the collaboration server has the client access server role installed in an Active Directory service site. If a target mailbox is part of a different Active Directory site a source client access server can create an HTTPS connection to the target client access server.

The target client access server can also obtain information to be included in a reminder by communicating over a messaging application programming interface MAPI to the collaboration server that has a mailbox server role installed. After receiving the requested information from the collaboration server the target client access server can send the requested information back to the source client access server. However if the target mailbox is in the same Active Directory site the client access server can use MAPI to communicate with the collaboration server to obtain the information. The client access server can then provide the data back to the requesting client.

As described above embodiments are configured to create and use call reminders for communication events. For example call reminders can be used in conjunction with a desktop communication or computing device laptop smart phone personal data assistant PDA ultra mobile personal computer and or other computing or communication devices to remind a user of a scheduled call. Components of system described above can be implemented as part of networked distributed and or other computer implemented and communication environments.

The system can be employed in a variety of computing communication environments. For example the system can used with devices systems having networking security and other communication components configured to provide communication functionality with other computing and or communication devices. While a communication architecture is shown in functionality of various components can be also combined or further divided. Additionally the various embodiments described herein can be used with a number of applications systems and other devices and are not limited to any particular implementation or architecture.

Moreover certain components and functionalities can be implemented in hardware and or software. While certain embodiments include software implementations they are not so limited and they encompass hardware or mixed hardware software solutions. Also while certain functionality has been described herein the embodiments are not so limited and can include more or different features and or other functionality. Accordingly the embodiments and examples described herein are not intended to be limiting and other embodiments are available.

UC server provides registration presence and routing functionalities. Presence functionality enables the system to route calls to a user using any of the client devices assigned to the user based on default and or user set policies. For example if a call reminder is scheduled and the user is not available through a regular phone the scheduled call may be forwarded to the user s mobile phone and if the mobile phone is not answered an auto attendant may be used to automatically schedule a subsequent call reminder. Since the end devices can handle additional communication modes UC server is configured to provide access to additional communication modes e.g. instant messaging video communication etc. through access server .

Access server can reside in a perimeter or other network and enables connectivity through network with other users in one of the additional communication modes. Access server can also be used to obtain information to be used in creating one or more call reminders. Mail server can be used to store call reminders and to provide information to create call reminders to requesting clients. Mediation server mediates signaling and media to and from the PBX . Mediation server may also act as a Session Initiation Protocol SIP user agent e.g. Business To Business User Agent B2BUA . PBX includes a PBX controller and associated traditional phone devices. PBX facilitates receipt and origination of calls through PSTN which can include a combination of networks managed by a number of providers.

To illustrate the variety of communication systems that may be integrated employing various embodiments PBX may adhere to Session Initiation Protocol SIP . The Session Initiation Protocol SIP is an application layer control signaling protocol for creating modifying and terminating sessions with one or more participants. It can be used to create two party multiparty or multicast sessions that include Internet telephone calls multimedia distribution and multimedia conferences. SIP is designed to be independent of the underlying transport layer.

SIP clients use Transport Control Protocol TCP or User Datagram Protocol UDP to connect to SIP servers and other SIP endpoints. SIP is primarily used in setting up and tearing down voice or video calls. However it can be used in any application where session initiation is a requirement. These include event subscription and notification terminal mobility and so on. Voice and or video communications are typically done over separate session protocols such as Real Time Protocol RTP RTP control protocol RTCP etc.

SIP is intended to provide a signaling and call setup protocol for IP based communications that can support a superset of the call processing functions and features present in the PSTN. The focus of SIP is call setup and signaling. SIP is also designed to enable the building of such features in network elements known as proxy servers and user agents. These are features that permit familiar telephone like operations dialing a number causing a phone to ring hearing ring back tones or a busy signal.

SIP enabled telephony networks can also implement many of the more advanced call processing features. SIP can be described as a client server protocol that enables peer to peer connectivity due in part because each side can function as a client and a server at the same time. Correspondingly SIP requires a relatively simple core network with intelligence distributed to the network edge and embedded in endpoints end devices systems built in either hardware and or software . SIP features can be implemented in the communicating endpoints i.e. at the edge of the network as opposed to being implemented in the network. While some example systems are described with SIP features many other VOIP and communication protocols exist and embodiments may be implemented with any of those protocols using the principles described herein.

According to various embodiments users can share the same identity in various communication systems. Correspondingly an address associated with a shared identity can be used in inbound and outgoing calls. The shared identity is not limited to a phone number. The identity may take any form depending on the integrated networks such as a telephone number a SIP URI or some other identifier. The shared identity can also be configured according to different formats. For example a shared identity may include a phone number and a SIP URI using an alias .

As an example a user may be able to receive calls through a variety of end devices. Call reminders can also be retrieved and used from each one of the end devices. When a call reminder is associated with a Direct Inward Dial DID number the call can be communicated to the UC system and the PBX . A UC device system registered to the user can be configured to receive a VOIP call from UC server if the call reminder designates that the user would like to receive the call on a VOIP enabled device. As a result the device system can receive a Remote Call Control RCC notification of a call associated with the call reminder.

If user N chooses to answer the incoming call at the users proceed with the call. At if user N declines the call or if user is directed to voicemail a call reminder can be created for the uncompleted call or a call reminder can be updated if the current call is associated with a previously scheduled call reminder. As described above reminder component can use diagnostic information provided by the device system of user N to create a call reminder when user N declines or chooses to defer a call. For example user N s device system client can be configured to communicate a diagnostic message to reschedule the call including a rescheduled time and a reminder type which can be used to create a call reminder for one or more users.

Reminder component and collaboration server can also be used to create call reminders for one or both users. Call reminders can be created to include a user display name URI phone number s recurring reminder settings snooze settings end point preference and or other details and communication information. At if a scheduled time associated with the call reminder occurs the device system of one user or both users if a call reminder was created for both parties can operate to issue an alert to notify the user s of the scheduled call. If a user chooses a delay time using a snooze option or opts to reschedule and defer the call for some time at the flow returns to and the call reminder can be updated or a new call reminder can be created. Otherwise the flow returns to and the scheduled call is attempted based in part on information associated with the call reminder.

At as part of the communication protocol of an embodiment user B s device system communicates a 100 Trying message at and a 180 Ringing 183 Session Progress message at . The 100 Trying message can be used to indicate that an action is being taken to process the call. The 180 Ringing 183 Session Progress messages can be used to indicate that the INVITE message has been received and that an alert is issuing for the call e.g. ring tone vibrate etc. .

At due in part to the unavailability of user B to take the current call user B s device system communicates a 486 Busy Here message which includes a header with information requesting a rescheduling of the call including a scheduled time and or a reminder type. For example user B may have declined the call by pressing a touch screen interface to decline the call and selecting a time for rescheduling the call from a drop down menu see . At a reminder component associated with user A s device system operates to create a call reminder to reschedule the call for user A.

As shown in the call reminder under an embodiment can include user B s URI contact details reschedule time reminder type snooze enable recurring details and a preferred contact endpoint. As described above according to one embodiment the reminder component can communicate with a dedicated server to obtain the additional information to be included in the call reminder. For example the call reminder can communicate with an exchange server provided by Microsoft to obtain additional call reminder information.

At a reminder component associated with user B s device system operates to create a call reminder to reschedule the call for user B. Alternatively the reminder component associated with user A s device system or a dedicated server can create the call reminder for user B. The call reminder for user B under an embodiment can include user A s URI contact details reschedule time reminder type snooze enable recurring details and a preferred contact endpoint. Again the reminder component associated with user B can communicate with dedicated server to obtain additional information to be included in the call reminder. Alternatively if a number if dialed the reminder component can operate to perform a reverse number or URI lookup in a contact database. The contact database may be as simple as a list of phone numbers or as complicated as a global address book also associated with electronic mail instant messaging and other applications.

At when the reminder time occurs or is to occur at some designated time e.g. an early notice preceding the actual call reminder time user A is notified in a user interface UI of the device system of a notification e.g. a toast which includes the contact details and a preferred contact endpoint associated with the call reminder. If user A decides to make the call to user B based on the call reminder at a call request is received by user B s device system with another INVITE message at or about the scheduled time. At user B s device system communicates a 100 Trying message and a 180 Ringing 183 Session Progress message at . If user B takes the call a 200 OK message is communicated to user A s device system at . While a certain order and number of operations are described with respect to the order and or number of operations and or components can be modified and or reconfigured according to a desired implementation. Accordingly other embodiments are available.

In one example Alice makes a call to her manager Bob to talk to him about the status of a task assigned to her. However Bob is involved in a planning meeting and would like to tell Alice to call him back an hour later. Accordingly a call reminder can be created which includes information to ensure that Alice calls him back an hour later. Bob also wants to make sure that Alice calls before the end of day at which time the information becomes useless. For example a call reminder can be created reading Call with Alice 11 30 AM on both his own and Alice s exchange calendar which can be displayed in an associated communication device or devices.

In another scenario Alice is away on a business trip to Hong Kong. Steve the UC designer is trying to reach her to talk about some UI updates. He calls her but is directed to voicemail. Since Alice is available to take a call for an hour interval from 5 PM 6 PM in her current time zone a call reminder can be created as soon as Steve reaches her voicemail for a portion or all of the published time. The call reminder can be created for Steve and or Alice to call at 5 15 5 30 PM Alice s time zone since Steve is also available at that time. A dedicated server can be used to create the reminder with any attached subject to ensure that the communication occurs. Call reminders can be made available at all end points where calendar data for the user can be retrieved via an exchange or other server.

In various embodiments the networked environment can include a topology of servers clients devices Internet service providers communication media and other network functionality. The networked environment can also include a static or dynamic topology. The term client can refer to a client application device and or system. While an integrated telephony system employing call reminders may involve greater or fewer components certain components are discussed below.

A more advanced digital telephony system such as a UC system employing call reminder functionality may reside side by side with mobile networks public switched networks etc. and communicate through those networks with the help of PBX systems gateways etc. Mediation server s can be configured to provide signaling and media exchange between various systems. The networked environment may also include a UC server for registering routing and other functionality and a mail server for maintaining user and other information such as calendar information call reminder information contact information etc.

Data associated with an architectural configuration e.g. user names phone numbers call policies configuration records etc. can be stored in one or more data stores such as data stores which can be directly or indirectly accessed by servers and or clients or managed through a database server . The backbone of the UC system can be implemented using a UC network UCN which can use a number of protocols such as SIP RTP etc. Client devices systems e.g. can be configured as UCN user end points. Users can receive access and or use call reminders using a client device or one or more client applications executing on a client device.

UCN can include a secure network such as an enterprise network an unsecure network such as a wireless open network the Internet or some other network or combination of networks. UCN provides communication between nodes described herein. By way of example and not limitation UCN can include wired media such as a wired network or direct wired connection and or wireless media such as acoustic radio frequency RF infrared and or other wireless media. Many other configurations of computing devices applications data sources data distribution systems may be employed to implement call reminder functionality. Moreover the networked environment of is included for illustrative purposes. Embodiments are not limited to the example applications modules devices systems or processes.
