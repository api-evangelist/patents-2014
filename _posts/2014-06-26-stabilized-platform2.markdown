The described technology relates to a stabilized platform comprising a support frame a supporting structure rotatably mounted relative to the support frame around a main rotation axis a supported structure rotatably mounted relative to the supporting structure around a secondary rotation axis substantially perpendicular to the main rotation axis.

Such stabilized platforms are notably provided on aircraft land vehicles or ships. They carry a payload comprising apparatuses notably optronic equipment such as cameras.

It is possible to provide a stabilized platform in which the supporting structure is guided in rotation by two bearings attached to the support frame spaced apart from each other along the direction of the main rotation axis the payload being attached in a supported structure integrated to the supporting structure and arranged between two other bearings spaced apart along the direction of the secondary rotation axis. The supporting structure encompasses the supported structure.

Such a platform however has several drawbacks.

Further the requirement of perfect alignment of the two guiding bearings of the supported structure and of the two bearings of the supporting structure requires accurate machining.

A purpose of the described technology is to propose a robust stabilized platform with a simple structure and allowing facilitated access to the payload.

For this purpose the object of the described technology is a stabilized platform of the aforementioned type wherein the supporting structure comprises at least one support intended to receive a load and the support is guided in rotation by a main bearing positioned on a single side of the support according to the secondary rotation axis.

According to another aspect the object of an embodiment is also a stabilized platform comprising a support frame a supporting structure rotatably mounted relative to the support frame around a main axis of rotation and a supported structure rotatably mounted relative to the supporting structure around a secondary rotation axis substantially perpendicular to the main rotation axis wherein the supporting structure comprises a central bearing able to guide in rotation the supported structure and the supported structure comprises two supports laid on either side of the central bearing according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis and each intended for receiving a load.

The stabilized platform described above may also comprise one or more of the following features taken individually or according to any technically possible combination s the central bearing is positioned in a plane containing the main rotation axis the supports extend on either side of the supporting structure according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis the supported structure comprises a central trunnion rotatably mounted in the central bearing each support being positioned at one end of the central trunnion according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis the support frame comprises a first and a second bearing for guiding in rotation the supporting structure the first and second bearings being mounted on the support frame via a system of suspensions the supporting structure comprises a central ring housing the central bearing and first and second end trunnions extending on either side of the central ring according to the direction of the main rotation axis and the support frame comprises a first and second bearing the first end trunnion and the second end trunnion being rotatably mounted in the first and the second bearing respectively the stabilized platform further comprises a first drive assembly able to drive into rotation the supported structure which first drive assembly comprises a first electric motor the first drive assembly being housed in the central ring the first drive assembly further comprises a first angular position sensor the central bearing being laid out according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis between the first electric motor and the first angular position sensor and at least one of the supports is accessible through an aperture provided in the support frame.

The stabilized platform according to an embodiment is for example intended to be mounted on the chassis of a movable machine such as an aircraft a ship or a land vehicle.

By stabilized platform is meant a device intended to receive a payload which is controlled so as to orient it accurately regardless of the movements and of the outer environment of the machine on which it is mounted.

When the stabilized platform is mounted on the movable machine with the secondary rotation axis B vertical the rotation around the main rotation axis A corresponds to an elevational movement while rotation around the secondary rotation axis B corresponds to a circular movement.

The support frame comprises a first and a second bearing able to ensure guiding in rotation of the supporting structure relative to the support frame . More specifically the first and second bearings are spaced apart from each other along the direction of the main rotation axis A. In the illustrated example the bearings are bearings with ball bearings. They each comprise two adjacent ball bearings.

The first and second bearings are mounted on the support frame via a suspension system. The latter comprises a first and second suspension ring schematically illustrated in . The first and second suspension rings are respectively interposed between the support frame and the first and second bearings . They each have a substantially annular shape centered on the main rotation axis A. The first suspension ring surrounds circumferentially the first bearing . The second suspension ring surrounds circumferentially the second bearing .

The supporting structure substantially extends along an extension direction coinciding with the direction of the main rotation axis A. It comprises a central bearing able to guide in rotation the supported structure around the secondary rotation axis B. In the first embodiment the central bearing is positioned in the plane containing the main rotation axis A. The supporting structure substantially has the shape of a beam.

More specifically the supporting structure comprises a central ring and first and second end trunnions extending on either side of the central ring according to the direction of the main rotation axis A.

More particularly the supporting structure extends according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B between a first plane Pand a second plane P the planes Pand Pbeing normal to the secondary rotation axis B and spaced apart along the direction of the secondary rotation axis B.

According to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B the end trunnions substantially extend between the first plane Pand the second plane P. The central ring also extends between the planes Pand P.

The first and second end trunnions are rotatably mounted in the first and second bearings respectively. Thus the supporting structure is guided in rotation around the main rotation axis A by the first and second bearings of the support frame .

The central ring delimits a central through orifice centered on the secondary rotation axis B. In the illustrated example the central ring has a substantially annular shape centered on the secondary rotation axis B.

The central bearing is housed in the central ring . It extends in a plane containing the main rotation axis A. In the illustrated example the main bearing is a ball bearing comprising bearing. It comprises a pair of coaxial adjoining roller bearings . The roller bearings are in particular angular contact ball bearings. Each roller bearing comprises an outer ring secured to the supporting structure and an inner ring secured to the supported structure the inner and outer rings delimiting between them a rolling path on which roll the balls of the roller bearing .

In the first embodiment the two roller bearings of the pair of roller bearings are arranged on either side of the main rotation axis A according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. They are symmetrical relative to a plane containing the main rotation axis A in particular relative to the plane normal to the secondary rotation axis B. The intersection point C1 C2 of the load lines of the roller bearings are located on the secondary rotation axis B. They are symmetrical relative to the main rotation axis A. The roller bearings of the pair of roller bearings are selected so that the intersection points C1 C2 of the load lines of each roller bearing are as far as possible from the main rotation axis A according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B on the same side of the main rotation axis A as the considered roller bearing . The intersection points C1 and C2 are schematically illustrated in .

The tilting rigidity of the central bearing is adjusted to the need of rigidity of the assembly. It is all the higher the greater the distance between the intersection points C1 and C2 of the load lines of the roller bearing and the greater the diameter of the central bearing .

The supported structure substantially extends along an extension direction coinciding with the direction of the secondary rotation axis B.

The central trunnion substantially extends according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B perpendicular to the mean plane of the supporting structure . The supports are arranged on either side of the central trunnion according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B.

The supports arranged on either side of the central bearing according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. They extend for example symmetrically on either side of the supported structure according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. The supports protrude outside the supported structure . The supports each extend outside of the space delimited between the first and second planes P P. In particular they each extend entirely outside of the space delimited between these first and second planes P P.

The supported structure is guided in rotation around the secondary rotation axis B by the central bearing . The central trunnion is rotatably mounted in the central bearing . Each support is guided in rotation around the secondary rotation axis B by the central bearing which is positioned on a single side of the respective support .

The supported structure is thus guided in rotation by a single central bearing . As described earlier this single central bearing for example comprises two adjacent coaxial roller bearings advantageously adjoining each other.

The mass in rotation around the secondary rotation axis B i.e. the total mass of the supported structure has its center of gravity as close as possible to the secondary rotation axis B.

The supports are attached to opposite ends of the central trunnion according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. The supports are in particular attached to the central trunnion removably for example via a respective mounting bracket. Thus each support is able to be detached from the central trunnion and to be replaced with another support depending on the needs and notably depending on the nature of the payload.

The supports are intended to receive a load in particular a payload and or a mass. The payload for example comprises optronic sensors such as thermal infrared near infrared or visible cameras laser pointers laser illuminators and or laser telemeters. It further comprises a gyroscope or inertial system able to measure the orientation of the stabilized platform in an absolute reference system. According to an embodiment each support bears a payload. Alternatively only one of the supports bears a payload while the other support receives a balancing weight.

The supports for example have the shape of a tray comprising housings for receiving the payload. They extend facing the supporting structure on either side of the central orifice of the central ring . The length of the supports taken parallel to the main rotation axis A is notably greater than the diameter of the central trunnion .

As an example a support is illustrated in comprising a base wall oriented towards the supporting structure and two side walls protruding away from the supporting structure from the base wall and notably substantially parallel with each other. The support is open on two side walls as well as on its side opposite to the supporting structure . The payload housed in this support is thus accessible from the side of the support opposite to the supporting structure as well as through two lateral sides. The support illustrated as an example in also includes a base wall and two side walls . The side walls are connected together through a transverse stiffening wall extending on at least one portion of their height taken along the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. Optionally at least one side wall comprises one or several housings for receiving the payload notably in the form of through orifices adapted to the interfaces of the sensors selected for the application.

According to an embodiment the supports are identical. Alternatively they have different shapes. The shape of each support notably depends on the payload which it receives.

Each support is freely accessible through its side opposite to the supporting structure according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. In particular the support frame comprises an aperture for accessing the load housed in the supports .

The stabilized platform further comprises a first drive assembly able to drive into rotation the supported structure . The first drive assembly is schematically illustrated in . It is housed in the central ring . It comprises a first electric motor able to drive into rotation the supported structure a first angular position sensor and a first electric revolving joint not shown able to provide the electric power supply of the payload received in the supports .

In the example illustrated in the first electric motor and the angular position sensor are arranged in the central ring on either side of the central bearing according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B.

The first electric motor conventionally comprises a rotor and a stator . It is a motor with an internal rotor. In particular the first electric motor is a flat motor further called a disc motor. The rotor is secured to the central trunnion of the supported structure which it drives into rotation. The stator circumferentially surrounds the rotor . It is fixedly mounted relative to the supporting structure .

The first angular position sensor is able to measure the angular position of the rotor of the first electric motor . In the example illustrated in the first angular position sensor a resolver. Conventionally the resolver comprises a rotor provided with a primary coil and a stator provided with two secondary coils. The rotor of the resolver is secured in rotation to the shaft of the first electric motor . The stator of the resolver is fixed relative to the supporting structure . The primary coil of the rotor of the resolver is powered with an excitation voltage. The rotation of the rotor relative to the stator induces in the secondary coils of the stator a voltage the value of which depends on the angular position of the rotor of the resolver and therefore of the rotor of the first electric motor .

The stabilized platform further comprises a second drive assembly able to drive into rotation the supporting structure . The second drive assembly is schematically illustrated in . It is positioned at one of the bearings of the support frame . It has a structure similar to the one of the first drive assembly. In particular it comprises a second electric motor able to drive into rotation the supporting structure a second angular position sensor and a second electric revolving joint not shown able to provide the electric power supply of the first electric motor and of the payload received in the supports . In the example illustrated in the second electric motor and the second angular position sensor are adjacent according to the direction of the main rotation axis A.

The second electric motor comprises a rotor secured to the first end trunnion and a stator fixedly mounted relative to the support frame . The second angular position sensor comprises a rotor and a stator similar to those of the first angular position sensor . The rotor is secured in rotation to the shaft of the second electric motor . The stator of the resolver is fixed relative to the support frame .

The use of a single bearing for guiding in rotation the supported structure simplifies the design and the manufacturing of the platform by avoiding having to align several bearings with each other. Further the reduction in the number of bearings contributes to reducing the total mass of the stabilized platform .

The beam shape of the supporting structure simplifies the manufacturing of this structure as well as the mounting of the platform . It also improves the rigidity of the supporting structure thereby reducing the risks of deformation of the platform . Further it increases the space available for the payload the latter being no longer limited by the dimensions of an encompassing supporting structure .

For a same transported payload the beam shape of the supporting structure generates a reduction in the total mass of the platform .

The layout of supports intended to receive the payload on either side of the supporting structure facilitates access to the payload notably during its integration into the supports or during maintenance operations. Further it gives the possibility of providing interchangeable removable supports depending on the received payload. This particular layout of the supports is notably made possible by the shape of the supporting structure which no longer encompasses the supported structure and which therefore in particular does not encompass the supports for the payload.

The mounting of the first and second bearings on the support frame via the system of suspensions is advantageous. Indeed the system of suspensions filters the vibrations transmitted by the support frame . The relative flexibility of the suspension system guarantees the alignment of the bearings and without requiring costly manufacturing tolerances of the support frame .

A stabilized platform according a second embodiment is illustrated in . Only the differences relative to the stabilized platform according to the first embodiment will be described hereafter.

The stabilized platform according to the second embodiment differs from that according to the first embodiment in that the supporting structure only comprises one support intended to receive a load. Further the supporting structure of the stabilized platform has a different shape from that of the stabilized platform according to the first embodiment.

As illustrated in the stabilized platform comprises a supported structure comprising a central trunnion and a single support . The support is attached to one end of the central trunnion according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. An end of the central trunnion opposite to the end is free i.e. it does not bear any support.

The supported structure is guided in rotation by a central bearing of a supporting structure . The central bearing is positioned on a single side of the support according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B below the support on . The trunnion is rotatably mounted in the central bearing .

The supported structure is thus guided in rotation by a single bearing . In the illustrated embodiment and as described with reference to the first embodiment the single central bearing comprises two coaxial adjacent roller bearings advantageously adjoining each other. The tilting rigidity of the central bearing is adjusted to the need of rigidity of the assembly. It is all the higher the greater the distance between the intersection points C1 and C2 of the load lines the roller bearings and the larger the diameter of the central bearing .

The supported structure is asymmetrical relative to the main rotation axis A. It is symmetrical relative to the secondary rotation axis B.

The features of the support as well as its relationship with the central trunnion are identical with those described with reference to the first embodiment.

The supporting structure is symmetrical relative to the secondary rotation axis B. It is asymmetrical relative to the main rotation axis A. It comprises a central ring housing the central bearing surrounded on either side thereof according to the direction of the main rotation axis A by first and second end trunnions . The first and second end trunnions each extend along a same direction coinciding with the main rotation axis A. In particular they are each substantially symmetrical relative to the main rotation axis A. As shown in they extend between a first plane Pand a second plane P the planes Pand Pbeing parallel with each other and containing a direction parallel to the main rotation axis A.

As is visible in the supporting structure has the shape of a crank shaft the central bearing being off centered relative to the end trunnions . The central bearing is spaced away from the main rotation axis A according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. In particular it is shifted relative to the end trunnions according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. The central bearing thus extends outside of the space delimited by the planes Pand P.

The supporting structure delimits between the end trunnions and facing the central bearing a reception space for receiving the support . This reception space is symmetrical relative to the secondary rotation axis B. The support is received at least partly into the reception space between the end trunnions . It is substantially symmetrical relative to the secondary rotation axis B.

The layout of the central bearing relative to the main rotation axis A is selected so that the mass rotating around the main rotation axis A i.e. the mass of the supported structure and of the supporting structure has its center of gravity as close as possible to the main rotation axis A.

Further the mass rotating around the secondary rotation axis B i.e. the mass of the supported structure has its center of gravity as close as possible to the secondary rotation axis B.

The central trunnion extends along the direction of the secondary rotation axis B perpendicularly to the mean plane of the supporting structure . In the illustrated example it extends according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B beyond the end of the central bearing on the side of the support . At its free end it stops substantially at the end of the central bearing opposite to the support .

The supported structure only extends partly facing the support at the first and second end trunnions i.e. on a portion of two side faces of the support on the side of the supported structure . The support is freely accessible through its side opposite to the trunnion according to the direction of the secondary rotation axis B. In particular the support frame comprises an aperture for accessing the load housed in the support .

The layout of the drive assembly in the central bearing is identical with the one described with reference to the first embodiment.

The use of a single bearing for guiding into rotation the supported structure simplifies the design and the manufacturing of the platform by avoiding having to align several bearings with each other. Further the reduction in the number of bearings contributes to reducing the total mass of the platform .

The non encompassing shape of the supporting structure simplifies the manufacturing of the structure as well as the assembling of the stabilized platform. It also improves the rigidity of the supporting structure thereby reducing the risks of deformation of the platform. Further the space available for the payload is not limited along the direction of the secondary rotation axis B by the dimensions of an encompassing supporting structure. It is thus increased as compared with a stabilized platform with an encompassing supporting structure.

For the same transported payload the non encompassing shape of the supporting structure generates a reduction in the total mass of the platform .

The aperture provided in the support frame facilitates the access to the payload notably during its integration into the support or during maintenance operations.

The particular shape of the supporting structure with the offset central bearing allows obtaining significant stability of the platform in spite of the asymmetry of the supported structure relative to the main rotation axis A in particular resulting from the absence of the second support .
