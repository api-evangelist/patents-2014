title: Remote weapons charging handle adapter
abstract: A remotely-operated gun is mounted in a cradle having a linear actuator for charging the gun. A charging adapter that is fixed to the linear actuator enables different types of guns to be charged. The charging adapter is easily configured to accommodate different gun types.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to remotely operated weapons and in particular to charging mechanisms for remotely operated guns.

Remotely operated weapons may include a turret mounted on a vehicle or on a fixed or mobile carriage. The turret may include a frame for supporting a firearm. The firearm used in a remotely operated weapon may be a conventional human operated firearm. The firearm may be designed to be cycled manually or automatically for example by propellant gas or by gun recoil. The frame on which the weapon is mounted may accept multiple different weapon configurations. An example of a remotely operated weapon system is the U.S. military s Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station CROWS .

For a remotely operated gun a linear actuator may provide the input for the charging handle to move the weapon s bolt to the rear to enable feeding ammunition. After locking the bolt rearward the charging handle must then be returned forward to prevent weapon damage. The M240 Machine Gun Mark 48 Mk 48 Machine gun and M249 Machine Gun are gas operated automatic weapons which require charging moving the charging handle rearward and then forward to load and clear the weapon. When used on remote weapon stations the linear actuator typically provides the external input required to actuate these weapons. The linear actuator moves the weapon s bolt assembly to the rear position to cycle and feed the next round on the belt. On the linear actuator return stroke the charging handle is moved forward to the forward detent position.

While different remotely operated weapons may use the same mounting cradle for example the CROWS Multi Adapter Small Caliber MASC cradle these weapons often require different charging handle adapters because of different charging handle sizes and positions on the different weapons. The various adaptors are easily lost and do not allow for reliable return of the charging handle to the forward position.

A need exists for a simple apparatus and method for interfacing with different weapon charging handle configurations on a single gun cradle.

One aspect of the invention is remote weapons charging handle adapter for charging a gun having a forward and a rear end. The gun is mounted in a cradle having a linear actuator.

The adapter includes a flange portion fixed to the linear actuator and a housing fixed to the flange portion. The housing has an upper rear bearing surface a pair of side surfaces a forward surface and a rear stepped surface. A wire rope has a first end selectively engageable with one of a hard stop on the flange and a hard stop on the housing. A second end of the wire rope extends into an upper portion of the housing through a first spring and a piston such that the second end of the wire rope is translatable against the spring in a rear direction.

An arm block has a rear curved bearing surface and a front planar surface that bears against the rear stepped surface of the housing. A rod is fixed eccentrically to the arm block and extends through the housing. A second spring is disposed around the rod and bears against the forward surface of the housing and a spring stop on an end of the rod to thereby bias the arm block in a forward direction.

In a first configuration of the adapter the arm block extends transversely beyond one of the pair of side surfaces of the housing and in a second configuration of the adapter the arm block extends transversely beyond the other of the pair of side surfaces of the housing.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel remote weapons charging handle adapter RWCHA can be used with several different remotely operated guns. The gun is mounted in a cradle for example the CROWS Multi Adapter Small Caliber MASC cradle. The RWCHA can be used with for example the M240 Mk 48 and M249 machine guns and various series models of each type of machine gun. The RWCHA mounts to the existing cradle.

In general to move the charging handle or mechanism of the gun rearward in direction R adapter translates to the left in . Depending on the particular model or series of gun adapter pushes the charging handle or mechanism of the gun rearward using either bearing surface or bearing surface . Bearing surface is a rearward facing planar surface of housing . Bearing surface is a rearward facing curved surface formed in an arm block . The curved surface is shaped to distribute load evenly on the cylindrical charging handles of guns.

In general to move the charging handle or mechanism of the gun forward in direction F adapter translates to the right in . A loop portion of a wire rope engages the rearward surface of the weapon charging mechanism and the adapter pulls the charging mechanism in the forward direction F. Some gun models may have an automatic return for the charging mechanism in which case the adapter is not required to positively move the charging mechanism forward.

One end of wire rope includes a finger loop formed by a compression sleeve . Sleeve is constrained from translation in direction R by a stop fixed to flange portion . In the second configuration of adapter sleeve is constrained from rearward translation in direction R by a slot at the bottom of housing and by a spring detent that constrains wire rope from moving laterally out of slot . In the second configuration there is of course more of the length of wire rope available for loop portion .

Referring to the other end of wire rope passes through the rearward surface of housing through a compression spring and a piston and is anchored with a fitting against piston . Piston may be made of for example a plastic material. Spring provides some flexibility to the available length of wire rope to allow for different charging handle locations and variation in interface tolerances. A roll pin inserted through housing restrains translation of piston with respect to housing in forward direction F.

The position of arm block in the first and second configurations is best seen by comparing first configuration with second configuration . It is noted that wire rope and arm block are not mechanically connected. In it is seen that arm block extends outward in direction A beyond the side surface of housing . On the other hand in it is seen that arm block extends inward in direction B beyond the opposite side surface of housing . The two positions of arm block enable adapter to interface with different gun configurations as will be explained in more detail.

Referring to arm block includes rear curved bearing surface and a front planar surface . Arm block is biased against a rear facing stepped surface of housing . Arm block is biased against surface in the forward direction F by a compression spring that bears against a spring stop and a front surface of housing . Arm block is fixed to a rod that terminates at spring stop . Arm block is fixed in an off center or eccentric manner to rod so that arm block extends beyond side surface first configuration see or side surface second configuration see . The position of arm block is easily changed by manually pulling arm block in direction R beyond rear bearing surface of housing . Then arm block is rotated 180 degrees and gently allowed to spring back so that front planar surface is again abutting and biased against rear stepped surface of housing .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof
