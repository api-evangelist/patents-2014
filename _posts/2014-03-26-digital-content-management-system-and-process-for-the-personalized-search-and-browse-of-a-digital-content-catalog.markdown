This application claims priority to and all benefits of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 921 687 filed on Dec. 30 2013 and entitled Digital Content Management System And Process For The Personalized Search And Browse Of A Digital Content Catalog .

This invention relates to the real time merging of Contextual Metadata about a digital subscriber with static Digital Content Catalog metadata associated with a Digital Content Catalog to create a personalized search and browse result set for a Digital Content Storefront that allows access to and the purchase rental and subscription of content from the digital content catalog.

Generally a digital content catalog is stored in a database on a remote server and contains metadata associated with various types of digital content. The digital content may be digitized forms of various types of products such as movies videos music literature and other documents games applications and other collections of data. The digital content in this catalog may also relate to physical products and other hard goods which products might be available for purchase wherein the digital content catalog contains digitized information relating to these physical products.

The digital content catalog is used by a potential consumer referenced herein as a digital subscriber who accesses the digital content catalog through a remote computerized access device which may be a computer or other digital device such as a tablet smartphone game console Blu ray Player Recorder internet enabled television or any other similar access device. The access device contains a processor which runs a consumer storefront application which can be a native application an HTML application accessed by a browser or the like. The storefront application displays a computerized storefront associated with the digital content catalog.

Generally the digital content catalog and the metadata associated therewith is stored at and within a managed datacenter containing master storage devices which include digital storage media that is maintained on servers or other similar storage devices. The data stored on the servers is accessed through a data connection preferably a web based data connection which allows communications between the remote access device and the master storage device.

Entitlements for digital content can be obtained through various transactions and for example can be rented purchased or subscribed to through the digital content storefront and its consumer storefront application by the digital subscriber. In this regard the digital subscriber can search and access information from the digital content catalog in order to browse and select specific digital content to which the digital subscriber wishes to obtain entitlements. The consumer storefront application allows this search access and subscriber capability through the remote access device.

Typically a remote access device accesses and searches and then can acquire entitlements to the digital content catalog directly from the managed datacenter. However known systems of such direct distribution of digital content can be slower and less reliable particularly where bandwidth to the managed datacenter is restricted or overloaded.

It is an object of the invention to provide improved access to and distribution of digital content from a digital content catalog.

The present invention provides a technology and a process for delivering personalized search and browse results based on the a real time combination and merging of cached Digital Content Catalog metadata with Contextual Metadata associated with the Digital Subscriber. This Contextual Metadata can include information about the Digital Subscriber s entitlements recommendation set geography available pricing options upsells wish lists favorite lists parental control settings and content bookmarks as well as other personalized attributes of the Digital Subscriber. This Contextual Metadata is obtained by calling Web Services to evaluate configured Content Targeting Rules for better accessing Contextual Metadata.

More particularly better discovery results can be achieved by presenting a view of the Digital Content Catalog that is most relevant to a Digital Subscriber. This reliance can be achieved through personalization of search and browse results based on a Digital Subscriber s Contextual Metadata which can comprise location and other personal attributes understood about the Digital Subscriber. These personal attributes may be specifically known about the particular Digital Subscriber or even generalized estimations of traits which might apply to this Digital Subscriber based upon other known information.

To facilitate the delivery of personalized browse and search results static Digital Content Catalog metadata from the managed datacenter can be merged in real time with Contextual Metadata about a Digital Subscriber to filter content and provide personalized search and browse results to the Digital Content Storefront.

In accordance with this invention Digital Content is configured in a Digital Content Catalog maintained on digital media storage devices at a direct managed datacenter. Also in this Digital Content Catalog Content Targeting Rules are created with the purpose of providing personalized context for the Digital Subscriber in order to filter the Digital Content Catalog based on personalized data or attributes about the Digital Subscriber using the storefront. Digital Content Catalog metadata is stored in the Digital Content Catalog and available to the Digital Content Storefront by the web based connection between the remote access device being used by the Digital Subscriber and managed datacenter. When a search or other discovery method is conducted on the remote access device the system of the invention provides the access device and the Consumer Storefront Application of the Digital Content Storefront with the Digital Content metadata and the Contextual Metadata associated with the Digital Subscriber which metadata is merged and the result set filtered to provide a personalized display of information in the Storefront.

The Contextual Metadata preferably is stored in a Digital Subscriber Attribute Database located at the same managed datacenter which contains the Digital Content Catalog. However the Digital Subscriber Attribute Database may be stored on servers at another datacenter located remote from the storage site for the Digital Content Catalog.

The invention also includes at least one Content Delivery Network CDN which is maintained separate from each managed datacenter that maintains the Digital Content Catalog and or the Digital Subscriber Attribute Database. While one CDN may be used in a particular geographic location to serve all Digital Subscribers more preferably multiple CDNs may be provided at different geographic locations within a geographic area such as North America or at different locations worldwide such as in North America Europe and Asia Pacific which thereby locates the CDN geographically closer to the Digital Subscribers. A data request is directed to the appropriate CDN by the consumer storefront application depending upon the particular physical location of the Digital Subscriber.

The CDN maintains a cached copy of the Digital Content Catalog such that the Digital Content Storefront directly obtains the metadata associated with the Digital Content Catalog directly from the CDN which provides a real time elastic cloud cache for the delivery of the Digital Content metadata to the consumer storefront application. If the requested data is not present or up to date in the CDN the CDN redirects or forwards the data request to the appropriate managed datacenter which supplies the real time updated Digital Content Catalog metadata to the CDN.

In parallel with retrieving the Digital Content Catalog metadata from the CDN the consumer storefront application also requests and obtains the Contextual Metadata associated with the Digital Subscriber from the managed datacenter.

The present invention exhibits various features and advantages over known content management systems and processes.

A feature of this invention is for the Digital Content Catalog to be configured in a Catalog administration tool which creates and updates a digital content database to be stored in the digital content database in a managed datacenter and a copy of the Digital Content metadata propagated to at least one Content Delivery Network CDN .

Also a feature of this invention is for Targeting Rules to be configured in the Catalog administration tool and stored in the digital content database in the managed datacenter.

Another feature of this invention is for a Digital Content Storefront to request a filtered result set for searching and browsing the Digital Content Catalog.

Still further a feature of this invention is for the search and browse algorithm of the Digital Content Storefront to request a real time merge of cached Digital Content Catalog data from the CDN with personalized Contextual Metadata about a Digital Subscriber from the managed datacenter and based on this metadata filter the Digital Content Catalog result set in real time within the consumer storefront application or browser session and present the personalized result set to the Digital Subscriber on the access device.

Other objects and purposes of the invention and variations thereof will be apparent upon reading the following specification and inspecting the accompanying drawings.

Certain terminology will be used in the following description for convenience and reference only and will not be limiting. For example the words upwardly downwardly rightwardly and leftwardly will refer to directions in the drawings to which reference is made. The words inwardly and outwardly will refer to directions toward and away from respectively the geometric center of the arrangement and designated parts thereof. Said terminology will include the words specifically mentioned derivatives thereof and words of similar import.

Generally referring to the invention relates to a digital content management system comprising a technology and process. The content management system provides for personalized searching and browsing of digital content from a Digital Content Storefront based upon a real time contextual merge of cloud based Digital Content Catalog metadata and individualized consumer personalized Contextual Metadata wherein the Contextual Metadata and Digital Content Catalog metadata are respectively delivered from a set of consumer personalization web services provided at a managed datacenter in combination with a real time elastic cloud cache preferably provided by a Content Delivery Network .

The Digital Content Storefront operates on a computerized remote access device which includes a processor that runs a Consumer Storefront Application wherein the Consumer Storefront Application may be provided by a software application or web site viewed through a browser on the access device . The static Digital Content Catalog metadata is requested by and delivered to the Consumer Storefront Application via restful web services through a web based connection with the CDN wherein a URL request is served by the CDN .

Generally the CDN stores a cache copy of Digital Content Catalog metadata and is configured to origin to and communicate with the real time personalization web services if the Digital Content Catalog metadata is not cached on the CDN . If there are Digital Content Catalog updates that are not yet provided to the CDN such that the updated metadata invalidates the CDN cache metadata the personalization Web Services still provide near real time updates of the Digital Content metadata .

In parallel with the request for static Digital Content Catalog metadata via the CDN the Consumer Storefront Application makes a request for real time personalization Web Services to obtain personalized data or Contextual Metadata for the individual Digital Subscriber through web based connection . The Contextual Metadata is derived from the consumer data maintained at the datacenter . This personalized Contextual Metadata comprises various forms of data including entitlement details purchase information ratings parental control filtering and settings available upsells and recommendation sets. This Contextual Metadata can also include other information about the Digital Subscriber including geography available pricing options wish lists favorite lists and content bookmarks as well as other personalized attributes of the Digital Subscriber. These personal attributes preferably are details specifically known about the particular Digital Subscriber but can be generalized estimations of traits which might apply to this Digital Subscriber based upon other known information. The personalization Web Services then supplies the Contextual Metadata to the Consumer Storefront Application through the connection .

As shown in the Consumer Storefront Application therefore receives two inputs namely the Contextual Metadata relating to the specific Digital Subscriber and the Digital Content Catalog metadata . The two responses are received in the Personalization Settings and the Contextual Search Results and then synchronized or merged in a real time contextual merge in the Consumer Storefront Application . The Consumer Storefront Application thereby has a display which allows the Digital Subscriber to perform and view a Personalized Contextual Search and receive and browse Content Catalog Results . The Content Catalog Results provide a contextual and personalized result set of metadata selling data and interaction data which is unique to the individual i.e. the Digital Subscriber using the Consumer Storefront Application .

Entitlements for Digital Content can be rented purchased or subscribed to through the Digital Content Storefront by the Digital Subscriber. In this regard the Digital Subscriber can search and access information from the Digital Content Catalog through the CDN in order to browse and select specific Digital Content to which the Digital Subscriber wishes to obtain entitlements. The Consumer Storefront Application allows this search access and subscriber capability through the remote access device .

The digital content management system of the invention is therefore usable to speed the delivery of personalized search and browse results to the Consumer Storefront Application .

In accordance with this system of the present invention Digital Content can be filtered to create a highly scalable real time personalized search and browse result set based on merging cache Digital Content Catalog Metadata with personalized Contextual Metadata for a Digital Subscriber.

More particularly referring to the Digital Content is stored in the form of a Digital Content Catalog maintained on digital media storage devices at a content direct managed datacenter . In comparison to the access devices the Digital Content Catalog is stored in a database on a server that is remote from the access device while the access devices are personally associated with potential customers or consumers of the Digital Content. The Digital Content Catalog contains the metadata associated with various types of Digital Content which Digital Content may be digitized forms of a wide variety of types of products such as movies videos music literature and other documents games applications and other collections of data. The Digital Content in the Digital Content Catalog may also relate to physical products and other hard goods which products might be available for purchase or rental wherein the Digital Content Catalog may contain digitized information descriptions or abstracts relating to these physical products.

The managed datacenter contains master storage devices which include digital storage media that is maintained on servers or other similar storage devices. The Digital Content Catalog is managed by Catalog Web Services and which are provided by suitable processors and servers in the managed datacenter . The Digital Content Catalog data is stored on the servers and may also be provided to the CDN through data connections and which preferably are web based data connections that connect the managed datacenter with the CDN .

The Content Catalog metadata of the Digital Content Catalog is ingested or configured through a computer based content administration or publishing tool shown in and published to the Digital Content Catalog managed in the datacenter . The publishing tool is performed on a processor associated with the datacenter Web Services and creates the original Digital Content Catalog as well as issues updates and changes to the Catalog .

As will be described further herein Targeting Rules are also supplied through the configuration process of . The Targeting Rules are provided to filter Digital Content availability based on criteria such as requesting geography configured cross and upsells for the digital content entitlement rules such as the presence of specific rental purchase or subscription characteristics for a Digital Subscriber derived peer affinity group recommendations created from systematic grouping of Digital Subscribers with similar browse purchase and content rating characteristics the presence of purchased products for a Digital Subscriber configured wish lists and favorite lists of a Digital Subscriber and configured parental control settings of a Digital Subscriber. These Targeting Rules are associated with the Digital Content Catalog .

As referenced above at least one CDN is provided separate from each managed datacenter that maintains the Digital Content Catalog . While one CDN may be used in a particular geographic location to serve all Digital Subscribers it may be preferred that multiple CDNs may be provided at different geographic locations within a geographic area or at different locations worldwide which thereby locates the CDN geographically closer to the Digital Subscribers.

Each CDN maintains a cached copy of the Digital Content Catalog as a Cached Digital Content Catalog such that the Digital Content Storefront directly obtains the Digital Content Catalog metadata stored in that particular copy of the cached Digital Content Catalog . Therefore the CDN provides a real time elastic cloud cache for the delivery of the Digital Content metadata to the Consumer Storefront Application . The Cached Digital Content Catalog is updated by the Web Services .

While the Cached Digital Content Catalog may contain the same metadata in all of several CDNs duplication of the Cached Digital Content Catalog is not required. Depending upon the geographic location being served by a particular CDN there may be geographic preferences for some Digital Content of the Digital Content Catalog but not all. As such it may be desirable to only store a portion of the total Digital Content in a particular Cached Digital Content Catalog since the cached copy may be updated and expanded if there is an increase in demand for an omitted portion of the cached copy.

The method of publishing this Digital Content Catalog metadata to the Cached Digital Content Catalog allows for updating of changes in metadata wherein the updates are initiated from the datacenter and distributed to each CDN where appropriate. The publishing tool can maintain the Content Direct Catalog as well as updated metadata and the datacenter will queue metadata changes in an update queue so that the changes can be accessed by Metadata Update Service controlled through the Web Services . The Metadata Update Service can communicate with each CDN and find each of the related entities within a CDN cached version of the Catalog and invalidate any catalog metadata entitles which have been changed. As such any updated metadata entities must be fetched from the cache of the managed Digital Content Catalog and distributed to the CDNs before this updated metadata can be used by a Digital Content Storefront .

In this manner the managed datacenter stores the Digital Content Catalog and controls updates of Catalog metadata to this managed Digital Content Catalog . The datacenter also distributes the metadata and any updates to each CDN which is stored as a cached copy of the Digital Content Catalog and is updated where necessary by the Metadata Update Service . As such one or more copies of the Digital Content can be maintained at one or more geographic locations and these multiple locations can be managed by the datacenter . It also is possible to manage multiple CDNs through multiple datacenters .

Next as seen in the Digital Content Storefront can request applicable metadata from the cached Digital Content Catalog through an edge cached Content Delivery Network through a REST based Web Service . The Web Services operate to retrieve metadata at step and if the requested metadata exists in the cached Catalog this metadata is returned to the Web Services for subsequent retrieval by the Digital Content Storefront through connection .

If the requested metadata entities are not available in the Content Delivery Network edge cache or the entity has been invalidated in the Content Delivery Network edge cache due to an update the requested metadata will be fetched from a managed datacenter through a Web Service request indicated by connection which will return the updated Digital Content Catalog entities to the Content Delivery Network . The method for the retrieval of these Catalog entities is to forward a request for the Digital Content Catalog entities to the Web Services provided by application servers in the managed datacenter .

This method will increase the scalability and availability of Digital Content Catalog requests from the Digital Content Storefront to the Content Delivery Network as the Content Delivery Network can deliver an edge cached version of the Catalog . This method also ensures that changes to the Digital Content Catalog are populated out to the Content Delivery Network and the cached Catalog as changes are made to the managed copy of the Digital Content Catalog .

At the same time the Digital Content Storefront makes a request for Digital Content Catalog it makes a Web Services request for Contextual Metadata as seen in and . Contextual Metadata is derived from several properties passed in through the session of the request . As seen in if the IP location of the request is understood the Contextual Metadata will be evaluated to include the requesting IP address at processing step .

If the Digital Subscriber is known at the time of the request at processing step the Digital Subscriber session ID will also be passed so that Targeting Rules can take this information into consideration when evaluating its rules. This input data is passed to Personalization or Context Web Services provided through the managed datacenter and the application servers thereof. The input attributes are used to evaluate the configured targeting rules to return the appropriate Contextual Metadata .

The personalized Digital Subscriber information or consumer information which supplies the Contextual Metadata preferably is stored in a Digital Subscriber Attribute Database located at the same managed datacenter which contains the Digital Content Catalog . However the Digital Subscriber Attribute Database may be stored on servers at another datacenter located remote from the storage site for the Digital Content Catalog .

If the Digital Subscriber is a known user at step the respective consumer information and data associated with that Digital Subscriber is retrieved from the Database joined together at step and then merged with the geographic information at step . Contextual Metadata is then transmitted at step to the Web Services and returned through connection .

The Contextual Metadata is returned to the calling Digital Content Storefront application and merged in real time through a Real time Contextual Merger to filter the Content Catalog metadata and provide a personalized set of search and browse results to the Digital Content Storefront .

The Digital Content Storefront is provided through any suitable access device provided geographically and physically remote from the datacenter and the CDN . The access device is one of many different access devices that connect to and use the content distribution system of the invention. As the Consumer Storefront Application is used a video display is typically provided which would display a search screen or page from which the Personalized Contextual Search is performed. This affects a request for digital content metadata to the CDN and for the Contextual Metadata to the datacenter . The metadata details are then retrieved and merged at step and displayed on a search page as Content Catalog Results . The Digital Subscriber can then browse these results and purchase license or obtain entitlements to any desired digital content or the products represented thereby.

This distribution system provides various advantages. For example the managed Digital Content Catalog can be configured in a Catalog administration or publishing tool which creates and updates the managed digital content database. The managed Digital Content Catalog can be stored in a digital content database in a managed datacenter and a copy of the Digital Content metadata propagated to at least one Content Delivery Network CDN as a cached Digital Content Catalog .

Also a feature of this invention is for Targeting Rules to be configured in the Catalog administration tool and stored in the digital content database in the managed datacenter .

Another feature of this invention is for a Digital Content Storefront to request a filtered result set for searching and browsing the Digital Content Catalog .

Still further the search and browse algorithm of the Digital Content Storefront can request a real time merge of cached Digital Content Catalog data from the CDN with personalized Contextual Metadata about a Digital Subscriber from the managed datacenter and based on this metadata filter the Digital Content Catalog result set in real time within the Consumer Storefront Application or the browser session thereof and present the personalized result set to the Digital Subscriber on the access device .

Although a particular preferred embodiment of the invention has been disclosed in detail for illustrative purposes it will be recognized that variations or modifications of the disclosed apparatus including the rearrangement of parts lie within the scope of the present invention.
