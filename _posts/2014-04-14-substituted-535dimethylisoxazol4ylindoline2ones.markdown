The invention is directed to methods and compounds for inhibiting BRD4 and treating disease associated with undesirable BRD4 activity.

 N acetylation of lysine residues is one of the most frequently occurring posttranslational modifications in proteins Choudhary et al. 2009 and has broad relevance to cellular signalling and disease biology. Lysine acetylation in histones is abundant in large macromolecular complexes that are involved in chromatin remodeling DNA damage repair and cell cycle control Choudhary et al. 2009 . Targeting chromatin modifying enzymes that control cellular acetylation levels the so called epigenetic writers histone acetyltransferases HATs and erasers histone deacetylases HDACs has been an area of extensive research in drug development but modulating the readers bromodomains that recognize acetylation sites has not been widely reported until recently Nicodeme et al 2010 Filippakopoulos et al 2010 . Bromodomains BRDs are a diverse family of evolutionary conserved protein interaction modules that specifically recognize protein motifs that contain acetyl lysine modification. The extra terminal BET bromodomain subfamily consists of BRD2 BRD3 BRD4 and BRDT shares a common domain architecture featuring two amino terminal bromodomains with high levels of sequence homology and a carboxy terminal domain. Recent research has validated targeting BET bromodomains to treat a number of cancers Filippakopoulos 2010 Delmore 2011 Zuber 2011 atherosclerosis Chung 2011 Mirguet 2012 inflammation Nicodeme 2010 and HIV infection Banerjee 2012 .

The MYC transcription factor is a master regulator of diverse cellular functions and has long been validated as a compelling therapeutic target for a range of human cancers yet strategies to modulate the function of the Myc oncoprotein have not been discovered. Recently two selective inhibitors of the BET family members with little activity against bromodomains outside of the BET family JQ1 and IBET 151 have been shown to potently downregulate MYC protein and MYC target gene transcription. In a MYC dependent manner JQ1 and IBET 151 potently inhibit in vitro and in vivo tumor growth of multiple myeloma a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines as well as primary leukemia patient samples Delmore 2011 Mertz 2011 Zuber 2011 Herrmann 2010 Dawson 2011 . BET bromodomain inhibitors could also be useful in treating other cancers that depend on MYC function such as neuroblastoma with MYCN amplification and other solid tumors with c MYC overexpression in addition JQ1 has also be shown to have antiproliferative effects in an incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma known as NUT midline carcinoma NMC . NMC is a genetically defined cancer with a chromosomal rearrangement involving t 15 19 that leads to expression of the tandem N terminal bromodomains of BRD4 or BRD3 as an in frame chimaera with the NUT nuclear protein in testis protein. JQ1 treatment leads to terminal differentiation cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in NMC cell lines and significant reduction of tumour growth in patient derived xenograft models Filippakopoulos 2010 . In summary BET bromodomain inhibitors can be useful in the treatment of a variety of human cancers.

A BET bromodomain inhibitor IBET has been reported to suppress several crucial pro inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by displacing BET proteins from the promoter of its inflammatory genses. IBET demonstrates anti inflammatory effect and protects animals from endotoxin induced death in a mouse sepsis model Nicodeme 2010 . These studies suggest that BET bromodomain inhibitors could be useful as immomodulating drugs.

Apolipoprotein A1 ApoA1 upregulation is associated with protection from atherosclerosis progression and with anti inflammatory effects Nicholls 2012 . BET bromodomain inhibitors have been discovered to increase ApoA1 expression. BET inhibitors are promising approaches for the development of new therapies for atherosclerosis.

The persistence of latent HIV 1 is a major challenge in efforts to eradicate infection. JQ1 has been reported to reactivate HIV virus in models of latent T cell infection and latent monocyte infection Banerjee 2012 Li 2003 . Combination therapies using BET bromodomain inhibitors to reactive latent HIV 1 virus can provide an opportunity to cure HIV 1 infection. Other BET bromodomain inhibitors are also known. See for example WO2012151512 WO2012143436 WO2012075383 WO2011161031 WO2011143669 WO2011143657 WO2011054848 WO2011054846 WO2011054845 WO2011054844 WO2011054843 WO WO2011054841 WO2011054553 WO2009084693 and WO2006032470.

Lower alkyl means 1 8 preferably 1 6 more preferably 1 4 carbon atoms lower alkenyl or alkynyl means 2 8 2 6 or 2 4 carbon atoms.

The term alkenyl refers to a hydrocarbon group selected from linear and branched hydrocarbon groups comprising at least one C C double bond and of 2 18 or 2 12 or 2 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the alkenyl group may be selected from ethenyl or vinyl prop 1 enyl prop 2 enyl 2 methylprop 1 enyl but 1 enyl but 2 enyl but 3 enyl buta 1 3 dienyl 2 methylbuta 1 3 diene hex 1 enyl hex 2 enyl hex 3 enyl hex 4 enyl and hexa 1 3 dienyl groups.

Examples of the alkynyl group include ethynyl 1 propynyl 2 propynyl propargyl 1 butynyl 2 butynyl and 3 butynyl groups.

The term cycloalkyl refers to a hydrocarbon group selected from saturated and partially unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon groups comprising monocyclic and polycyclic e.g. bicyclic and tricyclic groups. For example the cycloalkyl group may be of 3 12 or 3 8 or 3 6 carbon atoms. Even further for example the cycloalkyl group may be a monocyclic group of 3 12 or 3 8 or 3 6 carbon atoms. Examples of the monocyclic cycloalkyl group include cyclopropyl cyclobutyl cyclopentyl 1 cyclopent 1 enyl 1 cyclopent 2 enyl 1 cyclopent 3 enyl cyclohexyl 1 cyclohex 1 enyl 1 cyclohex 2 enyl 1 cyclohex 3 enyl cyclohexadienyl cycloheptyl cyclooctyl cyclononyl cyclodecyl cycloundecyl and cyclododecyl groups. Examples of the bicyclic cycloalkyl groups include those having 7 12 ring atoms arranged as a bicycle ring selected from 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 and 6 6 ring systems or as a bridged bicyclic ring selected from bicyclo 2.2.1 heptane bicyclo 2.2.2 octane and bicyclo 3.2.2 nonane. The ring may be saturated or have at least one double bond i.e. partially unsaturated but is not fully conjugated and is not aromatic as aromatic is defined herein.

For example the aryl group is selected from 5 and 6 membered carbocyclic aromatic rings fused to a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl or heterocyclic ring optionally comprising at least one heteroatom selected from N O and S provided that the point of attachment is at the carbocyclic aromatic ring when the carbocyclic aromatic ring is fused with a heterocyclic ring and the point of attachment can be at the carbocyclic aromatic ring or at the cycloalkyl group when the carbocyclic aromatic ring is fused with a cycloalkyl group. Bivalent radicals formed from substituted benzene derivatives and having the free valences at ring atoms are named as substituted phenylene radicals. Bivalent radicals derived from univalent polycyclic hydrocarbon radicals whose names end in yl by removal of one hydrogen atom from the carbon atom with the free valence are named by adding idene to the name of the corresponding univalent radical e.g. a naphthyl group with two points of attachment is termed naphthylidene. Aryl however does not encompass or overlap with heteroaryl separately defined below. Hence if one or more carbocyclic aromatic rings are fused with a heterocyclic aromatic ring the resulting ring system is heteroaryl not aryl as defined herein.

5 to 7 membered aromatic monocyclic rings comprising 1 2 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected from N O and S with the remaining ring atoms being carbon

11 to 14 membered tricyclic rings comprising 1 2 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected from N O and S with the remaining ring atoms being carbon and wherein at least one ring is aromatic and at least one heteroatom is present in an aromatic ring.

For example the heteroaryl group includes a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic aromatic ring fused to a 5 to 7 membered cycloalkyl ring. For such fused bicyclic heteroaryl ring systems wherein only one of the rings comprises at least one heteroatom the point of attachment may be at the heteroaromatic ring or at the cycloalkyl ring.

When the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group exceeds 1 those heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In some embodiments the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaryl group is not more than 2. In some embodiments the total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1.

Examples of the heteroaryl group include but are not limited to as numbered from the linkage position assigned priority 1 pyridyl such as 2 pyridyl 3 pyridyl or 4 pyridyl cinnolinyl pyrazinyl 2 4 pyrimidinyl 3 5 pyrimidinyl 2 4 imidazolyl imidazopyridinyl isoxazolyl oxazolyl thiazolyl isothiazolyl thiadiazolyl tetrazolyl thienyl triazinyl benzothienyl furyl benzofuryl benzoimidazolyl indolyl isoindolyl indolinyl phthalazinyl pyrazinyl pyridazinyl pyrrolyl triazolyl quinolinyl isoquinolinyl pyrazolyl pyrrolopyridinyl such as 1H pyrrolo 2 3 b pyridin 5 yl pyrazolopyridinyl such as 1H pyrazolo 3 4 b pyridin 5 yl benzoxazolyl such as benzo d oxazol 6 yl pteridinyl purinyl 1 oxa 2 3 diazolyl 1 oxa 2 4 diazolyl 1 oxa 2 5 diazolyl 1 oxa 3 4 diazolyl 1 thia 2 3 diazolyl 1 thia 2 4 diazolyl 1 thia 2 5 diazolyl 1 thia 3 4 diazolyl furazanyl benzofurazanyl benzothiophenyl benzothiazolyl benzoxazolyl quinazolinyl quinoxalinyl naphthyridinyl furopyridinyl benzothiazolyl such as benzo d thiazol 6 yl indazolyl such as 1H indazol 5 yl and 5 6 7 8 tetrahydroisoquinoline.

The term heterocyclic or heterocycle or heterocyclyl refers to a ring selected from 4 to 12 membered monocyclic bicyclic and tricyclic saturated and partially unsaturated rings comprising at least one carbon atoms in addition to 1 2 3 or 4 heteroatoms selected from oxygen sulfur and nitrogen. Heterocycle also refers to a 5 to 7 membered heterocyclic ring comprising at least one heteroatom selected from N O and S fused with 5 6 and or 7 membered cycloalkyl carbocyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic ring provided that the point of attachment is at the heterocyclic ring when the heterocyclic ring is fused with a carbocyclic aromatic or a heteroaromatic ring and that the point of attachment can be at the cycloalkyl or heterocyclic ring when the heterocyclic ring is fused with cycloalkyl.

 Heterocycle also refers to an aliphatic spirocyclic ring comprising at least one heteroatom selected from N O and S provided that the point of attachment is at the heterocyclic ring. The rings may be saturated or have at least one double bond i.e. partially unsaturated . The heterocycle may be substituted with oxo. The point of the attachment may be carbon or heteroatom in the heterocyclic ring. A heterocyle is not a heteroaryl as defined herein.

Examples of the heterocycle include but not limited to as numbered from the linkage position assigned priority 1 1 pyrrolidinyl 2 pyrrolidinyl 2 4 imidazolidinyl 2 3 pyrazolidinyl 1 piperidinyl 2 piperidinyl 3 piperidinyl 4 piperidinyl 2 5 piperazinyl pyranyl 2 morpholinyl 3 morpholinyl oxiranyl aziridinyl thiiranyl azetidinyl oxetanyl thietanyl 1 2 dithietanyl 1 3 dithietanyl dihydropyridinyl tetrahydropyridinyl thiomorpholinyl thioxanyl piperazinyl homopiperazinyl homopiperidinyl azepanyl oxepanyl thiepanyl 1 4 oxathianyl 1 4 dioxepanyl 1 4 oxathiepanyl 1 4 oxaazepanyl 1 4 dithiepanyl 1 4 thiazepanyl and 1 4 diazepane 1 4 dithianyl 1 4 azathianyl oxazepinyl diazepinyl thiazepinyl dihydrothienyl dihydropyranyl dihydrofuranyl tetrahydrofuranyl tetrahydrothienyl tetrahydropyranyl tetrahydrothiopyranyl 1 pyrrolinyl 2 pyrrolinyl 3 pyrrolinyl indolinyl 2H pyranyl 4H pyranyl 1 4 dioxanyl 1 3 dioxolanyl pyrazolinyl pyrazolidinyl dithianyl dithiolanyl pyrazolidinylimidazolinyl pyrimidinonyl 1 1 dioxo thiomorpholinyl 3 azabicyco 3.1.0 hexanyl 3 azabicyclo 4.1.0 heptanyl and azabicyclo 2.2.2 hexanyl. Substituted heterocycle also includes ring systems substituted with one or more oxo moieties such as piperidinyl N oxide morpholinyl N oxide 1 oxo 1 thiomorpholinyl and 1 1 dioxo 1 thiomorpholinyl.

R R and R each independently refer to hydrogen unsubstituted C1 C8 alkyl and heteroalkyl unsubstituted aryl aryl substituted with one to three halogens unsubstituted alkyl alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups or aryl C1 C4 alkyl groups. When R and R are attached to the same nitrogen atom they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5 6 or 7 membered ring. Hence NR R includes l pyrrolidinyl and 4 morpholinyl alkyl includes groups such as trihaloalkyl e.g. CFand CHCF and when the aryl group is 1 2 3 4 tetrahydronaphthalene it may be substituted with a substituted or unsubstituted C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group. The C3 C7 spirocycloalkyl group may be substituted in the same manner as defined herein for cycloalkyl .

Preferred substituents are selected from halogen R OR O NR R SR SiR R R OC O R C O R COR CONR R OC O NR R NR C O R NR COR NR SONR R S O R SOR SONR R NR SOR CN and NO perfluoro C1 C4 alkoxy and perfluoro C1 C4 alkyl where R and R are as defined above.

The term fused ring herein refers to a polycyclic ring system e.g. a bicyclic or tricyclic ring system in which two rings share only two ring atoms and one bond in common. Examples of fused rings may comprise a fused bicyclic cycloalkyl ring such as those having from 7 to 12 ring atoms arranged as a bicyclic ring selected from 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 and 6 6 ring systems as mentioned above a fused bicyclic aryl ring such as 7 to 12 membered bicyclic aryl ring systems as mentioned above a fused tricyclic aryl ring such as 10 to 15 membered tricyclic aryl ring systems mentioned above a fused bicyclic heteroaryl ring such as 8 to 12 membered bicyclic heteroaryl rings as mentioned above a fused tricyclic heteroaryl ring such as 11 to 14 membered tricyclic heteroaryl rings as mentioned above and a fused bicyclic or tricyclic heterocyclyl ring as mentioned above.

The compounds may contain an asymmetric center and may thus exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more asymmetric centers they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Enantiomers and diastereomers fall within the broader class of stereoisomers. All such possible stereoisomers as substantially pure resolved enantiomers racemic mixtures thereof as well as mixtures of diastereomers are intended to be included. All stereoisomers of the compounds and or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are intended to be included. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise reference to one isomer applies to any of the possible isomers. Whenever the isomeric composition is unspecified all possible isomers are included.

The term substantially pure means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 35 such as no more than 30 further such as no more than 25 even further such as no more than 20 by weight of any other stereoisomer s . In some embodiments the term substantially pure means that the target stereoisomer contains no more than 10 for example no more than 5 such as no more than 1 by weight of any other stereoisomer s .

When compounds contain olefin double bonds unless specified otherwise such double bonds are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.

Some of the compounds may exist with different points of attachment of hydrogen referred to as tautomers. For example compounds including carbonyl CHC O groups keto forms may undergo tautomerism to form hydroxyl CH C OH groups enol forms . Both keto and enol forms individually as well as mixtures thereof are also intended to be included where applicable.

It may be advantageous to separate reaction products from one another and or from starting materials. The desired products of each step or series of steps is separated and or purified hereinafter separated to the desired degree of homogeneity by the techniques common in the art. Typically such separations involve multiphase extraction crystallization from a solvent or solvent mixture distillation sublimation or chromatography. Chromatography can involve any number of methods including for example reverse phase and normal phase size exclusion ion exchange high medium and low pressure liquid chromatography methods and apparatus small scale analytical simulated moving bed SMB and preparative thin or thick layer chromatography as well as techniques of small scale thin layer and flash chromatography. One skilled in the art will apply techniques most likely to achieve the desired separation.

Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art such as by chromatography and or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher s acid chloride separating the diastereomers and converting e.g. hydrolyzing the individual diastereoisomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.

A single stereoisomer e.g. a substantially pure enantiomer may be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of diastereomers using optically active resolving agents Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds. New York John Wiley Sons Inc. 1994 Lochmuller C. H. et al. Chromatographic resolution of enantiomers Selective review. J. Chromatogr. 113 3 1975 pp. 283 302 . Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable method including 1 formation of ionic diastereomeric salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional crystallization or other methods 2 formation of diastereomeric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents separation of the diastereomers and conversion to the pure stereoisomers and 3 separation of the substantially pure or enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions. See Wainer Irving W. Ed. Drug Stereochemistry Analytical Methods and Pharmacology. New York Marcel Dekker Inc. 1993.

Similarly examples of pharmaceutically acceptable cations include but are not limited to sodium potassium calcium aluminum lithium and ammonium.

In addition if a compound is obtained as an acid addition salt the free base can be obtained by basifying a solution of the acid salt. Conversely if the product is a free base an addition salt such as a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt may be produced by dissolving the free base in a suitable organic solvent and treating the solution with an acid in accordance with conventional procedures for preparing acid addition salts from base compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize various synthetic methodologies that may be used without undue experimentation to prepare non toxic pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts.

 Treating treat or treatment refers to administering at least one compound and or at least one stereoisomer thereof and or at least one pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to a subject in recognized need thereof that has for example cancer.
