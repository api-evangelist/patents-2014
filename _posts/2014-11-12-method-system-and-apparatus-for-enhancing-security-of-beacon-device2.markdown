Referring to the beacon device according to this embodiment of the present invention checks an authentication key and current time information in order to enhance security at step S. Thereafter the beacon device generates identification information using the authentication key and the current time information at step S. In this case the beacon device performs an operation on the authentication key and the time information thereby generating the identification information at predetermined time intervals. For example the identification information may include an OTP. A user authentication method using a one time password of random numbers that are randomly generated is applied to the identification information. That is the control module generates a one time password. The control module may automatically generate a different password of a specific number of digits at predetermined time intervals.

At step S the beacon device transmits identification information generated in response to a request signal received from the terminal to the terminal . In this case the beacon device transmits the identification information to the terminal via short range wireless communication. In this case the beacon device may be equipped with a Wi Fi module and then communicate with the terminal .

Referring to the terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention receives the identification information from the beacon device at step S. Thereafter at step S the terminal transfers the received identification information to the service device .

At step S the terminal determines whether service information related to the identification information has been received by taking into account the result of the validation of the identification information received from the service device .

After receiving the service information the terminal provides the received service information at step S. In this case the service information includes at least one of current location information coupon information discount information and event information related to a corresponding store.

Referring to at step S the service device according to an embodiment of the present invention receives identification information from the terminal . Furthermore the service device receives identification information from the beacon device .

At step S the service device performs the validation of the identification information received from the terminal and the identification information received from the beacon device . In this case the service device determines whether the identification information received from the beacon device matches the identification information received from the terminal and performs the validation by taking into account the result of the determination. That is the service device may check the received identification information and then may perform the validation based on the times at which the identification information have been generated and whether authentication keys match each other.

At step S the service device extracts service information in response to the result of the validation. Thereafter at step S the service device transmits the extracted service information to the terminal .
