The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The invention relates generally to slug calorimetry. In particular the invention relates to directional slug calorimeters that are useful for heat flux measurements in extreme environments.

In order to adequately characterize a thermal environment both temperature and heat flux must be measured. Temperature is a thermodynamic property of a material and can be easily measured by standard methods. Heat flux on the other hand is an energy flow rate per unit area and is therefore far more difficult to obtain. There are two methods commonly utilized for heat flux measurement. The first method measures the temperature drop across a known thermal resistance. This temperature drop can then be related to heat flux by using Fourier s law of heat conduction. Sensors of this type are called differential heat flux sensors.

The second type of heat flux sensor examines the time rate of change of the temperature of a material that is exposed to a heat flux and isolated from all other thermal influences. When heat flows into an object its temperature increases. The rate of temperature rise is proportional to the applied heat flux and inversely proportional to the thermal mass of the object. By measuring this rate of temperature rise and calculating the thermal mass of the material the heat flux into the device can be determined. These devices are typically referred to as slug calorimeters heat flux sensors.

While both types of sensors have been developed and are commercially available current commercially available sensors typically cannot survive in the extreme environments found in fire research. The high temperatures and high heat fluxes destroy these gages in a short time rendering them useless in many situations. Even sensors made entirely from high temperature materials typically fail due to stresses that develop due to mismatches in thermal expansion coefficients. These sensors frequently tear apart when heated. As can be seen there is a need for a device that is capable of surviving extreme environments while obtaining accurate heat flux data.

Conventional calorimeters yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular a directional slug calorimeter is provided for measuring temperature in high temperature environments. Various exemplary embodiments provide the calorimeter as including a tubular member a plurality of slots formed along a portion of an axial length of the tubular member the slots dividing the tubular member into discrete segments insulation disposed within the tubular member and within the plurality of slots and thermocouples disposed with a thermocouple junction disposed in a central region of each of the discrete segments.

In other exemplary embodiments the directional slug calorimeter further includes end caps covering each end of the tubular member and a support tube extending from at least one of the end caps. In yet other exemplary embodiments a method for measuring directional heat flux includes disposing the directional slug calorimeter to thermal exposure calculating a time rate of change of a temperature history of each of the discrete segments from each of the thermocouples and multiplying the time rate of change by a mass and specific heat of the discrete segment and dividing an exposed surface of the segment to give the heat flux of that discrete segment.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

The present disclosure relates generally to a directional slug calorimeter that provides accurate non isotropic heat flux measurement in an environment unsuitable for conventional sensors such as high temperature refractory chambers. The directionality enables thermal conditions to be geometrically mapped for the test configuration. The slug calorimeter is designed so as to be easily manufactured affordable and straight forward to repair reducing overall lifecycle cost.

The slug calorimeter is formed from a tube having slots machined along an axial direction of the tube. In each of the locations between the slots a thermocouple can measure the temperature of that location. The time response of the calorimeter can be determined based on its size with larger tubes forming a slug calorimeter having a slower response time for longer duration heat flux measurements. These and other features aspects and advantages of the exemplary embodiments will become better understood with reference to the following drawings description and claims.

With the appropriate materials the exemplary slug calorimeter has the ability to survive in the environment present within large scale fires while providing multiple directional measurements. This slug calorimeter is inexpensive to manufacture and can be readily repaired if the thermocouple becomes damaged or the insulation requires replacement. Because the bulk of the slug calorimeter is fabricated from thick metal the housing is virtually indestructible under anticipated conditions.

Referring to a directional slug calorimeter includes a tubular member or tube having a number of slots formed along an axial direction into the tube . Typically the slots are equally spaced about the tube to separate the tube into distinct regions of equal size. The slots to not extend for the entire length of the tube to prevent the distinct regions from separating. The slots can extend for a length from about 80 to about 95 preferably about 90 of the length of the tube . Preferably from two to eight or more slots can be formed in the tube .

Refined spatial resolution can be obtained by machining additional slots and dividing the slug calorimeter into more sections. For example four slots as shown in the drawings can be formed in the tube to define four distinct regions. The slots serve to thermally isolate each of the distinct regions from its neighbor and allow for multiple independent measurements.

The tube can be made from various materials provided that the material survives the conditions of intended use of the slug calorimeter . Typically the tube is made from a high temperature metal alloy such as stainless steel nickel Inconel or the like. The tube can be a thick walled tube typically from about inch to about 1 inch thick. Of course the thickness and length of the tube can vary depending on application. For example the overall size length and or thickness of the tube can be adjusted to provide the desired thermal response time.

For short duration tests the slug calorimeter can be made small so as to have a rapid response. A larger i.e. more massive tube can provide data for a longer duration at the cost of a slower time response and the inability to resolve quickly changing transients. The ends of the tube can be covered with end caps . The end caps can be attached to the tube in various manners. For example bolts can be used to secure the end caps to ends of the tube .

A support tube can extend from one or both of the end caps . The support tube can be attached to the end caps in various manners. For example an exterior nut and an interior nut can be attached by welding for example to each side of the end caps and the support tube can be threaded into the exterior nut and the interior nut . In an exemplary configuration the tube has a length of 3.0 inches 7.62 cm with an outside diameter of 2.7 inches 6.86 cm with a mass of each quadrant being 0.258 kg when composed of 304 stainless steel.

As shown in the support tube does not typically extend entirely through the tube . However in some embodiments the support tube can extend through the tube and out both ends thereof. Insulation such as a rigid high porosity high temperature insulation can be machined to fill the internal volume within the tube and additional insulation can be fitted into the slots .

A thermocouple can have a connector on one end thereof and a thermocouple junction on an opposite end thereof. The thermocouple can fit into a hole that is bored into one end of the tube so that the bottom of the hole is centrally positioned between two adjacent slots and between the ends of the tube .

The thermocouple can be for example a standard mineral insulated metal sheathed MIMS thermocouple used to measure the temperature of each quadrant. To ensure that the thermocouple accurately measures the temperature of its insertion segment the thermocouple should be in intimate thermal contact with the inside of the hole . This can be accomplished for example by cementing the thermocouple into the hole using a high thermal conductivity high temperature adhesive. One suitable adhesive utilizing aluminum nitride as its base is Aremco s Ceramabond 865.

To obtain measurements with the directional slug calorimeter the temperature history of each quadrant is monitored during a thermal exposure such as a fire. The time rate of change of the temperature history is then calculated using a central difference procedure. Multiplying this time rate of change by the mass and specific heat of the isolated region and dividing by the exposed surface area gives the heat flux to that region. Increased accuracy can be obtained by determining the specific heat at each time step at the temperature recorded by the thermocouple at that time step as the specific heat typically varies slightly with temperature.

The exemplary slug calorimeter can be used for example by universities and laboratories performing fire research. Additional uses could be found in for example boiler and furnace development and maintenance the petrochemical industry oil refineries solar thermal generation research etc.

While the drawings show the tube of the slug calorimeter as being a round tube other tubular cross sectional shapes may be used within the scope of the present invention. For example the tube could be a square hexagonal or other shaped tube typically having the slots formed along a corner thereof thereby dividing the tube into sections at each corner.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
