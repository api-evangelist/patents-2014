The subject matter discussed herein relates generally to data processing and more particularly to an internet wide identity management widget.

Many online services are only provided to authenticated users. Users can register with a service provider so that the users can be authenticated by the service provider. Some service providers allow users to be authenticated through a third party identity provider without the users registering with the service providers. For example a user can register with an identity provider L or with a service provider L that also functions as an identity provider for other service providers. When the user wants to use services from service provider A that allows authentication through identity provider L the user can login to L or login to A using the user s credentials with L.

When authenticated with an identity provider e.g. L to access A s services a user is only provided access to the user s settings on A s website or with A s services. Similarly when authenticated with an identity provider e.g. L or another identity provider to access B s services the user is only provided access to the user s settings on B s website or with B s services. The user cannot access the user s models e.g. privacy settings interests preferences history etc. notifications or account settings associated with the identity provider or another service provider. The user also cannot access other identity oriented controls and preferences.

The subject matter includes methods for implementing internet wide identity management including providing a user interface associated with a service provider receiving by an identity provider a request to login a user associated with the service provider the service provider being different from the identity provider providing by the identity provider to the service provider a login status indicating that the user is authenticated wherein based on the login status the user is authorized by the service provider to access a service provided by the service provider and providing a widget associated with the login status the widget being configured to present one or more settings associated with the user including a first setting and a second setting wherein the first setting is used by the service provider and the second setting is used by another service provider and not used by the service provider and the another service provider is different from the identity provider

The methods are implemented using one or more computing devices and or systems. The methods may be stored in computer readable media.

The subject matter described herein is taught by way of example implementations. Various details have been omitted for the sake of clarity and to avoid obscuring the subject matter. The examples shown below are directed to structures and functions for implementing internet wide identity management widget.

In some implementations devices may be considered user devices e.g. devices used by users to access services . Devices may include but are not limited to a computer e.g. a laptop computing device a mobile device e.g. smartphone tablet etc. a television a device associated with a vehicle .

Devices may be devices associated with service providers e.g. used by service providers to provide services and or store data such as webpages text images audios audio segments videos video segments and or information thereabout . Devices may include but are not limited to one or more server computers computing devices and storage devices and .

For example devices may be used by service providers A B . . . N to provide services accessed by users using devices . Service providers A B . . . N and identity provider L may each be owned by a different business entity. In some implementations the business owner or controller of identity provider L also owns one or more service providers A B . . . N.

Users of services provided by one or more service providers A B . . . N may be authenticated with an identity provider L . Service providers A B . . . N may be referred to as associated service providers i.e. service providers associated with identity provider L . A service provider can be associated with an identity provider when two conditions are met. There is an agreement between the service provider e.g. A B . . . or N and the identity provider e.g. L to provide identity services to the service provider. There is consent or permission by a user to login using an identity provider e.g. the user chooses to login using the user s account and credentials registered with the identity provider instead of registering an account with the service provider .

As an example a user Dave has registered with identity provider L and uses services provided by service providers A B and C not shown all of which may be authenticated using identity provider L. Dave may sign in to A s website using Dave s account with L. After Dave signed in using Dave s account with L on A s website Dave is considered an authenticated user to use A s services without registering with A. Further Dave is able to view change add delete or otherwise manage Dave s settings with B C and or L while using A s services see below . That is Dave can but does not have to sign in or authenticate separately for B C and or L to manage Dave s settings with B C and or L.

In an example where a user Dave has registered or will register with service provider L Service L Dave can select option to sign in using Dave s account or credentials with Service L to use the services provided by A.

Logging in using an identity provider may be implemented in any way. For example Dave s selecting of option or another option may trigger a UI e.g. login window for Dave to input his login credentials. In some implementations login window encrypts Dave s credentials and sends the credentials to Service L. Service L authenticates the credentials and communicates with Service A to confirm whether the credentials have been authenticated. If authenticated Dave may start using services provided by Service A.

In other implementations login window encrypts Dave s credentials and sends the credentials to Service L. Service A passes the encrypted credentials to Service L. Service L authenticates the credentials and communicates with Service A the status of whether the credentials have been authenticated. If authenticated Dave may start using services provided by Service A. These are two of many possible implementations.

UI and are two of many possible implementations of the subject matter describe herein. When Dave wants to view add change delete or otherwise manage Dave s settings with A L and or another service providers that accept authentication using L Dave can use widget or as described further with respect to below.

UI may be attached or coupled to UI . In some implementations UI may be separated from UI e.g. UI and UI may be independently shown or hidden on a display . UI is provided by Service A and UI is provided in association with UI . In some implementations the frame of UI may also be provided by Service A. The content of UI may be provided by the identity provider e.g. Service L that provides identity services for Service A. That is Service L may be the backend that is associated with UI .

UI allows a user e.g. Dave to manage his settings used by various service providers without logging into the service providers websites or directly logging into the identity provider s website e.g. Service L s website . Service providers that may be affected by or use one or more settings managed using UI are the service providers that authenticate using Service L associated with Service L or use user settings managed by and or stored with Service L.

UI includes for example regions and . In some implementations different or additional regions may be included. Region may be used to manage Dave s identity level settings. Regions and may be used to manage Dave settings specific to specific service providers e.g. Service A and Service B respectively . Region may be used to manage Dave s settings for a group of service providers. The regions or some of the regions may have different layout not shown in some implementations.

Region may include an identifier for the region e.g. Dave s Identity level settings and one or more settings . Settings are available for use by any associated service providers. All existing settings in this region some of which may be displayed in the region are available for use by any service provider the user e.g. Dave has given consent or permission to use. Settings and their sub settings if any and values may be stored with or controlled by Service L. In some implementations one or more service providers may also store a copy e.g. backup copy or redundant copy of one or more settings with the consent of the user. If a setting is deleted it is no longer available for use. When a setting is added or changed in region the setting and one or more values associated with the setting may be stored with or controlled by Service L. The setting and its associated values are available to service providers to request and use.

For example five settings are shown in region . Dave may have just changed the example setting Manage Contacts to include the contact information of another user Eva with Eva s consent and Dave has previously given consent to Service B and Service J not shown to use the Manage Contacts setting in association with Dave as a user when he is authenticated for B and or J. As soon as Dave is done changing the Manage Contacts setting Eva s contact information is available for Services B and J to request and use but only in association with Dave being the authenticated user on Services from B and J. For example Service B may be a social network. When Dave is authenticated for Service B Dave will have access to Eva s contact information with Eva s consent on social network B without having to enter Eva s contact information directly with B. Dave can change his consent with respect to any setting in any region at any time e.g. revoking Service B s access to the Manage Contacts setting .

In another example Dave may have just created the setting Set Preferences that includes among others a sub setting Communication Preference with the value of Email and another sub setting Email Address with the value of an email address. Dave has set e.g. given consent to allow Services A K not shown and M not shown to use the sub setting when Dave is the authenticated user on those services. After Dave has added the Set Preferences setting that setting its sub settings and all associated values are available for Services A K and M to request and use when Dave is the authenticated user.

For example Service K may be associated with an auto repair shop. The next time Dave signs in to Service K using Dave s account with L . Dave requests a report of the maintenance records for his vehicle. Service K requests applicable settings of Dave from Service L and based on the sub settings Communication Preference and Email Address the maintenance records are provided e.g. emailed to Dave by Service K.

Regions and each may include an identifier or respectively to identify the specific service providers e.g. A and B respectively settings in these regions are intended for. Settings are for use by Service A and settings are for use by Service B. All existing settings some of which may be displayed in the region e.g. or are available for use by the associated service provider. As described above after a setting has been added or changed it is available for use by the associated service provider. If a setting is deleted it is no longer available for use.

For example even though Dave is not currently logged in to user services of service provider B Dave can still view add change delete or otherwise manage Dave s settings associated with Service B when Dave is logged in to Service A according to UI . If as soon as Dave has finished changing or adding in region the change or addition is available for Service B to use the next time Dave logs on to Service B. If Dave performs deletion in region that deletion is no longer available i.e. Service B cannot use the deleted setting or value the next time Dave is logged on to B .

Region may include an identifier for the region and one or more settings . Identifier identifies one or more service providers and or one or more groups of service providers that can use the settings . User Dave may be allowed to identify which service providers are included here e.g. can use the settings or in another similar region not shown . Dave may be allowed to define groups of service providers and include some or all the groups in region or one or more other similar regions not shown . Settings may be view add change delete or otherwise manage Dave s as described above in other regions . When Dave is done viewing or managing his settings in UI Dave may minimize UI by for example clicking on control which may replace UI with UI or UI .

At block Service L e.g. a backend system of associated with Service L authenticates Dave s account or login credentials and recognizes that Dave is a registered user with L. In some implementations Service L may check to determine if Dave can use his account with Service A. When all is checked out e.g. Dave is an authenticated user and or can use Service A Service L communicates with Service A e.g. communicates to Service A that Dave is an authenticated user . In some implementations Service L may communicate one or more settings applicable or pertaining to Service A e.g. settings in regions and .

At block website for Service A is rendered with services provided by A. A widget or UI for identity management associated with Service L is also rendered as shown in . At block the user e.g. Dave can interact with the identity management UI e.g. or the website for Service A e.g. or or both.

In some examples process may be implemented with different fewer or more blocks. Process may be implemented as computer executable instructions which can be stored on a medium loaded onto one or more processors of one or more computing devices and executed as a computer implemented method.

Computing device can be communicatively coupled to input user interface and output device interface . Either one or both of input user interface and output device interface can be a wired or wireless interface and can be detachable. Input user interface may include any device component sensor or interface physical or virtual that can be used to provide input e.g. buttons touch screen interface keyboard a pointing cursor control microphone camera braille motion sensor optical reader and or the like . Output device interface may include a display television monitor printer speaker braille or the like. In some example implementations input user interface and output device interface can be embedded with or physically coupled to the computing device . In other example implementations other computing devices may function as or provide the functions of input user interface and output device interface for a computing device .

Examples of computing device may include but are not limited to highly mobile devices e.g. smartphones devices in vehicles and other machines devices carried by humans and animals and the like mobile devices e.g. tablets notebooks laptops personal computers portable televisions radios and the like and devices not designed for mobility e.g. desktop computers other computers information kiosks televisions with one or more processors embedded therein and or coupled thereto radios and the like .

Computing device can be communicatively coupled e.g. via I O interface to external storage and network for communicating with any number of networked components devices and systems including one or more computing devices of the same or different configuration. Computing device or any connected computing device can be functioning as providing services of or referred to as a server client thin server general machine special purpose machine or another label.

I O interface can include but is not limited to wired and or wireless interfaces using any communication or I O protocols or standards e.g. Ethernet 802.11x Universal System Bus WiMax modem a cellular network protocol and the like for communicating information to and or from at least all the connected components devices and network in computing environment . Network can be any network or combination of networks e.g. the Internet local area network wide area network a telephonic network a cellular network satellite network and the like .

Computing device can use and or communicate using computer usable or computer readable media including transitory media and non transitory media. Transitory media include transmission media e.g. metal cables fiber optics signals carrier waves and the like. Non transitory media include magnetic media e.g. disks and tapes optical media e.g. CD ROM digital video disks Blu ray disks solid state media e.g. RAM ROM flash memory solid state storage and other non volatile storage or memory.

Computing device can be used to implement techniques methods applications processes or computer executable instructions in some example computing environments. Computer executable instructions can be retrieved from transitory media and stored on and retrieved from non transitory media. The executable instructions can originate from one or more of any programming scripting and machine languages e.g. C C C Java Visual Basic Python Perl JavaScript and others .

Processor s can execute under any operating system OS not shown in a native or virtual environment. One or more applications can be deployed that include logic unit application programming interface API unit input unit output unit login UI management user settings management 3rd party management and inter unit communication mechanism for the different units to communicate with each other with the OS and with other applications not shown . For example login UI management user settings management and 3rd party management may implement one or more processes or UI shown and described in . The described units and elements can be varied in design function configuration or implementation and are not limited to the descriptions provided.

In some example implementations when information or an execution instruction is received by API unit it may be communicated to one or more other units e.g. logic unit input unit output unit login UI management user settings management and 3rd party management . For example when login UI management detects a login request from input unit user authentication is performed. The user s login status is provided by for example output unit to user settings management and or 3rd party management which provides the login status and or user settings to a third party for which the login request is authenticated. An identity management UI or widget is populated with settings associated with the authenticated users. The user provides input to the UI to manage the settings. The input is detected by input unit and pass to user settings management and or 3rd party management for processing.

In some instances logic unit may be configured to control the information flow among the units and direct the services provided by API unit input unit output unit login UI management user settings management and 3rd party management in some example implementations described above. For example the flow of one or more processes or implementations may be controlled by logic unit alone or in conjunction with API unit .

In situations in which the systems discussed here collect personal information about users or may make use of personal information the users may be provided with an opportunity to control whether programs or features collect user information e.g. information about a user s social network social actions or activities profession a user s preferences or a user s current location or to control whether and or how to receive content from the content server that may be more relevant to the user. In addition certain data may be treated in one or more ways before it is stored or used so that personally identifiable information is removed. For example a user s identity may be treated so that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user or a user s geographic location may be generalized where location information is obtained such as to a city ZIP code or state level so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined. Thus the user may have control over how information is collected about the user and used by a content server.
