This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 865 371 filed Aug. 13 2013 the entirety of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.

This invention was made with government support under agreement No. DTFH61 10 H 00004 awarded by the DOT Federal Highway Administration. The government has certain rights in the invention.

The present invention relates to strain and crack sensors and more specifically to a wireless passive strain and crack sensing systems.

In order to accurately assess deterioration of civil mechanical and aerospace structures there has been a large volume of research in structural health monitoring SHM over past few decades. Sensors can be used to measure various structural responses and operating conditions including strain displacement acceleration humidity temperature etc. Among these measurements strain can be an important indicator for stress concentration and damage development.

Metal foil strain gages are currently among the most common solutions due to their low cost simple circuitry and acceptable reliability in many applications. However when applied to large structures traditional metal foil strain gages require lengthy cable connections for power and data acquisition which can significantly increase installation time and system cost.

Wireless strain sensors have recently been developed to avoid cabling difficulty associated with metal foil strain gages. For example one wireless strain sensor employs the inductive coupling principle involving two adjacent inductors. However the interrogation distance achieved by inductive coupling is usually limited to several inches which is inconvenient for many practical applications. Electromagnetic backscattering techniques have been exploited for wireless strain sensing in an attempt to increase interrogation distance.

Since the electromagnetic resonance frequency of a planar antenna is related to the antenna s physical dimension the resonance frequency changes when the antenna is under strain. This relationship between resonance frequency and strain can be used for stress strain measurement of a structure to which the planar antenna is bonded. For example a patch antenna has been designed for wireless strain sensing in which a phototransistor is adapted for signal modulation of the RF signal backscattered from the antenna sensor. As a result signal backscattered from the sensor can be distinguished from environmental reflections. However the light switching mechanism is not practical for outdoor application where light intensity is usually so strong that the phototransistor is constantly activated and thus loses the ability to switch.

To avoid this difficulty a low cost off the shelf radiofrequency identification RFID chip has been previously adopted as a simple mechanism for signal modulation. Since the RFID chip is powered by a wireless interrogation signal the RFID based strain sensor is wireless and passive i.e. battery free . One prototype RFID antenna sensor has shown a strain measurement resolution of 20 in laboratory experiments and can measure large strains up to 10 000 . Previous studies demonstrated that if operating frequency of the wireless strain sensor is increased strain sensitivity can be improved and sensor size can be reduced. However the RFID chip only functions in the frequency band of 860 960 MHz.

Therefore there is a need for a wireless passive strain sensor that is configured to operate at frequencies higher than typical RFID frequencies.

The disadvantages of the prior art are overcome by the present invention which in one aspect is a strain and crack sensor for sensing an amount of strain induced in an object. A receiving planar antenna has a first resonant frequency and is configured to receive a querying signal at the first resonant frequency. A transmitting planar antenna has a second resonant frequency that is twice the first resonant frequency. At least one or both of the receiving planar antenna and the transmitting planar antenna is bonded to the object so that at least one of strain induced in the object or a crack formed in the object causes a shift in at least one or both of the first resonant frequency or the second resonant frequency. A matching element is in electrical communication with the first planar antenna and the second planar antenna. The matching element is configured to cause the transmitting planar antenna to radiate a response signal in response to the querying signal.

In another aspect the invention is a sensing system for sensing an strain and a crack in an object. A receiving planar antenna has a first resonant frequency and is configured to receive a querying signal at the first resonant frequency. A transmitting planar antenna has a second resonant frequency that is twice the first resonant frequency. At least one or both of the receiving planar antenna and the transmitting planar antenna is bonded to the object so that at least one of strain induced in the object or a crack formed in the object causes a shift in at least one or both of the first resonant frequency or the second resonant frequency. A matching element is in electrical communication with the receiving planar antenna and the transmitting planar antenna. The matching element is configured to cause the transmitting planar antenna to radiate a response signal in response to the querying signal. The matching element includes a Schottky diode having a cathode side that is in electrical communication with the transmitting planar antenna and an anode side that is in electrical communication with the receiving planar antenna. A sensing unit that includes a transceiver that is configured to radiate the querying signal and to receive the response signal a spectrum analyzing circuit configured to detect the response signal frequency and a processor configured to calculate the amount of strain induced in an object.

In yet another aspect the invention is a method of sensing stain and a crack in an object in which a querying signal having a first frequency is transmitted to a receiving planar antenna that has a first resonant frequency. A response signal is received from a transmitting planar antenna that has a second resonant frequency that is twice the first resonant frequency. At least one of the receiving planar antenna and the transmitting planar antenna is bonded to the object so that at least one of strain in the object or the crack in the object will cause a frequency shift in the response signal. An amount of frequency shift between the response signal frequency and twice the querying signal frequency is detected. An amount of strain or the presence of a crack is determined based on the amount of frequency shift.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with the following drawings. As would be obvious to one skilled in the art many variations and modifications of the invention may be effected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure.

A preferred embodiment of the invention is now described in detail. Referring to the drawings like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. Unless otherwise specifically indicated in the disclosure that follows the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale. As used in the description herein and throughout the claims the following terms take the meanings explicitly associated herein unless the context clearly dictates otherwise the meaning of a an and the includes plural reference the meaning of in includes in and on. 

As shown in one embodiment of a strain and crack sensor includes a thin dielectric substrate a receiving patch antenna having a first resonant frequency disposed on the substrate a transmitting patch antenna also disposed on the substrate and having a second resonant frequency that is twice the first resonant frequency. A matching network electrically couples the receiving patch antenna to the transmitting patch antenna . In one embodiment the matching network includes a GaAs Schottky diode which ensures that current flowing from the receiving patch antenna is delivered to the transmitting patch antenna with a doubled frequency. The matching network also includes a pair of electromagnetic matching lines .

In other embodiments as shown in the receiving antenna and the transmitting antenna can include a plurality of dielectric layers disposed on the ground plane and a plurality of conductive radiating layers that are interleaved with the plurality of dielectric layers . Also in other embodiments the receiving planar antenna and the transmitting planar antenna can include patch antennas wideband antennas frequency selection surface FSS antennas and combinations thereof.

When at least one of the receiving patch antenna or the transmitting patch antenna is firmly affixed to an object such as a steel beam used in a bridge any strain induced in the object or any cracks forming therein will cause the affixed antenna to distort thereby causing a resonant frequency shift in the antenna.

When a sensing unit which includes a radio frequency transceiver transmits a querying signal generated by a function generator at a frequency corresponding to the first resonant frequency to the sensor the receiving patch antenna will harvest energy from the querying signal and resonate therein. This causes a current at resonant frequency of the receiving patch antenna to flow to the transmitting patch antenna through the Schottky diode which results in a doubling of the frequency of the current flowing into the transmitting patch antenna . As a result a response signal is radiated from the transmitting patch antenna . Any distortion experienced by the receiving patch antenna or the transmitting patch antenna will cause a resonant frequency shift in the respective antenna which will cause the response signal to be radiated with a frequency with a corresponding shift. The frequency of the response signal is detected by spectrum analyzing circuitry and a processor associated with the spectrum analyzer can measure the frequency shift in the response signal and correlate the shift with the amount of strain or the presence of a crack in the object .

The system uses energy harvested from the querying signal to generate the response signal and therefore does not require a separate power source. Because the response signal has a frequency that is nominally double the frequency of the querying signal the sensing unit can easily distinguish between the response signal and any local reflections of the querying signal .

Another example embodiment of the transmitting planar antenna or the receiving planar antenna as shown in employs a slotted patch antenna that includes a conductive element disposed on a substrate . Instead of being a simple patch antenna slot patterns are introduced on the conductive element so that the overall antenna dimension is reduced. Other embodiments that may be employed include folded patch antennas wideband antennas and frequency selection surface FSS antennas.

One experimental embodiment of a strain sensor design employed a frequency doubling scheme to enable sensor operation at a high frequency. The basic concept was to let the sensor double the frequency of reader interrogation signal and backscatter signal at the doubled frequency 2 . Because environmental reflections to reader interrogation signal are concentrated at the reader only receives signal at 2 backscattered from the sensor. The frequency doubling operation was implemented through a Schottky diode which is a nonlinear circuit device that can generate an output signal with frequencies at multiples of input frequency. The GaAs Schottky diode used provided a 1 conversion efficiency at 30 dBm input power.

In this experimental embodiment the diode enabled frequency doubling mechanism was incorporated with two patch antennas to form a wireless strain sensor. A Schottky diode SMS7621 079LF from Skyworks Solutions Inc. was used in the matching network. A patch antenna with resonance frequency at 2.9 GHz was used as a receiving antenna of the wireless strain sensor. Meanwhile another patch antenna with resonance frequency at 5.8 GHz was used to serve as a transmitting antenna of the wireless strain sensor. The three components i.e. the receiving and transmitting antennas and matching network were combined together to form a frequency doubling antenna sensor. Since operation power of the diode is harvested from wireless interrogation signal the frequency doubling antenna sensor is wireless and passive battery free . Strain sensing simulation shows that the proposed frequency doubling sensor can achieve a strain sensitivity of 3.84 kHz .

In the experimental embodiment the sensor included three main components a receiving antenna with resonance frequency a transmitting antenna with resonance frequency 2 and a diode integrated matching network between receiving and transmitting antennas. During operation a wireless interrogation signal is emitted from the reader side by a function generator and through a transmitting reader antenna. If interrogation frequency is in the neighborhood of resonance frequency of the receiving patch antenna at sensor side interrogation power is captured by the sensor side receiving patch antenna and transferred to the matching network. The diode then generates output signal at doubled frequency 2 . The output signal at 2 is backscattered to reader through sensor side transmitting patch antenna resonance frequency at 2 . A spectrum analyzer finally measures the backscattered signal at reader side. Frequency of backscattered sensor signal is at 2 and the unwanted environmental reflections to original reader interrogation signal remains at . Therefore it is easy for the spectrum analyzer to distinguish backscattered sensor signal from unwanted environmental reflections.

In this experimental embodiment the receiving and transmitting antennas of the frequency doubling sensor were microstrip patch antennas. For a microstrip patch antenna with length L width W and substrate thickness h effective dielectric constant of the antenna can be calculated for determining antenna electrical length 

In the experimental embodiment the substrate material used in was Rogers Duroid 5880 a glass micro fiber reinforced PTFE material. A 31 mil substrate thickness was chosen which represents a trade off between increasing wireless interrogation distance and improving strain transfer ratio from structural surface to top layer of the microstrip patch antenna. The dielectric constant of the material was 2.2. The resonance frequency was set 2.9 GHz for the receiving antenna and 2 5.8 GHz for the transmitting antenna.

It will be readily appreciated that many deviations may be made from the specific embodiments disclosed in this specification without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
