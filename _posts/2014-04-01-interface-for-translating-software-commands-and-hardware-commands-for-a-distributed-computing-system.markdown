title: Interface for translating software commands and hardware commands for a distributed computing system
abstract: In one embodiment, a method receives a software command from a software element in a main computer at a management computer via an application programming interface (API) included in the management computer. The management computer manages the main computer, and the main computer controls services for a distributed computing system. The management computer then determines a hardware device associated with the software command where the management computer includes a communication pathway to the hardware device. The management computer translates the software command to a hardware command that the hardware device can process where the hardware device cannot process the software command. Then, the management computer sends the hardware command to the hardware device via the communication pathway where the management computer provides the API to allow the software element to communicate with the hardware element without the software element having to translate the software command to the hardware command.
