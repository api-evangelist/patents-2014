This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 822 186 filed on May 10 2013 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.

This disclosure was made in part with government support under Grant No. 2R01 CA105304 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The United States Government has certain rights in this disclosure.

This disclosure generally relates to ester derivatives of bisphenol related compounds and their use for treatment of various indications. In particular the disclosure relates to ester derivatives of bisphenol related compounds and their use for treatment of various cancers for example all stages of prostate cancer including androgen dependent androgen sensitive and castration resistant prostate cancers.

Androgens mediate their effects through the androgen receptor AR . Androgens play a role in a wide range of developmental and physiological responses and are involved in male sexual differentiation maintenance of spermatogenesis and male gonadotropin regulation R. K. Ross G. A. Coetzee C. L. Pearce J. K. Reichardt P. Bretsky L. N. Kolonel B. E. Henderson E. Lander D. Altshuler G. Daley 35 355 361 1999 A. A. Thomson 121 187 195 2001 N. Tanji K. Aoki M. Yokoyama 47 1 7 2001 . Several lines of evidence show that androgens are associated with the development of prostate carcinogenesis. Firstly androgens induce prostatic carcinogenesis in rodent models R. L. Noble 37 1929 1933 1977 R. L. Noble 34 138 141 1977 and men receiving androgens in the form of anabolic steroids have a higher incidence of prostate cancer J. T. Roberts D. M. Essenhigh 2 742 1986 J. A. Jackson J. Waxman A. M. Spiekerman 149 2365 2366 1989 P. D. Guinan W. Sadoughi H. Alsheik R. J. Ablin D. Alrenga I. M. Bush 131 599 600 1976 . Secondly prostate cancer does not develop if humans or dogs are castrated before puberty J. D. Wilson C. Roehrborn 84 4324 4331 1999 G. Wilding 14 113 130 1992 . Castration of adult males causes involution of the prostate and apoptosis of prostatic epithelium while eliciting no effect on other male external genitalia E. M. Bruckheimer N. Kyprianou 301 153 162 2000 J. T. Isaacs Prostate 5 545 557 1984 . This dependency on androgens provides the underlying rationale for treating prostate cancer with chemical or surgical castration androgen ablation .

Androgens also play a role in female cancers. One example is ovarian cancer where elevated levels of androgens are associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer K. J. Helzlsouer A. J. Alberg G. B. Gordon C. Longcope T. L. Bush S. C. Hoffman G. W. Comstock 274 1926 1930 1995 R. J. Edmondson J. M. Monaghan B. R. Davies 86 879 885 2002 . The androgen receptor has been detected in a majority of ovarian cancers H. A. Risch 90 1774 1786 1998 B. R. Rao B. J. Slotman 12 14 26 1991 G. M. Clinton W. Hua 25 1 9 1997 whereas estrogen receptor alpha ERa and the progesterone receptor are detected in less than 50 of ovarian tumors.

An effective treatment available for advanced prostate cancer is the withdrawal of androgens which are essential for the survival of prostate epithelial cells. Androgen ablation therapy causes a temporary reduction in tumor burden concomitant with a decrease in serum prostate specific antigen PSA . Unfortunately prostate cancer can eventually grow again in the absence of testicular androgens castration resistant disease Huber et al 1987 104 33 39 . Castration resistant prostate cancer is biochemically characterized before the onset of symptoms by a rising titre of serum PSA Miller et al 1992 147 956 961 . Once the disease becomes castration resistant most patients succumb to their disease within two years.

The androgen receptor has distinct functional domains that include the carboxy terminal ligand binding domain LBD a DNA binding domain DBD comprising two zinc finger motifs and an N terminus domain NTD that contains one or more transcriptional activation domains. Binding of androgen ligand to the LBD of the androgen receptor results in its activation such that the receptor can effectively bind to its specific DNA consensus site termed the androgen response element ARE on the promoter and enhancer regions of normally androgen regulated genes such as PSA to initiate transcription. The androgen receptor can be activated in the absence of androgen by stimulation of the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA pathway with interleukin 6 IL 6 and by various growth factors Culig et al 1994 54 5474 5478 Nazareth et al 1996 271 19900 19907 Sadar 1999 274 7777 7783 Ueda et al 2002 A 277 7076 7085 and Ueda et al 2002 B 277 38087 38094 . The mechanism of ligand independent transformation of the androgen receptor AR has been shown to involve 1 increased nuclear androgen receptor protein suggesting nuclear translocation 2 increased androgen receptor ARE complex formation and 3 the AR NTD Sadar 1999 274 7777 7783 Ueda et al 2002 A 277 7076 7085 and Ueda et al 2002 B 277 38087 38094 . The androgen receptor may be activated in the absence of testicular androgens by alternative signal transduction pathways in castration resistant disease which is consistent with the finding that nuclear androgen receptor protein is present in secondary prostate cancer tumors Kim et al 2002 160 219 226 and van der Kwast et al 1991 48 189 193 .

Available inhibitors of the androgen receptor include nonsteroidal antiandrogens such as bicalutamide nilutamide flutamide enzalutamide and investigational drug ARN 509 and the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate. These antiandrogens target the LBD of the androgen receptor and predominantly fail presumably due to poor affinity and mutations that lead to activation of the androgen receptor by these same antiandrogens Taplin M. E. Bubley G. J. Kom Y. J. Small E. J. Uptonm M. Rajeshkumarm B. Balkm S. P. 59 2511 2515 1999 . These antiandrogens would also have no effect on the recently discovered androgen receptor splice variants that lack the ligand binding domain LBD to result in a constitutively active receptor which promotes progression of androgen independent prostate cancer Dehm S M Schmidt L J Heemers H V Vessella R L Tindall D J. 68 5469 77 2008 Guo Z Yang X Sun F Jiang R Linn D E Chen H Chen H Kong X Melamed J Tepper C G Kung H J Brodie A M Edwards J Qiu Y. 69 2305 13 2009 Hu et al 2009 Cancer Res. 69 16 22 Sun et al 2010 J Clin Invest. 2010 120 2715 30 .

Conventional therapy has concentrated on androgen dependent activation of the androgen receptor through its C terminal domain. Recent studies developing antagonists to the androgen receptor have concentrated on the C terminus and specifically 1 the allosteric pocket and AF 2 activity Estebanez Perpiumlaut over n et al 2007104 16074 16079 2 in silico drug repurposing procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists Bisson et al 2007104 11927 11932 and coactivator or corepressor interactions Chang et al 200519 2478 2490 Hur et al 20042 E274 Estebanez Perpiumlaut over n et al 2005280 8060 8068 He et al 200416 425 438 .

The AR NTD is also a target for drug development e.g. WO 2000 001813 since the NTD contains Activation Function 1 AF 1 which is the essential region required for androgen receptor transcriptional activity Jenster et al 1991. Mol. Endocrinol. 5 1396 404 . The AR NTD importantly plays a role in activation of the androgen receptor in the absence of androgens Sadar M. D. 1999 274 7777 7783 Sadar M D et al 1999 6 487 502 Ueda et al 2002 277 7076 7085 Ueda 2002 277 38087 38094 Blaszczyk et al 2004 10 1860 9 Dehm et al 2006 28 27882 93 Gregory et al 2004 279 7119 30 . The AR NTD is important in hormonal progression of prostate cancer as shown by application of decoy molecules Quayle et al 2007104 1331 1336 .

While the crystal structure has been resolved for the androgen receptor C terminus LBD this has not been the case for the NTD due to its high flexibility and intrinisic disorder in solution Reid et al 2002 277 20079 20086 thereby hampering virtual docking drug discovery approaches.

 Prodrug is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound. Thus the term prodrug refers to a metabolic precursor of a compound of the disclosure that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be active or inactive when administered to a subject in need thereof but is converted in vivo to an active or more active compound. Prodrugs are typically rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound for example by hydrolysis in blood. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism see Bundgard H. Design of Prodrugs 1985 pp. 7 9 21 24 Elsevier Amsterdam . A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi T. et al. A.C.S. Symposium Series Vol. 14 and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design Ed. Edward B. Roche American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press 1987. The present disclosure is meant to ecompass all compounds of structure I whether acting as a prodrug or the active compound itself or both.

The disclosure disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all pharmaceutically acceptable compounds of Structure I being isotopically labelled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the disclosed compounds include isotopes of hydrogen carbon nitrogen oxygen phosphorous fluorine chlorine and iodine such as H H C C C N N O O O P P S F Cl I and I respectively. These radiolabelled compounds could be useful to help determine or measure the effectiveness of the compounds by characterizing for example the site or mode of action or binding affinity to pharmacologically important site of action. Certain isotopically labelled compounds of Structure I for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope are useful in drug and or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium i.e. H and carbon 14 i.e. C are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.

Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium i.e. H may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability for example increased in vivo half life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances.

Substitution with positron emitting isotopes such as C F O Iand N can be useful in Positron Emission Topography PET or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography SPECT studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically labeled compounds of Structure I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples as set out below using an appropriate isotopically labeled reagent in place of the non labeled reagent previously employed.

The disclosure disclosed herein is also meant to encompass the in vivo metabolic products of the disclosed compounds. Such products may result from for example the oxidation reduction hydrolysis amidation esterification and the like of the administered compound primarily due to enzymatic processes. Accordingly the disclosure includes compounds produced by a process comprising administering a compound of this disclosure to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product thereof. Such products are typically identified by administering a radiolabelled compound of the disclosure in a detectable dose to an animal such as rat mouse guinea pig monkey or to human allowing sufficient time for metabolism to occur and isolating its conversion products from the urine blood or other biological samples.

 Stable compound and stable structure are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent.

 Mammal includes humans and both domestic animals such as laboratory animals and household pets e.g. cats dogs swine cattle sheep goats horses rabbits and non domestic animals such as wildlife and the like.

 Optional or optionally means that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. For example optionally substituted aryl means that the aryl radical may or may not be substituted and that the description includes both substituted aryl radicals and aryl radicals having no substitution.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier diluent or excipient includes without limitation any adjuvant carrier excipient glidant sweetening agent diluent preservative dye colorant flavor enhancer surfactant wetting agent dispersing agent suspending agent stabilizer isotonic agent solvent or emulsifier which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as being acceptable for use in humans or domestic animals.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable and which are formed with inorganic acids such as but are not limited to hydrochloric acid hydrobromic acid sulfuric acid nitric acid phosphoric acid and the like and organic acids such as but not limited to acetic acid 2 2 dichloroacetic acid adipic acid alginic acid ascorbic acid aspartic acid benzenesulfonic acid benzoic acid 4 acetamidobenzoic acid camphoric acid camphor 10 sulfonic acid capric acid caproic acid caprylic acid carbonic acid cinnamic acid citric acid cyclamic acid dodecylsulfuric acid ethane 1 2 disulfonic acid ethanesulfonic acid 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acid formic acid fumaric acid galactaric acid gentisic acid glucoheptonic acid gluconic acid glucuronic acid glutamic acid glutaric acid 2 oxo glutaric acid glycerophosphoric acid glycolic acid hippuric acid isobutyric acid lactic acid lactobionic acid lauric acid maleic acid malic acid malonic acid mandelic acid methanesulfonic acid mucic acid naphthalene 1 5 disulfonic acid naphthalene 2 sulfonic acid 1 hydroxy 2 naphthoic acid nicotinic acid oleic acid orotic acid oxalic acid palmitic acid pamoic acid propionic acid pyroglutamic acid pyruvic acid salicylic acid 4 aminosalicylic acid sebacic acid stearic acid succinic acid tartaric acid thiocyanic acid p toluenesulfonic acid trifluoroacetic acid undecylenic acid and the like.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from inorganic bases include but are not limited to the sodium potassium lithium ammonium calcium magnesium iron zinc copper manganese aluminum salts and the like. Preferred inorganic salts are the ammonium sodium potassium calcium and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include but are not limited to salts of primary secondary and tertiary amines substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins such as ammonia isopropylamine trimethylamine diethylamine triethylamine tripropylamine diethanolamine ethanolamine deanol 2 dimethylaminoethanol 2 diethylaminoethanol dicyclohexylamine lysine arginine histidine caffeine procaine hydrabamine choline betaine benethamine benzathine ethylenediamine glucosamine methylglucamine theobromine triethanolamine tromethamine purines piperazine piperidine N ethylpiperidine polyamine resins and the like. Particularly preferred organic bases are isopropylamine diethylamine ethanolamine trimethylamine dicyclohexylamine choline and caffeine.

Often crystallizations produce a solvate of the compound of the disclosure. As used herein the term solvate refers to an aggregate that comprises one or more molecules of a compound of the disclosure with one or more molecules of solvent. The solvent may be water in which case the solvate may be a hydrate. Alternatively the solvent may be an organic solvent. Thus the compounds of the present disclosure may exist as a hydrate including a monohydrate dihydrate hemihydrate sesquihydrate trihydrate tetrahydrate and the like as well as the corresponding solvated forms. The compound of the disclosure may be true solvates while in other cases the compound of the disclosure may merely retain adventitious water or be a mixture of water plus some adventitious solvent.

A pharmaceutical composition refers to a formulation of a compound of the disclosure and a medium generally accepted in the art for the delivery of the biologically active compound to mammals e.g. humans. Such a medium includes all pharmaceutically acceptable carriers diluents or excipients therefor.

An effective amount refers to a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. A therapeutically effective amount refers to an amount effective at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired therapeutic result such as reduced tumor size increased life span or increased life expectancy. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the subject and the ability of the compound to elicit a desired response in the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. A therapeutically effective amount is also one in which any toxic or detrimental effects of the compound are outweighed by the therapeutically beneficial effects.

Treatment of C with an appropriate ring opening reagent for example CeClx7HO yields D.

Compounds of structure D can be used as intermediates for the preparation of various compounds of Structure I. For example compound D can be modified to include an ester at the primary alcohol by treatment with the appropriate acid chloride e.g. acetyl chloride and the like . Alternatively the 1 2 dihydroxyl moiety can be protected as a ketal by reaction with 2 2 dimethoxypropane followed by conversion of the free secondary alcohol to an ester by treatment with the appropriate anhydride e.g. acetic anhydride and the like and deprotection of the ketal. Triester compounds of structure I can be prepared by treatment of compound D with an appropriate anhydride. Finally the 1 2 dihydroxyls can both be converted to a desired ester group using a modification of the above scheme as demonstrated in Examples 9 11. Other compounds of structure I are easily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art based on the above description.

Compounds of structure I wherein Ris ORcan be prepared by treating compounds of structure A with 2 equivalents of an appropriate epoxidation reagent for example an appropriately substituted glycidyl tosylate to yield a bis epoxide. One of these epoxides can be opened with an alcohol i.e. ROH followed by opening of the remaining epoxide with CeClx7HO and esterification as described above to yield the compound of structure I.

In another embodiment the present disclosure provides the use of any one of the foregoing pharmaceutical compositions including compositions comprising a compound of Structure I and an additional therapeutic agent for modulating androgen receptor AR activity. For example in some embodiments modulating androgen receptor AR activity is in a mammalian cell.

In other embodiments modulating androgen receptor AR activity is for treatment of at least one indication selected from the group consisting of prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer endometrial cancer salivary gland carcinoma hair loss acne hirsutism ovarian cysts polycystic ovary disease precocious puberty spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and age related macular degeneration. For example in some embodiments the indication is prostate cancer. For example in some embodiments the prostate cancer is castration resistant prostate cancer and in other embodiments the prostate cancer is androgen dependent prostate cancer.

In yet another embodiment the present disclosure provides a method of modulating androgen receptor AR activity the method comprising administering any one of the foregoing pharmaceutical compositions including compositions comprising a compound of Structure I and an additional therapeutic agent to a subject in need thereof. For example in some embodiments modulating androgen receptor AR activity is for the treatment of one or more of the following prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer endometrial cancer salivary gland carcinoma hair loss acne hirsutism ovarian cysts polycystic ovary disease precocious puberty spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy and age related macular degeneration. In still other embodiments the indication is prostate cancer. For example in some embodiments the prostate cancer is castration resistant prostate cancer while in other embodiments the prostate cancer is androgen dependent prostate cancer.

In general compounds of the disclosure should be used without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the compounds of the disclosure can be determined using standard techniques for example by testing in cell cultures or experimental animals and determining the therapeutic index i.e. the ratio between the LD50 the dose lethal to 50 of the population and the LD100 the dose lethal to 100 of the population . In some circumstances however such as in severe disease conditions it may be necessary to administer substantial excesses of the compositions. Some compounds of this disclosure may be toxic at some concentrations. Titration studies may be used to determine toxic and non toxic concentrations. Toxicity may be evaluated by examining a particular compound s or composition s specificity across cell lines using PC3 cells as a negative control that do not express functional AR. Animal studies may be used to provide an indication if the compound has any effects on other tissues. Systemic therapy that targets the AR will not likely cause major problems to other tissues since antiandrogens and androgen insensitivity syndrome are not fatal.

Compounds as described herein may be administered to a subject. As used herein a subject may be a human non human primate mammal rat mouse cow horse pig sheep goat dog cat and the like. The subject may be suspected of having or at risk for having a cancer such as prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer salivary gland carcinoma or endometrial cancer or suspected of having or at risk for having acne hirsutism alopecia benign prostatic hyperplasia ovarian cysts polycystic ovary disease precocious puberty spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or age related macular degeneration. Diagnostic methods for various cancers such as prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer salivary gland carcinoma or endometrial cancer and diagnostic methods for acne hirsutism alopecia benign prostatic hyperplasia ovarian cysts polycystic ovary disease precocious puberty spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or age related macular degeneration and the clinical delineation of cancer such as prostate cancer breast cancer ovarian cancer salivary gland carcinoma or endometrial cancer diagnoses and the clinical delineation of acne hirsutism alopecia benign prostatic hyperplasia ovarian cysts polycystic ovary disease precocious puberty spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy or age related macular degeneration are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Compounds described herein may also be used in assays and for research purposes. Definitions used include ligand dependent activation of the androgen receptor AR by androgens such as dihydrotestosterone DHT or the synthetic androgen R1881 used for research purposes. Ligand independent activation of the AR refers to transactivation of the AR in the absence of androgen ligand by for example stimulation of the cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA pathway with forskolin FSK . Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit both FSK and androgen e.g. R1881 a synthetic androgen induction of ARE luciferase ARE luc . Constitutive activity of the AR refers to splice variants lacking the AR ligand binding domain. Such compounds may block a mechanism that is common to both ligand dependent and ligand independent activation of the AR as well as constitutively active splice variants of the AR that lack ligand binding domain. This could involve any step in activation of the AR including dissociation of heatshock proteins essential posttranslational modifications e.g. acetylation phosphorylation nuclear translocation protein protein interactions formation of the transcriptional complex release of co repressors and or increased degradation. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit ligand only activity and may interfere with a mechanism specific to ligand dependent activation e.g. accessibility of the ligand binding domain LBD to androgen . Numerous disorders in addition to prostate cancer involve the androgen axis e.g. acne hirsutism alopecia benign prostatic hyperplasia and compounds interfering with this mechanism may be used to treat such conditions. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may only inhibit FSK induction and may be specific inhibitors to ligand independent activation of the AR. These compounds and compositions may interfere with the cascade of events that normally occur with FSK and or PKA activity or any downstream effects that may play a role on the AR e.g. FSK increases MAPK activity which has a potent effect on AR activity . Examples may include an inhibitor of cAMP and or PKA or other kinases. Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may induce basal levels of activity of the AR no androgen or stimulation of the PKA pathway . Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may increase induction by R1881 or FSK. Such compounds and compositions may stimulate transcription or transactivation of the AR.

Some compounds and compositions of this disclosure may inhibit activity of the androgen receptor. Interleukin 6 IL 6 also causes ligand independent activation of the AR in LNCaP cells and can be used in addition to FSK.

Compounds or pharmaceutical compositions in accordance with this disclosure or for use in this disclosure may be administered by means of a medical device or appliance such as an implant graft prosthesis stent etc. Also implants may be devised which are intended to contain and release such compounds or compositions. An example would be an implant made of a polymeric material adapted to release the compound over a period of time.

It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. For any particular subject specific dosage regimens may be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions. Dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and do not limit the dosage ranges that may be selected by medical practitioners. The amount of active compound s in the composition may vary according to factors such as the disease state age sex and weight of the subject. Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example a single bolus may be administered several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It may be advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.

The compounds described herein may be used for in vivo or in vitro research uses i.e. non clinical to investigate the mechanisms of orphan and nuclear receptors including steroid receptors such as the androgen receptor . Furthermore these compounds may be used individually or as part of a kit for in vivo or in vitro research to investigate signal transduction pathways and or the activation of orphan and nuclear receptors using recombinant proteins cells maintained in culture and or animal models.

LNCaP 2.4 10cell well cells were seeded on 24 well plates overnight before transfection with PSA 6.1 kb luciferase plasmid 0.25 ug well in serum free red phenol free media. The next day cells were pre treated with compounds of the disclosure for 1 hour before the addition of synthetic androgen R1881 1 nM to trans activate the androgen receptor. After 48 h of incubation with R1881 the cells were harvested and relative luciferase activity was determined as a read out for androgen receptor transcriptional activity. Test compounds were added to the cells at various concentrations and activity for each treatment was normalized to the predicted maximal activity induction in the absence of test compounds vehicle only . Transfection experiments were performed using triplicate wells.

Furthermore toxicity was assessed by both microscopic examination and reduction of protein levels. Solubility was assessed both macroscopically cloudy media and microscopically formation of granules or crystals .
