Based on this finding a novel activity based method is provided herein for detecting proteases in a sample by contacting the sample with a protease substrate comprising one or more protease cleavage sites. Cleavage of the substrate indicates the presence of protease in the sample. In certain embodiments this method can be used to diagnose a subject with aspergillosis caused by an infection by detecting the presence of a proteases in a biological sample from the subject. In other embodiments this detection method can be incorporated into a method of treating aspergillosis caused by an infection. For example detection of the presence of an protease in a biological sample from a subject can be used to determine whether to administer or re administer a therapeutic agent or to help determine an effective dosage for administering such an agent. Also provided herein are kits for carrying out the detection diagnosis and treatment methods disclosed herein. The methods and kits provided herein are superior to previously developed methods in part because they provide equal or greater sensitivity with reduced time and cost. The methods disclosed herein may be performed in either a manual or automated format.

In certain embodiments the methods and kits provided herein may be used to detect the presence of protease Asp f2. In other embodiments the methods and kits provided herein may be used to detect the presence of other proteases including but not limited to proteases comprising the amino acid motifs HRLYH SEQ ID NO 36 or HEXXH SEQ ID NO 37 or an amino acid sequence with significant sequence identity to these motifs. In certain of these embodiments an amino acid sequence with significant sequence identity to these motifs comprises one or more conservative substitutions versus the motif.

In certain embodiments the methods and kits provided herein may be used to detect an protease from including but not limited to Asp f2. In other embodiments the methods and kits may be used to detect proteases such as Asp f2 or homologues thereof from other species including for example and . Accordingly the methods and kits disclosed herein may be used to diagnose a subject with aspergillosis caused by infection with or or to treat aspergillosis caused by infection with or . In certain embodiments the protease being detected is glycosylated at one or more locations within the protein. For example in certain embodiments the methods and kits provided herein detect glycosylated Asp f2.

In certain embodiments of the methods and kits provided herein a sample is enriched for an protease prior to or at the same time as contact with the protease substrate. In certain of these embodiments enrichment is achieved by contacting the sample with one or more protease specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof. For example where the protease is Asp f2 the sample may be contacted with one or more Asp f2 specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof. In these embodiments the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may be monoclonal antibodies chimeric antibodies humanized antibodies affinity matured antibodies human antibodies bispecific antibodies or any antigen binding fragment thereof such as an scFv F ab 2 Fab Fab or Fv. In certain embodiments the protease specific antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof binds the protease in such a way such that the protease retains its catalytic activity after binding.

Provided herein in certain embodiments are protease specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof as well as compositions formulations and kits comprising these antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof and the use of these antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof in the detection diagnosis and treatment methods disclosed herein. As discussed in the Examples below the novel monoclonal antibody 5D7A1 was used to bind Asp f2 in a bead based assay. Accordingly in certain embodiments compositions formulations and kits are provided that comprise 5D7A1 alone or in combination with other components. In certain embodiments the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof provided herein comprise the complete variable light or variable heavy chain of 5D7A1 or homologues thereof. In these embodiments the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof comprise a light chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 a heavy chain comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 or a combination thereof.

In certain of these embodiments the antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof comprise one or more CDRs selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 8 10 12 14 16 and 18 or any combination thereof. In certain embodiments an antigen binding fragment thereof as provided herein is an scFv and in certain of these embodiments the scFv comprises the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 20 or 22 or one or more CDRs set forth therein .

In certain embodiments where a sample is enriched for an protease using an protease specific antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof may be free in solution. In these embodiments the protease antibody conjugate resulting from binding may be removed from solution for testing with a protease substrate using methods well known in the art. In other embodiments the antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof may be attached to or immobilized on an enrichment matrix such as an immunosorbent support of loose beads or a fixed column. In these embodiments the enrichment matrix may comprise immunoaffinity beads including cyanogen bromide CNBr activated Sepharose beads protein A protein G or protein A G conjugated Sepharose agarose or magnetic beads coupled and cross linked to protease specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof.

In those embodiments of the methods and kits disclosed herein that utilize an enrichment matrix formation of the protease antibody conjugate results in the protease being attached to or immobilized on the enrichment matrix. For example where a sample is being tested for the presence of Asp f2 the sample may be contacted with an enrichment matrix comprising one or more Asp f2 specific antibodies that bind Asp f2 to form an Asp f2 antibody conjugate. During or after formation of the protease antibody conjugate the enrichment matrix is contacted with the protease substrate. In certain embodiments the enrichment matrix may comprise the protease substrate prior to addition of the sample. In other embodiments the protease substrate may be added to the enrichment matrix after sample addition. In certain of these embodiments the enrichment matrix may be washed prior to contact with the protease substrate in order to remove unbound protease and or other proteins and molecules. If the protease is present in the enrichment matrix the protease substrate will be cleaved upon contact with the enrichment matrix.

In certain embodiments of the methods disclosed herein exposure of a sample to an enrichment matrix and to a protease substrate occurs under conditions permitting binding of protease to an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof on the enrichment matrix and modification of the protease substrate by the protease. In certain embodiments one or more of these steps may be carried out in the dark.

A protease substrate for use in the methods and kits disclosed herein can be any chemical biochemical or biological species or compound that reacts with or is capable of being modified by an protease. In certain embodiments the protease substrate comprises one or more protease cleavage sites and in certain of these embodiments the protease substrate may comprise one two three four or five or more cleavage sites. For example where the protease is Asp f2 the protease substrate comprises one or more Asp f2 cleavage sites. In certain of these embodiments the Asp f2 cleavage site comprises the amino acid sequence FSALK SEQ ID NO 38 . As disclosed in the Examples below Asp f2 is a protease that cleaves and or degrades certain protein or peptide substrates including the peptide of SEQ ID NO 5 collagen and elastin. In certain embodiments of the methods and kits provided herein wherein the protease is Asp f2 the Asp f2 protease substrate is a peptide comprising the amino acid sequence FSALK SEQ ID NO 38 the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 5 a human serum albumin protein or portion thereof e.g. a peptide an elastin protein or portion thereof e.g. a peptide or a collagen protein or portion thereof e.g. a peptide . In certain embodiments the protease substrate is a circular substrate which can increase the stability of the peptide by enhancing protection against digestion by other proteases. In certain of these embodiments the circular substrate is formed through a disulfide bond between two cysteines located within the peptide. In other embodiments the substrate may be circularized through amino acids other than cysteines. For example a glutamic acid residue may be positioned at a location 5 of the protease cleavage site and the peptide may be circularized via an N terminus to glutamate side chain peptide bond. In other embodiments the protease substrate is non circular.

Cleavage or other modification of a protease substrate may be detected in a variety of ways well known in the art. For example the protease substrate may be removed from solution or from an enrichment matrix and run on a gel to detect changes in size. In other embodiments the protease substrate may be capable of eliciting a detectable fluorescent signal when modified by an protease. In these embodiments cleavage may be detected based on this fluorescent signal. For example in certain embodiments the protease substrate may comprise a donor fluorophore such as 5 carboxyfluorescein 5 Fam or 4 methylumbelliferone 4 Mu and an acceptor having an absorbance spectrum overlapping the emission spectrum of the donor fluorophore including for example a dark quencher such as 4 dimethylaminoazo benzene 4 carboxy DABCYL . In certain embodiments the one or more fluorophores may be conjugated to the peptide or protein component of the protease substrate at or near the N terminus of the peptide or protein. As used herein near the N terminus refers to any position on the peptide or protein component of the protease substrate that is within five amino acids of the N terminus of the peptide or protein while near the C terminus refers to any position on the peptide or protein component of the protease substrate that is within five amino acids of the C terminus of the peptide or protein. In certain of these embodiments the fluorophore e.g. 5 FAM is conjugated to an alpha amino group of an N terminal amino acid and in certain of these embodiments the N terminal amino acid is a threonine residue. In other embodiments the fluorophore may be conjugated to an epsilon amino group of an N terminal amino acid. Similarly in certain embodiments the acceptor may be conjugated to the peptide or protein component at or near the C terminus of the peptide or protein. In certain of these embodiments the acceptor e.g. DABCYL is conjugated to an epsilon amino group of a C terminal amino acid and in certain of these embodiments the C terminal amino acid is a lysine residue.

In those embodiments where the fluorophore and or acceptor are conjugated to the peptide or protein component of the protease substrate conjugation may be via a peptide bond which enhances the stability of the substrate. In certain embodiments wherein a protease substrate comprises a fluorophore and an acceptor the acceptor e.g. DABCYL suppresses the fluorescence emission of the fluorophore when the protease substrate is intact and the acceptor and fluorophore remain close together. When the substrate is cleaved by the protease the fluorophore and acceptor are separated and the fluorophore emits light energy upon excitation. Thus protease substrate cleavage and hence the presence of protease is detected by contacting the protease substrate with an excitatory wavelength of light. If the protease substrate is cleaved i.e. if the protease is present the fluorophore will emit fluorescence upon excitation. If the protease substrate remains intact the acceptor will suppress fluorescent emission. The protease substrate may be contacted with the excitatory wavelength in solution on an enrichment matrix or after removal or elution from an enrichment matrix. In certain embodiments the protease substrate is part of a substrate composition comprising the protease substrate plus one or more additional components.

Detection of a fluorescent signal in conjunction with the methods disclosed herein may be performed using a handheld ultraviolet UV light a fluorescence excitation and or detecting tool or any suitable commercially available fluorometer. In some embodiments a Victor X2 multilabel plate reader Perkin Elmer Shelton Conn. may be used to detect fluorescence. In some embodiments the level of the change in the detectable fluorescence signal is calculated as a change in relative fluorescence unit RFU . In certain embodiments the level of the change in the fluorescence signal may be classified as elevated i.e. protease is present when the level of the change in the signal is greater than or equal to a predetermined level of background fluorescence. In some embodiments the predetermined level of background fluorescence may be the fluorescent level of an protease free control sample. In some embodiments the level of the change in the detectable fluorescence signal is elevated when the level is significantly greater than the level of change in detectable fluorescence signal from a negative control sample. As described herein a negative control sample comprises a sample that does not comprise protease for example a biological sample from a subject that is known to not be infected with . In other embodiments the negative control sample may be treated with a metalloprotease inhibitor.

In certain embodiments an enrichment matrix may comprise beads coupled and cross linked to antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that bind a fluorophore and or acceptor conjugated to the protease substrate. For example cyanogen bromide CNBr activated Sepharose beads may be coupled and cross linked to anti FITC antibodies that bind a fluorescent 5 Fam label conjugated to the protease substrate. In another example the enrichment matrix comprises CNBr activated Sepharose beads coupled and cross linked to anti DABCYL antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that bind DABCYL conjugated to the protease substrate. In certain embodiments the enrichment matrix may further comprise anti protease substrate specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof. In certain embodiments the anti protease substrate specific antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof may bind a portion of the protease substrate including a fluorophore or acceptor or amino acids of the peptide or protein component of the substrate sequence.

In certain embodiments the enrichment matrix may comprise a double affinity matrix comprising beads coupled and cross linked to antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that specifically bind the protease as described herein and beads coupled and cross linked to antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that specifically bind the protease substrate or fluorophore and or acceptors conjugated to the protease substrate as described herein.

In certain embodiments wherein the protease being detected is Asp f2 the protease substrate may consist of or comprise FluHSA2 see Example 1 below . In these embodiments the FluHSA2 protease substrate may be circular or non circular. In certain of these embodiments the methods and kits and utilize an enrichment matrix comprising CNBr activated Sepharose beads coupled and cross linked to antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof that bind a portion of FluHSA2.

In certain embodiments of the diagnosis and treatment methods provided herein the methods are used to determine if a subject is currently suffering from aspergillosis caused by an infection. In other embodiments the methods may be used to determine whether a subject has suffered from aspergillosis previously or to predict whether a subject is likely to develop aspergillosis. In certain embodiments a subject is suspected of suffering from aspergillosis due to the presence of one or more symptoms associated with aspergillosis. In certain embodiments a subject has been previously diagnosed with aspergillosis.

In certain embodiments of the treatment methods provided herein the steps of detecting protease are repeated at various timepoints following administration of a therapeutic agent or an increased dosage of a therapeutic agent.

A novel bead based assay was developed for detecting Asp f2 proteolytic activity. An immobilization bead based immuno affinity matrix was prepared using the novel anti Asp f2 monoclonal antibody 5D7A1 SEQ ID NOS 1 4 . As demonstrated below 5D7A1 binds the native glycosylated form of Asp f2. Cyanogen bromide CNBr activated sepharose beads were swelled in ice cold HCl 1 mM . Beads 1.0 g were incubated with 3.0 mg of 5D7A1 in Coupling Buffer NaHCO 0.1 M and NaCl 0.5 M pH 8.3 8.5 and rotated for two hours at 22 C. or for 16 hours at 4 C. Beads were blocked with 0.1 M ethanolamine pH 8.0 then washed with buffers of alternating pH first with Coupling Buffer pH 8.5 then with a low pH buffer sodium acetate 0.1 M NaCl 0.5 M pH 4.0 . These dual washes were repeated four times. Lastly beads were resuspended in ammonium bicarbonate 100 mM lyophilized and stored at 4 C.

125 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF samples from patients at City of Hope suspected of having an aspergillosis infection or another form of pulmonary mycosis were lyophilized to dryness and then re dissolved in water in one tenth of the original BALF volume. Re dissolved BALF 0.5 mL was combined with 0.5 mL of Immunoprecipitation IP Binding Buffer Tris base 0.025 M NaCl 0.15M NP 40 1 glycerol 5 pH 7.4 . To immunoenrich active Asp f2 antibody coupled beads 200 L were transferred into each tube of BALF IP Binding Buffer or BALF negative controls 0.9 NaCl IP Binding Buffer 1 1 . Samples were rotated for 1 hour at 22 C. followed by 16 hours rotation at 4 C. The beads were washed twice with IP Binding buffer three times with TBS Tris base 25 mM NaCl 150 mM pH 7.2 once with NaCl 0.2 M and finally three times with protease free HO. Beads were re dissolved in HO 2 100 L for duplicate or 3 100 L for triplicate measurements .

The enzymatic activity of immobilized Asp f2 was determined by cleavage of a novel fluorogenic peptide FluHSA2 5 Fam TKCATESAVNRRPCFSALK DABCYL SEQ ID NO 5 . FluHSA2 comprises the peptide of SEQ ID NO 5 conjugated to 5 Fam at the alpha amino group of the threonine at the N terminus of the peptide and to DABCYL at the epsilon amino group of the lysine side chain at the C terminus of the peptide. Upon excitation the DABCYL suppresses the fluorescence emission of the 5 Fam labeled peptides when the peptides are not cleaved and the fluorescent label and DABCYL remain close together. However when the peptide is cleaved by Asp f2 the fluorescent label and DABCYL are separated and the fluorescent label emits light energy upon excitation. For each replicate including negative controls 100 L of the antibody coupled bead suspension was transferred into 0.5 mL reaction buffer FluHSA2 SEQ ID NO 5 10 M in sodium phosphate 25 mM NaCl 100 mM pH 7.2. Tubes were incubated in the dark for two hours at 37 C. or for 16 hours at 22 C. on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Fluorescence was measured at Excitation Ex 485 nm Emission Em 535 nm in a black 96 well micro titer plate.

Results indicated that the FluHSA2 peptide was cleaved in samples from patients suspected of having aspergillosis but remained uncleaved in samples from patients that had other mold infections or no infection p

Previous studies have not detected Asp f2 proteolytic activity and Asp f2 has not previously been classified as a metalloprotease because it has very low 15 sequence identity to the metalloproteases of the Zincin like family and lacks the HEXXH SEQ ID NO 37 signature that characterizes all metalloproteases Amich et al. 2010 . However a sequence alignment of Asp f2 with deuterolysin from and the putative metalloprotease MEP20 from shows that Asp f2 contains a motif similar to the HEXXH SEQ ID NO 37 motif HRLYH SEQ ID NO 36 respectively . To investigate whether Asp f2 is a zinc metalloprotease the bead based assay described in Example 1 was used to evaluate Asp f2 protease activity in the presence of histidine modifiers and various chelators as well as the activity of an Asp f2 with a mutation in the histidine residue of the HRLYH SEQ ID NO 36 motif. These experiments led to the unexpected finding that Asp f2 possesses zinc metalloproteolytic activity.

It was not possible to express proteolytically active Asp f2 directly in bacteria because active Asp f2 lacks the signal peptide MAALLRLAVLLPLAAPLVATLPTSPVPIAAR SEQ ID NO 39 residues 1 31 and kills the bacteria. Accordingly active recombinant Asp f2 was generated using a fusion protein that expresses inactive recombinant Asp f2 which can then be activated after purification SEQ ID NOS 6 and 7 . The fusion protein comprised an N terminal linker Trx SMT3 N terminal linker region fused to Asp f2 residues 32 310 codon optimized for expression in via a Ubiquitin like specific protease 1 ULP1 cleavage site located between SMT3 and Asp f2. The Trx SMT3 N terminal linker contained the following from N to C terminus thioredoxin Trx glycine serine linker His tag linkers anotherHis tag SMT3. Trx was added to improve solubility of the construct and a yeast SUMO Smt3 was added to help enhance expression and promote solubility of Asp f2. Following purification using a His tag specific nickel NTA column Asp f2 was activated by cleaving the Trx SMT3 N terminal linker off using UPL1. This process yielded active recombinant Asp f2. The different cleavage sites in the linker region of the fusion protein construct can be used for cleavage by other enzymes .

Diethylpyrocarbonate DEPC derivatization of histidines results in the chemical modification of histidines in proteins and is used to study the importance of histidyl residues in enzymes. Using the materials and methods described in Example 1 anti Asp f2 5D7A1 bound beads were incubated with native or recombinant Asp f2 in the presence or absence of DEPC 30 M and incubated for one hour at 22 C. prior to reaction with FluHSA2. Samples were then incubated with 10 M of FluHSA2 for 16 hours at 22 C. and fluorescence was measured as described above. Cleavage of FluHSA2 was detected in the presence or absence of DEPC to test the proteolytic activity of native and recombinant Asp f2. Results show that both native and recombinant Asp f2 cleave the FluHSA2 substrate but are inactive in the presence of DEPC . This result indicates that at least one histidine residue may be necessary for Asp f2 proteolytic activity indicating that Asp f2 may be a metalloprotease.

To further investigate whether Asp f2 possesses zinc metalloprotease activity a variety of protease inhibitors and zinc ions were tested to investigate their effects on native and recombinant Asp f2 activity respectively . Anti Asp f2 5D7A1 bound beads were incubated with native or recombinant Asp f2 in the presence or absence of 0.5 mM zinc chloride or 50 M of various inhibitors. Samples were incubated with FluHSA2 and fluorescence was measured as described above. Treatment with the zinc chelator N N N N tetrakis 2 pyridylmethyl ethylenediamine TPEN the inhibitor of metallopeptidases 1 10 phenanthroline and the metal ion chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA suppressed both native and recombinant Asp f2 metalloprotease activity respectively . Other protease inhibitors that are known to inhibit different families of proteases e.g. cysteine peptidases IAA trypsin proteases aprotinin and SBTI aspartyl proteases pepstatin A and serine proteases PMSF did not inhibit native or recombinant Asp f2 respectively . These results further demonstrate that Asp f2 possesses zinc metalloprotease activity. Various Asp f2 histidine residues including those located in the HRLYH motif were mutated to alanine H186A and H190A are located in the HRLYH motif and mutant or wild type Asp f2 was incubated with anti Asp f2 5D7A1 bound beads as described above followed by incubation with FluHSA2. Mutation of histidine 186 to alanine significantly decreased the proteolytic activity of Asp f2 compared with wild type Asp f2 .

Cleavage specificity of the novel FluHSA peptide was tested using Asp f2 and another protein Asp f3. CNBr activated sepharose beads were prepared as described in Example 1 and incubated with either the anti Asp f2 monoclonal antibody 5D7A1 or an anti Asp f3 rabbit polyclonal antibody. Anti Asp f2 immobilized beads were incubated with native Asp f2 and anti Asp f3 immobilized beads were incubated with native Asp f3. Samples were incubated with FluHSA2 10 M for 16 hours at 22 C. Fluorescence was measured at Ex 485 nm Em 535 nm in a black 96 well micro titer plate as described above. FluHSA2 was found to exhibit high specificity for cleavage by Asp f2 compared with Asp f3 . This demonstrates the remarkable specificity that the FluHSA2 peptide has for the glycoprotein Asp f2.

The cleavage products of FluHSA2 after reaction with native Asp f2 were investigated by mass spectrometric analysis MALDI spectra . Cleavage by Asp f2 occurred in the C terminal linear tail section of the peptide resulting in at least 5 cleavage products .

Peptides other than FluHSA2 were tested for cleavage by Asp f2. Anti Asp f2 5D7A1 bound beads were incubated with native Asp f2 then incubated with either FluHSA2 10 M fluorescent labeled elastin protein 5 Fam QXL520 labeled elastin SensoLyteGreen Elastase assay kit 72178 Anaspec Freemont Calif. USA or FITC conjugated collagen 85111 Anaspec Freemont Calif. USA 15 g mL . Fluorescence was measured at Ex 485 nm Em 535 nm in a black 96 well micro titer plate as described above. Results showed that native Asp f2 is also capable of degrading the human proteins collagen and elastin . This demonstrates that active Asp f2 enriched on beads with 5D7A1 can cleave both fluorogenic elastin and collagen.

The specificity of binding between Asp f2 and the anti Asp f2 antibody 5D7A1 was further investigated using 5D7A1 and a variety of other antibodies known to bind Asp proteins other than Asp f2 anti Asp f1 specific for Asp f1 and anti Asp f3 specific for Asp f3 and proteases 4E17.1 specific for botulinum neurotoxin serotype A heavy chain in the bead based protease activity assay as described above. Polyclonal Rabbit IgG antibody was used as a non specific IgG control. Antibodies were incubated with culture filtrate from and protease activity was detected using the 5 FAM labeled elastin protein or FITC conjugated collagen protein described above in Example 3. Fluorescence was measured at Ex 485 nm Em 535 nm in a black 96 well micro titer plate as described above.

Results demonstrated that robust Asp f2 cleavage of the collagen and elastin substrates was detected in only those samples containing the anti Asp f2 antibody 5D7A1 FITC collagen substrate 5 Fam elastin substrate . Little to no activity was observed in samples containing antibodies that are non Asp f2 specific antibodies . This assay demonstrates that Asp f2 and 5D7A1 bind each other specifically.

Most aspergillosis is caused by but there are other aspergilli that can cause the disease. Proteolytic activity of Asp f2 was investigated in BALF samples from aspergillosis patients for which species were identified as indicated by the clinical Microbiology lab at City of Hope. The different species identified were and other unidentified species. Results demonstrate that Asp f2 proteolytic activity may be useful for detecting other species as well .

A receiver operating characteristic ROC curve was generated to determine the sensitivity specificity and appropriate cut off values of the bead based Asp f2 assay described herein . The ROC analysis included clinical diagnostic data from a total of 144 patients of which 27 had aspergillosis 40 had other mold infections and 77 were diagnosed negative for fungal infections. The ROC curve was used to determine the cutoff value for positive Asp f2 activity assay values. This cutoff value is ARFU 8.8 10 which corresponds to approximately 280 pmol mL substrate HSA2 peptide cleaved by Asp f2 in 16 hours. The assay was found to have a specificity of 96.1 at a sensitivity of 77.8 for cases of aspergillosis versus a specificity of 72.7 at 57.5 sensitivity for all other mold infections indicating that the assay is highly specific and sensitive for aspergillosis and less specific and sensitive for other mold infections.

The Asp f2 activity assay disclosed herein was compared to clinical galactomannan GM test results. Clinical diagnosis was based on the EORTC MSG criteria for probable and proven aspergillosis DePauw 2008 including cytological pathological and microbiological examination of the patients by infectious disease physicians. The GM assay was performed by a clinical laboratory. A GM index cut off of 0.5 for patients positive with fungal infections was used in accordance with clinical practice. The GM assay had only 40 sensitivity in the sample group of City of Hope aspergillosis patients while the Asp f2 activity assay achieved 77.8 sensitivity in the same group of patients . A cut off value of RFU 8.8 10 equivalent to 280 pmol mL converted substrate in 16 hours was used to determine aspergillosis positive samples.

A molecular cloning approach was used to generate single chain variable fragments scFvs from the sequenced Vand Vchains of 5D7A1. Two types of scFvs were generated. In the first the C terminus of the Vchain is linked to the N terminus of the Vchain via a glycine serine linker GS15 . In the second the sequential order of the V chains is reversed such that the C terminus of the Vchain is linked to the N terminus of the Vchain using the same GS15 linker.

Initial attempts at scFv expression resulted in insoluble products. To overcome this scFvs were fused to a human Fc domain of IgG and a human antibody signal peptide was added. The resultant DNA construct was cloned into a pEE12.4 vector GS Gene Expression System see WO06 111387 and expressed in Expi293F cells derived from 293 cells primary embryonic human kidney Gibco Life technologies in Expi293 expression medium Gibco Life technologies . The resulting single chain monovalent antibody homologues were soluble and exhibited Asp f2 specific binding affinities. The DNA and amino acid sequences of the V GS15 V Fc scFv are set forth in and SEQ ID NOs 20 21 and the sequences of the V GS15 V Fc scFv are set forth in and SEQ ID NOs 22 23.

Western blots were performed to compare the binding specificity of 5D7A1 and the recombinant scFvs generated in Example 8. 5D7A1 and V G515 V Fc scFv both bound native Asp f2 independent of the different glycosylation states responsible for the different gel migration patterns in lanes 1 and 2 and weakly bound recombinant SMT3 Asp f2 . Unglycosylated Asp f2 showed a stronger signal for 5D7A1 than for the scFv.
