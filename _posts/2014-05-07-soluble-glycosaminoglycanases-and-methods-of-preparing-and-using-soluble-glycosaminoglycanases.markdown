The present invention is generally related to Glycosaminoglycanase enzymes including Neutral Active Soluble Hyaluronidase Glycoproteins sHASEGPs and portions thereof particularly Hyaluronidase domains. More specifically the invention is related to chemical modifications pharmaceutical compositions expression plasmids methods for manufacture and therapeutic methods using the Glycosaminoglycanases and domains thereof and the encoding nucleic acid molecules for the therapeutic modification of glycosaminoglycans in the treatment of disease and for use to increase diffusion of other molecules such as injected molecules in an animal.

Glycosaminoglycans GAGs are complex linear polysaccharides of the extracellular matrix ECM . GAGs are characterized by repeating disaccharide structures of an N substituted hexosamine and an uronic acid in the case of hyaluronan HA chondroitin sulfate CS chondroitin C dermatan sulfate DS heparan sulfate HS and heparin H or a galactose in the case of keratan sulfate KS . Except for HA all exist covalently bound to core proteins. The GAGs with their core proteins are structurally referred to as proteoglycans PGs .

Hyaluronan HA is found in mammals predominantly in connective tissues skin cartilage and in synovial fluid. Hyaluronan is also the main constituent of the vitreous of the eye. In connective tissue the water of hydration associated with hyaluronan creates hydrated matrices between tissues. Hyaluronan plays a key role in biological phenomena associated with cell motility including rapid development regeneration repair embryogenesis embryological development wound healing angiogenesis and tumorigenesis Toole 1991 Cell Biol. Extracell. Matrix Hay ed Plenum Press New York 305 341 Bertrand et al. 1992 Int. J. Cancer 52 1 6 Knudson et al. 1993 FASEB J. 7 1233 1241 . In addition hyaluronan levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness Ozello et al. 1960 Cancer Res. 20 600 604 Takeuchi et al. 1976 Cancer Res. 36 2133 2139 Kimata et al. 1983 Cancer Res. 43 1347 1354 .

HA is found in the extracellular matrix of many cells especially in soft connective tissues. HA has been assigned various physiological functions such as in water and plasma protein homeostasis Laurent T C et al 1992 FASEB J 6 2397 2404 . HA production increases in proliferating cells and may play a role in mitosis. It has also been implicated in locomotion and cell migration. HA seems to play important roles in cell regulation development and differentiation Laurent et al. supra .

HA has been used in clinical medicine. Its tissue protective and rheological properties have proved useful in ophthalmic surgery e.g. to protect the corneal endothelium during cataract surgery . Serum HA is diagnostic of liver disease and various inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Interstitial edema caused by accumulation of HA may cause dysfunction in various organs Laurent et al. supra .

Hyaluronan protein interactions also are involved in the structure of the extracellular matrix or ground substance .

Hyaluronidases are a group of generally neutral or acid active enzymes found throughout the animal kingdom. Hyaluronidases vary with respect to substrate specificity and mechanism of action.

1. Mammalian type hyaluronidases EC 3.2.1.35 which are endo beta N acetylhexosaminidases with tetrasaccharides and hexasaccharides as the major end products. They have both hydrolytic and transglycosidase activities and can degrade hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfates CS generally C4 S and C6 S.

2. Bacterial hyaluronidases EC 4.2.99.1 degrade hyaluronan and and to various extents CS and DS. They are endo beta N acetylhexosaminidases that operate by a beta elimination reaction that yields primarily disaccharide end products.

3. Hyaluronidases EC 3.2.1.36 from leeches other parasites and crustaceans are endo beta glucuronidases that generate tetrasaccharide and hexasaccharide end products through hydrolysis of the beta 1 3 linkage.

Mammalian hyaluronidases can be further divided into two groups neutral active and acid active enzymes. There are six hyaluronidase like genes in the human genome HYAL1 HYAL2 HYAL3 HYAL4 HYALP1 and PH20 SPAM1. HYALP1 is a pseudogene and HYAL3 has not been shown to possess enzyme activity toward any known substrates. HYAL4 is a chondroitinase and exhibits little activity towards hyaluronan. HYAL1 is the prototypical acid active enzyme and PH20 is the prototypical neutral active enzyme. Acid active hyaluronidases such as HYAL1 and HYAL2 generally lack catalytic activity at neutral pH i.e. pH 7 . For example HYAL1 has little catalytic activity in vitro over pH 4.5 Frost et al Anal Biochemistry 1997 . HYAL2 is an acid active enzyme with a very low specific activity in vitro.

The hyaluronidase like enzymes can also be characterized by those which are generally locked to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol anchor such as human HYAL2 and human PH20 Danilkovitch Miagkova et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2003 Apr. 15 100 8 4580 5 Phelps et al. Science 1988 and those which are generally soluble such as human HYAL1 Frost et al. 1997 Jul. 9 236 1 10 5 . However there are variations from species to species bovine PH20 for example is very loosely attached to the plasma membrane and is not anchored via a phospholipase sensitive anchor Lalancette et al. 2001 August 65 2 628 36. . This unique feature of bovine hyaluronidase has permitted the use of the soluble bovine testes hyaluronidase enzyme as an extract for clinical use Wydase Hyalase . Other PH20 species are lipid anchored enzymes that are generally not soluble without the use of detergents or lipases. For example human PH20 is anchored to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor. Attempts to make human PH20 DNA constructs that would not introduce a lipid anchor into the polypeptide resulted in either a catalytically inactive enzyme or an insoluble enzyme Arming et al 1997 Aug. 1 247 3 810 4 . Naturally occurring macaque sperm hyaluronidase is found in both a soluble and membrane bound form. While the 64 kDa membrane bound form possesses enzyme activity at pH 7.0 the 54 kDa form is only active at pH 4.0 Chen et al. Dev Biol. 1996 Apr. 10 175 1 142 53. . Thus soluble forms of PH20 are often lacking enzyme activity under neutral conditions.

Chondroitinases are enzymes found throughout the animal kingdom. These enzymes degrade glycosaminoglycans through an endoglycosidase reaction. Specific examples of known Chondroitinases include Chondroitinase ABC derived from Japanese Patent Application Laid open No 6 153947 T. Yamagata H. Saito O. Habuchi and S. Suzuki J. Biol.

Glycoproteins are composed of a polypeptide chain covalently bound to one or more carbohydrate moieties. There are two broad categories of glycoproteins that possess carbohydrates coupled though either N glycosidic or O glycosidic linkages to their constituent protein. The N and O linked glycans are attached to polypeptides through asparagine N acetyl D glucosamine and serine threonine N acetyl D galactosamine linkages respectively. Complex N linked oligosaccharides do not contain terminal mannose residues. They contain only terminal N acetylglucosamine galactose and or sialic acid residues. Hybrid oligosaccharides contain terminal mannose residues as well as terminal N acetylglucosamine galactose and or sialic acid residues.

With N linked glycoproteins an oligosaccharide precursor is attached to the amino group of asparagine during peptide synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. The oligosaccharide moiety is then sequentially processed by a series of specific enzymes that delete and add sugar moieties. The processing occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues with passage through the cis medial and trans Golgi apparatus.

Provided herein are soluble glycosaminoglycanase enzymes particularly members of the soluble neutral active Hyaluronidase Glycoprotein family also referred to herein as sHASEGPs preferred members being human soluble neutral active Hyaluronidase Glycoproteins particularly the human soluble PH 20 Hyaluronidase Glycoproteins also referred to herein as rHuPH20s . The soluble neutral active Hyaluronidases provided herein are each a sHASEGP family member designated herein as a sHASEGP. The soluble Hyaluronidase domain and uses thereof are also provided. While a number of uses and applications of soluble glycosaminoglycanases sometimes referred to herein as GAG Enzymes are illustrated herein using rHuPH20 as an exemplary glycosaminoglycanase e.g. in promoting the delivery of pharmacologics and other agents within tissues of the mammalian body it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that other glycosaminoglycanases such as those described herein or others known in the art can be applied to a number of such applications. Presently preferred soluble glycosaminoglycanases such as sHASEGPs exhibit some hyaluronidase activity and can exhibit other glycosaminoglycanase activities as well. Human soluble glycosaminoglycanases are presently preferred for applications in which the enzyme is to be employed within the human body including many medical applications as described and illustrated herein.

One aspect of the invention is based upon the discovery that a soluble neutral active hyaluronidase activity can be produced with high yield in a mammalian expression system by introducing nucleic acids that lack a narrow region encoding amino acids in the carboxy terminus of the human PH20 cDNA. Additional modifications of the sHASEGP to enhance secretion by use of non native leader peptides are also provided. Further provided are methods to modify the sHASEGP to prolong its half life by way of masking the protein with polyethylene glycol PEG and or post translational modifications to native glycosylation. Previous attempts to generate soluble neutral active human hyaluronidase glycoproteins were unsuccessful. It was concluded that truncations of the human hyaluronidase polypeptide resulted in both a loss of neutral enzymatic activity and an inability of cells to secrete the recombinant protein in mammalian expression systems Arming et al Eur J Biochem 1997 Aug. 1 247 3 810 4 . It is critical to generate neutral acting secreted sHASEGP for commercial production and therapeutic utility as a hyaluronidase. The invention disclosed herein overcomes these and other challenges.

The invention further comprises a catalytically active human sHASEGP glycoprotein wherein the sHASEGP possesses at least one N linked sugar moiety. The studies shown herein demonstrate that human PH20 requires N linked glycans for catalytic activity whereas bovine and bee venom hyaluronidases remain active without such N linked glycans. A human hyaluronidase PH20 domain devoid of N linked moieties is catalytically inactive. Thus classic recombinant DNA technology does not permit the production of a catalytically active human sHASEGP unlike bee venom hyaluronidase which can be produced in

The invention includes methods and cells for generation of an N linked sHASEGP glycoprotein polypeptide by using of a cell capable of introducing said N linked sugar moieties or by introduction of said N linked moieties on a sHASEGP polypeptide. Methods of identifying properly glycosylated sHASEGPs are further disclosed.

Catalytically active PEGylated and or super Sialated sHASEGP glycoproteins are also provided. PEGylated and or super sialated sHASEGPs possess greater serum half lives compared to naturally occurring non sialated bovine and ovine testes sHASEGPs and are thus preferable for both enzyme stability and use as drugs or adjuvants in circumstances in which prolonged half lives are desirable such as is commonly the case with intravenous delivery . The invention provides methods for the preparation of PEGylated and or super Sialated sHASEGPs compositions and uses thereof. Without being restricted to a particular application or mechanism of action it is generally considered that the attachment of PEG moieties to sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases can be used to effectively shield the molecules decreasing its relative sensitivity to proteases and potentially also decreasing the extent and rate of its clearance and elimination from the body. Applying these principles and techniques to other glycosaminoglycanases PEGylated super sialated and or otherwise modified versions of such other glycosaminoglycanases can likewise be generated and used in the context of methods and techniques as described and illustrated herein e.g. techniques for promoting the dispersion of pharmacologics and other agents within tissues of the body .

Further provided are compositions of the sHASEGP comprising a soluble sHASEGP glycoprotein with a metal ion wherein the metal ion is Calcium Magnesium or Sodium. sHASEGPs are generally optimally active in the presence of said metals. Formulations consisting of sHASEGP in the presence of said metal ions are also provided.

Modifications of sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases to further prolong their half life are provided. Chemical modifications of a sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases with polymers such as polyethylene glycol and dextran are provided. Such modifications shield sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases from removal from circulation and the immune system as well as glycosylation receptors for mannose and asialoglycoprotein. Further provide are methods to link to specific functional groups such as glycosylation sites positively charged amino acids and cysteines.

Assays for identifying effectors such as compounds including small molecules and conditions such as pH temperature and ionic strength that modulate the activation expression or activity of sHASEGPs are also provided herein. In exemplary assays the effects of test compounds on the ability of a Hyaluronidase domain of sHASEGP to cleave a known substrate typically a glycosaminoglycan or proteoglycan are assessed. Agents generally compounds particularly small molecules that modulate the activity of the Hyaluronidase domain are candidate compounds for modulating the activity of the sHASEGP. The Hyaluronidase domains can also be used to produce Hyaluronidase specific antibodies with function perturbing activity. The Hyaluronidase domains provided herein include but are not limited to the N terminal glycosyl hydrolase domain with C terminal truncated portions thereof that exhibit catalytic activity in vitro.

Also provided are cells generally eukaryotic cells such as mammalian cells and yeast cells in which a sHASEGP polypeptide is expressed on the surface of the cells. Such cells can be used in drug screening assays to identify compounds that modulate the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide. These assays including in vitro binding assays and transcription based assays in which signal transduction mediated directly or indirectly such as via activation of pro growth factors by the sHASEGP is assessed.

Also provided are peptides encoded by such nucleic acid molecules. Included among those polypeptides is the sHASEGP Hyaluronidase domain or a polypeptide with amino acid changes such that the specificity and or Hyaluronidase activity remains substantially unchanged. In particular a substantially purified mammalian sHASEGP glycoprotein is provided that comprises a secreted neutral active enzyme.

The invention also includes a Hyaluronidase catalytic domain and may additionally include other domains. The sHASEGP may form homodimers and can also form heterodimers with some other protein such as a membrane bound protein. Also provided is a substantially purified glycoprotein including a sequence of amino acids that has at least 60 70 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 identity to an exemplary sHASEGP where the percentage identity is determined using standard algorithms and gap penalties that maximize the percentage identity.

Splice variants of sHASEGPs particularly those with a catalytically active Hyaluronidase domains are contemplated herein.

In other embodiments substantially purified polypeptides that include a Hyaluronidase domain of a sHASEGP polypeptide or a catalytically active portion thereof but that do not include the entire sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 are provided.

In a specific embodiment a nucleic acid that encodes a eukaryotic Hyaluronidase glycoprotein designated a eukaryotic sHASEGP is provided. In particular the nucleic acid includes the sequence of nucleotides set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 particularly set forth as nucleotides 106 1446 of SEQ ID NO 6 or a portion thereof that encodes a catalytically active polypeptide.

Also provided are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize under conditions of at least low stringency generally moderate stringency more typically high stringency to the SEQ ID NO 6 or degenerates thereof.

In one embodiment the isolated nucleic acid fragment hybridizes to a nucleic acid molecule containing the nucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID No 6 or degenerates thereof under high stringency conditions. A full length sHASEGP is set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 and is encoded by SEQ ID NO 6 or degenerates thereof.

Also provided are muteins of the Hyaluronidase domain of sHASEGPs particularly muteins in which one or more Cys residues in the Hyaluronidase domain that are free i.e. do not form disulfide linkages with any other Cys residue in the Hyaluronidase domain are substituted with another amino acid typically although not necessarily with a conservative amino acid substitution or a substitution that does not eliminate the activity and muteins in which a specific glycosylation site or sites is eliminated.

sHASEGP polypeptides including but not limited to splice variants thereof and nucleic acids encoding sHASEGPs and domains derivatives and analogs thereof are provided herein. Single chain secreted Hyaluronidase glycoproteins that have an N terminus functionally equivalent to that generated by activation of a signal peptidase to form sHASEGP are also provided. There are seven potential N linked glycosylation sites at N82 N166 N235 N254 N368 N393 N490 of the human PH20 sHASEGP exemplified in SEQ ID NO 1. Disulfide bonds form between the Cys residues C60 C351 and Cys residues C224 to C238 to form the core Hyaluronidase domain. However additional cysteines are required in the carboxy terminus for neutral enzyme catalytic activity such that the sHASEGP domain from amino acids 36 to Cys 464 in SEQ ID NO 1 comprises the minimally active human PH20 sHASEGP hyaluronidase domain. Thus N linked glycosylation site N 490 is not required for proper sHASEGP activity. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art minor changes can be made to such compositions as described and illustrated herein without substantially eliminating or in some cases without substantially reducing or potentially even improving their useful activity and can thus be similarly employed in various applications as described herein.

N linked glycosylation of some sHASEGPs such as the sHASEGP comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 1 can be very important for their catalytic activity and stability. While altering the type of glycan modifying a glycoprotein can have dramatic affects on a protein s antigenicity structural folding solubility and stability most enzymes are not thought to require glycosylation for optimal enzyme activity. Such sHASEGPs are thus unique in this regard in that removal of N linked glycosylation can result in near complete inactivation of the Hyaluronidase activity. For such sHASEGPs the presence of N linked glycans is critical for generating an active enzyme. Protein expression systems suitable for the introduction of critical N linked glycosylation residues on sHASEGPs are included. Additionally the introduction of deglycosylated sHASEGP polypeptide in the presence of extracts capable of introducing N linked glycans are included. In one aspect of the invention complex glycosylation capped with sialation is described whereas others capped with free mannose residues are contemplated as well. Preferably sialic acid residues are found in the terminal residues of N linked glycosylation on sHASEGPs.

N linked oligosaccharides fall into several major types oligomannose complex hybrid sulfated all of which have Man 3 GlcNAc GlcNAc cores attached via the amide nitrogen of Asn residues that fall within Asn Xaa Thr Ser sequences where Xaa is not Pro . Glycosylation at an Asn Xaa Cys site has been reported for coagulation protein C. N linked sites are often indirectly assigned by the appearance of a blank cycle during sequencing. Positive identification can be made after release of the oligosaccharide by PNGase F which converts the glycosylated Asn to Asp. After PNGase F release N linked oligosaccharides can be purified for example by using Bio Gel P 6 chromatography with the oligosaccharide pool subjected to preparative high pH anion exchange chromatography HPAEC Townsend et al. 1989 Anal. Biochem. 182 1 8 . Certain oligosaccharide isomers can be resolved using HPAEC. Fucose residues will shift elution positions earlier in the HPAEC chromatogram while additional sialic acid residues will increase the retention time. Concurrent treatment of glycoproteins whose oligosaccharide structures are known e.g. bovine fetuin a 1 acid glycoprotein ovalbumin RNAse B transferrin can facilitate assignment of the oligosaccharide peaks. The collected oligosaccharides can be characterized by a combination of compositional and methylation linkage analyses Waeghe et al. 1983 Carbohydr Res. 123 281 304. with anomeric configurations assigned by NMR spectroscopy Van Halbeek 1993 in Methods Enzymol 230 .

In the case of some sHASEGPs exemplified by the human sHASEGP rHuPH20 described herein the sHASEGP can comprise both N glycosidic and O glycosidic linkages. For example rHuPH20 as produced in the DG44 CHO line 3D3 as described in the Examples below has been discovered to have O linked oligosaccharides as well as N linked oligosaccharides. Glycosidic modifications of such sHASEGPs for example modifications comprising one or more additions removals or alterations of such N linked and or O linked oligosaccharides can be used to generate glycosidic variant sHASEGPs exhibiting altered pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles that make them desirable for particular applications. By way of illustration but without being restricted to a particular mechanism of action removal or alteration of such as by capping or otherwise de exposing one or more N linked and or O linked oligosaccharides that are involved in binding to cellular or other receptors can be used to alter the extent and or rate at which a sHASEGP binds to or is taken up by a particular tissue which can in turn be used to alter for example its pharmacokinetic profile e.g. by increasing its serum half life or otherwise altering its bioabsorption .

Formulations of sHASEGPs are also provided. sHASEGPs may be formulated in lyophilized forms and stabilized solutions for example. Formulations containing specific metal ions such as calcium magnesium or sodium are useful for optimal activity at neutral pH. In addition to stabilized solution formulations slow release formulations are contemplated herein for extended removal of glycosaminoglycans or extended promotion of spreading or diffusion of agents such as pharmacologics. Also provided herein are kits providing for pre packaged syringes of sHASEGPs for the administration of small volumes of sHASEGP for intraocular surgical procedures and other small volume procedures. Balanced salt formulations for ex vivo use in artificial reproductive technology procedures are also provided.

Methods for the use of glycosaminoglycanases including sHASEGPs in the removal of glycosaminoglycans are also provided. Glycosaminoglycanases including sHASEGPs open channels in the interstitial space through degradation of glycosaminoglycans that generally permit the diffusion of molecules less than about 500 nm in size. These channels can remain relatively open for a period of 24 48 hours depending on dose and formulation. Such channels can be used to facilitate the diffusion of exogenously added molecules such as fluids small molecules proteins nucleic acids and gene therapy vectors and other molecules less than about 500 nm in size. In addition without being restricted to a particular theory or mechanism of action it is believed that the formation of such channels can facilitate bulk fluid flow within an interstitial space which can in turn promote the dispersion or movement of a solute such as a detectable molecule or other diagnostic agent an anesthetic or other tissue modifying agent a pharmacologic or pharmaceutically effective agent or a cosmetic or other esthetic agent that is effectively carried by the fluid in a process sometimes referred to herein as convective transport or simply convection. Such convective transport can substantially exceed the rate and cumulative effects of molecular diffusion and can thus cause the therapeutic or other administered molecule to more rapidly and effectively perfuse a tissue. Furthermore when a molecule such as a therapeutic or other agent such as a small molecule drug or a larger molecule or complex is co formulated or co administered with a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase and both are injected into a relatively confined local site such as a site of non intravenous parenteral administration e.g. intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular or into or around other internal tissues organs or other relatively confined spaces within the body then the fluid associated with the administered dose can both provide a local driving force i.e. hydrostatic pressure as well as lower impedance to flow by opening channels within the interstitial matrix both of which would tend to increase fluid flow and with it convective transport of the therapeutic agent or other molecule contained within the fluid. As discussed and illustrated in more detail herein and as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art these aspects of the use of sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases can have substantial utility for improving the bioavailability as well as manipulating other pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic characteristics of co formulated or co administered agents.

sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases can also be used to remove excess glycosaminoglycans such as those that occur following ischemia reperfusion inflammation arteriosclerosis edema cancer spinal cord injury and other forms of scarring. In some instances sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases can be delivered systemically by intravenous infusion. This can be helpful when local access is not readily available such as the heart or brain or in the case of disseminated neoplasm wherein the disease is through the body. For such intravenous or other intravascular applications Super Sialated sHASEGPs are often preferable to increase serum half life and distribution over native hyaluronidase enzymes that lack terminal sialic acids.

In some circumstances such as spinal cord injury and other nervous system disorders glaucoma and certain other disorders of the eye as well as various autoimmune inflammatory conditions cancers and other chronically progressive diseases and conditions and cosmetic treatments sustained delivery is preferred. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art a number of different compositions and techniques have been developed to provide slow release or sustained release formulations or depots of molecules of interest.

In other indications a single short acting dose is preferable. Temporary removal of glycosaminoglycans can be used to enhance the delivery of solutions and drugs into and or through interstitial spaces. This can be useful for the diffusion of anesthesia and for the administration of therapeutic fluids molecules and proteins. Subcutaneous intradermal and intramuscular administration of molecules in the presence of sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases also facilitate their systemic distribution more rapidly. Such methods are very useful when intravenous access is not available or where more rapid systemic delivery of molecules is needed. By way of illustration delivery of other large molecules such as Factor VIII that are poorly bioavailable upon subcutaneous administration may be injected with sHASEGPs to increase their availability.

Uses of sHASEGPs for enzymatic removal of the cumulus matrix surrounding oocytes are also provided. The removal of the cumulus matrix using a purified sHASEGP without the toxic contaminants of extract derived hyaluronidase permits more gentle recover of the oocyte with greater viabilities. Moreover sHASEGPs can be manufactured without the use of cattle extracts or other organisms that carry viruses and other pathogens such as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

Injections of small volumes of sHASEGP for intraocular use may also be used for small spaces. For example sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases may be injected into the anterior chamber of the eye to remove excess viscoelastic substrates that are administered during surgery. Intraocular injection of sHASEGPs can also be used to reduce intraocular pressure in glaucoma to dissolve vitreous aggregates or floaters to clear vitreous hemorrhage for the treatment of macular degeneration to promote vitreo retinal detachment in diabetic retinopathy and to be mixed with other enzymes to promote reshaping of the cornea along with corrective lenses. As described herein sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases can also be injected into the eye or into surrounding periorbital spaces as a form of spreading agent i.e. to promote the delivery of diagnostic anesthetic or pharmacologic agents to sites within and or around the target tissue. For example injection of a sHASEGP concomitant with or in temporal proximity to injection of diagnostic anesthetic or pharmacologic agents into the sub Tenon s or episcleral space can be used to promote transcleral delivery of the pharmacologic to interior portions of the eye such as the choroid retina and vitreous body . The episcleral space is a lymph containing space between the Fascia Bulbi capsule of Tenon and the sclera which is a relatively tough protective tissue surrounding the choroid and retina and the interior of the eye. The Sub Tenon s or episcleral space which is sometimes referred to as the periscleral lymph space is generally also continuous with the subdural and subarachnoid cavities and is traversed by bands of connective tissue extending from the fascia to the sclera. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the ability to promote delivery of compositions across the protective scleral layer covering the eye allows for a great variety of pharmacologic and other agents to be conveniently and efficiently delivered to underlying tissues within the eye such as the choroid retina or vitreous humor. By applying compositions of the present invention to such in vivo delivery routes even relatively difficult to reach tissues such as those at the back of the eye can be treated by minimally invasive means. It will be recognized that in some instances the use of a longer lasting sHASEGP such as a pegylated sHASEGP will be desirable.

It is important to note that while animal derived hyaluronidases can and have been applied to treat certain conditions of the eye and as a spreading factor to promote the delivery of anesthetics and other therapeutic or pharmacologic agents several important considerations apply to the use of animal derived enzymes and potentially either limit their use or introduce safety concerns or additional risks when they are used for treating humans. Among these considerations is the concern that proteins and other impurities present in the formulations can lead to immunogenic and or other problems when applied to human tissues in vivo. In addition to the extent that non human animal enzymes are employed even purified enzymes can themselves further contribute to immunogenicity since they are of non human origin. Further in that regard the potential for degradative enzymes such as hyaluronidases to effectively promote their own dispersal as described herein could increase the probability that immunogenic versions or formulations of such animal derived products are contacted by the immune system.

Concerns with animal derived and or impure factors are also of increased significance in a number of situations for example situations in which the target tissue has already been subjected to surgical or other procedures situations in which the agent is being introduced into a relatively immune privileged space such as portions of the eye the heart the nervous system and many other tissues and organs that are not typically exposed to the external environment and or situations in which the patient is immuno compromised or otherwise at elevated risk associated with infection. Use of such animal derived formulations may thus be avoided in a number of applications in which the risk of infection or other complications undercut their potential utility. In those situations and in others the use of recombinantly prepared sHASEGPs of the present invention can provide applications that are both highly effective and have favorable safety profiles and thus improve and expand the conditions and situations in which these enzymes are beneficially used.

In the context of non intravenous parenteral injections such as intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular and other injections into spaces other than the vasculature a sHASEGP and or another glycosaminoglycanase and another agent e.g. a co formulation or a mixture comprising a sHASEGP and another agent such as a diagnostic agent an anesthetic agent a pharmacologic agent an esthetic agent or combinations thereof in a volume of liquid e.g. a pharmaceutical excipient or other solution can be introduced into a site or sites within the body by injection or infusion. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that several forces can be brought into motion to enhance delivery of the pharmacologic or other agent the extent of which depends in part on the particular composition volume and site of administration for example . These driving forces can include an increase in hydrostatic pressure as a volume of fluid is effectively forced into a contained space such as the sub Tenon s space referred to above or a site of intradermal subcutaneous intramuscular or other non IV parenteral injection a subsequent increase in convective transport of solutes or convection as fluid flow is increased down its pressure gradient and dissolved molecules or macromolecular complexes are carried with it as well as an increase in diffusion and or permeation mediated by degradation of glycosaminoglycans and concomitant channel formation within the downstream intercellular matrix or interstitial space.

In the case of sHASEGPs being injected into the anterior chamber of the eye to remove excess viscoelastic substrates such as glycosaminoglycan containing formulations which are commonly used as ophthalmosurgical aids in a variety of anterior segment procedures it will be appreciated by those of skill in view of the teachings of the present application that sHASEGP can be used to supplement or to obviate the need for post surgical procedures such as irrigation and aspiration which are commonly used to reduce the amount of applied viscoelastic remaining in the eye after surgery is completed. Viscoelastics are commonly used during anterior segment surgeries to maintain a deep anterior chamber allowing for more efficient manipulations and potentially protecting the corneal endothelium and other tissues during surgery. A variety of viscoelastics containing hyaluronate and or chondroitin sulfate are used in surgeries such as anterior eye segment procedures see e.g. Provisc Viscoat and Duovisc available from Alcon Laboratories Inc. alconlabs.com Healon Healon 5 and Healon GV available from Advanced Medical Optics healon.com Amvisc and Amvisc Plus available from Bausch Lomb bausch.com IVisc Plus IVisc 18 and IVisc Phaco available from I MED Pharma imedpharma.com LA LON available from General Innovations generaltrade.net . However as is known in the art retained viscoelastic in the anterior chamber following surgical procedures such as cataract surgery can lead to compromised outflow from the anterior chamber potentially by reducing outflow through the trabecular meshwork which can cause elevations in intraocular pressure IOP spikes that can lead to glaucoma.

Thus sHASEGPs of the present invention can be introduced for example by injection into the anterior chamber of the eye as a viscoelastic antidote for previously applied viscoelastic formulations containing glycosaminglycans such as hyaluronan. For use as such a viscoelastic antidote the sHASEGP will generally be introduced by post surgical injection into the anterior chamber with or without prior irrigation or aspiration to remove some portion of the previously applied viscoelastic following anterior segment procedures such as cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation e.g. by phacoemulsification or extracapsular surgery glaucoma filtration surgery trabeculectomy corneal transplant surgery e.g. penetrating keratoplasty post traumatic eye surgery and the like. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the amount of a sHASEGP applied in such a context will depend inter alia on its specific activity as well as the amount of viscoelastic used and whether or not some of the viscoelastic is first physically removed e.g. by irrigation and aspiration . Each application will thus generally be optimized for the particular circumstances as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of the descriptions and illustrations provided herein.

Some viscoelastics such as Viscoat and Duovisc available from Alcon Labs comprise both hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate. Advantageously many sHASEGPs of the present invention are enzymatically active both as hyaluronidases and as chondroitinases making them particularly suitable for such dual formulation viscoelastics.

Hyaluronidases including sHASEGPs can also be combined with one or more additional glycosaminoglycanases such as chondroitinases for applications such as the foregoing or to further open channels within interstitial spaces for other applications such as those described and illustrated herein.

To the extent that viscoelastics are also used in other procedures sHASEGPs of the present invention can likewise be used in conjunction with or as replacement of techniques for reducing or eliminating amounts of applied viscoelastic i.e. as a viscoelastic antidote.

In applications of sHASEGPs as spreading agents in tissues such as those of the eye a formulation comprising one or more sHASEGPs as described herein is typically applied to a target tissue prior to or concomitant with application of an anesthetic diagnostic pharmacologic or other agent that is desired to be delivered into or to the vicinity of the target tissue. In some contexts sHASEGPs can be used to promote delivery of a pharmacologic or other agent across a first tissue to target one or more tissues distal to the first. By way of illustration introduction of sHASEGPs into the episcleral space surrounding the eye prior to or concomitantly with introduction of a pharmacologic or other agent into the episcleral space can be used to promote delivery of the agent across the protective scleral tissue and into the choroid the retina and the vitreous body. In this manner a number of pharmacologic and or other agents which are useful for treating conditions of the choroid retina and or vitreous can be delivered relatively locally to the target tissues but at the same time using a relatively non invasive approach such as a Sub Tenon s injection. Analogous situations exist in other situations in which sHASEGPs can be applied to one tissue or location in the body in order to facilitate the delivery of a pharmacologic or other agent within that tissue or location and or to distal sites as described and illustrated herein.

While the extent and rate of dispersal of a co formulated or co administered agent depends in part on the tissue and agent involved such disperal can generally be increased by inter alia increasing the amount of sHASEGP applied employing a sHASEGP having higher specific activity employing a sHASEGP that is more resistant to degradation or other inactivation such as a PEGylated super sialated or other such modified sHASEGP providing a sustained release or depot formulation of the sHASEGP and other such approaches to increasing the effective activity and or duration of the applied sHASEGP. In addition where it is desired that the sHASEGP facilitate the dispersion of an agent into a tissue or location distal to e.g. a site of injection then providing the sHASEGP and or agent in a significant volume of liquid such as would partially fill or even slightly distend the site of injection can be used to further promote dispersion through a process of convective transport as described and illustrated herein.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art sHASEGPs can thus be used to effectively promote delivery of a number of anesthetics diagnostics pharmacologics and or other agents to the posterior segments of the eye for treating conditions such as retinal detachments retinal vein occlusions proliferative retinopathies diabetic retinopathies inflammatory conditions such as uveitis choroiditis retinitis and the like as well as degenerative diseases vascular diseases and various tumors. Again as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art a variety of pharmacologic or pharmaceutically effective agents can be usefully applied to treating such posterior segment conditions and diseases including by way of illustration anesthetic and pharmacologic agents such as those described and illustrated below.

Co formulations or co administrations of sHASEGP with other substances may also be envisioned for injectable pens for small volume or rapid subcutaneous administration. Examples such as Epipen insulin and other fluids can be formulated. The methods of the invention include administration of the sHASEGP polypeptide or pharmaceutical compositions containing sHASEGP prior to simultaneously with or following administration of other therapeutic molecules. The sHASEGP may be administered at a site different from the site of administration of the therapeutic molecule or the sHASEGP may be administered at a site the same as the site of administration of the therapeutic molecule.

Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the ability of sHASEGPs and other glycosaminoglycanases to cause the degradation of a portion of the glycosaminoglycans in the interstitial spaces between cells results in a temporary opening up of channels within the interstitium which in turn tends to increase interstitial fluid flow and to concomitantly facilitate the diffusion and or convective solute transport convection of dissolved components within the interstitial fluid such as anesthetics drugs and other pharmacologic agents labels and diagnostic agents and the like . As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art sHASEGPs of the present invention can be applied to enhance the bioavailability and potentially improve other pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic properties of a number of pharmacologic and other agents that are useful for treating or diagnosing various disease conditions or otherwise modifying one or more tissues in vivo. Illustrative categories of such agents include anti cancer agents anti infectives anesthetics anti inflammatories cytokines antibodies and other proteins nucleic acids macromolecular complexes and numerous other molecules and pharmacologic agents which modify cellular or other physiologic activities including various categories of agents and exemplary members thereof described herein and in the art.

While the diffusion and convective transport of even small molecules can be enhanced by opening interstitial channels and increasing fluid flow in the case of larger pharmacologic or other agents such as many biotherapeutics including antibodies and other proteins large nucleic acids macromolecular complexes such as liposomes and other macromolecular carriers as well as gene therapy vectors and the like the size of the molecules and the presence of interstitial components such as glycosaminoglycans substantially impairs the diffusion and or convection of the agents. Several consequences potentially limiting the agent s usefulness can result. For example the pharmacokinetics of the agent can be effectively impaired by a slowing of absorption and thus distribution of the agent. In addition trapping of a portion of the agent at or near the site of administration both limits its bioavailability and can also cause toxicity as a result of a potentially sustained and high local dose. In the latter regard local toxicity that may be associated with painful or other side effects is a problem with many large biomolecules that are administered by non intravenous injection such as by subcutaneous intradermal or intramuscualar injection. As a result a number of pharmacologic agents have pharmacokinetic PK and or pharmacodynamic PD profiles that can be enhanced by co formulating the agent with a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase and or co administering the agent with a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase which may be provided before coincident with or after the agent and administered at the same or a different site which parameters would be the subject of optimization in standard models such as animal models typically used to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the agent . Any of a variety of therapeutics and pharmacologics as well as other agents such as cosmetic or esthetic formulations that are typically administered by parenteral administration can thus be enhanced using sHASEGPs.

While intravascular administration particularly by intravenous IV injection can generally provide for rapid bioavailability IV injections are often inconvenient associated with risks or inapplicable and even where practicable can be associated with less than optimal overall PK PD profiles . Since sHASEGPs can be applied to enhance the bioavailability of agents administered by non IV parenteral routes such as subcutaneous intradermal intramuscular and other routes delivering agents into the interstitium agents that have been delivered by IV injection can be reformulated for delivery by non IV parenteral routes. Such reformulations can provide substantial benefits such as allowing use of agents in which IV administration is inconvenient inapplicable unsafe too expensive or otherwise limited. The reformulation of IV agents as non IV parenterals can also allow patients to self administer the agents and can allow dosing to be optimized e.g. better tailored to the agent s PK PD parameters by avoiding the need for administration by intravenous injection.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art PK PD parameters that can be improved by using sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases include such measures as Cmax the maximal concentration of agent achieved following absorption in e.g. the bloodstream Tmax the time required to achieve maximal concentration T1 2 the time required for the concentration to fall by half Cmin the minimal concentration of agent following metabolism and excretion AUC area under the curve of concentration versus time a measure of the overall amount of bioavailability concentrations in various tissues of interest including e.g. the rate of achieving desired concentrations the overall levels and the duration of maintaining desired levels and Emax the maximal effect achieved . By way of illustration reformulating a drug or other pharmacologic agent with a sHASEGP or co administering the agent with a sHASEGP which can be introduced locally or systemically and before together with or after the agent can be used for example to increase an agent s Cmax decrease its Tmax decrease its T1 2 increase its AUC and or increase its Emax. As will be appreciated the ability to readily and proportionately manipulate such key PK and PD parameters e.g. by applying more or less units of sHASEGP and altering the timing and or location of administration enables the improvement of a number of a pharmacologic and other agents. Evaluating the levels of these parameters can be performed in models such as animal models used for PK PD measurements of the agent and co formulations and or co administrations that enhance the relative efficacy to safety profile thus selected for a particular application.

Among non IV parenterals sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases can also be used to allow the agents to be administered by more convenient routes and or with greater efficiency. By way of illustration and without limitation by reformulating and or co administering agents with sHASEGP either local or systemic and either before coincident with or after administration of the agent agents that are typically administered by subcutaneous injection can instead be administered by intradermal injection and agents that are typically administered by intramuscular injection can instead be administered by subcutaneous or intradermal injection. Alternatively agents can be administered by the same route but with improved pharmacokinetics and or pharmacodynamics using sHASEGPs.

The use of sHASEGPs and or other glycosaminoglycanases to reformulate IV drugs and other agents as non IV parenterals also enables delivery of the agents using any of a variety of new injection devices designed to ease and or speed delivery and to facilitate self administration. Such devices include for example ultra sharp and microneedle devices such as those being developed by Becton Dickinson and others as well as needle free injection devices such as Biojector and other devices available from Bioject IntraJect . and other devices available from Aradigm Medijector . devices and the like . A number of devices such as the Biojector are particularly useful for facilitating intradermal injections which tend to require more experience when using standard needles due to the potential for penetrating the dermis during needle placement and delivering the agent to an underlying tissue site such as the subcutaneous layer . For some pharmacologic agents such as vaccines for example e.g. a DNA based or other vaccine it can be particularly advantageous to deliver the agent into the dermal as opposed to sub dermal layers since there tends to be a relatively high concentration of antigen presenting cells APCs localized within the dermis.

In the context of those agents that are typically delivered by intradermal injection whether by standard needles or other newer devices or those many other agents which are not currently but could be delivered by intradermal injection the local co introduction of a sHASEGP and or other glycosaminoglycanase can be used to enhance delivery of the pharmacologic or other agent delivered and to promote its dispersal or spreading within the dermis. In the case of a vaccine where the dermis may be the primary target tissue given the local abundance of APCs the sHASEGP and or other glycosaminoglycanase can thus facilitate dispersal of the vaccine within the target tissue thereby increasing the probability and extent of interactions between a vaccine and APCs which can significantly potentiate the generation of an immunomodulatory response . In the case of other agents the dermis may not be the primary target tissue but is rather a tissue into which a dose of the agent is introduced from which it is desired that the agent be absorbed into another tissue typically the bloodstream. In the latter case the bloodstream may itself be the target tissue of interest e.g. for blood modulatory factors as described herein and in the art or the bloodstream may itself be a delivery tissue by which the agent is transported to a distal target tissue e.g. a tissue in the body supplied by the bloodstream . In either of these latter cases in which delivery is intradermal but it is desired that the agent be delivered to the bloodstream the sHASEGP and potentially a volume of liquid in which it is injected can facilitate dispersal of the agent first within the dermis and thence into the vasculature draining the dermis and eventually into the larger blood supply as described and illustrated herein.

The use of sHASEGPs to enhance the pharmacokinetics and or pharmacodynamics of other therapeutic or pharmacologic agents can also be applied to agents delivered by routes other than non IV parenteral administration. For example without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the presence of sHASEGPs in interstitial spaces within the body which can be achieved by local and or systemic administration of sHASEGPs tends to promote interstitial channels and an increase in fluid flow within the interstitial space that in turn facilitates both diffusion and convective transport of agents dissolved with the interstitial fluid such as pharmacologic and other agents . By way of illustration agents that are administered directly into the bloodstream e.g. by intravenous injection or orally and thus enter the bloodstream after uptake from the gastrointestinal tract for example can still be subject to constraints in the post absorption i.e. distribution phase of their pharmacokinetics. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that sHASEGPs can enhance delivery to target cells by increasing interstitial permeability and fluid flow and thus increasing the diffusion and or convection of agents within the interstitial space which effectively forms the intermedium between almost all pharmacologic delivery routes and the target cells .

In addition it is believed that changes in oncotic pressure brought about by the administration of sHASEGPs can contribute to enhancing the delivery of pharmacologic agents. Again without wishing to be bound by theory the presence of sHASEGP and concomitant degradation along the interstitial side of a vascularized tissue would tend to decrease the oncotic pressure within the interstitial space which in turn would enhance fluid filtration from the vasculature into the interstitial space.

The potential to decrease interstitial pressure is considered to be particularly important in the context of many cancers in which interstitial pressure within the tumor tumor interstitial pressure of TIF is elevated. High TIF can result in relative impedance to fluid flow from the vasculature toward the center of a tumor thereby limiting the amount of an anti cancer agent that effectively reaches a tumor particularly sites that are deeper within a tumor mass. The introduction of sHASEGPs to tumor interstitia would thus tend to enhance the delivery of locally delivered as well as systemically available anti cancer agents which can more readily penetrate the tumor when interstitial oncotic pressure is reduced and diffusion and or convective transport increased. Measurements of TIF and hydraulic conductivity K within tumors e.g. using tagged molecules such as albumin labeled with Evan s Blue dye can be used to quantitatively assess the effect of various concentrations of sHASEGPs on the fluid dynamics of tumors in vivo as illustrated herein and or in the art.

Further exacerbating the reduced fluid dynamics within many tumors and highlighting an additional potential benefit of applying sHASEGPs to tumors is the fact that many tumors exhibit accumulation of glycosaminoglycans particularly hyaluronan which may be due to the fact that lymphatics which are the predomint route for hyaluronan catabolism are impaired or lacking in many tumors . Such excess hyaluronan can contribute to impeding hydraulic conductivity. The introduction of sHASEGPs can thus be used to counteract the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in many tumors improving hydraulic conductivity within the tumor and effectively rendering them more susceptible to anti tumor agents whether locally or systemically delivered .

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the principles described herein can also be applied to numerous other pharmacologics and other agents that are desired to be delivered to sites within the body such as for the prevention diagnosis and or treatment of disease or to otherwise modulate physiological functions. Illustrative classes of such agents and exemplary members thereof are provided herein and many more are known in the art or under development.

In addition to their use in potential improvements and or reformulations of a variety of parenterally administered pharmacologics and or agents sHASEGPs can also be usefully employed in connection with non parenteral agents such as agents formulated as pills liquids or other forms for ingestion and typical absorption through the gastrointestinal tract . For example since most non parenteral drugs must ultimately reach cells within the interstitium in order to exert their desired effects the use of sHASEGPs to enhance diffusion and or convective transport within the interstitium either systemically or locally e.g. by local or targeted administration of sHASEGP can be applied to improve the extent and or rate at which non parenterals as well as parenterals reach desired target cells.

In addition a number of agents that are typically administered non parenterally e.g. orally may be reformulated or their active ingredients reformulated for use in parenteral administrations that are rendered more effective and or safe in combination with sHASEGPs. To illustrate this broadly applicable approach the ability of sHASEGPs to facilitate targeted delivery to particular tissues such as the ability of sHASEGPs to provide for transcleral delivery to tissues within the posterior of the eye can be used to deliver any of a variety of agents including agents previously administered systemically directly and preferentially to a localized site of interest within the body. This can not only provide for more desirable and or more rapidly achieved concentrations at the site of interest but can substantially reduce potential problems and limitations associated with systemic administration in which concentrations at undesired sites may equal or even exceed concentrations at the desired target site potentially triggering undesired side effects as well as wasting agent . In some cases agents that are not widely used or are not used for certain indications or in certain patients for example may be effectively applied to benefit additional patients by being co formulated or co administered with sHASEGPs as described and illustrated herein.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the ability to employ sHASEGPs to enhance speed and or target biodistribution of co formulated and or co administered agents and to manipulate other aspects of their pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics e.g. in order to improve their risk benefit profile or facilitate their use by patients family or health care professionals provides a major opportunity for improving drugs and other agents that are used treat diagnose or prevent diseases.

Without being limited to a particular set of applications glycosaminoglycanases including sHASEGPs as described herein as well as other hyaluronidases and other glycosaminoglycanases can be used to effectively achieve bolus or bolus like delivery of any number of pharmacologic and other agents by non intravenous parenteral routes as well as by other routes of administration e.g. by enhancing the delivery of agents into and or through a target tissue after they leave the bloodstream whether they were introduced into the bloodstream directly such as by IV administration or indirectly such as by oral or non IV parenteral administration .

Without being restricted to a specific mechanism of action or aspect thereof it is believed that the ability of these enzymes to temporarily degrade components of the interstitial matrix between cells which accounts for a substantial portion of the fluid space in the body and a correspondingly large space that must be traversed in order for pharmacologics and other agents to reach most target cells can significantly promote the delivery of agents to target cells by one or more of several potentially synergistic means. First while the bulk of the interstitial fluid exhibits some degree of flow that flow is often restrained or impeded by glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan and other interstitial components. The ability of glycosaminoglycanases including sHASEGPs as well as other hyaluronidases and other glycosaminoglycanases to open channels within such interstitial spaces as described and illustrated herein can be used to decrease impedance and increase the extent and rate of downstream flow resulting from any given upstream pressure. Second in the case of non IV parenteral injections of sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanase and another pharmacologic or other agent the volume of the non IV parenteral injection can be used to increase the upstream driving pressure or pressure head e.g. by increasing the hydrostatic pressure within a confined space which can further promote flow. Third since the volume of fluid comprising the introduced sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase and other agent is effectively driven down the increased pressure gradient i.e. the increased gradient created by elevating the hydrostatic pressure associated within the injected bolus and simultaneously decreasing the interstitial pressure within the surrounding tissue solutes within the bolus can be effectively carried e.g. by convective transport into the adjacent tissue. This injected fluid or bolus can thus be efficiently and relatively quickly moved into the adjacent tissue and deliver whatever pharmacologic or other agent was introduced at or near the same site of introduction e.g. by co formulating or co administering the agent in combination with the sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase .

By way of illustration using glycosaminoglycanases such as sHASEGPs to open channels within interstitial spaces as described and illustrated herein can be used to increase interstitial flow into and through tissues such as tumors and others in which flow is typically impeded and interstitial pressures elevated. Illustrative examples of these principles as described herein include the use of sHASEGPs to reduce the interstitial pressure within a tumor in vivo.

Increased flow can likewise be applied to normal tissue to e.g. allow an anesthetic diagnostic cosmetic or other esthetic or a pharmacologic or other agent to be delivered into a tissue e.g. to modify the tissue or introduce a depot formulation into a tissue . Increased flow can likewise be applied to a first or proximal tissue to promote delivery of an agent through the tissue of introduction to a distal tissue which distal tissue may itself by the desired target tissue or a route to the desired target tissue. Illustrative examples of these principles as described herein include for example i the use of sHASEGPs introduced into the episcleral space surrounding the eye to promote the delivery of agents across the sclera in order to target distal target tissues within the interior of the eye such as the retina and choroid and ii the use of sHASEGPs introduced intradermally to promote the delivery of agents through the subdermal layers and into the bloodstream which can itself be the target tissue e.g. for blood modifying agents or a route by which the agent s can be delivered to other target tissues within the body

By way of further illustration of these techniques and compositions for promoting delivery of pharmacologics and other agents to desired tissues within the body the following additional examples are provided. By means such as described and illustrated herein the pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles of pharmacologic agents and the absorption distribution and or effectiveness profiles of other agents can be enhanced or otherwise modified. In addition agents that were essentially or practically limited to delivery by one route such as by IV injection can be delivered by other safer less intrusive less costly and or more convenient routes.

By way of further illustration and without being limited to a particular type of application a volume V of liquid L comprising a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase GAG Enzyme can be introduced into a tissue site in the body a Dosing Tissue . By means as described and illustrated herein the GAG Enzyme can be delivered into and to some extent through the Dosing Tissue. Without being restricted to a particular mechanism of action the GAG Enzyme can be effectively carried into the Dosing Tissue by convective transport by the volume of liquid L . The convective transport can in turn be promoted in part by the hydrostatic pressure associated with L which can provide a driving pressure and in part by the ability of the GAG Enzyme to open channels within the interstitial spaces of the Dosing Tissue which can reduce downstream impedance to flow and thereby lower the resisting pressure . A fluid driving pressure differential can thus be created and to the extent desired it can be increased for example by one or both of the following i introducing and if desired increasing a driving hydrostatic pressure e.g. by introducing L into a confined space and if desired increasing V and ii reducing the downstream impedance to flow e.g. by introducing GAG Enzyme and if desired increasing its effectiveness by for example increasing its concentration increasing its resistance to degradation e.g. by PEGylation super sialation or other modification and or increasing its delivery by convective transport e.g. by increasing V .

In certain embodiments e.g. in which increased extent or rate of delivery is desired V is a volume sufficient to temporarily distend the site within the Dosing Tissue at which the GAG Enzyme is introduced. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the volume V that can be accommodated and the resulting extent of distension D depends on the particular tissue. For purposes of illustration and not limitation the extent to which distention occurs varies for example from situations in which i the Dosing Tissue is a relatively large and or rapidly moving fluid filled space such as the bloodstream in connection with intravenous or intraarterial delivery in which case L can be large e.g. many ml if desired but D tends to be relatively minimal ii the Dosing Tissue is a relatively smaller and or less rapidly moving fluid filled space such as cerebrospinal fluid in connection with intrathecal delivery in which case L can still be relatively large but D may be more than minimal depending on the precise site and volume of injection iii the Dosing Tissue is a relatively smaller but somewhat distensible space such as the episcleral space surrounding the eye for purposes of illustration or iv the Dosing Tissue is a relatively more dense and or more confined space with higher resisting pressure such as the dermis in connection with intradermal delivery for purposes of illustration .

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art V can range from volumes of less than 0.1 ml to volumes of greater than 100 ml for many applications being in the range of about 0.5 ml to 20 ml and for many in the range of 1 ml to 10 ml frequently from 2 to 5 ml but can be varied for particular situations as illustrated herein. V can also be specifically optimized within such ranges for a particular application as desired e.g. by comparing standard pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles over a range of test volumes.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art in view of these teachings by combining the rapidly acting and reinitiating channel opening activity of the GAG Enzyme which both promotes and is promoted by its own delivery together with a delivery system that both promotes and is promoted by the catalytic activity a multiply synergistic drug delivery system can thus be generated as further described and illustrated herein.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in view of the detailed descriptions and illustrative embodiments provided herein any of a large variety of agents can be co introduced e.g. by co formulation or co administration with the GAG Enzyme and any of a variety of GAG Enzymes can be employed at concentrations in ranges such as those provided herein but typically optimized for the particular tissue and objective involved. The volume of liquid V applied in the above illustrative aspects will generally depend on the nature of the site of introduction and will likewise typically be optimized for the particular tissue and objective involved. As described and illustrated herein in the case of non IV parenteral administrations V can be increased within the particular constraints of the tissue site in order to provide an enhanced hydrostatic driving pressure which coupled with decreased impedance associated with degradation of hyaluronan or other glycosaminoglycan can effectively cause the volume of liquid to function as a bolus carrying any solute it contains into the downstream interstitial space and potentially beyond.

Hence provided herein are a variety of techniques employing hyaluronidases and or other glycosaminoglycanases to promote the delivery of pharmacologic and other agents to sites within the body as well as a family of eukaryotic secreted neutral active hyaluronidase glycoproteins designated sHASEGPs and functional domains thereof especially Hyaluronidase or catalytic domains thereof muteins and other derivatives and analogs thereof. Also provided herein are nucleic acids encoding the sHASEGPs. Additionally provided are formulations co formulations and therapeutic uses of said sHASEGPs including by co administration with other agents to treat prevent or diagnose disease and for use as tissue modifying enzymes.

Unless defined otherwise all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which the invention s belong. All patents patent applications published applications and publications Genbank sequences websites and other published materials referred to throughout the entire disclosure herein unless noted otherwise are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the event that there is a plurality of definitions for terms herein those in this section prevail.

Where reference is made to a URL or other such identifier or address it understood that such identifiers can change and particular information on the internet can come and go but equivalent information can be found by searching the internet. Reference thereto evidences the availability and public dissemination of such information.

As used herein the abbreviations for any protective groups amino acids and other compounds are unless indicated otherwise in accord with their common usage recognized abbreviations or the IUPAC IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature see 1972 Biochem. 11 942 944 .

As used herein eukaryotic Hyaluronidase refers to a diverse family of glycosaminoglycan endoglucosaminidases wherein a glutamate residue in the Hyaluronidase hydrolyzes the beta 1 4 linkages of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfates through an acid base catalytic mechanism.

Of particular interest are soluble neutral active hyaluronidases or sHASEGPs of mammalian including human origin. Those of skill in this art recognize that in general single amino acid substitutions in non essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity see e.g. Watson et al. 1987 Molecular Biology of the Gene 4th Edition The Benjamin Cummings Pub. Co. p. 224 .

As used herein membrane anchored HASEGP refers to a family of membrane anchored Hyaluronidases that share common structural features as described herein. As described and illustrated herein hyaluronidases i.e. glycosaminoglycanases capable of breaking down hyaluronan preferably those exhibiting at least some activity in the ranges of neutral pH that are normally membrane anchored can be converted to soluble HASEGPs or sHASEGPs by removing or otherwise modifying one or more of the regions that are associated with anchoring the hyaluronidase in the membrane.

As used herein soluble hyaluronidase refers to a polypeptide characterized by its solubility under physiologic conditions. Soluble HASEGP can be distinguished for example by its partitioning into the aqueous phase of a Triton X 114 solution warmed to 37 C. Bordier et al J. Biol. Chem. 1981 Feb. 25 256 4 1604 7 . Lipid anchored HASEGP on the other hand will partition into the detergent rich phase but will partition into the detergent poor or aqueous phase following treatment with Phospholipase C.

Thus reference for example to sHASEGP encompasses all glycoproteins encoded by the sHASEGP gene family including but not limited to Human sHASEGP mouse sHASEGP or an equivalent molecule obtained from any other source or that has been prepared synthetically or that exhibits the same activity. Sequences of encoding nucleic acid molecules and the encoded amino acid sequences of exemplary sHASEGPs and or domains thereof are set forth for example in SEQ ID NO 4. The term also encompasses sHASEGP with amino acid substitutions that do not substantially alter activity of each member and also encompasses splice variants thereof. Suitable substitutions including although not necessarily conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and can be made without eliminating the biological activity such as the catalytic activity of the resulting molecule.

As used herein a sHASEGP whenever referenced herein includes at least one or all of or any combination of a polypeptide encoded by the sequence of nucleotides set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 or by a sequence of nucleotides that includes nucleotides that encode amino acids 1 509 of SEQ ID NO 1 a polypeptide encoded by a sequence of nucleotides that hybridizes under conditions of low moderate or high stringency to the sequence of nucleotides set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 a polypeptide that includes the sequence of amino acids set forth as amino acids 1 509 of SEQ ID NO 1 a polypeptide that includes a sequence of amino acids having at least about 60 70 75 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 sequence identity with the sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 or as amino acids 1 448 of SEQ ID NO 4.

In particular the sHASEGP polypeptide with the Hyaluronidase domains as indicated in SEQ ID NO 4 is provided. The polypeptide is a single or two chain polypeptide. Smaller portions thereof that retain Hyaluronidase activity are also provided. The Hyaluronidase domains from sHASEGPs vary in size and constitution including insertions and deletions in surface loops. Thus for purposes herein the catalytic domain is a portion of a sHASEGP as defined herein and is homologous to a domain of other hyaluronidase like sequences such as HYAL1 HYAL2 HYAL3 which have been previously identified it was not recognized however that an isolated single chain form of the human Hyaluronidase domain could function in in vitro assays. The Aspartate and Glutamate residues necessary for activity are present in conserved motifs.

As used herein a neutral hyaluronidase domain of a soluble sHASEGP refers to a beta 1 4 endoglucosaminidase domain of a sHASEGP that exhibits Hyaluronidase activity at neutral pH is soluble under conditions as described and shares homology and structural features with the hyaluronidase glycosyl hydrolase family domains but contains additional sequences in the carboxy terminus that are required for neutral activity. Hence it is at least the minimal portion of the domain that exhibits Hyaluronidase activity as assessed by standard in vitro assays and remains soluble. Contemplated herein are such Hyaluronidase domains and catalytically active portions thereof. Also provided are truncated forms of the Hyaluronidase domain that include the smallest fragment thereof that acts catalytically as a single chain form. As used herein and in the art neutral or neutral active refers to a protein exhibiting activity at neutral pH e.g. exhibiting activity at about pH 7 and which is therefore active at a pH range characteristic of many physiological tissues. As will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art a protein generally exhibits a range of activity around its pH optimum. The pH optimum of a neutral active protein will typically be within one to several pH units above or below pH 7 but its range of activity may extend over many pH units.

A Hyaluronidase domain of an sHASEGP whenever referenced herein includes at least one or all of or any combination of or a catalytically active portion of an N linked glycoprotein polypeptide that includes the sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 a polypeptide encoded by a sequence of nucleotides that hybridizes under conditions of low moderate or high stringency to the sequence of nucleotides set forth in SEQ ID NO 6 a polypeptide that includes the sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 a polypeptide that includes a sequence of amino acids having at least about 70 75 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 sequence identity with the sequence of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 1 and or a Hyaluronidase domain of a polypeptide encoded by a splice variant of the sHASEGP.

Thus for purposes herein the Hyaluronidase domain is a portion of a sHASEGP as defined herein and is homologous to a domain of other sHASEGPs. As with the larger class of enzymes of the hyaluronidase family the sHASEGP catalytic domains share a high degree of amino acid sequence identity. The Asp and Glu residues necessary for activity are present in conserved motifs.

By active form is meant a form active in vivo and or in vitro. As described herein the Hyaluronidase domain also can exist as a soluble secreted glycoprotein. It is shown herein that at least in vitro the single chain forms of the sHASEGPs and the catalytic domains or enzymatically active portions thereof typically C terminal truncations exhibit Hyaluronidase activity. Hence provided herein are isolated forms of the Hyaluronidase domains of sHASEGPs and their use in in vitro drug screening assays for identification of agents that modulate the activity thereof.

As used herein the catalytically active domain of a sHASEGP refers to the neutral active endoglucosaminidase domain as defined by activity in vitro towards a glycosaminoglycan substrate.

sHASEGPs of interest include those that are active against chondroitin sulfates and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans CSPG s in vivo and in vitro and those that are active against hyaluronan. As used herein a human sHASEGP is one encoded by nucleic acid such as DNA present in the genome of a human including all allelic variants and conservative variations as long as they are not variants found in other mammals.

As used herein nucleic acid encoding a Hyaluronidase domain or catalytically active portion of a sHASEGP shall be construed as referring to a nucleic acid encoding only the recited single chain Hyaluronidase domain or active portion thereof and not the other contiguous portions of the sHASEGP as a continuous sequence.

As used herein disease or disorder refers to a pathological condition in an organism resulting from e.g. infection or genetic defect and characterized by identifiable symptoms.

As used herein a splice variant refers to a variant produced by differential processing of a primary transcript of genomic nucleic acid such as DNA that results in more than one type of mRNA. Splice variants of sHASEGPs are provided herein.

As used herein the Hyaluronidase domain of a sHASEGP protein refers to the Hyaluronidase domain of a sHASEGP that exhibits neutral endoglucosaminidase activity. Hence it is at least the minimal portion of the protein that exhibits endoglucosaminidase activity as assessed by standard assays in vitro. Exemplary human Hyaluronidase domains include at least a sufficient portion of sequences of amino acids set forth in SEQ ID NO 4 to exhibit endoglucosaminidase activity.

Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that encode a polypeptide that has endoglucosaminidase activity in an in vitro Hyaluronidase assay and that have at least 70 75 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 or 99 sequence identity with the full length of a Hyaluronidase domain of an sHASEGP polypeptide or that hybridize along their full length or along at least about 70 80 or 90 of the full length to a nucleic acids that encode a Hyaluronidase domain particularly under conditions of moderate generally high stringency.

For the Hyaluronidase domains of PH20 for example residues within the N terminal region can be critical yet not sufficient for activity. By application of techniques such as shown herein one can generate Hyaluronidase domains of the sHASEGP that are catalytically active. By way of illustration while the Hyaluronidase domain of human PH20 generally requires the N terminal amino acids thereof for activity the C terminus portion can be truncated until the last Cysteine residue yet requires additional amino acids to be optimally active. The amount that can be removed can be determined empirically by testing the polypeptide for Hyaluronidase activity in an in vitro assay that assesses catalytic cleavage.

Hence smaller portions of the Hyaluronidase domains particularly the single chain domains thereof that retain Hyaluronidase activity are contemplated. Such smaller versions generally are C terminal truncated versions of the Hyaluronidase domains. The Hyaluronidase domains vary in size and constitution including insertions and deletions in surface loops. Such domains exhibit conserved structure including at least one structural feature such as the proton donor and or other features of Hyaluronidase domains of endoglucosaminidases. Thus for purposes herein the Hyaluronidase domain is a single chain portion of a sHASEGP as defined herein but is homologous in its structural features and retention of sequence of similarity or homology the Hyaluronidase domain of other hyaluronidase like sequences. The glycoprotein exhibits Hyaluronidase activity as a single chain.

As used herein by homologous means about greater than 25 nucleic acid sequence identity such as 25 40 60 70 80 90 or 95 . If necessary the percentage homology will be specified. The terms homology and identity are often used interchangeably. In general sequences are aligned so that the highest order match is obtained see e.g. Computational Molecular Biology Lesk A. M. ed. Oxford University Press New York 1988 Biocomputing Informatics and Genome Projects Smith D. W. ed. Academic Press New York 1993 Computer Analysis of Sequence Data Part Griffin A. M. and Griffin H. G. eds. Humana Press New Jersey 1994 Sequence Analysis in Molecular Biology von Heinje G. Academic Press 1987 and Sequence Analysis Primer Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. M Stockton Press New York 1991 Carrillo et al. 1988 Slam J Applied Math 48 1073 1082 .

By sequence identity the numbers of conserved amino acids is determined by standard alignment algorithms programs and are used with default gap penalties established by each supplier. Substantially homologous nucleic acid molecules would hybridize typically at moderate stringency or at high stringency all along the length of the nucleic acid or along at least about 70 80 or 90 of the full length nucleic acid molecule of interest. Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that contain degenerate codons in place of codons in the hybridizing nucleic acid molecule.

Whether any two nucleic acid molecules have nucleotide sequences that are at least for example 80 85 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical can be determined using known computer algorithms such as the FASTA program using for example the default parameters as in Pearson et al 1988 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 2444 other programs include the GCG program package Devereux J. et al. Nucleic Acids Research 12 387 1984 BLASTP BLASTN FASTA Altschul S. F. et al. J Molec Biol 215 403 410 1990 Guide to Huge Computers Martin J. Bishop Ed. Academic Press San Diego 1994 and Carrillo et al. 1988 SIAM J Applied Math 48 1073 1082 . For example the BLAST function of the National Center for Biotechnology Information database can be used to determine identity. Other commercially or publicly available programs include DNASTAR MEGALIGN PROGRAM Madison Wis. and the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group UWG Gap program Madison Wis. . Percent homology or identity of proteins and or nucleic acid molecules can be determined for example by comparing sequence information using a GAP computer program e.g. Needleman et al. 1970 J. Mol. Biol. 48 443 as revised by Smith and Waterman Adv. Appl. Math 1981 2 482 . Briefly the GAP program defines similarity as the number of aligned symbols i.e. nucleotides or amino acids that are similar divided by the total number of symbols in the shorter of the two sequences. Default parameters for the GAP program can include 1 a unary comparison matrix containing a value of 1 for identities and 0 for non identities and the weighted comparison matrix of Gribskov et al 1986 Nucl. Acids Res. 14 6745 6763 as described by Schwartz and Dayhoff eds. Atlas Of Protein Sequence And Structure National Biomedical Research Foundation pp. 353 358 1979 2 a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap and 3 no penalty for end gaps. Therefore as used herein the term identity represents a comparison between a test and a reference polypeptide or polynucleotide.

As used herein the term at least 90 identical to refers to percent identities from 90 to 99.99 relative to the reference polypeptides. Identity at a level of 90 or more is indicative of the fact that assuming for exemplification purposes a test and reference polynucleotide length of 100 amino acids are compared. No more than 10 i.e. 10 out of 100 amino acids in the test polypeptide differ from that of the reference polypeptides. Similar comparisons can be made between a test and reference polynucleotides. Such differences can be represented as point mutations randomly distributed over the entire length of an amino acid sequence or they can be clustered in one or more locations of varying length up to the maximum allowable e.g. 10 100 amino acid difference approximately 90 identity . Differences are defined as nucleic acid or amino acid substitutions or deletions. At the level of homologies or identities above about 85 90 the result should be independent of the program and gap parameters set such high levels of identity can be assessed readily often without relying on software.

As used herein primer refers to an oligonucleotide containing two or more deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides typically more than three from which synthesis of a primer extension product can be initiated. Experimental conditions conducive to synthesis include the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and an agent for polymerization and extension such as DNA polymerase and a suitable buffer temperature and pH.

As used herein animals include any animal such as but are not limited to goats cows deer sheep rodents pigs and humans. Non human animals exclude humans as the contemplated animal. The sHASEGPs provided herein are from any source animal plant prokaryotic and fungal. Preferred sHASEGPs are of animal origin including mammalian origin and more preferably are of human origin in the case of their use in humans.

As used herein genetic therapy involves the transfer of heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA into certain cells target cells of a mammal particularly a human with a disorder or conditions for which such therapy is sought. The nucleic acid such as DNA is introduced into the selected target cells in a manner such that the heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA is expressed and a therapeutic product encoded thereby is produced.

Alternatively the heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA can in some manner mediate expression of DNA that encodes the therapeutic product or it can encode a product such as a peptide or RNA that in some manner mediates directly or indirectly expression of a therapeutic product. Genetic therapy can also be used to deliver nucleic acid encoding a gene product that replaces a defective gene or supplements a gene product produced by the mammal or the cell in which it is introduced. The introduced nucleic acid can encode a therapeutic compound such as a growth factor inhibitor thereof or a tumor necrosis factor or inhibitor thereof such as a receptor therefore that is not normally produced in the mammalian host or that is not produced in therapeutically effective amounts or at a therapeutically useful time. The heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA encoding the therapeutic product can be modified prior to introduction into the cells of the afflicted host in order to enhance or otherwise alter the product or expression thereof. Genetic therapy can also involve delivery of an inhibitor or repressor or other modulator of gene expression.

As used herein heterologous nucleic acid is nucleic acid that encodes proteins or if DNA encodes RNA that encodes proteins that are not normally produced in vivo by the cell in which it is expressed or that mediates or encodes mediators that alter expression of endogenous nucleic acid such as DNA by affecting transcription translation or other regulatable biochemical processes. Heterologous nucleic acid such as DNA can also be referred to as foreign nucleic acid such as DNA. Any nucleic acid such as DNA that one of skill in the art would recognize or consider as heterologous or foreign to the cell in which is expressed is herein encompassed by heterologous nucleic acid heterologous nucleic acid includes exogenously added nucleic acid that is also expressed endogenously. Examples of heterologous nucleic acid include but are not limited to nucleic acid that encodes traceable marker proteins such as a protein that confers drug resistance nucleic acid that encodes therapeutically effective substances such as anti cancer agents enzymes and hormones and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA that indirectly or directly encode other types of proteins such as antibodies. Antibodies that are encoded by heterologous nucleic acid can be secreted or expressed on the surface of the cell in which the heterologous nucleic acid has been introduced.

Heterologous nucleic acid is generally not endogenous to the cell into which it is introduced but has been obtained from another cell or prepared synthetically.

Generally although not necessarily such nucleic acid encodes RNA and or proteins that are not normally produced by the cell in which it is expressed.

As used herein a therapeutically effective product is a product that is encoded by heterologous nucleic acid typically DNA that upon introduction of the nucleic acid into a host a product is expressed that ameliorates or eliminates the symptoms manifestations of an inherited or acquired disease or that cures the disease.

As used herein recitation that a glycoprotein consists essentially of the Hyaluronidase domain means that the only sHASEGP portion of the polypeptide is a Hyaluronidase domain or a catalytically active portion thereof. The polypeptide can optionally and generally will include additional non sHASEGP derived sequences of amino acids.

As used herein domain refers to a portion of a molecule e.g. glycoproteins or the encoding nucleic acids that is structurally and or functionally distinct from other portions of the molecule.

As used herein Hyaluronidase refers to an enzyme catalyzing hydrolysis of glycosaminoglycans including hyaluronans.

For clarity reference to Hyaluronidase refers to all forms and particular forms will be specifically designated. For purposes herein the Hyaluronidase domain includes the membrane bound and soluble forms of a sHASEGP protein.

As used herein nucleic acids include DNA RNA and analogs thereof including protein nucleic acids PNA and mixture thereof. Nucleic acids can be single or double stranded. When referring to probes or primers optionally labeled with a detectable label such as a fluorescent dye or radiolabel single stranded molecules are generally contemplated. Such molecules are typically of a length such that their target is statistically unique or of low copy number typically less than 5 generally less than 3 for probing or priming a library. As is known in the art generally a probe or primer contains at least 14 16 20 or 30 residues of contiguous or nearly contiguous sequence complementary to or identical a gene of interest. Probes and primers can be 10 20 30 50 100 or more nucleic acids long.

As used herein nucleic acid encoding a fragment or portion of a sHASEGP refers to a nucleic acid encoding only the recited fragment or portion of sHASEGP and not the other contiguous portions of the sHASEGP.

As used herein operative linkage of heterologous nucleic to regulatory and effector sequences of nucleotides such as promoters enhancers transcriptional and translational stop sites and other signal sequences refers to the relationship between such nucleic acid such as DNA and such sequences of nucleotides. For example operative linkage of heterologous DNA to a promoter refers to the functional and typically physical relationship between the DNA and the promoter such that the transcription of such DNA is initiated from the promoter by an RNA polymerase that specifically recognizes binds to and transcribes the DNA in reading frame. Thus operatively linked or operationally associated refers to the functional relationship of nucleic acid such as DNA with regulatory and effector sequences of nucleotides such as promoters enhancers transcriptional and translational stop sites and other signal sequences. In order to optimize expression and or in vitro transcription it can be necessary to remove add or alter 5 Untranslated portions of the clones to eliminate extra potential inappropriate alternative translation initiation i.e. start codons or other sequences that can interfere with or reduce expression either at the level of transcription or translation. Alternatively consensus ribosome binding sites see e.g. Kozak J. Biol. Chem. 266 19867 19870 1991 can be inserted immediately 5 of the start codon and can enhance expression. The desirability of or need for such modification can be empirically determined.

As used herein a sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA with reference to antisense oligonucleotides means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize with the RNA generally under moderate or high stringency conditions forming a stable duplex in the case of double stranded sHASEGP antisense nucleic acids a single strand of the duplex DNA or dsRNA can thus be tested or triplex formation can be assayed. The ability to hybridize depends on the degree of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally the longer the hybridizing nucleic acid the more base mismatches with a sHASEGP encoding RNA it can contain and still form a stable duplex or triplex as the case can be . One skilled in the art can ascertain a tolerable degree of mismatch by use of standard procedures to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.

For purposes herein amino acid substitutions can be made in any of sHASEGPs and Hyaluronidase domains thereof provided that the resulting protein exhibits Hyaluronidase activity. Amino acid substitutions contemplated include conservative substitutions such as those set forth in Table 1 and other modifications that do not eliminate proteolytic activity. As described herein substitutions that alter properties of the proteins such as removal of cleavage sites and other such sites are also contemplated such substitutions are generally non conservative but can be readily effected by those of skill in the art.

Suitable conservative substitutions of amino acids are known to those of skill in this art and can be made generally without eliminating and preferably without substantially altering the biological activity for example enzymatic activity of the resulting molecule. Those of skill in this art recognize that in general single amino acid substitutions in non essential regions of a polypeptide do not substantially alter biological activity see e.g. Watson et al. Molecular Biology of the Gene 4th Edition 1987 The Benjamin Cummings Pub. co. p. 224 . Also included within the definition is the catalytically active fragment of a sHASEGP particularly a single chain Hyaluronidase portion. Conservative amino acid substitutions are made for example in accordance with those set forth in TABLE 1 as follows 

TABLE 1 Original residue Conservative substitution Ala A Gly Ser Abu Arg R Lys Orn Asn N Gln His Cys C Ser Gln O Asn Glu E ASP Gly G Ala Pro His H Asn Gln Ile I Leu Val Met Nle Nva Leu L Val Met Nle Nva Lys K Arg Gln Glu Met M Leu Tyr Ile NLe Val Orn Lys Arg Phe F Met Leu Tyr Ser S Thr Thr T Ser Trp W Tyr Tyr Y Trp Phe Val V ILE Leu Met Nle Nva. Other substitutions are also permissible and can be determined empirically or in accord with known conservative substitutions.

Oligosaccharides are considered to have a reducing end and a non reducing end whether or not the saccharide at the reducing end is in fact a reducing sugar. In accordance with accepted nomenclature oligosaccharides are depicted herein with the non reducing end on the left and the reducing end on the right. All oligosaccharides described herein are described with the name or abbreviation for the non reducing saccharide e.g. Gal followed by the configuration of the glycosidic bond .alpha. or. beta. the ring bond the ring position of the reducing saccharide involved in the bond and then the name or abbreviation of the reducing saccharide e.g. GlcNAc . The linkage between two sugars may be expressed for example as 2 3 2.fw darw.3 or 2 3 . Each saccharide is a pyranose.

As used herein N linked sugar moiety refers to an oligosaccharide attached to a sHASEGP via the amide nitrogen of Asn residues. N linked oligosaccharides fall into several major types oligomannose complex hybrid sulfated all of which have Man 3 GlcNAc GlcNAc cores attached via the amide nitrogen of Asn residues that fall within Asn Xaa Thr Ser sequences where Xaa is not Pro . N linked sites are often indirectly assigned by the appearance of a blank cycle during sequencing. Positive identification can be made after release of the oligosaccharide by PNGase F which converts the glycosylated Asn to Asp. After PNGase F release N linked oligosaccharides can be purified using Bio Gel P 6 chromatography with the oligosaccharide pool subjected to preparative high pH anion exchange chromatography HPAEC Townsend et al. 1989 Anal. Biochem. 182 1 8 . Certain oligosaccharide isomers can be resolved using HPAEC. Fucose residues will shift elution positions earlier in the HPAEC chromatogram while additional sialic acid residues will increase the retention time. Concurrent treatment of glycoproteins whose oligosaccharide structures are known e.g. bovine fetuin a 1 acid glycoprotein ovalbumin RNAse B transferrin can facilitate assignment of the oligosaccharide peaks. The collected oligosaccharides can be characterized by a combination of compositional and methylation linkage analyses Waeghe et al. 1983 Carbohydr Res. 123 281 304. with anomeric configurations assigned by NMR spectroscopy Van Halbeek 1993 in Methods Enzymol 230 .

Alternatively oligosaccharides can be identified by fluorescence assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis FACE Callewaert et al. 2001 Glycobiology 11 275 281.

As used herein the term sialic acid refers to any member of a family of nine carbon carboxylated sugars. The most common member of the sialic acid family is N acetylneuraminic acid 2 keto 5 acetamindo 3 5 di deoxy D glycero D galactononulopyranos 1 onic acid often abbreviated as Neu5Ac NeuAc or NANA . A second member of the family is N glycolyl neuraminic acid Neu5Gc or NeuGc in which the N acetyl group of NeuAc is hydroxylated. A third sialic acid family member is 2 keto 3 deoxy nonulosonic acid KDN Nadano et al. 1986 J. Biol. Chem. 261 11550 11557 Kanamori et al. 1990 J. Biol. Chem. 265 21811 21819. Also included are 9 substituted sialic acids such as a 9 O C Cacyl Neu5Ac like 9 O lactyl Neu5Ac or 9 O acetyl Neu5Ac 9 deoxy 9 fluoro Neu5Ac and 9 azido 9 deoxy Neu5Ac. For review of the sialic acid family see e.g. Varki 1992 Glycobiology 2 25 40 Sialic Acids Chemistry Metabolism and Function R. Schauer Ed. Springer Verlag N.Y. 1992 . The synthesis and use of sialic acid compounds in a sialation procedure is disclosed in international application WO 92 16640 published Oct. 1 1992.

As used herein PNGase refers to an Asparagine Peptide specific N glycosidase F such as the peptide N glycosidase F. PNGASE enzymes are characterized by their specificity towards N linked rather than O linked oligosaccharides. Characterization of PNGASE efficacy can be defined by both SDS PAGE electrophoresis or fluorescent assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis.

As used herein substantially terminated Sialation refers to N linked oligosaccharides terminating with sialic acid residue as a terminal sugar. Terminal sialic acids can be identified by FACE analysis of released carbohydrates following treatment with neuraminidase.

The circulatory lifetime of glycoproteins in the blood is highly dependent on the composition and structure of its N linked carbohydrate groups. This fact is of direct relevance for therapeutic glycoproteins that are intended to be administered parenterally. In general maximal circulatory half life of a glycoprotein requires that its N linked carbohydrate groups terminate in the sequence NeuAc Gal GlcNAc. Without the terminal sialic acid NeuAc the glycoprotein is rapidly cleared from the blood by a mechanism involving the recognition of the underlying N acetylgalactosamine GalNAc or galactose Gal residues Goochee et al. 1991 Biol Technology 9 1347 1355 . For this reason ensuring the presence of terminal sialic acid on N linked carbohydrate groups of therapeutic glycoproteins is an important consideration for their commercial development.

Circulating glycoproteins are exposed to sialidase s or neuraminidase which can remove terminal sialic acid residues. Typically the removal of the sialic acid exposes galactose residues and these residues are recognized and bound by galactose specific receptors in hepatocytes reviewed in Ashwell and Harford 1982 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 51 531 . Liver also contains other sugar specific receptors which mediate removal of glycoproteins from circulation. Specificities of such receptors also include N acetylglucosamine mannose fucose and phosphomannose. Glycoproteins cleared by the galactose receptors of hepatocytes undergo substantial degradation and then enter the bile glycoproteins cleared by the mannose receptor of Kupffer cells enter the reticuloendothelial system reviewed in Ashwell and Harford 1982 Ann. Rev. Biochem. 51 53 .

One TRU is defined as the amount of hyaluronidase activity required to reduce the turbidity of an acidified solution of hyaluronic acid and is equivalent to the U.S.P. National Formulary NF XIII units NFU . The ELISA like enzyme assay described herein can be related to the TRU the NFU and U.S.P. unit through a standard curve of a sample of hyaluronidase e.g. USP or WHO standard standardized through the U.S.P. Therefore the enzyme activities determined by the ELISA like enzyme assay are actually relative TRU since enzyme activity is not actually measured using the turbidometric assay Dorfman et al. 1948 J. Biol. Chem. 172 367 .

As used herein potency is defined by the amount of sHASEGP protein required to degrade substrate in vitro based upon a Turbidity Reducing Unit or Relative Turbidity Reducing Unit.

As used herein specific activity refers to Units of activity per mg protein. The amount of sHASEGP protein is defined by the absorption of a solution of sHASEGP at 280 nm assuming a molar extinction coefficient of approximately 1.7 in units of Mcm.

Polyethylene glycol PEG has been widely used in biomaterials biotechnology and medicine primarily because PEG is a biocompatible nontoxic nonimmunogenic and water soluble polymer Zhao and Harris ACS Symposium Series 680 458 72 1997 . In the area of drug delivery PEG derivatives have been widely used in covalent attachment i.e. PEGylation to proteins to reduce immunogenicity proteolysis and kidney clearance and to enhance solubility Zalipsky Adv. Drug Del. Rev. 16 157 82 1995 . Similarly PEG has been attached to low molecular weight relatively hydrophobic drugs to enhance solubility reduce toxicity and alter biodistribution. Typically PEGylated drugs are injected as solutions.

A closely related application is synthesis of crosslinked degradable PEG networks or formulations for use in drug delivery since much of the same chemistry used in design of degradable soluble drug carriers can also be used in design of degradable gels Sawhney et al. Macromolecules 26 581 87 1993 . It is also known that intermacromolecular complexes can be formed by mixing solutions of two complementary polymers. Such complexes are generally stabilized by electrostatic interactions polyanion polycation and or hydrogen bonds polyacid polybase between the polymers involved and or by hydrophobic interactions between the polymers in an aqueous surrounding Krupers et al. Eur. Polym J. 32 785 790 1996 . For example mixing solutions of polyacrylic acid PAAc and polyethylene oxide PEO under the proper conditions results in the formation of complexes based mostly on hydrogen bonding. Dissociation of these complexes at physiologic conditions has been used for delivery of free drugs i.e. non PEGylated . In addition complexes of complementary polymers have been formed from both homopolymers and copolymers.

In one aspect the polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight ranging from about 3 kD to about 50 kD and preferably from about 5 kD to about 30 kD. Covalent attachment of the PEG to the drug known as PEGylation may be accomplished by known chemical synthesis techniques. For example in one aspect of the present invention the PEGylation of protein may be accomplished by reacting NHS activated PEG with the protein under suitable reaction conditions.

While numerous reactions have been described for PEGylation those that are most generally applicable confer directionality utilize mild reaction conditions and do not necessitate extensive downstream processing to remove toxic catalysts or bi products. For instance monomethoxy PEG mPEG has only one reactive terminal hydroxyl and thus its use limits some of the heterogeneity of the resulting PEG protein product mixture. Activation of the hydroxyl group at the end of the polymer opposite to the terminal methoxy group is generally necessary to accomplish efficient protein PEGylation with the aim being to make the derivatised PEG more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The attacking nucleophile is usually the epsilon amino group of a lysyl residue but other amines can also react e.g. the N terminal alpha amine or the ring amines of histidine if local conditions are favorable. A more directed attachment is possible in proteins containing a single lysine or cysteine. The latter residue can be targeted by PEG maleimide for thiol specific modification. Alternatively PEG hydrazide can be reacted with periodate oxidized sHASEGP and reduced in the presence of NaCNBHMore specifically PEGylated CMP sugars can be reacted with sHASEGP in the presence of appropriate glycosyl transferases. One technique is the PEGylation technique where a number of polymeric molecules are coupled to the polypeptide in question. When using this technique the immune system has difficulties in recognizing the epitopes on the polypeptide s surface responsible for the formation of antibodies thereby reducing the immune response. For polypeptides introduced directly into the circulatory system of the human body to give a particular physiological effect i.e. pharmaceuticals the typical potential immune response is an IgG and or IgM response while polypeptides which are inhaled through the respiratory system i.e. industrial polypeptide potentially may cause an IgE response i.e. allergic response . One of the theories explaining the reduced immune response is that the polymeric molecule s shield s epitope s on the surface of the polypeptide responsible for the immune response leading to antibody formation. Another theory or at least a partial factor is that the heavier the conjugate is the more reduced immune response is obtained.

In the case of human sHASEGPs being used in the human body a preferred combination as described herein the tendency for the sSHASEGP to elicit an immune response can be significantly reduced as compared to for example non human animal derived enzymes such as bovine or ovine hyaluronidases i.e. even if those animal derived enzymes could be completely purified away from other animal derived proteins which is difficult to impossible to achieve in practice . Although human sHASEGPs thus represent a substantial and very important improvement over animal derived products they can for many uses be improved still further by post translational modifications PTMs such as PEGylation to enhance their resistance to degradation or elimination and or. to improve other properties making them even more beneficial for particular applications.

For example although preferred compositions for humans such as the human sHASEGPs exhibit reduced immunogenicity compared to animal derived hyaluronidases or non human sHASEGPs PEGylation of such human sHASEGPs can be used for example to extend their half life in the bloodstream and or in other tissues within the body. Without being restricted to a particular mechanism of action it is generally considered that the attachment of PEG moieties to sHASEGPs can be used to effectively shield the molecule decreasing its relative sensitivity to proteases and potentially also decreasing the extent and rate of its clearance and elimination from the body.

The polymeric molecules coupled to the polypeptide may be any suitable polymeric molecule with a molecular weight as defined according to the invention including natural and synthetic homopolymers such as polyols i.e. poly OH polyamines i.e. poly NH and polycarboxyl acids i.e. poly COOH and further heteropolymers i.e. polymers comprising one or more different coupling groups e.g. a hydroxyl group and amine groups.

Examples of suitable polymeric molecules include polymeric molecules selected from the group comprising polyalkylene oxides PAO such as polyalkylene glycols PAG including polypropylene glycols PEG methoxypolyethylene glycols mPEG and polypropylene glycols PEG glycidyl ethers Epox PEG PEG oxycarbonylimidazole CDI PEG branched polyethylene glycols PEGs polyvinyl alcohol PVA polycarboxylates polyvinylpyrrolidone poly D L amino acids polyethylene co maleic acid anhydride polystyrene co maleic acid anhydride dextrans including carboxymethyl dextrans heparin homologous albumin celluloses including methylcellulose carboxymethylcellulose ethylcellulose hydroxyethylcellulose carboxyethylcellulose and hydroxypropylcellulose hydrolysates of chitosan starches such as hydroxyethyl starches and hydroxypropyl starches glycogen agaroses and derivatives thereof guar gum pullulan inulin xanthan gum carrageenan pectin alginic acid hydrolysates and bio polymers.

Preferred polymeric molecules are non toxic polymeric molecules such as m polyethylene glycol mPEG which further requires a relatively simple chemistry for its covalent coupling to attachment groups on the enzyme s surface.

Generally seen polyalkylene oxides PAO such as polyethylene oxides such as PEG and especially mPEG are the preferred polymeric molecules as these polymeric molecules in comparison to polysaccharides such as dextran pullulan and the like have few reactive groups capable of cross linking which is undesirable.

Improvements in PEGylation and other types of post translational modifications PTMs have been extensive and there are now a large number of PTM techniques and reagents known in the art and new ones are regularly being developed. Techniques and reagents for PEGylation include for example i specialized linkers and coupling chemistries see e.g. the reagents and technologies reviewed by Roberts et al. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54 459 476 2002 and the primary references reviewed therein ii branched PEGs which effectively allow additional PEG groups to be attached to a single conjugation site see e.g. Guiotto et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 12 177 180 2002 iii site specific PEGylation including site specific monoPEGylation see e.g. Chapman A. P. et al. Nature Biotech. 17 780 783 1999 and iv site directed enzymatic PEGylation e.g. using a transglutaminase reaction as described by Sato H. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 54 487 504 2002 . There are also additional technologies and reagents available from an increasing number of commercial suppliers see e.g. Nektar Shearwater nektar.com Sunbio sunbio.com and sunbio.com peg shop Celares GmbH celares.com and others .

While previously thought to be testis specific human sHASEGP is expressed in multiple tissues in humans when using more sensitive techniques such as RT PCR. The sHASEGP transcript is found in medulla brain microvascular endothelium prostate breast retina pooled human melanocyte fetal heart and pregnant uterus. sHASEGP is also expressed in germ cell tumors. RT PCR based detection of sHASEGP transcripts is generally required to detect levels in tissues other than testis.

Hyaluronidase activity can be detected by way of a modified turbidometric assay in acidified serum solution. The reagents required are as follows 

The following reagents are prepared Acetate Buffer Solution 14.0 g of potassium acetate and 25.0 mL of glacial acetic acid in water to make 1000 mL. Phosphate Buffer Solution 2.5 g of sodium phosphate monobasic 1.0 g of anhydrous sodium phosphate dibasic and 8.2 g of sodium chloride in water to make 1000 mL. Enzyme Diluent Stock Solution 500 mL of Phosphate Buffer Solution with 500 mL of water. Enzyme Diluent Working Solution 33 mg of hydrolyzed gelatin in 50 mL of Enzyme Diluent Stock Solution prepared within 2 hours of use. Sample Stabilization Buffer Solution SSB Soln. 125 microliters L of a 20 Human Serum Albumin Solution and 50 L of a 1 M Calcium Chloride solution in 50 mL of Enzyme Diluent Working Solution and mix thoroughly. Serum Stock Solution Dilute 1 volume of Horse Serum with 9 volumes of Acetate Buffer Solution. Adjust with 4 N hydrochloric acid to a pH of 3.1 and allow the solution to stand at room temperature for 18 to 24 hrs. Store the solution at 4 C. and use within 30 days. Serum Working Solution 10 mL of the Serum Stock Solution in 30 mL of the Acetate Buffer Solution adjusted to room temperature. Hyaluronic Acid Stock Solution Sodium Hyaluronic Acid to a concentration 5.0 mg mL in water. Hyaluronic Acid Working Solution 0.75 mL of the Hyaluronic Acid Stock Solution in 4.25 mL of the Phosphate Buffer Solution. Standard Stock Solution One container of USP Reference Standard Hyaluronidase to a concentration 1000 Units mL in water aliquoted into 50 L portions and stored at 20 C. Standard Working Solution 40 L of Standard Stock Solution in 960 uL of cold Enzyme Diluent Working Solution to obtain a solution having a known concentration of 40 Units mL prepared immediately before use in the assay.

All enzyme samples are diluted in a Low Protein Binding 96 well plate according to the following guidelines 

a The range of maximum sensitivity of this assay is between 10 30 Units mL. To minimize the number of times an assay must be repeated in order to get results that are within range first determine the approximate number of total units mL for the sample and then choose a whole number dilution such that the final concentration is approximately 20 Units ml.

b Minimum Sample volumes needed to perform assay are as follows FPLC Fractions 50 L Tissue Culture Supernatants 1 mL Purified Concentrated Final Step Material 10 L.

c For samples with serial dilutions 1 10 dilutions in the Low Protein Binding 96 well plate are made in triplicate by pipetting 360 L of the SSB Solution and 40 L of Sample into each well.

For preparation of USP Standard prepare the USP Standard Curve in the Low Protein Binding 96 well plate as follows 

For preparation of the Hyaluronic Acid Control in columns 1 3 prepare the H.A. Control in the Flat Bottom 96 well plate is prepared as follows 

The Reaction Plate 30 L per well of Hyaluronic Acid Working Solution is pipetted using a 50 L 8 channel transfer pipette into a Flat Bottom 96 well microtiter plate leaving wells H1 H3 empty. 60 L well of Enzyme Diluent Working Solution is pipetted into wells H1 H3 of the same plate as the HA control.

Serum Working Solution 40 mL of Serum Working Solution is dispensed into a transfer basin and next to the Heat Block.

Pre warming stage Once both plates have been prepared the Low Protein Binding 96 Well plate containing the diluted samples standards controls and the Flat Bottom 96 well plate containing the Hyaluronic Acid Working Solution are placed onto a heat block and allow them to warm for 5 min. at 37 C.

The Reaction is initiated by the addition of Enzyme to Substrate 30 L from the enzyme plate into all of the wells in column 1 of the 96 Well flat bottom plate containing the substrate using a 5 50 L 8 channel pipette. The Enzyme Substrate reaction mixture is aspirated 5 times drawing the solution up and down with the transfer during the first 15 seconds to ensure complete sample mixing. After mixing the enzyme and substrate the tips are ejected and a new set of tips loaded on the transfer pipettor for the next column. A timer is restarted and at time t 0 30 this process is repeated for column 2. At the next 30 second interval t 1 00 this is repeated process for column 3. This process is repeated moving from left to right across the plate every 30 seconds until all of the wells contain both enzyme and substrate.

Stopping the reaction When timer reaches 6 minutes t 6 00 240 L of the Serum Working Solution is pippetted into each well using a 50 300 L 8 channel transfer pipette into column 1 of the 96 well flat bottom plate from the adjacent 50 mL Reagent Reservoir. The mixture is aspirated 3 times drawing the solution up and down with the transfer Pipettor during the first 10 seconds to ensure complete mixing. The process is repeated every 30 seconds proceeding from column s 1 to 12. Upon completion of the last column column 12 the reaction plate is removed from the heat block and place the plate onto the read tray of the plate reader at 640 nM. A linear curve fit is generated from the standard curve that permits extrapolation of test samples.

The free carboxyl groups on glucuronic acid residues of Hyaluronan are biotinylated in a one step reaction using biotin hydrazide Pierce Sulfo NHS Pierce and 1 Ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide Sigma . This biotinylated HA substrate is covalently coupled to a 96 well microtiter plate in a second reaction. At the completion of the enzyme reaction residual substrate is detected with an avidin peroxidase reaction that can be read in a standard ELISA plate reader. As the substrate is covalently bound to the microtiter plate artifacts such as pH dependent displacement of the biotinylated substrate does not occur. The sensitivity permits rapid measurement of Hyaluronidase activity from cultured cells and biological samples with an inter assay variation of less than 10 .

The specific activity of hyaluronidase is expressed in turbidity reducing units TRU . One TRU is defined as the amount of hyaluronidase activity required to reduce the turbidity of an acidified solution of hyaluronic acid and is equivalent to the U.S.P. National Formulary NF XIII units NFU . The ELISA like enzyme assay used for purification is related to the TRU the NFU and U.S.P. unit through a standard curve of a sample of hyaluronidase e.g. USP standardized through the U.S.P. Therefore the enzyme activities determined by the ELISA like enzyme assay are actually relative TRU since enzyme activity is not actually measured using the turbidometric assay Dorfman et al. 1948 J. Biol. Chem. 172 367 .

Many Hyaluronidase assays have been based upon the measurement of the generation of new reducing N acetylamino groups Bonner and Cantey 13 746 752 1966 or loss of viscosity De Salegui et al. 121 548 554 1967 or turbidity Dorfman and Ott 172 367 1948 . With purified substrates all of these methods suffice for determination of the presence or absence of endoglucosamidic activity.

Substantially purified glycosaminoglycan substrates can also be used for in a Gel Shift Assay. Glycosaminoglycans are mixed with recombinant sHASEGP to test for endoglucosidase activity that results in a shift in substrate mobility within the gel. Chondroitin 4 and 6 sulfate dermatan sulfate heparan sulfate can be obtained from Sigma Chemical. Human umbilical cord Hyaluronan can be obtained from ICN. Each test substrate is diluted to 0.1 mg ml in a buffer range from pH 3.5 7.5. 10 ul samples of purified sHASEGP or conditioned media from sHASEGP expressing cells as well as are mixed with 90 ul of test substrate in desired buffer and incubated for 3 hours at 37 C. Following incubation samples are neutralized with sample buffer Tris EDTA PH 8.0 Bromophenol Blue and glycerol followed by electrophoresis. Glycosaminoglycans are detected by staining the gels in 0.5 Alcian Blue in 3 Glacial Acetic Acid overnight followed by destaining in 7 Glacial Acetic Acid. Degradation is determined by comparison substrate mobility in the presence and absence of enzyme.

Hyaluronidase activity can also be detected by substrate gel zymography Guentenhoner et al. 1992 Matrix 388 396 . In this assay a sample is applied to a SDS PAGE gel containing hyaluronic acid and the proteins in the sample separated by electrophoresis. The gel is then incubated in an enzyme assay buffer and subsequently stained to detect the hyaluronic acid in the gel. Hyaluronidase activity is visualized as a cleared zone in the substrate gel.

The sHASEGP polypeptide gene and or domains thereof can be obtained by methods well known in the art for DNA isolation. Any method known to those of skill in the art for identification of nucleic acids that encode desired genes can be used. Any method available in the art can be used to obtain a full length i.e. encompassing the entire coding region cDNA or genomic DNA clone encoding a sHASEGP polypeptide. For example the polymerase chain reaction PCR can be used to amplify a sequence that is expressed in normal tissues e.g. nucleic acids encoding a sHASEGP polypeptide SEQ. Nos 1 and 2 in a genomic or cDNA library. Oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to sequences at the 3 and 5 termini of the identified sequences can be used as primers to amplify by PCR sequences from a nucleic acid sample RNA or DNA generally a cDNA library from an appropriate source e. testis prostate breast .

PCR can be carried out e.g. by use of a Perkin Elmer Cetus thermal cycler and Taq polymerase Gene Amp . The DNA being amplified can include mRNA or cDNA or genomic DNA from any eukaryotic species. One can choose to synthesize several different degenerate primers for use in the PCR reactions.

It is also possible to vary the stringency of hybridization conditions used in priming the PCR reactions to amplify nucleic acid homologs e.g. to obtain sHASEGP polypeptide sequences from species other than humans or to obtain human sequences with homology to sHASEGP polypeptide by allowing for greater or lesser degrees of nucleotide sequence similarity between the known nucleotide sequence and the nucleic acid homolog being isolated. For cross species hybridization low stringency to moderate stringency conditions are used. For same species hybridization moderately stringent to highly stringent conditions are used. The conditions can be empirically determined.

After successful amplification of the nucleic acid containing all or a portion of the identified sHASEGP polypeptide sequence or of a nucleic acid encoding all or a portion of a sHASEGP polypeptide homolog that segment can be molecularly cloned and sequenced and used as a probe to isolate a complete cDNA or genomic clone. This in turn permits the determination of the gene s complete nucleotide sequence the analysis of its expression and the production of its protein product for functional analysis. Once the nucleotide sequence is determined an open reading frame encoding the sHASEGP polypeptide gene protein product can be determined by any method well known in the art for determining open reading frames for example using publicly available computer programs for nucleotide sequence analysis. Once an open reading frame is defined it is routine to determine the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the open reading frame. In this way the nucleotide sequences of the entire sHASEGP polypeptide genes as well as the amino acid sequences of sHASEGP polypeptide proteins and analogs can be identified.

Any eukaryotic cell potentially can serve as the nucleic acid source for the molecular cloning of the sHASEGP polypeptide gene. The nucleic acids can be isolated from vertebrate mammalian human porcine bovine feline avian equine canine as well as additional primate sources insects plants and other organisms. The DNA can be obtained by standard procedures known in the art from cloned DNA e.g. a DNA library by chemical synthesis by cDNA cloning or by the cloning of genomic DNA or fragments thereof purified from the desired cell see e.g. Sambrook et al. 1989 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. Kaiser K. and N. Murray The use of phage lambda replacement vectors in the construction of representative genomic DNA libraries. In DNA Cloning A Practical Approach Ed. D. Glover . 1985 MRL Press Ltd. Oxford U. K. 1985. Vol. 1 pp. 11 12 . Clones derived from genomic DNA can contain regulatory and intron DNA regions in addition to coding regions clones derived from cDNA will contain only exon sequences. For any source the gene is cloned into a suitable vector for propagation thereof.

In the molecular cloning of the gene from genomic DNA DNA fragments are generated some of which will encode the desired gene.

Alternatively one can use DNAse in the presence of manganese to fragment the DNA or the DNA can be physically sheared for example by sonication. The linear DNA fragments then can be separated according to size by standard techniques including but not limited to agarose and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and column chromatography.

Once the DNA fragments are generated identification of the specific DNA fragment containing the desired gene can be accomplished in a number of ways.

For example a portion of the sHASEGP polypeptide of any species gene e.g. a PCR amplification product obtained as described above or an oligonucleotide having a sequence of a portion of the known nucleotide sequence or its specific RNA or a fragment thereof be purified and labeled and the generated DNA fragments can be screened by nucleic acid hybridization to the labeled probe Benton and Davis Science 196 180 1977 Grunstein and Hogness Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72 3961 1975 . Those DNA fragments with substantial homology to the probe will hybridize. It is also possible to identify the appropriate fragment by restriction enzyme digestion s and comparison of fragment sizes with those expected according to a known restriction map if such is available or by DNA sequence analysis and comparison to the known nucleotide sequence of sHASEGP polypeptide. Further selection can be carried out on the basis of the properties of the gene. Alternatively the presence of the gene can be detected by assays based on the physical chemical or immunological properties of its expressed product. For example cDNA clones or DNA clones which hybrid select the proper mRNA can be selected which produce a protein that e.g. has similar or identical electrophoretic migration isoelectric focusing behavior proteolytic digestion maps antigenic properties Hyaluronidase activity. If an anti sHASEGP polypeptide antibody is available the protein can be identified by binding of labeled antibody to the putatively sHASEGP polypeptide synthesizing clones in an ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay type procedure.

Alternatives to isolating the sHASEGP polypeptide genomic DNA include but are not limited to chemically synthesizing the gene sequence from a known sequence or making cDNA to the mRNA that encodes the sHASEGP polypeptide.

For example RNA for cDNA cloning of the sHASEGP polypeptide gene can be isolated from cells expressing the protein. The identified and isolated nucleic acids then can be inserted into an appropriate cloning vector. A large number of vector host systems known in the art can be used. Possible vectors include but are not limited to plasmids or modified viruses but the vector system must be compatible with the host cell used. Such vectors include but are not limited to bacteriophages such as lambda derivatives or plasmids such as pBR322 or pUC plasmid derivatives or the Bluescript vector Stratagene La Jolla Calif. . The insertion into a cloning vector can for example be accomplished by ligating the DNA fragment into a cloning vector that has complementary cohesive termini.

If the complementary restriction sites used to fragment the DNA are not present in the cloning vector the ends of the DNA molecules can be enzymatically modified. Alternatively any site desired can be produced by ligating nucleotide sequences linkers onto the DNA termini these ligated linkers can include specific chemically synthesized oligonucleotides encoding restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. In an alternative method the cleaved vector and sHASEGP polypeptide gene can be modified by homopolymeric tailing.

Recombinant molecules can be introduced into host cells via transformation transfection infection electroporation calcium precipitation and other methods so that many copies of the gene sequence are generated.

In specific embodiments transformation of host cells with recombinant DNA molecules that incorporate the isolated sHASEGP polypeptide gene cDNA or synthesized DNA sequence enables generation of multiple copies of the gene.

Thus the gene can be obtained in large quantities by growing transformants isolating the recombinant DNA molecules from the transformants and when necessary retrieving the inserted gene from the isolated recombinant DNA.

For recombinant expression of one or more of the sHASEGP polypeptides the nucleic acid containing all or a portion of the nucleotide sequence encoding the sHASEGP polypeptide can be inserted into an appropriate expression vector i.e. a vector that contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted protein coding sequence. The necessary transcriptional and translational signals can also be supplied by the native promoter for sHASEGP genes and or their flanking regions.

Also provided are vectors that contain nucleic acid encoding the sHASEGPs that can be introduced into an expression system capable of producing a soluble neutral active sHASEGP.

Cells containing the vectors are also provided. The cells include eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and the vectors suitable for use therein.

Eukaryotic cells including dihydrofolate reductase deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells DG44 containing the vectors are provided. Suitable cells include yeast cells fungal cells plant cells insect cells and animal cells. The cells are used to produce a sHASEGP polypeptide or Hyaluronidase domain thereof by a growing the above described cells under conditions whereby the encoded sHASEGP polypeptide or Hyaluronidase domain of the sHASEGP polypeptide is expressed by the cell and then b recovering the expressed Hyaluronidase domain protein. In the exemplified embodiments the Hyaluronidase domain is secreted into the medium.

In one embodiment the vectors include a sequence of nucleotides that encodes a polypeptide that has Hyaluronidase activity and contains all or a portion of only the Hyaluronidase domain or multiple copies thereof of a sHASEGP protein are provided. Also provided are vectors that comprise a sequence of nucleotides that encodes the Hyaluronidase domain and additional portions of a sHASEGP protein up to and including a full length sHASEGP protein as well as multiple copies thereof are also provided. The vectors can be selected for expression of the sHASEGP protein or Hyaluronidase domain thereof in the cell or such that the sHASEGP protein is expressed as a secreted protein. Alternatively the vectors can include signals necessary for secretion of encoded proteins. When the Hyaluronidase domain is expressed the nucleic acid is linked to nucleic acid encoding a secretion signal such as the a mating factor signal sequence or a portion thereof or the native signal sequence.

In order to generate a soluble neutral active sHASEGP cells capable of introducing N linked glycosylation are required. In the preferred embodiment mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells deficient in dihydrofolate reductase such as DG44 are electroporated with a plasmid encoding a strong mammalian promoter such as CMV nucleic acid encoding a sHASEGP followed by an internal ribosomal entry site the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene and the SV40 polyadenylation sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 51. Such cells are then cultured in chemically defined medium in the absence of hypoxanthine and thymidine followed by further gene amplification with increasing concentrations of methotrexate.

A variety of host vector systems can be used to express the protein coding sequence. These include but are not limited to mammalian cell systems infected with virus e.g. vaccinia virus adenovirus etc. insect cell systems infected with virus e.g. baculovirus microorganisms such as yeast containing yeast vectors or bacteria transformed with bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA. The expression elements of vectors vary in their strengths and specificities. Depending on the host vector system used any one of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements can be used. Note that bacterial expression of sHASEGP DNA will not result in a catalytically active sHASEGP per se but when combined with proper glycosylation machinery can be artificially glycosylated as such.

Any methods known to those of skill in the art for the insertion of nucleic acid fragments into a vector can be used to construct expression vectors containing a chimeric gene containing appropriate transcriptional translational control signals and protein coding sequences. These methods can include in vitro recombinant DNA and synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinants genetic recombination . Expression of nucleic acid sequences encoding sHASEGP polypeptide or domains derivatives fragments or homologs thereof can be regulated by a second nucleic acid sequence so that the genes or fragments thereof are expressed in a host transformed with the recombinant DNA molecule s . For example expression of the proteins can be controlled by any promoter enhancer known in the art. In a specific embodiment the promoter is not native to the genes for sHASEGP polypeptide. Promoters which can be used include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter Bernoist and Chambon Nature 290 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al.

In a specific embodiment a vector is used that contains a promoter operably linked to nucleic acids encoding a sHASEGP polypeptide or a domain fragment derivative or homolog thereof one or more origins of replication and optionally one or more selectable markers e. G. an antibiotic resistance gene .

Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of a sHASEGP sequence. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. In cases where sHASEGP its initiation codon and upstream sequences are inserted into the appropriate expression vector no additional translational control signals may be needed. However in cases where only coding sequence or a portion thereof is inserted exogenous transcriptional control signals including the ATG initiation codon must be provided. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in the correct reading frame to ensure transcription of the entire insert. Exogenous transcriptional elements and initiation codons can be of various origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of enhancers appropriate to the cell system in use Scharf D et al 1994 Results Probl Cell Differ 20 125 62 Bittner et al 1987 Methods in Enzymol 153 516 544 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen for its ability to modulate the expression of the inserted sequences or to process the expressed protein in the desired fashion. Such modifications of the polypeptide include but are not limited to acetylation carboxylation glycosylation phosphorylation lipidation and acylation. Post translational processing which cleaves a prepro form of the protein may also be important for correct insertion folding and or function. Different host cells such as CHO DG44 DXB11 CHO K1 HeLa MDCK 293 WI38 etc have specific cellular machinery and characteristic mechanisms for such post translational activities and may be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the introduced foreign protein.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines that stably express sHASEGP may be transformed using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication or endogenous expression elements and a selectable marker gene. Following the introduction of the vector cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media before they are switched to selective media. The purpose of the selectable marker is to confer resistance to selection and its presence allows growth and recovery of cells that successfully express the introduced sequences. Resistant clumps of stably transformed cells can be proliferated using tissue culture techniques appropriate to the cell type.

Any number of selection systems may be used to recover transformed cell lines. These include but are not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler M et al 1977 Cell 11 223 32 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy I et al 1980 Cell 22 817 23 genes which can be employed in TK or APRT cells respectively. Also antimetabolite antibiotic or herbicide resistance can be used as the basis for selection for example DHFR which confers resistance to methotrexate Wigler M et al 1980 Proc Natl Acad Sci 77 3567 70 npt which confers resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin and G 418 Colbere Garapin F et al 1981 J Mol Biol 150 1 14 and als or pat which confer resistance to chlorsulfuron and phosphinotricin acetyltransferase respectively Murry supra . Additional selectable genes have been described for example trpB which allows cells to utilize indole in place of tryptophan or hisD which allows cells to utilize histinol in place of histidine Hartman S C and R C Mulligan 1988 Proc Natl Acad Sci 85 8047 51 . Recently the use of visible markers has gained popularity with such markers as anthocyanins beta glucuronidase and its substrate GUS and luciferase and its substrate luciferin being widely used not only to identify transformants but also to quantify the amount of transient or stable protein expression attributable to a specific vector system Rhodes C A et al 1995 Methods Mol Biol 55 121 131 .

Although the presence absence of marker gene expression suggests that the gene of interest is also present the presence and expression of an active sHASEGP should be confirmed. For example if the sHASEGP is inserted within a marker gene sequence recombinant cells containing sHASEGP can be identified by the absence of marker gene function. Alternatively a marker gene can be placed in tandem with a sHASEGP sequence under the control of a single promoter. Expression of the marker gene in response to induction or selection usually indicates expression of the tandem sHASEGP as well. Detection of a properly glycosylated neutral active sHASEGP can be determined by way of testing the conditioned media for sHASEGP enzyme activity under appropriate conditions.

Host cells transformed with a sHASEGP nucleotide sequence may be cultured under conditions suitable for the expression and recovery of the encoded protein from cell culture. The protein produced by a recombinant cell is preferably secreted but may be contained intracellularly depending on the sequence and or the vector used. As will be understood by those of skill in the art expression vectors containing sHASEGP can be designed with signal sequences that facilitate direct secretion of sHASEGP through a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell membrane. Other recombinant constructions may join sHASEGP to nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide domain which will facilitate purification of soluble proteins Kroll D J et al 1993 DNA Cell Biol 12 441 53 cf discussion of vectors infra containing fusion proteins .

sHASEGP may also be expressed as a recombinant protein with one or more additional polypeptide domains added to facilitate protein purification. Such purification facilitating domains include but are not limited to metal chelating peptides such as histidine tryptophan modules that allow purification on immobilized metals protein A domains that allow purification on immobilized immunoglobulin and the domain utilized in the FLAGS extension affinity purification system Immunex Corp Seattle Wash. . The inclusion of a cleavable linker sequences such as Factor XA or enterokinase Invitrogen San Diego Calif. between the purification domain and sHASEGP is useful to facilitate purification. One such expression vector provides for expression of a fusion protein compromising a sHASEGP and contains nucleic acid encoding 6 histidine residues followed by thioredoxin and an enterokinase cleavage site. The histidine residues facilitate purification on IMIAC immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography as described in Porath et al 1992 Protein Expression and Purification 3 263 281 while the enterokinase cleavage site provides a means for purifying the chemokine from the fusion protein.

In addition to recombinant production fragments of sHASEGP may be produced by direct peptide synthesis using solid phase techniques see e.g. Stewart et al 1969 Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis W H Freeman Co San Francisco Merrifield J 1963 J Am Chem Soc 85 2149 2154 . In vitro protein synthesis may be performed using manual techniques or by automation. Automated synthesis may be achieved for example using Applied Biosystems 431A Peptide Synthesizer Perkin Elmer Foster City Calif. in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Various fragments of sHASEGP may be chemically synthesized separately and combined using chemical methods to produce the full length molecule.

Expression vectors containing the coding sequences or portions thereof of a sHASEGP polypeptide is made for example by subcloning the coding portions into the EcoRI restriction site of each of the three PGEX vectors glutathione S transferase expression vectors Smith and Johnson Gene 7 31 40 1988 . This allows for the expression of products in the correct reading frame. Exemplary vectors and systems for expression of the Hyaluronidase domains of the sHASEGP polypeptides include the well known vectors available for example from Invitrogen San Diego Calif. particularly those designed for secretion of the encoded proteins. The protein can also be expressed cytoplasmically such as in the inclusion bodies. One exemplary vector is described in the examples.

Plasmids for transformation of cells include for example the pET expression vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 952 496 available from Novagen Madison Wis. see also literature published by Novagen describing the system .

Such plasmids include pET 11a which contains the T71 ac promoter T7 terminator the inducible lac operator and the lac repressor gene pET 12A C which contains the T7 promoter T7 terminator and the OMPT secretion signal and pET 15B and PET19B Novagen Madison Wi which contain a His Tag leader sequence for use in purification with a His column and a thrombin cleavage site that permits cleavage following purification over the column the T7 lac promoter region and the T7 terminator.

The vectors are introduced into host cells such as cells and bacterial cells such as and the proteins expressed therein. Exemplary strains include for example GS115. Exemplary bacterial hosts contain chromosomal copies of DNA encoding T7 RNA polymerase operably linked to an inducible promoter such as the LACUV promoter see U.S. Pat. No. 4 952 496 . Such hosts include but are not limited to the lysogenic strain BL21 DE3 .

The sHASEGP domains derivatives and analogs can be produced by various methods known in the art. For example once a recombinant cell expressing a sHASEGP polypeptide or a domain fragment or derivative thereof is identified the individual gene product can be isolated and analyzed. This is achieved by assays based on the physical and or functional properties of the protein including but not limited to radioactive labeling of the product followed by analysis by gel electrophoresis immunoassay cross linking to marker labeled product and assays of proteolytic activity.

The sHASEGP polypeptides can be isolated and purified by standard methods known in the art either from natural sources or recombinant host cells expressing the complexes or proteins including but not restricted to column chromatography E. g. ion exchange affinity gel exclusion reversed phase high pressure and fast protein liquid differential centrifugation differential solubility or by any other standard technique used for the purification of proteins.

In one embodiment a sHASEGP can be purified to homogeneity from the chemically defined conditioned media of HZ24 transfected and methotrexate amplified DG44 cells by 1 tangential flow diafiltration 2 binding and elution from anion exchange chromatography 3 flow through phenyl sepharose chromatography 4 binding and elution from phenylboronate chromatography and 4 binding and elution with hydroxyapatite chromatography.

Alternatively once a sHASEGP polypeptide or its domain or derivative is identified the amino acid sequence of the protein can be deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the gene that encodes it. As a result the protein or its domain or derivative can be synthesized by standard chemical methods known in the art e. G. see Hunkapiller et al. Nature 310 105 111 1984 followed by glycosylation in vitro.

Manipulations of sHASEGP polypeptide sequences can be made at the protein level. Also contemplated herein are sHASEGP polypeptide proteins domains thereof derivatives or analogs or fragments thereof which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation pegylation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand.

Any of numerous chemical modifications can be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 NABH4 acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin and other such agents.

In addition domains analogs and derivatives of a sHASEGP polypeptide can be chemically synthesized. For example a peptide corresponding to a portion of a sHASEGP polypeptide which includes the desired domain or which mediates the desired activity in vitro can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer.

Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the sHASEGP polypeptide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to the D isomers of the common amino acids a amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 aminobutyric acid E ABU e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionoic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as methyl amino acids ca methyl amino acids na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be d dextrorotary or 1 levorotary .

In cases where natural products are suspected of being mutant or are isolated from new species the amino acid sequence of the sHASEGP polypeptide isolated from the natural source as well as those expressed in vitro or from synthesized expression vectors in vivo or in vitro can be determined from analysis of the DNA sequence or alternatively by direct sequencing of the isolated protein. Such analysis can be performed by manual sequencing or through use of an automated amino acid sequenator.

Modifications A variety of modifications of the sHASEGP polypeptides and domains are contemplated herein. A sHASEGP encoding nucleic acid molecule can be modified by any of numerous strategies known in the art Sambrook ET A . 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. . The sequences can be cleaved at appropriate sites with restriction endonuclease s followed by further enzymatic modification if desired isolated and ligated in vitro. In the production of the gene encoding a domain derivative or analog of sHASEGP care should be taken to ensure that the modified gene retains the original translational reading frame uninterrupted by translational stop signals in the gene region where the desired activity is encoded.

Additionally the sHASEGP encoding nucleic acid molecules can be mutated in vitro or in vivo to create and or destroy translation initiation and or termination sequences or to create variations in coding regions and or form new restriction endonuclease sites or destroy pre existing ones to facilitate further in vitro modification. Also as described herein muteins with primary sequence alterations such as replacements of Cys residues and elimination or addition of glycosylation sites are contemplated the sHASEGP of SEQ ID NO 1 has seven potential glycosylation sites. Such mutations can be effected by any technique for mutagenesis known in the art including but not limited to chemical mutagenesis and in vitro site directed mutagenesis Hutchinson et al. j. Biol. Chem. 253 6551 6558 1978 use of TABE Linkers Pharmacia . In one embodiment for example a sHASEGP polypeptide or domain thereof is modified to include a fluorescent label. In other specific embodiments the sHASEGP polypeptide is modified to have a heterobifunctional reagent such heterobifunctional reagents can be used to crosslink the members of the complex.

In addition domains analogs and derivatives of a sHASEGP can be chemically synthesized. For example a peptide corresponding to a portion of a sHASEGP which includes the desired domain or which mediates the desired activity in vitro can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the sHASEGP sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to the D isomers of the common amino acids a amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 aminobutyric acid S ABU e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionoic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as ti methyl amino acids a methyl amino acids na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be d dextrorotary or 1 levorotary .

Properly N glycosylated human sHASEGP is required to generate a catalytically stable protein. N linked glycosylation of sHASEGP can be achieved through various techniques. Glycosylation of sHASEGP can be achieved by introducing nucleic acids encoding sHASEGP into cells of eukaryotic origin capable of proper N linked glycosylation or alternatively by contacting sHASEGP polypeptide with cell free extracts or purified enzymes capable of introducing the desired N linked sugar moieties.

Eukaryotic cell expression systems vary in the extent and type of glycosylation they introduce into an ectopically expressed polypeptide. CHO cells are for example highly efficient at the introduction of N linked glycosylation into an active sHASEGP polypeptide.

Additional eukaryotic expression systems that introduce N linked glycosylation to generate a functional sHASEGP product can be tested by introducing a human sHASEGP expression plasmid into said cells and testing for neutral activity. Proper N linked glycosylation can be determined by way of FACE analysis of PNGASE released oligosaccharides. Glycosylation profiles of catalytically active sHASEGPs are further provided herein. Verification of glycosylation can also be made by treatment of sHASEGP from said cells with PNGASE F or by growth of such cells in tunicamycin following introduction of sHASEGP encoding nucleic acids.

N glycosylation of sHASEGP polypeptide in vitro. The sHASEGP polypeptide can be N glycosylated by contact of sHASEGP polypeptide with cell free extracts containing activity capable of transferring N linked sugars to sHASEGP polypeptide such as canine microsomal membranes or through coupled transcription and translation as is commercially available Promega Madison Wis. .

Oligosaccharides are considered to have a reducing end and a non reducing end whether or not the saccharide at the reducing end is in fact a reducing sugar. In accordance with accepted nomenclature oligosaccharides are depicted herein with the non reducing end on the left and the reducing end on the right. All oligosaccharides described herein are described with the name or abbreviation for the non reducing saccharide e.g. Gal followed by the configuration of the glycosidic bond .alpha. or. beta. the ring bond the ring position of the reducing saccharide involved in the bond and then the name or abbreviation of the reducing saccharide e.g. GlcNAc . The linkage between two sugars may be expressed for example as 2 3 2.fw darw.3 or 2 3 . Each saccharide is a pyranose.

As used herein N linked sugar moiety refers to an oligosaccharide attached to a sHASEGP via the amide nitrogen of Asn residues. N linked oligosaccharides fall into several major types oligomannose complex hybrid sulfated all of which have Man 3 GlcNAc GlcNAc cores attached via the amide nitrogen of Asn residues that fall within Asn Xaa Thr Ser sequences where Xaa is not Pro . N linked sites are often indirectly assigned by the appearance of a blank cycle during sequencing. Positive identification can be made after release of the oligosaccharide by PNGase F which converts the glycosylated Asn to Asp. After PNGase F release N linked oligosaccharides can be purified using Bio Gel P 6 chromatography with the oligosaccharide pool subjected to preparative high pH anion exchange chromatography HPAEC Townsend et al. 1989 Anal. Biochem. 182 1 8 . Certain oligosaccharide isomers can be resolved using HPAEC. Fucose residues will shift elution positions earlier in the HPAEC chromatogram while additional sialic acid residues will increase the retention time. Concurrent treatment of glycoproteins whose oligosaccharide structures are known e.g. bovine fetuin a 1 acid glycoprotein ovalbumin RNAse B transferrin can facilitate assignment of the oligosaccharide peaks. The collected oligosaccharides can be characterized by a combination of compositional and methylation linkage analyses Waeghe et al. 1983 Carbohydr Res. 123 281 304. with anomeric configurations assigned by NMR spectroscopy Van Halbeek 1993 in Methods Enzymol 230 .

Alternatively oligosaccharides can be identified by fluorescence assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis FACE Callewaert et al. 2001 Glycobiology 11 275 281.

Determining whether a protein is in fact glycosylated is the initial step in glycoprotein glycan analysis. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS PAGE has become the method of choice as the final step prior to protein sequencing. Glycosylated proteins often migrate as diffuse bands by SDS PAGE. A marked decrease in bandwidth and change in migration position after treatment with peptide N4 N acetyl D glucosaminyl asparagine amidase PNGase F is considered diagnostic of N linked glycosylation. If the other types of glycosylation are predominant other approaches must be used. Lectin blotting methods provide an approach that is independent of the class of glycosylation N versus O . Lectins carbohydrate binding proteins from various plant tissues have both high affinity and narrow specificity for a wide range of defined sugar epitopes found on glycoprotein glycans Cummings R. D. 1994 Methods in Enzymol. 230 66 86. . When conjugated with biotin or digoxigenin they can be easily identified on membrane blots through a colorimetric reaction utilizing avidin or anti digoxigenin antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase Haselbeck et al. 1993 Methods in Mol. Biol. 14 161 173. analogous to secondary antibody alkaline phosphatase reactions employed in Western blotting. Screening with a panel of lectins with well defined specificity can provide considerable information about a glycoprotein s carbohydrate complement. Importantly the color development amplification is sufficiently high that 10 50 ng of a glycoprotein can easily be seen on a membrane blot of an SDS PAGE. Although lectins exhibit very high affinity for their cognate ligands some do reveal significant avidity for structurally related epitopes. Thus it is important to carefully note the possibility of cross reactivity when choosing a panel of lectins and apply those with the highest probability of individually distinguishing complex hybrid and high mannose N linked glycans from O linked structures.

Monosaccharide analysis can also be used to determine whether sHASEGP is glycosylated and as in the case of lectin analysis provides additional information on structural features. Quantitative monosaccharide composition analysis i identifies glycosylated proteins ii gives the molar ratio of individual sugars to protein iii suggests in some cases the presence of oligosaccharide classes iv is the first step in designing a structural elucidation strategy and v provides a measure of production consistency for recombinant glycoprotein therapeutics. In recent years high pH anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection HPAEC PAD has been extensively used to determine monosaccharide composition Townsend et al. 1995 in Carbohydrate Analysis High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis Z. El Rassi ed. . pp. 181 209. . More recently fluorophore based labeling methods have been introduced and many are available in kit form. A distinct advantage of fluorescent methods is an increase in sensitivity 50 fold . One potential disadvantage is that different monosaccharides may demonstrate different selectivity for the fluorophore during the coupling reaction either in the hydrolysate or in the external standard mixture. However the increase in sensitivity and the ability to identify which monosaccharides are present from a small portion of the total amount of available glycoprotein as well as the potential for greater sensitivity using laser induced fluorescence makes this approach attractive.

Monosaccharide composition analysis of small amounts of sHASEGP is best performed on PVDF PSQ membranes after either electroblotting Weitzhandler et al. 1993 J. Biol. Chem. 268 5121 5130. or if smaller aliquots are to be analyzed on dot blots. PVDF is an ideal matrix for carbohydrate analysis since neither mono or oligosaccharides bind to the membrane once released by either acid or enzymatic hydrolysis.

FACE analysis is an efficient means of detecting glycosylation profiles of sHASEGPs. FACE N Linked Oligosaccharide Profiling Prozyme with 30 oligosaccharide gels is one such mechanism. Oligosaccharides cleaved from 100 g of glycoproteins by enzymatic digestion with N Glycanase a.k.a PNGase labeled using the fluorophore ANTS and separated by electrophoresis can be used for detection of sHASEGP glycosylation profiles. The relative positions of the oligosaccharide bands are determined by running the sample and dilutions of the sample alongside an oligosaccharide standard ladder which designated the migration distance in Degree of Polymerization DP units.

Several types of assays are exemplified and described herein. It is understood that the Hyaluronidase domains can be used in other assays. It is shown here however that the Hyaluronidase domains exhibit catalytic activity.

The sHASEGP full length zymogens activated enzymes and Hyaluronidase domains are contemplated for use in any screening assay known to those of skill in the art including those provided herein. Hence the following description if directed to Hyaluronidase assays is intended to apply to use of a single chain Hyaluronidase domain or a catalytically active portion thereof of any Hyaluronidase including a sHASEGP. Other assays such as binding assays are provided herein particularly for use with a sHASEGP including any variants such as splice variants thereof.

1. Catalytic Assays for identification of agents that modulate the Hyaluronidase activity of a sHASEGP protein. Methods for identifying a modulator of the catalytic activity of a sHASEGP particularly a single chain Hyaluronidase domain or catalytically active portion thereof are provided herein. The methods can be practiced by contacting the sHASEGP a full length zymogen or activated form and particularly a single chain domain thereof with a substrate of the sHASEGP in the presence of a test substance and detecting the proteolysis of the substrate whereby the activity of the sHASEGP is assessed and comparing the activity to a control. For example a control can be the activity of the sHASEGP assessed by contacting a sHASEGP including a full length zymogen or activated form and particularly a single chain domain thereof particularly a single chain domain thereof with a substrate of the sHASEGP and detecting the proteolysis of the substrate whereby the activity of the sHASEGP is assessed. The results in the presence and absence of the test compounds are compared. A difference in the activity indicates that the test substance modulates the activity of the sHASEGP. Activators of sHASEGP activation cleavage are also contemplated such assays are discussed below.

In one embodiment a plurality of the test substances are screened simultaneously in the above screening method. In another embodiment the sHASEGP is isolated from a target cell as a means for then identifying agents that are potentially specific for the target cell.

In another embodiment a test substance is a therapeutic compound and whereby a difference of the sHASEGP activity measured in the presence and in the absence of the test substance indicates that the target cell responds to the therapeutic compound.

One method includes the steps of a contacting the sHASEGP polypeptide or Hyaluronidase domain thereof with one or a plurality of test compounds under conditions conducive to interaction between the ligand and the compounds and b identifying one or more compounds in the plurality that specifically binds to the ligand.

Another method provided herein includes the steps of a contacting a sHASEGP polypeptide or Hyaluronidase domain thereof with a substrate of the sHASEGP polypeptide and detecting the degradation of substrate whereby the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide is assessed b contacting the sHASEGP polypeptide with a substrate of the sHASEGP polypeptide in the presence of a test substance and detecting the degradation of the substrate whereby the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide is assessed and c comparing the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide assessed in steps a and b whereby the activity measured in step a differs from the activity measured in step b indicates that the test substance modulates the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide.

In another embodiment a plurality of the test substances is screened simultaneously. In comparing the activity of a sHASEGP polypeptide in the presence and absence of a test substance to assess whether the test substance is a modulator of the sHASEGP polypeptide it is unnecessary to assay the activity in parallel although such parallel measurement is typical. It is possible to measure the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide at one time point and compare the measured activity to a historical value of the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide.

For instance one can measure the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide in the presence of a test substance and compare with historical value of the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide measured previously in the absence of the test substance and vice versa. This can be accomplished for example by providing the activity of the sHASEGP polypeptide on an insert or pamphlet provided with a kit for conducting the assay.

Methods for selecting substrates for a particular sHASEGP are described in the EXAMPLES and particular Hyaluronidase assays are exemplified.

Combinations and kits containing the combinations optionally including instructions for performing the assays are provided. The combinations include a sHASEGP polypeptide and a substrate of the sHASEGP polypeptide to be assayed and optionally reagents for detecting proteolysis of the substrate. The substrates which can be chromogenic or fluorogenic molecules including glycosaminoglycans subject to proteolysis by a particular sHASEGP polypeptide can be identified empirically by testing the ability of the sHASEGP polypeptide to cleave the test substrate. Substrates that are cleaved most effectively i.e. at the lowest concentrations and or fastest rate or under desirable conditions are identified.

Additionally provided herein is a kit containing the above described combination. The kit optionally includes instructions for identifying a modulator of the activity of a sHASEGP polypeptide. Any sHASEGP polypeptide is contemplated as target for identifying modulators of the activity thereof.

2. Binding assays. Also provided herein are methods for identification and isolation of agents particularly compounds that bind to sHASEGPs. The assays are designed to identify agents that bind to the isolated Hyaluronidase domain or a protein other than a sHASEGP polypeptide that contains the Hyaluronidase domain of a sHASEGP polypeptide and to the activated form including the activated form derived from the full length zymogen or from an extended Hyaluronidase domain. The identified compounds are candidates or leads for identification of compounds for treatments of disorders and diseases involving aberrant Hyaluronidase activity. The sHASEGP polypeptides used in the methods include any sHASEGP polypeptide as defined herein including the sHASEGP single chain Hyaluronidase domain or proteolytically active portion thereof.

A variety of methods are provided herein. These methods can be performed in solution or in solid phase reactions in which the sHASEGP polypeptide s or Hyaluronidase domain s thereof are linked either directly or indirectly via a linker to a solid support. Screening assays are described in the Examples and these assays have been used to identify candidate compounds.

Methods for identifying an agent such as a compound that specifically binds to a sHASEGP single chain Hyaluronidase domain a full length activated sHASEGP or two chain Hyaluronidase domain thereof are provided herein. The method can be practiced by a contacting the sHASEGP with one or a plurality of test agents under conditions conducive to binding between the sHASEGP and an agent and b identifying one or more agents within the plurality that specifically binds to the sHASEGP.

For example in practicing such methods the sHASEGP polypeptide is mixed with a potential binding partner or an extract or fraction of a cell under conditions that allow the association of potential binding partners with the polypeptide. After mixing peptides polypeptides proteins or other molecules that have become associated with a sHASEGP are separated from the mixture. The binding partner that bound to the sHASEGP can then be removed and further analyzed. To identify and isolate a binding partner the entire protein for instance the entire disclosed protein of SEQ ID NO 1 can be used. Alternatively a fragment of the protein can be used.

A variety of methods can be used to obtain cell extracts or body fluids such as blood serum urine sweat synovial fluid CSF and other such fluids.

For example cells can be disrupted using either physical or chemical disruption methods. Examples of physical disruption methods include but are not limited to sonication and mechanical shearing. Examples of chemical lysis methods include but are not limited to detergent lysis and enzyme lysis. A skilled artisan can readily adapt methods for preparing cellular extracts in order to obtain extracts for use in the present methods.

Once an extract of a cell is prepared the extract is mixed with the sHASEGP under conditions in which association of the protein with the binding partner can occur. A variety of conditions can be used including conditions that resemble conditions found in the cytoplasm of a human cell or in a body fluid such as blood. Features such as osmolarity pH temperature and the concentration of cellular extract used can be varied to optimize the association of the protein with the binding partner. Similarly methods for isolation of molecules of interest from body fluids are known.

After mixing under appropriate conditions the bound complex is separated from the mixture. A variety of techniques can be used to separate the mixture. For example antibodies specific to a sHASEGP can be used to immunoprecipitate the binding partner complex. Alternatively standard chemical separation techniques such as chromatography and density sediment centrifugation can be used.

After removing the non associated cellular constituents in the extract the binding partner can be dissociated from the complex using conventional methods. For example dissociation can be accomplished by altering the salt concentration or pH of the mixture.

To aid in separating associated binding partner pairs from the mixed extract the sHASEGP can be immobilized on a solid support. For example the protein can be attached to a nitrocellulose matrix or acrylic beads. Attachment of the protein or a fragment thereof to a solid support aids in separating peptide binding partner pairs from other constituents found in the extract. The identified binding partners can be either a single protein or a complex made up of two or more proteins.

Alternatively the nucleic acid molecules encoding the single chain Hyaluronidases can be used in a yeast two hybrid system. The yeast two hybrid system has been used to identify other protein partner pairs and can readily be adapted to employ the nucleic acid molecules herein described.

Another in vitro binding assay particularly for a sHASEGP uses a mixture of a polypeptide that contains at least the catalytic domain of one of these proteins and one or more candidate binding targets or substrates. After incubating the mixture under appropriate conditions the ability of the sHASEGP or a polypeptide fragment thereof containing the catalytic domain to bind to or interact with the candidate substrate is assessed. For cell free binding assays one of the components includes or is coupled to a detectable label. The label can provide for direct detection such as radioactivity luminescence optical or electron density etc. or indirect detection such as an epitope tag an enzyme etc. A variety of methods can be employed to detect the label depending on the nature of the label and other assay components. For example the label can be detected bound to the solid substrate or a portion of the bound complex containing the label can be separated from the solid substrate and the label thereafter detected.

3. Detection of signal transduction sHASEGP which is a membrane anchored protein can be involved directly or indirectly in signal transduction directly as a cell surface receptor or indirectly by activating proteins such as pro growth factors that can initiate signal transduction.

In addition secreted sHASEGP such as the soluble domain of sHASEGP as described in SEQ ID NO 4 can be involved in signal transduction either directly by binding to or interacting with a cell surface receptor or indirectly by activating proteins such as pro growth factors that can initiate signal transduction. Assays for assessing signal transduction are well known to those of skill in the art and can be adapted for use with the sHASEGP polypeptide.

Assays for identifying agents that affect or alter signal transduction mediated directly or indirectly such as via activation of a pro growth factor by a sHASEGP particularly the full length or a sufficient portion to anchor the extracellular domain or a functional portion thereof of a sHASEGP on the surface of a cell are provided. Such assays include for example transcription based assays in which modulation of a transduced signal is assessed by detecting an effect on an expression from a reporter gene see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 128 .

4. Methods for Identifying Agents that Modulate the Expression a Nucleic Acid encoding a sHASEGP. Another embodiment provides methods for identifying agents that modulate the expression of a nucleic acid encoding a sHASEGP. Such assays use any available means of monitoring for changes in the expression level of the nucleic acids encoding a sHASEGP.

Assay formats can be used to monitor the ability of the agent to modulate the expression of a nucleic acid encoding a sHASEGP. For instance mRNA expression can be monitored directly by hybridization to the nucleic acids. Also enzyme assays as described can be used to detect agents that modulate the expression of sHASEGP.

Cell lines are exposed to the agent to be tested under appropriate conditions and time and total RNA or mRNA is isolated by standard procedures see e.g. Sambrook et al 1989 MOLECULAR CLONING A LABORATORY MANUAL 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press . Probes to detect differences in RNA expression levels between cells exposed to the agent and control cells can be prepared from the nucleic acids. It is typical but not necessary to design probes which hybridize only with target nucleic acids under conditions of high stringency. Only highly complementary nucleic acid hybrids form under conditions of high stringency. Accordingly the stringency of the assay conditions determines the amount of complementarity that should exist between two nucleic acid strands in order to form a hybrid. Stringency should be chosen to maximize the difference in stability between the probe target hybrid and potential probe non target hybrids.

For example N and C terminal fragments of the sHASEGP can be expressed in bacteria and used to search for proteins that bind to these fragments. Fusion proteins such as His tag or GST fusion to the N or C terminal regions of the sHASEGP can be prepared for use as a substrate. These fusion proteins can be coupled to for example Glutathione Sepharose beads and then probed with cell lysates or body fluids. Prior to lysis the cells or body fluids can be treated with a candidate agent that can modulate a sHASEGP or proteins that interact with domains thereon. Lysate proteins binding to the fusion proteins can be resolved by SDS PAGE isolated and identified by protein sequencing or mass spectroscopy as is known in the art.

Antibody probes are prepared by immunizing suitable mammalian hosts in appropriate immunization protocols using the peptides polypeptides or proteins if they are of sufficient length e.g. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 20 25 30 35 40 or more consecutive amino acids the sHASEGP polypeptide or if required to enhance immunogenicity conjugated to suitable carriers. Methods for preparing immunogenic conjugates with carriers such as bovine serum albumin BSA keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLH or other carrier proteins are well known in the art. In some circumstances direct conjugation using for example carbodiimide reagents can be effective in other instances linking reagents such as those supplied by Pierce Chemical Co. Rockford Ill. can be desirable to provide accessibility to the hapten. Hapten peptides can be extended at either the amino or carboxy terminus with a Cys residue or interspersed with cysteine residues for example to facilitate linking to a carrier.

Administration of the immunogens is conducted generally by injection over a suitable time period and with use of suitable adjuvants as is generally understood in the art. During the immunization schedule titers of antibodies are taken to determine adequacy of antibody formation.

Anti peptide antibodies can be generated using synthetic peptides corresponding to for example the carboxy terminal amino acids of the sHASEGP.

Synthetic peptides can be as small as 1 3 amino acids in length generally at least 4 or more amino acid residues long. The peptides can be coupled to KLH using standard methods and can be immunized into animals such as rabbits or ungulates. Polyclonal antibodies can then be purified for example using Actigel beads containing the covalently bound peptide.

While the polyclonal antisera produced in this way can be satisfactory for some applications for pharmaceutical compositions use of monoclonal preparations are generally used. Immortalized cell lines which secrete the desired monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using the standard method of Kohler et al. Nature 256 495 7 1975 or modifications which effect immortalization of lymphocytes or spleen cells as is generally known. The immortalized cell lines secreting the desired antibodies are screened by immunoassay in which the antigen is the peptide hapten polypeptide or protein.

When the appropriate immortalized cell culture secreting the desired antibody is identified the cells can be cultured either in vitro or by production in vivo via ascites fluid. Of particular interest are monoclonal antibodies that recognize the catalytic domain or activation cleavage site region of a sHASEGP.

The antibodies or fragments can also be produced. Regions that bind specifically to the desired regions of receptor also can be produced in the context of chimeras with multiple species origin.

Agents that are assayed in the above method can be randomly selected or rationally selected or designed.

The agents can be as examples peptides small molecules and carbohydrates. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents.

The peptide agents can be prepared using standard solid phase or solution phase peptide synthesis methods as is known in the art. In addition the DNA encoding these peptides can be synthesized using commercially available oligonucleotide synthesis instrumentation and produced recombinantly using standard recombinant production systems. The production using solid phase peptide synthesis is necessitated if non gene encoded amino acids are to be included.

sHASEGPs identified by the methods herein are used for treating or preventing abnormal accumulations of sHASEGP substrates in an animal particularly a mammal including a human. In one embodiment the method includes administering to a mammal an effective amount of a sHASEGP glycoprotein whereby the disease or disorder is treated or prevented.

In another embodiment a sHASEGP inhibitor can be used in the treatment of an excess amount of neutral hyaluronidase activity. The mammal treated can be a human. The inhibitors provided herein are those identified by the screening assays. In addition antibodies and antisense nucleic acids or double stranded RNA dsRNA such as RNAi are contemplated.

1. Antisense treatment In a specific embodiment as described hereinabove sHASEGP polypeptide function is reduced or inhibited by sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acids to treat or prevent excessive chondroitinase activity. The therapeutic or prophylactic use of nucleic acids of at least six nucleotides generally up to about 150 nucleotides that are antisense to a gene or cDNA encoding sHASEGP polypeptide or a portion thereof is provided. A sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acid as used herein refers to a nucleic acid capable of hybridizing to a portion of a sHASEGP polypeptide RNA generally mRNA by virtue of some sequence complementarity and generally under high stringency conditions. The antisense nucleic acid can be complementary to a coding and or noncoding region of a sHASEGP polypeptide mRNA. Such antisense nucleic acids have utility as therapeutics that reduce or inhibit sHASEGP polypeptide function and can be used in the treatment or prevention of disorders as described supra.

The sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acids are of at least six nucleotides and are generally oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 150 nucleotides including 6 to 50 nucleotides . The antisense molecule can be complementary to all or a portion of the Hyaluronidase domain. For example the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides at least 15 nucleotides preferably at least 20 40 80 to at least 100 nucleotides or at least 125 nucleotides. The oligonucleotides can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof single stranded or double stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety sugar moiety or phosphate backbone. The oligonucleotide can include other appending groups such as peptides or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane see e.g. Letsinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 6553 6556 1989 Lemaitre et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84 648 652 1987 PCT Publication No. WO 88 09810 published Dec. 15 1988 or blood brain barrier see e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 89 10134 published Apr. 25 1988 hybridization triggered cleavage agents see e.g. Krol et al. BioTechniques 6 958 976 1988 or intercalating agents see e.g. Zon. Pharm. Res. 5 539 549 1988 .

The sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acid generally is an oligo nucleotide typically single stranded DNA or RNA or an analog thereof or mixtures thereof. For example the oligonucleotide includes a sequence antisense to a portion of a nucleic acid that encodes a human sHASEGP polypeptide. The oligonucleotide can be modified at any position on its structure with substituents generally known in the art.

The sHASEGP polypeptide antisense oligonucleotide can include at least one modified base moiety which is selected from the group including but not limited to 5 fluorouracil 5 bromouracil 5 chlorouracil 5 iodouracil hypoxanthine xanthine 4 acetylcytosine 5 carboxyhydroxylmethyl uracil 5 carboxymethylaminomethyl 2 thiouridine 5 carboxymethylaminomethyluracil dihydrouracil beta D galactosylqueosine inosine N6 isopentenyladenine 1 methylguanine 1 methylinosine 2 2 dimethylguanine 2 methyladenine 2 methylguanine 3 methylcytosine 5 methylcytosine N6 adenine 7 methylguanine 5 methylaminomethyluracil 5 methoxyaminomethyl 2 thiouracil beta D mannosylqueosine 5 apos methoxycarboxymethyluracil 5 methoxyuracil 2 methylthio N6 isopentenyladenine uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v wybutoxosine pseudouracil queosine 2 thiocytosine 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 2 thiouracil 4 thiouracil 5 methyluracil uracil 5 oxyacetic acid methylester uracil 5 oxyacetic acid v 5 methyl 2 thiouracil 3 3 amino 3 n 2 carboxypropyl uracil ACP3 w and 2 6 diaminopurine.

In another embodiment the oligonucleotide includes at least one modified sugar moiety selected from the group including but not limited to arabinose 2 fluoroarabinose xylulose and hexose. The oligonucleotide can include at least one modified phosphate backbone selected from a phosphorothioate a phosphorodithioate a phosphoramidothioate a phosphoramidate a phosphordiamidate a methylphosphonate an alkyl phosphotriester and a formacetal or analog thereof.

The oligonucleotide can be an a anomeric oligonucleotide. An a anomeric oligonucleotide forms specific double stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which the strands run parallel to each other Gautier et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6625 6641 1987 .

The oligonucleotide can be conjugated to another molecule such as but are not limited to a peptide hybridization triggered cross linking agent transport agent or a hybridization triggered cleavage agent. The oligonucleotides can be synthesized by standard methods known in the art e.g. by use of an automated DNA synthesizer such as are commercially available from Biosearch Applied Biosystems etc. . As examples phosphorothioate oligonucleotides can be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 16 3209 1988 methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports Sarin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 7448 7451 1988 etc. In a specific embodiment the sHASEGP polypeptide antisense oligonucleotide includes catalytic RNA or a ribozyme see e.g. PCT International Publication WO 90 11364 published Oct. 4 1990 Sarver et al. Science 247 1222 1225 1990 . In another embodiment the oligonucleotide is a 2 O methylribonucleotide Inoue et al. Nucl. Acids Res. 15 6131 6148 1987 or a chimeric RNA DNA analogue Inoue et al. FEBS Lett. 215 327 330 1987 .

In an alternative embodiment the sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acid is produced intracellularly by transcription from an exogenous sequence.

For example a vector can be introduced in vivo such that it is taken up by a cell within which cell the vector or a portion thereof is transcribed producing an antisense nucleic acid RNA . Such a vector would contain a sequence encoding the sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acid. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid viral or others known in the art used for replication and expression in mammalian cells. Expression of the sequence encoding the sHASEGP polypeptide antisense RNA can be by any promoter known in the art to act in mammalian including human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to the SV40 early promoter region Bernoist and Chambon Nature 290 304 310 1981 the promoter contained in the 3 long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus Yamamoto et al. Cell 22 787 797 1980 the herpes thymidine kinase promoter Wagner et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 1441 1445 1981 the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene Brinster et al. Nature 296 39 42 1982 etc.

The antisense nucleic acids include sequence complementary to at least a portion of an RNA transcript of a sHASEGP polypeptide gene including a human sHASEGP polypeptide gene. Absolute complementarity is not required. The amount of sHASEGP polypeptide antisense nucleic acid that is effective in the treatment or prevention of neoplastic disease depends on the nature of the disease and can be determined empirically by standard clinical techniques.

Where possible it is desirable to determine the antisense cytotoxicity in cells in vitro and then in useful animal model systems prior to testing and use in humans.

2. RNA interference RNA interference RNAi see e.g. Chuang et al. 2000 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 4985 can be employed to inhibit the expression of a gene encoding a sHASEGP. Interfering RNA RNAi fragments particularly double stranded ds RNAi can be used to generate loss of sHASEGP function. Methods relating to the use of RNAi to silence genes in organisms including mammals and plants and humans are known see e.g. Fire et al. 1998 Nature 391 806 811 Fire 1999 Trends Genet. 15 358 363 Sharp 2001 Genes Dev. 15 485 490 Hammond et al. 2001 Nature Rev Genet. 2 110 119 Tuschl 2001 Chem. Biochem. 2 239 245 Hamilton et al. 1999 Science 286 950 952 Hammond et al. 2000 Nature 404 293 296 Zamore et al. 2000 Cell 101 25 33 Bernstein et al. 2001 Nature 409 363 366 Elbashir et al. 2001 Genes Dev. 15 188 200 Elbashir et al. 2001 Nature 411 494 498 International PCT application No. WO 01 29058 International PCT application No. WO 99 32619 .

Double stranded RNA dsRNA expressing constructs are introduced into a host such as an animal or plant using a replicable vector that remains episomal or integrates into the genome. By selecting appropriate sequences expression of dsRNA can interfere with accumulation of endogenous mRNA encoding a sHASEGP. RNAi also can be used to inhibit expression in vitro.

Regions include at least about 21 or 21 nucleotides that are selective i.e. unique for sHASEGP are used to prepare the RNAi. Smaller fragments of about 21 nucleotides can be transformed directly i.e. in vitro or in vivo into cells larger RNAi dsRNA molecules are generally introduced using vectors that encode them. dsRNA molecules are at least about 21 bp long or longer such as 50 100 150 200 and longer. Methods reagents and protocols for introducing nucleic acid molecules into cells in vitro and in vivo are known to those of skill in the art.

3. Gene Therapy in an exemplary embodiment nucleic acids that include a sequence of nucleotides encoding a sHASEGP polypeptide or functional domains or derivative thereof are administered to promote sHASEGP polypeptide function by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration of a nucleic acid to a subject. In this embodiment the nucleic acid produces its encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect by promoting sHASEGP polypeptide function. Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used see Goldspiel et al. Clinical Pharmacy 12 488 505 1993 Wu and Wu Biotherapy 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev An. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan Science 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson An. Rev. Biochem. 62 191 217 1993 TIBTECH 11 5 155 215 1993 . For example one therapeutic composition for gene therapy includes a sHASEGP polypeptide encoding nucleic acid that is part of an expression vector that expresses a sHASEGP polypeptide or domain fragment or chimeric protein thereof in a suitable host. In particular such a nucleic acid has a promoter operably linked to the sHASEGP polypeptide coding region the promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment a nucleic acid molecule is used in which the sHASEGP polypeptide coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the sHASEGP protein nucleic acid Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

Delivery of the nucleic acid into a patient can be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vector or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acid in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid is directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing it as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that it becomes intracellular e.g. by infection using a defective or attenuated retroviral or other viral vector see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering it in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment a nucleic acid ligand complex can be formed in which the ligand is a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 dated Apr. 16 1992 Wu et al. WO 92 22635 dated Dec. 23 1992 Wilson et al. WO 92 20316 dated Nov. 26 1992 Findeis et al. WO 93 14188 dated Jul. 22 1993 Clarke et al. WO 93 20221 dated Oct. 14 1993 Young . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijistra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment a viral vector that contains the sHASEGP polypeptide nucleic acid is used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors have been modified to delete retroviral sequences that are not necessary for packaging of the viral genome and integration into host cell DNA. The sHASEGP polypeptide nucleic acid to be used in gene therapy is cloned into the vector which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. Biotherapy 6 291 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy.

Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 1994 Kiem et al. Blood 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg Human Gene Therapy 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson Cliff. Opin. In Genetics And Devel. 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. Human Gene Therapy 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 and Mastrangeli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234 1993 .

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 1993 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate mediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 1993 Cline Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92 1985 and can be used provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and generally heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. In an embodiment epithelial cells are injected e.g. subcutaneously. In another embodiment recombinant skin cells can be applied as a skin graft onto the patient. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells can be administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as T lymphocytes B lymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. such as stem cells obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver and other sources thereof.

For example a cell used for gene therapy is autologous to the patient. In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy a sHASEGP polypeptide nucleic acid is introduced into the cells such that it is expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells that can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment.

Such stem cells include but are not limited to hematopoietic stem cells HSC stem cells of epithelial tissues such as the skin and the lining of the gut embryonic heart muscle cells liver stem cells PCT Publication WO 94 08598 dated Apr. 28 1994 and neural stem cells Stemple and Anderson Cell 71 973 985 1992 .

Epithelial stem cells ESC or keratinocytes can be obtained from tissues such as the skin and the lining of the gut by known procedures Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 . In stratified epithelial tissue such as the skin renewal occurs by mitosis of stem cells within the germinal layer the layer closest to the basal lamina. Stem cells within the lining of the gut provide for a rapid renewal rate of this tissue. ESC or keratinocytes obtained from the skin or lining of the gut of a patient or donor can be grown in tissue culture Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 Pittelkow and Scott Cano. Clinic Proc. 61 771 1986 . If the ESC are provided by a donor a method for suppression of host versus graft reactivity e.g. irradiation drug or antibody administration to promote moderate immunosuppression also can be used.

With respect to hematopoietic stem cells HSC any technique which provides for the isolation propagation and maintenance in vitro of HSC can be used in this embodiment. Techniques by which this can be accomplished include a the isolation and establishment of HSC cultures from bone marrow cells isolated from the future host or a donor or b the use of previously established long term HSC cultures which can be allergenic or xenogenic.

Non autologous HSC generally are used with a method of suppressing transplantation immune reactions of the future host patient. In a particular embodiment human bone marrow cells can be obtained from the posterior iliac crest by needle aspiration see e.g. Kodo et al. J. Clin. Invest. 73 1377 1384 1984 . For example the HSC can be made highly enriched or in substantially pure form. This enrichment can be accomplished before during or after long term culturing and can be done by any techniques known in the art. Long term cultures of bone marrow cells can be established and maintained by using for example modified Dexter cell culture techniques Dexter et al. J. Cell Physiol. 91 335 1977 or Witlock Witte culture techniques Witlock and Witte Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79 3608 3612 1982 .

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid to be introduced for purposes of gene therapy includes an inducible promoter operably linked to the coding region such that expression of the nucleic acid is controllable by controlling the presence or absence of the appropriate inducer of transcription.

4. Prodrugs A method for treating tumors is provided. The method is practiced by administering a prodrug that is cleaved at a specific site by a HASEGP to release an active drug or precursor that can be converted to active drug in vivo. Upon contact with a cell that expresses sHASEGP activity the prodrug is converted into an active drug. The prodrug can be a conjugate that contains the active agent such as an anti tumor drug such as a cytotoxic agent or other therapeutic agent TA linked to a substrate for the targeted sHASEGP such that the drug or agent is inactive or unable to enter a cell in the conjugate but is activated upon cleavage. The prodrug for example can contain an chondroitin sulfate molecule typically a relatively short less than about 20 disaccharide units that is catalytically cleaved by the targeted sHASEGP. Cytotoxic agents include but are not limited to alkylating agents antiproliferative agents and tubulin binding agents. Others include vinca drugs mitomycins bleomycins and taxanes.

Pharmaceutical compositions containing an active sHASEGP are provided herein. Also provided are combinations of compounds that modulate the activity of a sHASEGP polypeptide and another treatment or compound for treatment of a hyaluronidase disorder such as an antibody compound.

The sHASEGP polypeptide and a second agent can be packaged as separate compositions for administration together or sequentially or intermittently. Alternatively they can be provided as a single composition for administration or as two compositions for administration as a single composition. The combinations can be packaged as kits.

The sHASEGP polypeptides and soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof provided herein can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions typically for single dosage administration. The concentrations of the polypeptides in the formulations are effective for delivery of an amount upon administration that is effective for the intended treatment. Typically the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration. To formulate a composition the weight fraction of a sHASEGP polypeptide soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof or mixture thereof is dissolved suspended dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the treated condition is relieved or ameliorated.

Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the sHASEGP or soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration.

In addition the polypeptides can be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or can be combined with other active ingredients. Liposomal suspensions including tissue targeted liposomes can also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. For example liposome formulations can be prepared as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 522 811.

The active sHASEGP or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. The therapeutically effective concentration can be determined empirically by testing the polypeptides in known in vitro and in vivo systems such as by using the assays provided herein or see e.g. Taliani et al. 1996 240 60 67 Filocamo et al. 1997 71 1417 1427 Sudo et al. 1996 32 9 18 Buffard et al. 1995 209 52 59 Bianchi et al. 1996 237 239 244 Hamatake et al. 1996 39 249 258 Steinkaler et al. 1998 37 8899 8905 D Souza et al. 1995 76 1729 1736 Takeshita et al. 1997 247 242 246 see also e.g. Shimizu et al. 1994 68 8406 8408 Mizutani et al. 1996 70 7219 7223 Mizutani et al. 1996 227 822 826 Lu et al. 1996 . USA 93 1412 1417 Hahm et al. 1996 226 318 326 Ito et al. 1996 77 1043 1054 Mizutani et al. 1995 212 906 911 Cho et al. 1997 65 201 207 and then extrapolated therefrom for dosages for humans.

Typically a therapeutically effective dosage is contemplated. The amounts administered can be on the order of 0.001 to 1 mg ml including about 0.005 0.05 mg ml and about 0.01 mg ml of blood volume. Pharmaceutical dosage unit forms are prepared to provide from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg including from about 10 to about 500 mg and including about 25 75 mg of the essential active ingredient or a combination of essential ingredients per dosage unit form. The precise dosage can be empirically determined.

In some instances a high Unit dose of human sHASEGP is preferable. For example with intravenous administration of sHASEGP concentrations of sHASEGP from 500 100 000 Units per ml are preferable. Lyophilized formulations of sHASEGP are also ideal for storage of large Unit doses of sHASEGP. 200 000 Unit lyophilized vials of sHASEGP are contemplated for intravenous delivery.

High concentration doses are also contemplated for the delivery of small volumes of sHASEGP. Administration of 10 100 uL of 5000 Units ml sHASEGP is contemplated for injection in the anterior chamber to dissolve pre administered viscoelastic substances during cataract and phakic intraocular lens implantation surgeries. Small volume injections of 50 200 U ml doses are also contemplated for intravitreal procedures such as the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage or vitro retinal detachment in diabetic retinopathy.

Somewhat larger volume injections e.g. between about one to several ml or more are contemplated for somewhat larger and or more readily drained spaces within the body. For example as illustrated herein periorbital injections of one to several ml or more can be made into one or more spaces surrounding the eye e.g. by injection into the sub Tenon s or episcleral space in order to promote the transcleral delivery of pharmacologic agents to tissues at the back of the eye such as the choroid plexus and or retina. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art some spaces within the body can readily accommodate larger volumes. By way of illustration the episcleral or sub Tenon s space around the eye can readily accommodate one to several ml or even larger volumes e.g. up to or greater than 5 to 10 ml depending for example on the characteristics of the particular tissue and the rate at which the volume is delivered .

In addition as described and illustrated herein it appears that the introduction of a sHASEGP potentially in combination with one or more additional pharmacologic or other agents in a larger volume can be used to further drive delivery of agents to desired target sites within the body. Without being restricted to a particular mechanism of action it is believed that such larger volume injections can further drive permeation or spreading of both sHASEGP as well as other agent s present in the treated tissue by a process of convective transport that is promoted by an increased pressure differential. Again without wishing to be restricted to a particular mechanism of action it is believed that such an increased pressure differential can be brought about in the context of the present invention by inter alia one or both of the following i an elevated driving pressure or elevated pressure head e.g. caused by increased hydrostatic pressure associated with an injection that largely fills or somewhat overfills or distends a space or site of injection and ii a reduced downstream pressure or reduced impedance e.g. caused by the opening of channels in the interstitial matrix associated with localized hyaluronidase activity and consequent degradation of relatively hydrated hyaluronan . Preferred hyaluronidases for use in this and other applications of the present invention such as facilitating the delivery pharmacologic and other agents are sHASEGPs particularly human sHASEGPs in the context of delivery of agents to one or more tissues in the human body. However these and other approaches to the use and application of hyaluronidases can also be applied using non human sHASEGPs such as mammalian sHASEGPs as well other human or mammalian hyaluronidases preferably soluble forms of such hyaluronidases.

The active ingredient can be administered at once or can be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and can be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values can also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or use of the claimed compositions and combinations containing them.

Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives include acids salts esters hydrates solvates and prodrug forms. The derivative is typically selected such that its pharmacokinetic properties are superior to the corresponding neutral sHASEGP or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof.

Thus effective concentrations or amounts of one or more of the polypeptides herein or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier or vehicle for systemic topical or local administration to form pharmaceutical compositions. sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof are included in an amount effective for ameliorating or treating the disorder for which treatment is contemplated. The concentration of active polypeptide in the composition depends on absorption inactivation excretion rates of the active polypeptide the dosage schedule amount administered particular formulation as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.

The therapeutic agents for use in the methods can be administered by any route known to those of skill in the art such as but are not limited to topically intraarticularly intracisternally intraocularly peri orbitally intraventricularly intrathecally intravenously intraarterially intramuscularly intraperitoneally intradermally subcutaneously intratracheally as well as by any combination of any two or more thereof. Dry powder pulmonary formulations can be envisioned as well.

The most suitable route for administration will vary depending upon the proposed use such as for example use as a delivery agent to facilitate subcutaneous delivery of fluids use to reduce intraocular pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients receiving viscoelastics or use as a spreading agent to enhance the activity of chemotherapeutics and the location of interest such as a particular internal organ a tumor growth intraocular cavity and the epidermis. Modes of administration include but are not limited to topically locally intraarticularly intracisternally intraocularly peri orbitally intraventricularly intrathecally intravenously intramuscularly intratracheally intraperitoneally intradermally subcutaneously and by a combination of any two or more thereof. For example for treatment of various cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma breast cancer urinary bladder cancer and gastrointestinal cancer local administration including administration to the site of the tumor growth e.g. intrathecally intraventricularly or intracisternally provides the advantage that the therapeutic agent can be administered in a high concentration without risk of the complications that can accompany systemic administration of a therapeutic agent.

As an exemplary class of pharmacologic agents that can be combined with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases e.g. combined by co formulation with one or more sHASEGPs or by co administration with one or more sHASEGPs which may be administered prior to coincident with or following administration of the agent a number of agents having effectiveness or potential effectiveness in the treatment of various cancers have been described in the art and novel anti cancer agents are regularly being developed which may likewise be combined with one or more sHASEGPs e.g. provided by co formulation or by co administration before coincident with and or following administration of the agent to improve the pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics or other useful properties of the agent.

By way of illustration and without limitation a number of anti cancer or chemotherapeutic agents have now been approved for the treatment of various cancers which can be combined with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases by co formulation or co administration before coincident with or after administration of the anti cancer agent .

As with other classes of pharmacologic agents described herein a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase may be used in conjunction with the administration of or co formulated with an individual pharmacologic agent such as an antineoplastic for purposes of illustration or with a member of another class of agents as described herein and or known in the art . Alternatively a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase may be used in conjunction with the administration of or co formulated with more than one pharmacologic agent of a given class such as multiple antineoplastic agents for purposes of illustration or multiple members of other classes of agents as described herein and or known in the art . In the case of combinations with two or more agents of a given class it is often preferred that the two or more agents act by two or more different mechanisms of action. A sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase may also be used in conjunction with the administration of or co formulated with one pharmacologic agent of a first given class such as an antineoplastic for purposes of illustration or a member of one of the other classes of agents as described herein and or known in the art and one or more additional pharmacologic agents of one or more different classes that are useful for treating any of a variety of conditions. While certain principles are thus referred to here in the case of anticancer agents for purposes of illustration these principles are also applicable to for example anti infectives and the numerous members of other classes of agents that are described and illustrated herein as well as additional agents that are already known in the art or are newly developed.

In the case of any of the combinations and or co formulations described herein comprising at least one sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase and at least one other agent such as a pharmacologic agent e.g. a member of one of the classes of agents illustrated herein it is also contemplated that such combination and or co formulation can further comprise one or more agents such as various stabilizers excipients and the like which do not themselves exert substantial pharmacodynamic effects but which promote the usefulness of the combination and or co formulation e.g. by stabilizing one or more of the components or an entire formulation by helping to promote or target the activity of one or more of the agents or of the sHASEGP and or by reducing toxicity or otherwise improving the safety profile of the combination or co formulation.

As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art new versions and formulations of these and other anti cancer agents as well as members of other classes of agents as described herein are regularly being developed that can likewise be combined with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases . Furthermore since such enzymes can be used to improve pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles of a large variety of agents and allow agents to be delivered by different and potentially more targeted routes for example sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases can be used to enhance the PK and or PD profiles of a number of agents previously considered to have sub optimal profiles. Testing of agents in appropriate animal models with and without concomitant sHASEGP can be used to assess the relative effectiveness and toxicity of particular agents.

As illustrated and exemplified herein a number of large molecule agents such as antibodies and other proteins particularly those administered by non IV parenteral injection exhibit relatively poor pharmacokinetic profiles and can be particularly enhanced by co formulation or co administration with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases . Without being restricted to a particular mechanism of action it is generally considered that small molecule agents exhibiting relatively low hydrophobicity are more effectively dispersable by e.g. convective transport within interstitial fluids as can be promoted by sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases . A commonly used method for predicting such attributes is to assess the calculated and or estimate octanol water partition coefficients K which have been reported for a number of compounds. In that regard agents exhibiting log Kof

Pharmaceutical and cosmetic carriers or vehicles suitable for administration of the sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. In addition the polypeptides can be formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in the composition or can be combined with other active ingredients that do not impair the desired action or with materials that supplement the desired action known to those of skill in the art. For example the sHASEGP polypeptides provided herein can be used as a delivery or spreading agent in combination with a second active compound such as a therapeutically effective agent including but not limited to a drug or a prodrug to facilitate delivery of or to enhance the activity of the second active ingredient. In a particular embodiment a sHASEGP polypeptide or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can be co formulated or co administered with an anesthetic agent such as Lignocaine Bupivicaine or a mixture of the two and optionally a hormonal agent such as epinephrine to decrease or stop blood uptake during ophthalmic surgery. In another particular embodiment a sHASEGP polypeptide or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can be co formulated or co administered with a pharmacologic agent such as an anti inflammatory agent to enhance the delivery of the pharmacologic to mammalian tissues in vivo e.g. to portions of the eye where such agent is desired for treating a particular condition. By co administration is intended the administration of sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase together with or in close temporal proximity to the administration of a pharmacologic agent. Typically it is preferred that the sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase be administered shortly before e.g. 5 to 60 minutes before or for maximal convenience together with the pharmacologic agent. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art the desired proximity of co administration depends in significant part on the effective half lives of the agents in the particular tissue setting and the particular disease being treated and can be readily optimized by testing the effects of administering the agents at varying times in suitable models such as in suitable animal models. In some situations the optimal timing of administration of the sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase will exceed 60 minutes. By way of illustration and without wishing to be bound by theory in some tumor situations for example the maximal entry of chemotherapeutic agent into the tumor may occur after the degradation of hyaluronan in the tumor is substantially complete so as to reduce tumor interstitial volume which is followed by a hyaluronan regenerative phase during which fluid is drawn back into the tumor resulting in increased adsorption of a chemotherapeutic agent from plasma. In the latter case optimal administration of sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase may be obtained between about one to twenty hours prior to administration of the pharmacologic agent. In order to optimize the timing of pre administration relative to pharmacologic agent for a particular combination of disease condition and pharmacologic agent one of skill can conduct a routine time course of pre administration typically comparing one or several time points of an hour or less with one or several timepoints of greater than hour but typically not exceeding a day in order to optimize the timing of administration. A sHASEGP polypeptide or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can also be co formulated or co administered with various chemotherapeutics such as a toxin and a tumor necrosis factor to enhance the activity of the chemotherapeutic and or the accessibility of the target tumors to the chemotherapeutic. The active compound is included in the carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of serious toxic effects on the treated individual. The effective concentration can be determined empirically by testing the compounds using in vitro and in vivo systems including the animal models described herein.

In the case of pharmacologic agents that are delivered by parenteral administration i.e. by routes other than through the digestive tract such as by subcutaneous intradermal intramuscular or intravenous routes for example sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases can be readily co formulated with or co administered with any of a variety of such pharmacologic agents to enhance their delivery to desired sites within the body. For example depending on the particular combination of pharmacologic agent and route of administration delivery can be enhanced by increasing the extent and or rate at which the agent diffuses through a tissue at or near the site of delivery e.g. following its injection and or the extent and or rate at which the agent diffuses and or is carried by convective transport through a target tissue e.g. following its release from the bloodstream lymph cerebrospinal fluid or other fluid system . The extent by which delivery is enhanced can be readily evaluated for example in animal model systems in which the addition of a sHASEGP results in a measurable increase in the bioavailability of the agent in tissues of interest within the body.

Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that in the case of non intravenous parenterals such as subcutaneous intradermal and intramuscular injectables the presence of sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase in the vicinity of an injection site and in downstream sites such as those between an injection site and a distal vascular bed can enhance the diffusion and or convective transport of the agent into a delivery system such as the vasculature. Enhanced delivery in such a situation can be associated with an increase in the amount of the agent that effectively passes through and out of the initial delivery site potentially by both increasing the volume and rate of bulk fluid flow .

In the case of many pharmacologic agents which are subject to degradation removal or other forms of inactivation in tissues increasing the rate of its passage through a tissue can in turn substantially increase the amount of effective agent that transits through the tissue further increasing its bioavailability. For both non intravenously administered parenterals that subsequently enter the bloodstream or other conduit as well agents delivered directly into the conduit vessels such as by intravenous administration IV the ability of the agent to diffuse through a tissue supplied by the conduit can also be enhanced by the presence of sHASEGP in the tissue. Whether sHASEGP is present in the delivery tissue such as in the former case and or in the target tissue as in the latter case the presence of sHASEGP can thus enhance the effective extent and or rate of delivery of the pharmacologic to target tissues within the body. In either case the sHASEGP can be used to increase the effective bioavailability of a pharmacologic agent with which it has been co formulated or co administered. As a result the sHASEGP can be used to achieve elevated and or more rapidly achieved concentrations of the agent to provide for example a more potent and or more rapid response for a given dose. Alternatively the sHASEGP can be used to allow a given response to be achieved with a lower dose of administered agent for example. The ability of a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase to enhance bulk fluid flow at and near a site of injection can also improve other aspects of associated pharmacologic delivery. For example the increase in bulk fluid flow can help to allow the volume of fluid injected to be more readily dispersed from the site of injection reducing potentially painful or other adverse consequences of injection . Indeed it has long been recognized that such adverse sensations associated with non IV parenteral injections are a key reason that patients may resist or avoid non IV parenteral administration which may effectively require a product to be administered intravenously when it might otherwise be given more conveniently and or safely through a non IV route .

In using a sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase of the present invention to enhance delivery of one or more pharmacologic or other agents in the body a use that is sometimes referred to as spreading the sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase itself may be administered by the same route as is the pharmacologic agent in which case it may be co formulated or otherwise co administered together with the pharmacologic agent or it may be administered separately preferably in advance of the pharmacologic agent as discussed above. Alternatively or in addition the sHASEGP or other glycosaminoglycanase may be administered by a different route of administration. For example the pharmacologic agent may be introduced locally by non IV parenteral injection and the sHASEGP may be introduced intravenously. As another illustrative and non limiting example the sHASEGP may be introduced locally by non IV parenteral injection in a tissue that is desired to be targeted by the pharmacologic agent and the pharmacologic agent itself may be introduced by another route such as intravenous non parenteral e.g. oral or other route. As will thus be appreciated by those of skill in the art sHASEGPs of the present invention can be used to enhance the delivery and bioavailability of a variety of pharmacologic and other agents including agents that are typically delivered by parenteral as well as non parental routes.

For example sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases can be co formulated or co administered with a variety of pharmacologic agents that are typically administered by parenteral delivery e.g. to enhance their effectiveness and or to improve their risk benefit profile in treating disease.

As described and illustrated herein pharmacologic agents of a number of different classes and routes of administration can be benefited by co administration and or co formulation with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases to improve one or more of their aspects of use. Such improvements can comprise for example one or any combination of the following i improving the extent and or the rate of absorption and thus bioavailability of an agent for example by causing more of it to reach the bloodstream after non IV parenteral administration and or less of it to be degraded after such local administration by more rapid permeation which can be brought about for example by accelerating interstitial flow and potentially convective transport following non IV parenteral administration e.g. by applying hydrostatic pressure associated with the volume of injection combined with a reduction in impedance to flow associated with degradation of hyaluronan ii providing for a safer or more convenient route of administration for example allowing for non IV parenteral administration in place of IV or for improved or more convenient non IV parenteral administrations such as intradermal or subcutaneous in place of intramuscular iii more favorable dosing regimens for example less frequent dosing or a more frequent but lower dose non IV route as opposed to a less frequent but higher dose IV iv reducing a side effect or otherwise decreasing toxicity for example an effect associated with the initially high concentration high Cmax generated by IV dosing or from a high local dose generated by slow and or incomplete absorption following non IV parenteral administration v otherwise improving the pharmacokinetics and or pharmacodynamics for example by allowing more of an agent to reach a target site e.g. by increased interstitial fluid flow and convective transport due to the presence of sHASEGP at or near a delivery site such as an injection site and or by enhancing the permeation within a target site e.g. by increased interstitial fluid flow and convective transport due to the presence of sHASEGP within the target site or by delivering an agent preferentially to a target site e.g. by local administration to a target site in connection with local or systemic administration of a sHASEGP to promote permeation of the target or by using vehicles or macromolecular complexes to preferentially target an agent to a particular site combined with local or systemic administration of sHASEGP to promote permeation of the target site Agents that have been delivered orally can also be benefited by reformulations for parenteral delivery to e.g. avoid loss of agent to the gastrointestinal tract or subsequent degradation or toxicity allow for more effective targeting to a desired site of action and therefore potentially greater effectiveness and or less toxicity or otherwise provide for more favorable pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles. In addition sHASEGPs can be used to improve the pharmacodynamics of agents that are administered orally for example by enhancing the permeation of an orally administered agent within its desired target site e.g. by increased interstitial fluid flow and convective transport due to the presence of sHASEGP within the target site following systemic administration of sHASEGP and or following local administration of sHASEGP to the target site .

Even in situations in which the desired target site for an agent such as pharmacologic is the bloodstream itself such agents can be enhanced by co administration and or co formulation with sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases . For example there are a number of agents that act as blood modifiers which may be administered by one of several routes including oral dosing as well as parenteral administration such as IV injection . A number of agents that are or could be administered orally nevertheless exhibit relatively limited or slow uptake and or are subject to undesirable degradation and there are other agents that are generally safe and effective once introduced into the bloodstream but are not administered orally for that reason . Parenteral administration of such agents e.g. by intramuscular subcutaneous intradermal or transdermal routes in combination with administration of sHASEGP preferably at or near the site of parenteral administration can thus be employed to provide for introduction into the bloodstream. In addition there are a number of urgent medical situations in which rapid delivery of an agent to the bloodstream is essential but oral dosing is too slow and intravenous dosing is either inconvenient unsafe or unavailable. These urgent situations include those in which the blood is the target as well as those in which the bloodstream is simply the route of delivery to another target tissue. In such situations the ability to combine administration with a sHASEGP or apply a ready prepared co formulation with a sHASEGP can allow for rapid delivery of the agent via non IV parenteral administration. As will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art there are a number of formulations and devices designed for non IV parenteral administrations that can provide for e.g. timed or other triggered release of agents as well as variably controlled dosing and the like. A large number of such pharmacologic agents that can be co formulated with or used in combination with a sHASEGP are regularly applied in medical practice and aspects of their use well described see e.g. the Physicians Desk Reference Thomson 2003 2004 2005 and many other such agents are known in the art. In the latter regard as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art sHASEGPs can be employed in combination with agents currently used to e.g. improve their applicability as described herein with agents that are not currently used to e.g. improve their pharmacokinetics and or pharmacodynamics and thus make them useful or with agents that are newly developed.

Thus for pharmacologic agents such as anticancer agents blood modifiers or members of other classes of agents as described herein that are typically introduced parenterally e.g. by IV injection sHASEGPs or other glycosaminoglycanases can be used for example to allow such agents to be administered by other potentially more convenient and or safe routes such as by non IV parenteral administration e.g. by intramuscular subcutaneous intradermal or transdermal routes . For agents that are already deliverable by a non IV parenteral route sHASEGPs may be used to enhance its extent and or rate of uptake and delivery e.g. by promoting its dispersion and subsequent entry into the bloodstream which can likely be aided by convective transport as described herein . Advantages of such effects include having a greater portion of the agent reach the bloodstream having reduced local exposure to agent in terms of concentration and or time e.g. at or near the injection site which often limits dosing or results in local toxicity issues increasing the speed at which an agent can be delivered into the bloodstream other improved pharmacokinetic and or pharmadynamic properties and convenience of administration. In the last regard non IV parenteral administrations can allow many agents to be administered out of hospital that would otherwise require hospitalization or other medical attention typically required for intravenous administrations.

Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral administration including by intramuscular intradermal subcutaneous topical application and other non oral routes can include any of the following components a sterile diluent such as water for injection saline solution fixed oil polyethylene glycol glycerine propylene glycol or other synthetic solvent antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and methyl parabens antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and sodium bisulfite cheating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA buffers such as acetates citrates and phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity including but not limited to sodium chloride calcium chloride magnesium chloride dextrose glycerol or boric acid. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in ampoules disposable syringes or single or multiple dose vials made of glass plastic or other suitable material.

The sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof can be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or can be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the polypeptide in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the targeted condition and can be empirically determined using methods known to those of skill in the art. To formulate a composition the weight fraction of polypeptide is dissolved suspended dispersed or otherwise mixed in a selected vehicle at an effective concentration such that the targeted condition is relieved or ameliorated.

In instances in which the sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof exhibit insufficient solubility methods for solubilizing polypeptides can be used. Such methods are known to those of skill in this art and include but are not limited to using cosolvents such as dimethylsulfoxide DMSO using surfactants such as TWEEN and Pluronic F68 or dissolution in aqueous sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the polypeptides such as prodrugs of the polypeptides can also be used in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions. For ophthalmic indications the compositions are formulated in an ophthalmically acceptable carrier. For the ophthalmic uses herein local administration either by topical administration or by injection is contemplated. Time release formulations are also desirable. Typically the compositions are formulated for single dosage administration so that a single dose administers an effective amount.

Upon mixing or addition of the polypeptide with the vehicle the resulting mixture can be a solution suspension emulsion or other composition and can be formulated as an aqueous mixtures a creams gels ointments emulsions solutions elixirs lotions suspensions tinctures pastes foams aerosols irrigations sprays suppositories bandages or any other formulation suitable for systemic topical or local administration.

The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. If necessary pharmaceutically acceptable salts or other derivatives of the compounds are prepared. For local internal administration such as intramuscular parenteral or intra articular administration the compounds are preferably formulated as a solution suspension in an aqueous based medium such as isotonically buffered saline or are combined with a biocompatible support or bioadhesive intended for internal administration.

The sHASEGP polypeptide or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof is included in the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in the absence of undesirable side effects on the patient treated. It is understood that number and degree of side effects depends upon the condition for which the compounds are administered. For example certain toxic and undesirable side effects are tolerated when treating life threatening illnesses that would not be tolerated when treating disorders of lesser consequence. Amounts effective for therapeutic use will of course depend on the severity of the disease and the weight and general state of the subject as well as the route of administration. Local administration of the therapeutic agent will typically require a smaller dosage than any mode of systemic administration although the local concentration of the therapeutic agent can in some cases be higher following local administration than can be achieved with safety upon systemic administration.

Since individual subjects can present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each therapeutic agent has its unique therapeutic characteristics it is up to the practitioner to determine the response of a subject to treatment and vary the dosages accordingly. Dosages used in vitro can provide useful guidance in the amounts useful for in situ administration of the pharmaceutical composition and animal models can in some cases be used to determine effective dosages for treatment of particular disorders. In general however for local administration it is contemplated that an effective amount of the therapeutic agent will be an amount within the range from about 0.1 picograms pg up to about 1 ng per kg body weight. Various considerations in arriving at an effective amount are known to those of skill in the art and are described see e.g. Goodman And Gilman s The Pharmacological Bases of Therapeutics 8th ed. Pergamon Press 1990 Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences 17th ed. Mack Publishing Co. Easton Pa. 1990 and Mantyh et al. 278 275 79 1997 involving the intrathecal injection of a neuronal specific ligand toxin each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety .

The formulations of the sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof for use herein include those suitable for oral rectal topical inhalation buccal sublingual other parenteral e.g. subcutaneous intramuscular intradermal transdermal or intravenous administration or any route. The most suitable route in any given case depends on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound that is being used. The formulations are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms such as tablets capsules pills powders granules sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions and oral solutions or suspensions and oil water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the polypeptides and or other agents or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutical therapeutically active polypeptides and or other agents and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit dosage forms or multiple dosage forms. A unit dose form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art.

The pharmaceutical compositions are provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms such as tablets capsules pills powders granules sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions and oral solutions or suspensions and oil water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the sHASEGP polypeptide or soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof and optionally another agent or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof. The pharmaceutically therapeutically active compounds and derivatives thereof are typically formulated and administered in unit dosage forms or multiple dosage forms. A unit dose form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal subjects and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit dose forms include but are not limited to ampoules syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. For example a small volume formulation containing a stabilized solution with 1 to 5000 Units of sHASEGP in a small volume such as 5 to 50 l can be prepackaged in a syringe for use such as after viscoelastic injection. Unit dose forms can be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple dose form is a plurality of identical unit dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit dose form. Examples of multiple dose forms include vials bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence multiple dose form is a multiple of unit doses that are not segregated in packaging.

The composition can contain along with the active ingredient such as a sHASEGP polypeptide a diluent such as lactose sucrose dicalcium phosphate or carboxymethylcellulose a lubricant such as magnesium stearate calcium stearate and talc and a binder such as starch natural gums such as gum acaciagelatin glucose molasses polyvinylpyrrolidine celluloses and derivatives thereof povidone crospovidones and other such binders known to those of skill in the art. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can for example be prepared by dissolving dispersing or otherwise mixing an active compound as defined above and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier such as for example water saline aqueous dextrose glycerol glycols ethanol and the like to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired the pharmaceutical composition to be administered can also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances such as wetting agents emulsifying agents or solubilizing agents pH buffering agents and the like for example acetate sodium citrate cyclodextrine derivatives sorbitan monolaurate triethanolamine sodium acetate triethanolamine oleate and other such agents. Methods of preparing such dosage forms are known or will be apparent to those skilled in this art see e.g. Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. 15th Edition 1975 . The composition or formulation to be administered contains a quantity of the active compound in an amount sufficient to alleviate the symptoms of the treated subject. For example a standard stabilized formulation of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof as provided herein includes 150 Units ml of the soluble glycoprotein formulated in EDTA NaCl and CaCl. Additionally an anti bacterial or anti fungal agent including but not limited to thiomersal can be present in the formulation. Another formulation provided herein is a stabilized solution or lyophilized form of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof in EDTA NaCl and CaCl containing an effective active amount of the soluble glycoprotein such as 150 Unit ml with the addition of lactose such as 13 mg ml. Also provided herein is a formulation containing a stabilized solution or lyophilized form of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof in EDTA NaCl and CaClcontaining an effective active amount of the soluble glycoprotein such as 150 Unit ml with the addition of lactose such as 13 mg ml and Albumin Pluronic F68 TWEEN and or other detergent. Another formulation provided herein either lyophilized or as a stabilized solution contains an effect amount of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 1 to 300 Units ml in EDTA NaCl and CaCl.

For oral administration the pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of for example tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents e.g. pregelatinized maize starch polyvinyl pyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose fillers e.g. lactose microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate lubricants e.g. magnesium stearate talc or silica disintegrants e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycolate or wetting agents e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate . The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the art.

The sHASEGPs or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be prepared with carriers that protect the soluble glycoprotein against rapid elimination from the body such as time release formulations or coatings. The compositions can include other pharmaceutically effective agents known in the general art to be of value in treating one or more of the diseases or medical conditions including but not limited to a chemotherapeutic agent an analgesic agent an anti inflammatory agent an antimicrobial agent an amoebicidal agent a trichomonocidal agent an anti parkinson agent an anti malarial agent an anticonvulsant agent an anti depressant agent and antiarthritics agent an anti fungal agent an antihypertensive agent antipyretic agent an anti parasite agent an antihistamine agent an alpha adrenargic agonist agent an alpha blocker agent an anesthetic agent a bronchi dilator agent a biocide agent a bactericide agent a bacteriostat agent a betadrenergic blocker agent a calcium channel blocker agent a cardiovascular drug agent a contraceptive agent a decongestant agent a diuretic agent a depressant agent a diagnostic agent a electrolyte agent a hypnotic agent a hormone agent a hyperglycemic agent a muscle relaxant agent a muscle contractant agent an ophthalmic agent a parasympathomimetic agent a psychic energizer agent ophthalmic agent a parasympathomimetic agent a psychic energizer agent a sedative agent a sympathomimetic agent a tranquilizer agent an urinary agent a vaginal agent a viricide agent a vitamin agent a non steroidal anti inflammatory agent an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor agent a polypeptide a protein a nucleic acid a drug a prodrug a organic molecule and a sleep inducer to obtain desired combinations of properties.

The concentration of the pharmaceutically active compound is adjusted so that an injection provides an effective amount to produce the desired pharmacological effect. The exact dose depends on the age weight and condition of the patient or animal as is known in the art.

The unit dose parenteral preparations are packaged in an ampoule a vial or a syringe with a needle. All preparations for parenteral administration must be sterile as is known and practiced in the art.

Illustratively intravenous or intraarterial infusion of a sterile aqueous solution containing an active compound is an effective mode of administration. Another embodiment is a sterile aqueous or oily solution or suspension containing an active material injected as necessary to produce the desired pharmacological effect.

Injectables are designed for local and systemic administration. Typically a therapeutically effective dosage is formulated to contain a concentration of at least about 0.1 w w up to about 90 w w or more preferably more than 1 w w of the active compound to the treated tissue s . The active ingredient such as a sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can be administered at once or can be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the tissue being treated and can be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values can also vary with the age of the individual treated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the formulations and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed formulations.

The compounds provided herein can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection e.g. by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form e.g. in ampoules or in multi dose containers with an added preservative. The compositions can be suspensions solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending stabilizing and or dispersing agents. Alternatively the active ingredient can be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle e.g. sterile pyrogen free water or other solvents before use. For example provided herein are parenteral formulations containing an effective amount of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 500 to 500 000 Units in a stabilized solution or a lyophilized from.

The compound can be suspended in micronized or other suitable form or can be derivatized to produce a more soluble active product or to produce a prodrug. The form of the resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors including the intended mode of administration and the solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for ameliorating the symptoms of the condition and can be empirically determined.

Also provided herein are lyophilized powders containing sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof which can be reconstituted for administration as solutions emulsions and other mixtures. These formulations can also be reconstituted and formulated as solids or gels.

The sterile lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving a solid portion of or mixing an aliquot of a solution containing a sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof in a suitable solvent. The solvent can contain an excipient that improves the stability or other pharmacological component of the powder or reconstituted solution prepared from the powder. Excipients that can be used include but are not limited to dextrose sorbitol fructose corn syrup xylitol glycerin glucose sucrose lactose or other suitable agent. The solvent can also contain a buffer such as citrate sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at typically about neutral pH. Subsequent sterile filtration of the solution followed by lyophilization under standard conditions known to those of skill in the art provides the lyophilized formulation. Generally the solution resulting from the sterile filtration is apportioned into vials for lyophilization. Each vial can contain a single dosage such as 10 1000 mg or 100 500 mg or multiple dosages of the compound.

Briefly the lyophilized powder is prepared by dissolving dextrose sorbitol fructose corn syrup xylitol glycerin glucose sucrose lactose or other suitable agent about 1 20 in a suitable buffer such as citrate sodium or potassium phosphate or other such buffer known to those of skill in the art at about neutral pH. Then a selected salt such as for example the sodium salt of the sHASEGP about 1 gm of the salt per 10 100 gms of the buffer solution typically about 1 gm 30 gms is added to the resulting mixture above room temperature such as at about 30 35 C. and stirred until it dissolves. The resulting mixture is diluted by adding more buffer to decrease the resulting concentration of the salt by about 10 50 typically about 15 25 . The resulting mixture is sterile filtered or treated to remove particulates and to insure sterility and apportioned into vials for lyophilization. The lyophilized powder can be stored under appropriate conditions such as at about 4 C to room temperature.

Reconstitution of this lyophilized powder with water for injection provides a formulation for use in parenteral administration. For reconstitution a therapeutically effective amount of the lyophilized powder containing a sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof is added per milliliter of sterile water or other suitable carrier. The precise amount depends upon the selected compound and can be empirically determined by methods known to those of skill in the art.

Topical mixtures are prepared as described for the local and systemic administration. Topical administration which is sometimes referred to in the art as percutaneous administration typically involves applications designed for absorption across skin mucous membranes or other surfaces of the body e.g. applications applied directly onto the skin under the tongue sublingual against the cheek buccal to the eyes nose or ears or to the lungs inhalation . The resulting mixture can be a solution suspension emulsions or the like and are formulated as creams gels ointments emulsions solutions elixirs lotions suspensions tinctures pastes foams aerosols irrigations sprays suppositories bandages dermal patches or any other formulations suitable for topical administration.

The compositions of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof can be formulated as aerosols for topical application such as by inhalation see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 044 126 4 414 209 and 4 364 923 which describe aerosols for delivery of a steroid useful for treatment inflammatory diseases particularly asthma . These formulations for administration to the respiratory tract can be in the form of an aerosol or solution for a nebulizer or as a microfine powder for insufflation alone or in combination with an inert carrier such as lactose. In such a case the particles of the formulation will typically have diameters of less than 50 microns such as less than 10 microns.

For administration by inhalation the compositions for use herein can be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant including but not limited to dichlorodifluoromethane trichlorofluoromethane dichlorotetrafluoroethane carbon dioxide and other suitable gases. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of e.g. gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.

The compositions can be formulated for local or topical application such as for topical application to the skin and mucous membranes such as in the eye in the form of gels creams and lotions and for application to the eye or for intracisternal or intraspinal application. Topical administration is contemplated for transdermal delivery and also for administration to the eyes or mucosa or for inhalation therapies. Nasal solutions of the active compound alone or in combination with other pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can also be administered.

For example formulations suitable for topical application to the skin or to the eye generally are formulated as an ointment cream lotion paste gel spray aerosol and oil. Carriers that can be used include vaseline lanoline polyethylene glycols alcohols and combinations of two or more thereof. The topical formulations can further advantageously contain 0.05 to 15 percent by weight of thickeners including but not limited to hydroxypropylmethylcellulose methylcellulose polyvinylpyrrolidone polyvinyl alcohol poly alkylene glycols poly hydroxyalkyl meth acrylates or poly meth acrylamides. A topical formulation is often applied by instillation or as an ointment into the conjunctival sac. It also can be used for irrigation or lubrication of the eye facial sinuses and external auditory meatus. The topical formulations in the liquid state can be also present in a hydrophilic three dimensional polymer matrix in the form of a strip contact lens and the like from which the active components are released. It can also be injected into the anterior eye chamber into the episcleral space and other places. For example provided herein is a formulation for intraocular use after viscoelastic injecting containing a stabilized solution of an effective amount of a sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 1 to 5000 Units of the soluble glycoprotein with 30 to 150 000 Units mg of specific activity in a small volume such as 5 to 50 l. As another example provided herein is a formulation for intraocular use to enhance delivery of one or more pharmacologic agents to tissues within the eye following injection by routes of administration such as a Sub Tenon s injection into the episcleral space surrounding the sclera comprising a stabilized solution of an effective amount of a sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 50 to 5 000 Units of the soluble glycoprotein with 30 to 150 000 Units mg of specific activity in a volume such as 0.05 to 10 ml.

These solutions particularly those intended for ophthalmic use can be formulated as 0.01 10 isotonic solutions pH about 5 7 with appropriate salts.

In the case of topical administrations and other applications to tissues that are susceptible to iontophoresis the use of one or more sHASEGPs potentially co formulated or co administered with another pharmacologic or other agent can be combined with iontophoretic techniques in order to further drive permeation of a tissue. In these regards iontophoresis and sHASEGPs can function cooperatively in that iontophoresis can promote delivery of sHASEGPs into a tissue or other location within the body and the sHASEGP so delivered can further drive permeation of the enzyme as well as co formulated or co administered or other molecules present in the tissue i.e. by enzymatically opening channels that facilitate diffusion as well as promoting bulk fluid flow and thus convective transport of solutes such as pharmacologics.

Other routes of administration such as topical application transdermal patches and rectal administration are also contemplated herein.

For example pharmaceutical dosage forms for rectal administration are rectal suppositories capsules and tablets for systemic effect. Rectal suppositories are used herein mean solid bodies for insertion into the rectum that melt or soften at body temperature releasing one or more pharmacologically or therapeutically active ingredients. Pharmaceutically acceptable substances utilized in rectal suppositories are bases or vehicles and agents to raise the melting point. Examples of bases include cocoa butter theobroma oil glycerin gelatin carbowax polyoxyethylene glycol and appropriate mixtures of mono di and triglycerides of fatty acids. Combinations of the various bases can be used. Agents to raise the melting point of suppositories include spermaceti and wax. Rectal suppositories can be prepared either by the compressed method or by molding. The typical weight of a rectal suppository is about 2 to 3 gm.

Tablets and capsules for rectal administration are manufactured using the same pharmaceutically acceptable substance and by the same methods as for formulations for oral administration.

Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Such patches suitably contain the active compound as an optionally buffered aqueous solution of for example 0.1 to 0.2 M concentration with respect to the active compound. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can also be delivered by iontophoresis see e.g. 3 6 318 1986 and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the active compound.

The pharmaceutical compositions can also be administered by controlled release means and or delivery devices see e.g. in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3 536 809 3 598 123 3 630 200 3 845 770 3 847 770 3 916 899 4 008 719 4 687 610 4 769 027 5 059 595 5 073 543 5 120 548 5 354 566 5 591 767 5 639 476 5 674 533 and 5 733 566 . The active compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives can be prepared with carriers that protect the compound against rapid elimination from the body such as time release formulations or coatings.

In one embodiment of the compositions and methods provided herein the therapeutic agent is administered locally in a slow release delivery vehicle for example encapsulated in a colloidal dispersion system or in polymer stabilized crystals. Useful colloidal dispersion systems include nanocapsules microspheres beads and lipid based systems including oil in water emulsions micelles mixed micelles and liposomes. For example the colloidal dispersion system can be a liposome or microsphere. Liposomes are artificial membrane vesicles that are useful as slow release delivery vehicles when injected or implanted. Some examples of lipid polymer conjugates and liposomes are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 631 018 which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Other examples of slow release delivery vehicles are biodegradable hydrogel matrices U.S. Pat. No. 5 041 292 dendritic polymer conjugates U.S. Pat. No. 5 714 166 and multivesicular liposomes Depofoam Depotech San Diego Calif. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 723 147 and 5 766 627 . One type of microspheres suitable for encapsulating therapeutic agents for local injection e.g. into subdermal tissue is poly D L lactide microspheres as described in D. Fletcher 84 90 94 1997 . For example a slow release formulation containing an effective amount of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 1 to 5000 Units ml can be employed for various uses or to treat various conditions including but not limited to cosmetic formulations treatment of spinal cord injuries and other nervous system disorders certain ophthalmic disorders inflammatory or autoimmune conditions cancers and other chronic disease conditions in which prolonged delivery of the sHASEGP is beneficial.

Desirable blood levels can be maintained by a continuous infusion of the active agent as ascertained by plasma levels. It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate interrupt or adjust therapy to lower dosage due to toxicity or bone marrow liver or kidney dysfunctions. Conversely the attending physician would also know how to and when to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response is not adequate precluding toxic side effects .

The efficacy and or toxicity of the sHASEGP polypeptide and or its inhibitor s alone or in combination with other agents such as therapeutically effective agents also can be assessed by the methods known in the art see e.g. O Apos Reilly 15 5 13 1997 .

The sHASEGP polypeptides or soluble human hyaluronidase domains thereof or compositions containing any of the preceding agents can be packaged as articles of manufacture containing packaging material a compound or suitable derivative thereof provided herein which is effective for treatment of a diseases or disorders contemplated herein within the packaging material and a label that indicates that the compound or a suitable derivative thereof is for treating the diseases or disorders contemplated herein. The label can optionally include the disorders for which the therapy is warranted.

The articles of manufacture provided herein contain packaging materials. Packaging materials for use in packaging pharmaceutical products are well known to those of skill in the art see e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 323 907 5 052 558 and 5 033 352 . Examples of pharmaceutical packaging materials include but are not limited to blister packs bottles tubes inhalers pumps bags vials containers syringes bottles and any packaging material suitable for a selected formulation and intended mode of administration and treatment. A wide array of formulations of the compounds and compositions provided herein are contemplated as are variety treatments for any disorder in which HCV infection is implicated as a mediator or contributor to the symptoms or cause.

Kits containing the compositions and or the combinations with instructions for administration thereof are also provided herein. The kit can further include a needle or syringe typically packaged in sterile form for injecting the complex and or a packaged alcohol pad. Instructions are optionally included for administration of the active agent by a clinician or by the patient. For example provided herein is a kit containing a small volume syringe with an effective amount of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 1 to 5000 Units of the soluble glycoprotein in a 5 to 50 l volume optionally containing a second syringe containing a viscoelastic. Also provided herein is a kit containing a small volume syringe containing an effective amount of sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof such as 1 to 500 Units of the soluble glycoprotein and a therapeutic amount of a second active ingredient such as a drug a small molecule a protein or a nucleic acid.

Transgenic animal models and animals such as rodents including mice and rats cows chickens pigs goats sheep monkeys including gorillas and other primates are provided herein. In particular transgenic non human animals that contain heterologous nucleic acid encoding a sHASEGP polypeptide or a transgenic animal in which expression of the polypeptide has been altered such as by replacing or modifying the promoter region or other regulatory region of the endogenous gene are provided. Such an animal can by produced by promoting recombination between endogenous nucleic acid and an exogenous sHASEGP gene that could be over expressed or mis expressed such as by expression under a strong promoter via homologous or other recombination event.

Transgenic animals can be produced by introducing the nucleic acid using any know method of delivery including but not limited to microinjection lipofection and other modes of gene delivery into a germline cell or somatic cells such as an embryonic stem cell. Typically the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell such as an embryonic stem cell ES followed by injecting the ES cells into a blastocyst and implanting the blastocyst into a foster mother which is followed by the birth of a transgenic animal. Generally introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule into a chromosome of the animal occurs by a recombination between the heterologous sHASEGP encoding nucleic acid and endogenous nucleic acid. The heterologous nucleic acid can be targeted to a specific chromosome. In some instances knockout animals can be produced. Such an animal can be initially produced by promoting homologous recombination between a sHASEGP polypeptide gene in its chromosome and an exogenous sHASEGP polypeptide gene that has been rendered biologically inactive typically by insertion of a heterologous sequence e.g. an antibiotic resistance gene . In one embodiment this homologous recombination is performed by transforming embryo derived stem ES cells with a vector containing the insertionally inactivated sHASEGP polypeptide gene such that homologous recombination occurs followed by injecting the ES cells into a blastocyst and implanting the blastocyst into a foster mother followed by the birth of the chimeric animal knockout animal in which a sHASEGP polypeptide gene has been inactivated see Capecchi Science 244 1288 1292 1989 . The chimeric animal can be bred to produce homozygous knockout animals which can then be used to produce additional knockout animals. Knockout animals include but are not limited to mice hamsters sheep pigs cattle and other non human mammals. For example a knockout mouse is produced. The resulting animals can serve as models of specific diseases such as cancers that exhibit under expression of a sHASEGP polypeptide. Such knockout animals can be used as animal models of such diseases e.g. to screen for or test molecules for the ability to treat or prevent such diseases or disorders.

Other types of transgenic animals also can be produced including those that over express the sHASEGP polypeptide. Such animals include knock in animals that are animals in which the normal gene is replaced by a variant such as a mutant an over expressed form or other form. For example one species such as a rodent s endogenous gene can be replaced by the gene from another species such as from a human. Animals also can be produced by non homologous recombination into other sites in a chromosome including animals that have a plurality of integration events.

After production of the first generation transgenic animal a chimeric animal can be bred to produce additional animals with over expressed or mis expressed sHASEGP polypeptides. Such animals include but are not limited to mice hamsters sheep pigs cattle and other non human mammals. The resulting animals can serve as models of specific diseases such as cancers that are exhibit over expression or mis expression of a sHASEGP polypeptide. Such animals can be used as animal models of such diseases e.g. to screen for or test molecules for the ability to treat or prevent such diseases or disorders. In a specific embodiment a mouse with over expressed or mis expressed sHASEGP polypeptide is produced.

The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

Naturally occurring hyaluronidase enzymes from slaughterhouses have been the principle source of clinical enzyme preparations for over forty years. Bovine and Ovine testicles are the principle source of this material. These clinical enzyme preparations however are very crude sold in preparations ranging from 0.5 5 purity based upon known specific activities between 30 100 000 Units mg. Thus their lack of purity combined with their slaughterhouse origin leave them as both immunogenic to humans and as potential source of Jacob Creutzfeld disease and other bovine and ovine pathogens. Anaphylactic reactions to bovine and ovine hyaluronidase preparations are known to occur.

Cattle or bacterially derived hyaluronidase have been used in the treatment of diseases associated with excess hyaluronic acid and to enhance the circulation of physiological fluids and or therapeutic agents. For example bovine hyaluronidase can be co injected with anesthesia in peribulbar retrobulbar and sub Tenon s blocks for ophthalmic surgical procedures. Moreover increased surgical complications occur in its absence Brown S M et al. 1999 September 25 9 1245 9. . Bovine hyaluronidase is also used as an antidote to local necrosis from paravenous injection of necrotic substances such as vinka alkaloids Few B. J. 1987 12 23 26 . Bovine testes hyaluronidase is also useful for the treatment of ganglion cysts Paul et al. 1997 April 22 2 219 21 . Hyaluronidase can also be used to facilitate subcutaneous delivery of fluids in hypodermoclysis Berger E Y 1984 March 32 3 199 203 . Hyaluronidase has also been utilized to reduce intraocular pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients and cataract patients receiving viscoelastics U.S. Pat. No. 4 820 516 issued Apr. 11 1989 .

Cattle or bacterially derived hyaluronidases have also been used as a spreading agent to enhance the activity of chemotherapeutics and or the accessibility of tumors to chemotherapeutics Schuller et al. 1991 Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res. 32 173 abstract no. 1034 Czejka et al. 1990 Pharmazie 45 H.9 . Combination chemotherapy with hyaluronidase is effective in the treatment of a variety of cancers including urinary bladder cancer Horn et al. 1985 J. Surg. Oncol. 28 304 307 squamous cell carcinoma Kohno et al. 94 J. Cancer Res. Oncol. 120 293 297 breast cancer Beckenlehner et al. 1992 J. Cancer Res. Oncol. 118 591 596 and gastrointestinal cancer Scheithauer et al. 1988 Anticancer Res. 8 391 396 . Hyaluronidase is effective as the sole therapeutic agent in the treatment of brain cancer gliomas PCT published application no. WO88 02261 published Apr. 7 1988 . Administration of hyaluronidase also induces responsiveness of previously chemotherapy resistant tumors of the pancreas stomach colon ovaries and breast Baumgartner et al. 1988 Reg. Cancer Treat. 1 55 58 Zanker et al. 1986 Proc. Amer. Assoc. Cancer Res. 27 390 . Unfortunately the contaminants and non human nature of such hyaluronidases result in anaphylactic reactions.

In addition to its indirect anticancer effects cattle derived hyaluronidase has direct anticarcinogenic effects. Hyaluronidase prevents growth of tumors transplanted into mice De Maeyer et al. 1992 Int. J. Cancer 51 657 660 and inhibits tumor formation upon exposure to carcinogens Pawlowski et al. 1979 Int. J.

Given the value of cattle derived hyaluronidases as a therapeutic particularly in chemotherapy in conjunction with conventional chemotherapeutics or as a chemotherapeutic in and of itself there is a need in the field for substantially pure preparations of hyaluronidase of human origin. There is also a need for efficient cost effective methods of making hyaluronidase to provide commercially significant quantities of the enzyme. The present invention addresses these problems.

Hyaluronic acid is an essential component of the extracellular matrix. Hyaluronic acid is found in the connective tissue of mammals and is the main constituent of the vitreous of the eye. In connective tissue the water of hydration associated with hyaluronic acid creates spaces between tissues thus creating an environment conducive to cell movement and proliferation. Hyaluronic acid plays a key role in biological phenomena associated with cell motility including rapid development regeneration repair embryogenesis embryological development wound healing angiogenesis and tumorigenesis Toole 1991 Cell Biol. Extracell. Matrix Hay ed Plenum Press New York 305 341 Bertrand et al. 1992 Int. J. Cancer 52 1 6 Knudson et al. 1993 FASEB J. 7 1233 1241 . In addition hyaluronic acid levels correlate with tumor aggressiveness Ozello et al. 1960 Cancer Res. 20 600 604 Takeuchi et al. 1976 Cancer Res. 36 2133 2139 Kimata et al. 1983 Cancer Res. 43 1347 1354 .

Following spinal cord injury glial scars are produced by astrocytes and contain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans CSPGs . CSPGs play a crucial role in the inhibition of axon growth Levine 1994 Powell et al. 1997 . For example during fetal development CSPGs repel axons and inhibit neural cell adhesion. CSPG s also play an important role in boundary formation Snow et al. 1990 1992 Powell and Geller 1999 . In addition the expression of CSPG increases following injury of CNS Mckeon et al. 1991 Davies et al. 1997 .

Studies indicate that the inhibitory effects of CSPGs are principally due to the chondroitin sulfate CS glycosaminoglycan GAG sugar chain Snow et al. 1990 Cole and McCable 1991 Geisert and Bidanset 1993 . This is supported by the finding that administration of bacterial chondroitinase in fact promote axon regeneration when administered intrathecally. Moreover electrophysiological experiments determined that regenerated CST axons established functional connections Bradbury et al 2002 . In addition to their direct inhibitory effects CSPGs could also interact with cell adhesion molecules or neurotrophic factors to influence neurite outgrowth Roberts et al. 1988 Ruoslahti and Yamaguchi 1991 Miley et al. 1994 . Recombinant mammalian Hyaluronidases are thus useful to reverse the inhibition of CSPG s in the glial scar and to promote axon regeneration following injury.

The amount of sHASEGP required to sufficiently degrade CSPG s in the glial scar will vary. In some cases repeated administration of 10 5000 Units of sHASEGP by intrathecal delivery will be required to remove the CSPG s in the scar. In other cases sustained release of sHASEGP through use of a slow release formulation may be preferred. Alternatively administration of gene therapy vectors encoding sHASEGP may be effective to enhance clearance of CSPG s.

sHASEGPs can also be utilized for the treatment of herniated disks in a process known as chemonucleolysis. Chondroitinase ABC and enzyme cleaving similar substrates as sHASEGP can induce the reduction of intradiscal pressure in the lumbar spine. Sasaki et al. 2001 Ishikawa et al. 1999 . There are three types of disk injuries. A protruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In an extruded disk the fibrous wrapper has torn and the NP has oozed out but is still connected to the disk. In a sequestered disk a fragment of the NP has broken loose from the disk and is free in the spinal canal. Chemonucleolysis is effective on protruded and extruded disks but not on sequestered disk injuries. In the United States chemonucleolysis is approved only for use in the lumbar lower spine. In other countries it has also been used successfully to treat cervical upper spine hernias. Chemonucleolysis is thus a conservative alternative to disk surgery when it is preferable to reduce disk pressure.

The precise composition and structure of the carbohydrate chain s on a glycoprotein can directly influence its serum lifetime since cells in the liver and reticulo endothelial system can bind and internalize circulating glycoproteins with specific carbohydrates. Hepatocytes have receptors on their surfaces that recognize oligosaccharide chains with terminal i.e. at the outermost end s of glycans relative to the polypeptide Gal residues macrophages contain receptors for terminal Man or GlcNAc residues and hepatocytes and lymphocytes have receptors for exposed fucose residues. No sialic acid specific receptors have been found however. Although somewhat dependent on the spatial arrangement of the oligosaccharides as a general rule the greater the number of exposed sugar residues recognized by cell surface receptors in the liver and reticulo endothelial system the more rapidly a glycoprotein will be cleared from the serum. Because of the absence of sialic acid specific receptors however oligosaccharides with all branches terminated or capped with sialic acid will not promote the clearance of the protein to which they are attached.

The presence and nature of the oligosaccharide chain s on a glycoprotein can also affect important biochemical properties in addition to its recognition by sugar specific receptors on liver and reticulo endothelial cells. Removal of the carbohydrate from a glycoprotein will usually decrease its solubility and it may also increase its susceptibility to proteolytic degradation by destabilizing the correct polypeptide folding pattern and or unmasking protease sensitive sites. For similar reasons the glycosylation status of a protein can affect its recognition by the immune system.

sHASEGPs can be used to remove the cumulus cells surrounding an egg prior to cryopreservation and other In Vitro fertilization techniques such an intracytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI . Hyaluronidase can be added to harvested oocytes between 10 200 U ml in buffered salt solutions. Oocytes are separated from the released cumulus cells through aspiration and washed through several washes with media lacking hyaluronidase. The eggs can then be processed for cryopreservation or IVF techniques.

sHASEGPs are also useful for the more effective penetration of chemotherapeutic agents into solid tumors. sHASEGPs can be injected intratumorally with anti cancer agents or intravenously for disseminated cancers or hard to reach tumors. The anticancer agent can be a chemotherapeutic an antibody a peptide or a gene therapy vector virus or DNA. Additionally sHASEGPs can be used to recruit tumor cells into the cycling pool for sensitization in previously chemorefractory tumors that have acquired multicultural drug resistance St Croix et al Cancer Lett 1998 Sep. 11 131 1 35 44 . sHASEGPs are also useful to enhance delivery of biologics such as monoclonal antibodies cytokines and other drugs to tumors that accumulate glycosaminoglycans. Many tumors delete genes involved with the catabolism of glycosaminoglycans such that localized accumulation can prevent antineoplastic agents and the immune system from reaching the tumor mass.

sHASEGP can also be used to increase the sensitivity of tumors that are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. In one embodiment sHASEGP is administered to a patient having a tumor associated with a LuCa 1 defect in an amount effective to increase diffusion around the tumor site e.g. to increase circulation of chemotherapeutic factors e.g. to facilitate circulation and or concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents in and around the tumor site inhibit tumor cell motility e.g. by HA degradation and or to lower the tumor cell s threshold of apoptosis i.e. bring the tumor cell s to a state of anoikis a state that renders the tumor cell s more susceptible to the action of chemotherapeutic agents or other agents that may facilitate cell death preferably preferentially facilitate programmed cell death of cells in anoikis. Chemotherapeutic agents as used herein is meant to encompass all molecules synthetic e.g. cisplatin as well as naturally occurring e.g. tumor necrosis factor IF that facilitate inhibition of tumor cell growth and preferably facilitate more preferably preferentially facilitate tumor cell death.

Of particular interest is the use of sHASEGP for the treatment of metastatic and non metastatic cancers particularly metastatic cancers having decreased to undetectable hyaluronidase activity relative to non cancerous normal cells. sHASEGP can be used as a chemotherapeutic agent alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutics in the treatment of any of a variety of cancers particularly invasive tumors. For example sHASEGP can be used in the treatment of small lung cell carcinoma squamous lung cell carcinoma as well as cancers of the breast ovaries head and neck or any other cancer associated with depressed levels of hyaluronidase or with a defective LuCa 1 hpHAse gene e.g. a LuCa 1 gene that does not provide for expression of adequate hpHAse levels or encodes a defective hpHAse that does not provide for an adequate level of hyaluronidase activity or other defect associated with decreased hyaluronan catabolism. sHASEGP is preferable for the treatment of malignancies associated with deficient HA catabolism as it does not require cellular participation for degradation to occur.

The specific dosage appropriate for administration can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art according to the factors discussed above see for example Harrison s Principles of Internal Medicine 11th Ed. 1987 . In addition the estimates for appropriate dosages in humans may be extrapolated from determinations of the level of enzymatic activity of sHASEGP in vitro and or dosages effective in animal studies. For example 70 300 TRU hyaluronidase is effective in reducing the tumor load in a scid mouse. Given this information the corresponding dosages in the average 70 kg human would range from about 250 000 1 200 000 TRU hyaluronidase. The amount of sHASEGP administered to a human patient is generally in the range of 1 TRU to 5 000 000 TRU of enzymatic activity preferably between about 1 000 TRU to 2 500 000 TRU more preferably between about 100 000 TRU to 1 500 000 TRU normally between about 250 000 TRU and 1 200 000 TRU with about 725 000 TRU representing average prescribed doses.

In one embodiment a sHASEGP is formulated in a 0.15 M saline solution containing sHASEGP at a concentration of about 150 000 TRU cc. The formulation is then injected intravenously at 15 000 TRU kg body weight of the patient. Alternatively the enzyme formulation may also be injected subcutaneously to allow the hyaluronidase to perfuse around the tumor site. In a preferred embodiment sHASEGP is injected peritumorally or into the tumor mass. In another preferred embodiment sHASEGP is formulated as a liposome and is delivered by injection either intravenously or at or near the site of cancerous cells associated with a defect in the LuCa 1 hpHAse gene. Injection of sHASEGP intravenously results in sHASEGP in the tumor site. Moreover Super Sialated sHASEGP is preferably for parenteral administration in that the terminal sialic acids on sHASEGP prevent the clearance of the enzyme from circulation by the reticuloendothelial system. Comparisons of super sialated sHASEGP to non sialated bovine and ovine hyaluronidases reveal that substantially more favorable pharmacokinetics is achieved.

The efficacy of most gene delivery vehicles in vivo does not correspond to the efficacy found in vitro. Glycosaminoglycans can hinder the transfer and diffusion of DNA and viral vectors into many cell types. The levels such extracellular matrix material can hinder the process considerably. Dubensky et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1984 December 81 23 7529 33 demonstrated that hyaluronidase when combined with collagenase could facilitate transduction of DNA in vivo. It has been demonstrated that adeno associated virus is also amenable to hyaluronidase mediated gene therapy Favre et al. 2000 August 7 16 1417 20 .

We have determined herein that channels of defined size in the extracellular matrix are opened with sHASEGP. These pores generally do not enhance the diffusion of substances greater than about 200 500 nm in diameter. However smaller molecules such as retroviruses adenoviruses adeno associated viruses and DNA complexes are amenable to sHASEGP mediated diffusion. The fact that sHASEGPs generally act to open channels that are substantially large enough to permit the movement of most therapeutic and other pharmacological agents of interest including macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids as well as macromolecular complexes such as gene therapy vectors and yet are generally not so large as to promote the dislocation and movement of cells provides particularly advantageous applications in treating preventing and or diagnosing a variety of diseases for example.

Alternatively viruses can be armed with the sHASEGP gene to facilitate their replication and spread within a target tissue for example. The target tissue can be a cancerous tissue whereby the virus is capable of selective replication within the tumor. The virus can also be a non lytic virus wherein the virus selectively replicates under a tissue specific promoter. As the viruses replicate the coexpression of sHASEGP with viral genes will facilitate the spread of the virus in vivo.

Alternatively the nucleic acid of interest and a sHASEGP can be used simultaneously or consecutively or so as to be staggered over time. Simultaneously refers to a coadministration. In this case these two essential components can be mixed to form a composition prior to being administered or can be administered at the same time to the cell or the host organism. It is also possible to administer them consecutively that is to say one after the other irrespective of which component of the combination product according to the invention is administered first. Finally it is possible to use a mode of administration which is staggered over time or is intermittent and which stops and restarts at intervals which may or may not be regular. It is pointed out that the routes and sites of administration of the two components can be different. According to one particularly preferred embodiment the sHASEGP is administered before the nucleic acid with the route of administration of the two components preferably being similar. The time interval between the injections is not critical and can be defined by the skilled person. It is possible to recommend an interval of from 10 min to 72 h advantageously of from 30 min to 48 h preferably of from 1 to 24 h and very preferably of from 1 to 6 h.

In addition the combination product according to the invention can also be combined with one or more molecule s which is are intended to improve the nucleic acid administration. The molecules can be molecules which have a protective effect on the nucleic acid protection with regard to degradation in the cell which improve its penetration or its expression in the host cell fusogenic peptide nuclear localization signal etc. which enable one particular cell type to be targeted ligand or antibody which recognizes a cell surface protein etc. or which prolong the therapeutic effect immunosuppressive agent etc. . The combination product can also be combined with agents that facilitate transfection proteins etc. .

The combination product according to the invention can be prepared with a view to local or parenteral administration or to administration by the digestive route. Routes which may in particular be mentioned are the intragastric subcutaneous intracardiac intravenous intraperitoneal intrasynovial intratumor intrapulmonary intranasal and intratracheal routes and very particularly the intramuscular route. The administration can be effected by means of any technique of the art injection oral route aerosol instillation etc. as a single dose or as a dose that is repeated once or several times after a particular time interval. The route of administration can be adjusted to suit the gene of interest to be transferred and the disease to be treated. The formulation can include pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles excipients adjuvants etc. . The substance leading to disorganization of the extracellular matrix and the nucleic acid of interest are preferably dissolved in a buffer which is suitable for pharmaceutical use and which can be hypertonic hypotonic or isotonic. Various buffers can be envisaged. Those which may be mentioned by way of illustration are a physiological saline solution 0.9 NaCl a nonphysiological saline solution 1.8 NaCl a Hepes Ringer solution a Lactate Ringer solution a buffer which is based on Tris HCl 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 to 8 1 mM EDTA 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 to 8 1 mM MgCl a phosphate buffer Krebs phosphate HO buffer a sugar glucose sucrose trehalose etc. solution or simply water.

Hypodermoclysis the subcutaneous infusion of fluids is a useful and easy hydration technique suitable for mildly to moderately dehydrated adult patients especially the elderly. The method is considered safe and does not pose any serious complications. The most frequent adverse effect is mild subcutaneous edema that can be treated by local massage or systemic diuretics. Approximately 3 L can be given in a 24 hour period at two separate sites. Common infusion sites are the chest abdomen thighs and upper arms. The preferred solution is normal saline but other solutions such as half normal saline glucose with saline or 5 percent glucose can also be used. Potassium chloride can be added to the solution bag if needed. Additionally other drugs can be delivered through similar routes. Human sHASEGP can be added to enhance fluid absorption and increase the overall rate of administration. Human sHASEGP is preferable for repeated Hypodermoclysis over slaughter house derived enzymes in that it not likely to be immunogenic as the bovine enzyme is known to be. It may be administered at home by family members or a nurse the technique should be familiar to every family physician.

In ambulatory patients hypodermoclysis sites include the abdomen upper chest above the breast over an intercostal space and the scapular area. In bedridden patients preferred sites are the thighs the abdomen and the outer aspect of the upper arm. After one to four days the needle and tubing should be changed although infusion sets have been left in place for much longer periods Without complications. Administration of 500 mL boluses over one or two hours three times a day can also be given with 150 U of sHASEGP given at the subcutaneous site before the first morning infusion

Many Molecules Injected Percutaneously e.g. by using a needle or other device that penetrates the skin and is used to deposit the molecules into a sub dermal layer reach circulation slowly or with very low efficiency. Several factors regulate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of molecules injected subcutaneously SC or intramuscularly IM . Generally larger molecules reach circulation more slowly and less efficiently without active transport into circulation. Subcutaneous bioavailability is determined by calculating the ratio of area under the curves for SC verses intravenous administration AUC AUC . A second factor is charge and affinity for matrix molecules that may play a role in sequestration of molecules subcutaneously. If these materials are degraded locally they may never reach their desired targets and thus demonstrate a decreased overall systemic bioavailability to the target organs.

Large proteins are normally given intravenously so the medicament directly available in the blood stream. It would however be advantageous if a medicament could be given subcutaneously intramuscularly or intradermally ID as these administration forms are much easier to handle for the patient. Especially if the medicament must be taken regularly during the whole life and treatment is to start early already when the patient is a child. However a medicament with a very large and labile molecule such as coagulation factor VIII of 170 to 300 kDa have normally a very low bioavailability if given subcutaneously intramuscularly or intradermally since the uptake is not enough and degradation is severe.

In addition to the need to increase bioavailability of many subcutaneously administered biologics more rapid pharmacokinetics is also critically important in instances of emergency medicine. The time required to reach intravenous access in many patients can prevent an otherwise rapid acting drug when administered systemically from being utilized. In some cases failure to reach intravenous access is then followed by subcutaneous injection which leads to additional delay in reaching the target organs. Thus the more rapid availability of subcutaneous drugs would be of benefit as a first line of treatment rather than to risk the time required to achieve intravenous access. Examples of molecules that can be delivered subcutaneously as well as intravenously include epinephrine atropine narcan lignocaine and dextrose.

An additional benefit of the invention lies in the ability to deliver equivalent or larger volumes of solutions ID SC or IM without the pain and morbidity associated with the pressure and volume of the solution at the site of injection.

By way of illustration and without limitation there are a number of biologics that can be enhanced by combination with one or more sHASEGPs e.g. by co formulation or co administration of sHASEGP before coincident with or after administration of the biologic including for example Abciximabs e.g. REOPRO Adalimumabs e.g. HUMIRA Agalsidase betas e.g. FABRAZYME Aldesleukins e.g. PROLEUKIN Alefacepts e.g. AMEVIVE Alemtuzumabs e.g. CAMPATH Alteplases e.g. ACTIVASE Alteplases e.g. CATHFLO ACTIVASE Anakinras e.g. KINERET Arcitumomabs e.g. CEA Scan Asparaginases e.g. ELSPAR Basiliximabs e.g. SIMULECT Becaplermins e.g. REGRANEX bevacizumabs e.g. AVASTIN Botulinum Toxin Type A s e.g. BOTOX Botulinum Toxin Type B s e.g. MYOBLOC Capromab Pendetides e.g. PROSTASCINT Cetuximabs e.g. ERBITUX Daclizumabs e.g. ZENAPAX Darbepoetin alphas e.g. ARANESP Denileukin diftitoxs e.g. ONTAK Dornase alphas e.g. PULMOZYME Drotrecogin alphas e.g. XIGRIS Efalizumabs e.g. RAPTIVA Epoetin alphas e.g. EPOGEN Etanercepts e.g. ENBREL Filgrastims e.g. NEUPOGEN Ibritumomabs Tiuxetans e.g. ZEVALIN Imciromab Pentetates e.g. MYOSCINT Infliximabs e.g. REMICADE Interferon alpha 2 as e.g. ROFERON A Interferon alphacon 1s e.g. INFERGEN Interferon alpha n3s e.g. ALFERON N Interferon beta 1 as e.g. AVONEX BETASERON Interferon beta 1as e.g. REBIF Interferon gamma lbs e.g. ACTIMMUNE Laronidases e.g. ALDURAZYME Nofetumomabs e.g. VERLUMA Omalizumabs e.g. XOLAIR Oprelvekins e.g. NEUMEGA Palivizumabs e.g. SYNAGIS Pegfilgrastims e.g. NEULASTA Peg interferon alpha 2 as e.g. PEGASYS Peginterferon alpha 2bs e.g. PEG INTRON Rasburicases e.g. ELITEK Reteplases e.g. RETAVASE Rituximabs e.g. RITUXAN Tenecteplases e.g. TNKase Tositumomab and Iodine 1 131s e.g. BEXXAR Trastuzumabs e.g. HERCEPTIN Urokinases e.g. ABBOKINASE .

In an effort to minimize the potential for causing further detachment or tearing of the retina during performance of vitrectomy it has previously been proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 292 509 Hageman to inject certain protease free glycosaminoglycanase enzymes into the vitreous body to cause the vitreous body to become uncoupled or disinserted from the retina prior to removal of the vitreous body. Such disinsertion or uncoupling of the vitreous body is purported to minimize the likelihood that further tearing or detachment of the retina will occur as the vitreous body is removed. Examples of specific protease free glycosaminoglycanase enzymes which may be used to bring about this vitreal disinsertion purportedly include chondroitinase ABC chondroitinase AC chondroitinase B chondroitin 4 sulfatase chondroitin 6 sulfatase hyaluronidase and beta glucuronidase.

Although hyaluronidase enzyme has been known to be usable for various ophthalmic applications including the vitrectomy adjunct application described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 292 509 Hageman published studies have indicated that the hyaluronidase enzyme may itself be toxic to the retina and or other anatomical structures of the eye. See The Safety of Intravitreal Hyaluronidase Gottleib J. L. Antoszyk A. N. Hatchell D. L. and Soloupis P. Invest Ophthalmol V is Sci 31 11 2345 52 1990 . Moreover the used of impure slaughterhouse preparations of hyaluronidase can cause uveitis or inflammation of the eye. The use of human sHASEGP is thus preferable in both its increased potency purity and lack of animal origin that can give rise to immunogenic reactions and antibody mediated neutralization following repeated administration. In another embodiment a pegylated form of a sHASEGP can be injected into the eye. Such a pegylated sHASEGP is not cleared from the vitreous in such a rapid fashion and maintains its activity in the vitreous for a longer period of time.

The ophthalmic toxicity of some hyaluronidase preparations has been confirmed by other investigators who have proposed that such hyaluronidase preparations be used as a toxic irritant for causing experimentally induced neovascularization of the eye in animal toxicity models see An Experimental Model of Preretinal Neovascularization in the Rabbit Antoszyk A. N. Gottleib J. L. Casey R. C. Hatchell D. L. and Machemer R. Invest Ophthalmol V is Sci 32 1 46 51 1991 . The use of a highly purified sHASEGP devoid of mercury based and cattle or bacterially derived contaminants is preferable for intraocular procedures. Moreover a recombinant human sHASEGP is preferable over slaughterhouse derived preparations in both purity lack of bovine pathogens and reduced risk of immunogenicity. Most preferably a pegylated sHASEGP is envisioned.

An enzymatic method using a human sHASEGP is thus provided for treating ophthalmic disorders of the mammalian eye. In one embodiment of the invention said sHASEGP is PEGylated to prolong its residence within the vitreous and prevent localized uptake. Prevention of neovascularization and the increased rate of clearance from the vitreous of materials toxic to retina are accomplished by administering an amount of hyaluronidase effective to liquefy the vitreous humor of the treated eye without causing toxic damage to the eye. Liquefaction of the vitreous humor increases the rate of liquid exchange from the vitreal chamber. This increase in exchange removes those materials and conditions whose presence causes ophthalmologic and retinal damage.

It is known that hyaluronidase has the effect of depolymerizing the long mucopolysaccharide chains of the fundamental substance responsible for the retention of bound water and of the slowing by capillary compression of the diffusion of organic liquids which eliminate metabolic wastes. Such retention of water and wastes associated with fat overloading of the lipocytes constitutes classical pigskin edema or orange peel edema. This depolymerization will therefore cut the long chains of mucopolysaccharides into shorter chains whence the elimination of the bound water of wastes restoration of the venous and lymphatic circulation and disappearance of local edema.

Use of sHASEGP by way of subcutaneous administration is thus preferred for the removal of glycosaminoglycans involved in the accumulation of so called cellulite and to promote lymphatic flow. Human sHASEGP is preferred for the treatment of cellulite in that it is capable of removal of said glycosaminoglycans without the inflammatory components of slaughter house derived proteins and is of high purity and is not likely to be immunogenic. The sHASEGP can be administered through repeated subcutaneous injections through transdermal delivery in the form of ointments or creams or through the use of injectable slow release formulations to promote the continual degradation of glycosaminoglycans and prevent their return.

Hyaluronan has several biological effects that are in part related to its molecular size West D. C. Kumar S. Exp. Cell. Res. 183 179 196 1989 . The content of hyaluronan in an organ increases in different conditions of inflammation of that organ. Thus an increased concentration of hyaluronan has been shown in tissue from different organs characterized by inflammatory immunological injury such as alveolitis Nettelbladt et al. Am Rev Resp Dis 1989 139 759 762 and myocardial infarction Waldenstrom et al. J Clin Invest 1991 88 5 1622 1628 . Other examples are allograft rejection after a renal Hallgren et al. J Exp Med 1990a 171 2063 2076 Wells et al. Transplantation 1990 50 240 243 small bowel Wallander et al. Transplant Int 1993 6 133 137 or cardiac H llgren et al. J Clin Invest 1990b 85 668 673 transplantation or a myocardial inflammation of viral origin Waldenstrom et al. Eur J Clin Invest 1993 23 277 282 .

The occurrence of interstitial edemas in connection with the grafting of an organ constitutes a severe problem in the field of transplantation surgery. As much as 25 of the grafts will swell to such a degree that the function will temporarily be lost. Moreover in 2 3 of the cases the swelling causes disruption of the kidney resulting in a massive haemorrhage.

SHASEGP may be used to degrade accumulated glycosaminoglycans in an organ transplant. Removal of such glycosaminoglycans promotes removal of water from the graft and thus organ function. Dose ranging from 500 10 000 Units kg may be administered to reduce interstitial pressure as such.

Hyaluronan levels are elevated in a number of cerebrospinal pathologic conditions. Levels of cerebrospinal hyaluronan are normally less than 200 g L in adults Laurent et al. Acta Neurol Scand 1996 September 94 3 194 206 . These levels can elevate to over 8 000 g L in diseases such as meningitis spinal stenosis head injury and cerebral infarction. Thus administration of sHASEGP for example by intrathecal delivery or systemic injection of a sHASEGP PEGylated sHASEGP or super sialated sHASEGP can be utilized to degrade critically elevated levels of substrate.

The lack of effective lymphatics in the brain can also lead to life threatening edema following head trauma. Hyaluronan accumulation is a result of increased synthesis by HA synthases and decreased degradation. Accumulation of hyaluronan can initially serve the beneficial purpose of increasing water content in the damaged tissue to facilitate leukocyte extravasation but continued accumulation can be lethal. Administration of human sHASEGP to a patient suffering from head trauma can thus removal tissue hyaluronan accumulation and the water associated with it. Human sHASEGP can be administered intrathecally through a shunt or alternatively sHASEGP PEGylated sHASEGP or Super Sialated sHASEGP preferably human versions thereof can be administered intravenously to reach the brain tissue.

Following ischemia and reperfusion of the brain as occurs in stroke the hyaluronan content typically increases dramatically due to increased expression of HA synthases and decreased catabolism. Failure of ion pumps and leakage of plasma into the interstitium results in fluid retention that if not properly cleared by the lymphatics results in tissue necrosis. Some groups have attempted to prevent interstitial fluid accumulation following ischemia reperfusion by blocking vascular permeability. However once the fluid has extravasated preventing vascular permeability can prevent resolution of edema and exacerbate conditions. As noted above human sHASEGP can be administered intrathecally e.g. through a shunt or sHASEGP PEGylated sHASEGP or Super Sialated sHASEGP preferably human versions thereof can be administered intravenously to reach the brain tissue.

Human sHASEGP can also be used in the treatment of edema associated with brain tumors particularly that associated with glioblastoma multiform. The edema associated with brain tumors results from the accumulation of hyaluronan in the non cancerous portions of the brain adjacent the tumor. Administration of hyaluronidase to the sites of hyaluronan accumulation e.g. by intravenous injection or via a shunt can relieve the edema associated with such malignancies by degrading the excess hyaluronan at these sites. Thus hyaluronidase is successful in the treatment of brain tumors not only in the reduction of the tumor mass and inhibition of tumor growth and or metastasis but it also is useful in relieving edema associated with the malignancy. Human sHASEGP can be administered for treatment of edema in a manner similar to that for administration of bovine testicular hyaluronidase to treat edema see e.g. Sa Earp Arq. Braz. Med. 44 217 20 .

Without being bound to a particular application or mechanism of action sHASEGPs can potentially ameliorate ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and or other CNS damaging conditions by one or more of the following i increasing oxygenation of damaged tissue by reducing intracranial pressure ii facilitating the dissolution of clots and resorption of toxic metabolites iii suppressing leukocyte extravasation into infarcted or hemorrhaged regions e.g. by removal of hyaluronan which is a receptor for CD44 iv promotion of neural regeneration of damaged tissue or v increasing cerebral vasculogenesis.

It has been shown that the administration of hyaluronidase in animal models following experimental myocardial infarct can reduce infarct size Maclean et al. Science 1976 Oct. 8 194 4261 199 200 . The proposed mechanism by which bovine hyaluronidase reduces infarct size in animals is by reducing hyaluronan accumulation that occurs following ischemia reperfusion. Reduction of infarct size is believed to occur from increased lymph drainage and increased tissue oxygenation and reduction of myocardial water content. While reduced infarct size could be obtained in animal models the benefits were not realized in larger clinical studies in humans. Bovine testes hyaluronidase possesses a remarkably short serum half life of approximately 3 minutes in animals and man Wolf et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 1982 August 222 2 331 7 . This short half life is due to the terminal mannose residues that are readily recognized by the scavenger receptors of the reticuloendothelial system. While small animals may benefit from hyaluronidase due to a smaller vascular bed an enzyme with increased half life is needed. Super sialated sHASEGP possesses more favorable pharmacokinetics due to sialation for which there is no scavenger receptor. Super sialated sHASEGP in doses ranging from 100 200 000 Units kg may be utilized to facilitate resolution of excess hyaluronan following ischemia reperfusion and to reduce infarct size.

Super sialated sHASEGP may also be used to limit coronary plaques from arteriosclerosis. Such plaques accumulate glycosaminoglycans and mediate macrophage and foam cell adhesion Kolodgie et al. Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2002 Oct. 1 22 10 1642 8 . Administration of Super Sialated sHASEGP can be used to reduce plaque formation. As repeated administration of hyaluronidase is contemplated at doses from 100 100 000 U kg the need to utilize a human recombinant protein with low risk of immunogenicity and increased half life will result in superior reduction of plaques.

Tissue necrosis occurs in many diseases due to venous insufficiency. The lack of sufficient oxygenation is one of the main obstacles for regrowth of the tissue. It has been demonstrated that intra arterial hyaluronidase treatment significantly improves the clinical picture in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease Elder et al. Lancet 1980 648 649 . sHASEGP can be injected intra arterially 3 5 times a week at doses from 10 200 000 Units.

Slaughterhouse derived hyaluronidase is commonly used for peribulbar block in local anesthesia prior ophthalmic surgery. The presence of the enzyme prevents the need for additional blocks and speeds the time to the onset of akinesia loss of eye movement . Peribulbar and sub Tenon s block are the most common applications of hyaluronidase for ophthalmic procedures. Since the discontinuation of Wydase reports of increased diplopia and ptosis have been reported with peribulbar block Brown et al 1999 25 1245 9 .

With Wyeth s discontinuance of Wydase bovine testes derived hyaluronidase material is now supplied by compounding pharmacies. However there are several concerns with using an extemporaneously compounded sterile product www.ashp.org shortage hyaluronidase.cfm cfid 11944667 CFToken 9426953 ref ref . Compounded preparations are not FDA approved products. As such the FDA has no control over the quality or consistency of the manufacturing process.

SHASEGP from 10 500 Units can be mixed directly with 5 ml 2 lidocaine Xylocalne 5 ml 0.5 bupivacaine Marcaine and optionally with epinephrine 1 200 000. sHASEGP can be used to increase the onset of akinesia and to remove the need for additional blocks. sHASEGP is also ideal for akinesia for cosmetic surgery in blepharoplasties and face lifts. sHASEGP can also be utilized following such surgical procedures to diffuse anti inflammatories and to reduce tissue swelling.

SHASEGP may also be mixed with a buffering solution such as bicarbonate to prevent discomfort during the injection procedure. SHASEGP can also be mixed with anesthesia for lacerations to both reduce the total volume of material required for injection and to reduce pain from swelling of tissue.

As described herein the compositions and methods of the present invention can be used to promote or enhance the delivery of anesthetics and other pharmacologic agents such as members of the various classes of pharmaceutically effective agents referred to herein to any of a variety of mammalian tissues in vivo. In that regard sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can be used to facilitate the diffusion and therefore promote the delivery of small molecule pharmacologic agents such as anesthetics anti infectives and anti inflammatories for example as well as larger molecule pharmacologic agents such as proteins including e.g. enzymes monoclonal antibodies and the like nucleic acids including deoxyribonucleic acids e.g. genes and antisense molecules and ribonucleic acids including molecules for RNA interference RNAi and the like and macromolecular compositions which may comprise a combination of such components including combinations of nucleic acids proteins carbohydrates lipids and lipid based molecules and the like . By way of illustration and without limitation molecules and macromolecular complexes ranging from less than about 10 nm to around 500 nm in diameter particularly from about 20 to 200 nm are likely to exhibit dramatic improvements in delivery through interstitial spaces when the interstitial space has been previously or is coincidentally exposed to a sHASEGP as described and illustrated herein.

Without being restricted to a particular theory of mechanism of action it is believed that sHASEGP of the present invention functions principally by hydrolyzing glycosaminoglycans within the extracellular matrix surrounding mammalian cells to create pore like passages or channels that facilitate diffusion or other movement of molecules within the exposed extracellular matrix and furthermore that permeabilizing such portions of the extracellular matrix has the greatest effect on the diffusion or spreading of molecules that are not so large as to be also hindered by other macromolecular components of the extracellular matrix such as an overarching network of collagen. The extent of the spreading effect obtainable with a given sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof in a particular tissue setting can be readily ascertained as illustrated herein by assessing the effect of the sHASEGP or domain thereof on the diffusion of detectable test molecules of various sizes such as fluoresceinated or otherwise labeled beads within the test tissue either with or without pretreatment or concomitant treatment with sHASEGP or domain thereof at a range of times and concentrations. By way of illustration in the case of recombinant rHuPH20 injected subcutaneously into the lateral skin of mice fluoresceinated bead diffusion tests as exemplified herein indicated that the effects on diffusion were greatest with particles of less than about 500 nm in diameter.

It is further believed that larger macromolecules exemplified by beads of 500 nm or larger may be hindered in diffusion not only by their larger size but by their potential interaction with other relatively more open networks within the extracellular matrix such as a network formed from strands of interstitial collagen. In addition and unlike described animal derived hyaluronidases presently preferred sHASEGPs of the present invention do not contain agents that promote extravasation or contaminating agents such as collagenases that may open larger channels or other contaminants that may provoke immune reactions. In particular applications in which larger pores or channels are desired sHASEGP or a soluble human hyaluronidase domain thereof can be combined with preferably relatively pure forms of other matrix degrading enzymes such as collagenases to facilitate further spreading of larger size macromolecular complexes or cells. For most applications the use of an agent that promotes the permeability of macromolecules having a size of less than about 500 nm and more preferably less than about 200 nm is very advantageous in that the agent does not substantially promote the movement of cells within a treated tissue but promotes the passage of smaller complexes and agents.

As described and illustrated herein sHASEGPs can be used to enhance the delivery of a variety of other pharmacologic and or other agents to tissues within the human body including tissues such as those at the back of the eye that are typically relatively difficult to reach . Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that sHASEGPs can enhance the pharmacokinetic and or pharmacodynamic profiles of a number of such agents by potentially enhancing their diffusion or permeation within a tissue and or by enhancing their convective transport by increasing bulk fluid flow within the interstitial space of a tissue. For purposes of illustration and without limitation examples of pharmacologic agents that can be combined with sHASEGPs of the present invention e.g. combined by co formulation with one or more sHASEGPs or by co administration with one or more sHASEGPs which may be administered prior to coincident with or following administration of the agent for treatment of various conditions affecting the eye include for example Angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatins anecortave acetates e.g. RETAANE endostatins thrombospondins e.g. thrombospondin 1 and thrombospondin 2 anti angiogenic antibodies and other anti angiogenic agents or vascular targeting agents VTAs e.g. anti VEGF antibodies such as bevacizumabs e.g. AVASTIN carboxyamido triazole CAI Interleukin 12 IL 12 OLTIPRAZ 5 2 pyrazinyl 4 methyl 1 2 3 thio ne SU 5416 TNP 470 thalidomide and the like Anti cataract and anti diabetic retinopathy substances such as aldose reductase inhibitors AR15 for example tolrestats e.g. ALREDASE and zopolrestats e.g. ALOND lisinoprils enalaprils statils and thiol cross linking substances and the like Anti inflammatory agents including steroidal and non steroidal anti inflammatory agents as described herein and in the art Anti infectives including compounds as described below as well as a number of ophthalmic preparations thereof such as BLEPHAMIDE CILOXAN POLYTRIM TOBRADEX VIGAMOX ZYMAR Beta adrenergic blocking agents such as betaxolols e.g. BETOPTIC S timolols e.g. BETIMOL and TIMOPTIC and combinations thereof e.g. timolols and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as a dorzolamide e.g. COSOP Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamides brinzolamides e.g. AZOP dichlorophenamides dorzolamides e.g. TRUSOPT and in combinations with other agents as in e.g. COSOP methazolamides and the like Mydriatics such as atropine sulfates cyclopentolates homatropines scopolamines tropicamides eucatropines and hydroxyamphetamines and the like Photodynamic therapy agents such as verteporfin e.g. VISUDYNE Prostaglandin analogs such as bimatoprosts e.g. LUMIGAN latanoprosts e.g. XALATAN and travoprosts e.g. TRAVATAN Sympathomimetics such as brimonidines e.g. ALPHAGAN P as well as combinations thereof such as combinations of a beta adrenergic blocking agent and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor as in COSOPT and numerous other classes of agents such as anti infectives and various other physiological modulators as described below or elsewhere herein and or as known in the art or newly developed.

A common side effect occurring in postoperative cataract patients is a significant early and occasionally prolonged rise in intraocular pressure. Such a condition is sometimes serious especially in patients with glaucomatous optic disc changes. Although the pressure increase tends to be more severe when visco elastic agents such as hyaluronic acid are injected into the eye during surgery the intraocular pressure can become elevated postoperatively even when such agents are not utilized. Furthermore such a pressure increase can occur even when no additional medications are used during the surgical procedure. In some cases it is advantageous to leave a viscoelastic agent in the eye which often necessitates giving patients large doses of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. These inhibitors lower the intraocular pressure by decreasing the formation of aqueous humor a fluid that is normally secreted in the eye by the ciliary body. Current methods for relieving postoperative pressure increases in the eye include various types of eye drops such as beta adrenergic blocking agents sympathomimetic agents miotics alpha II selective agents carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin agents.

A preferred method of removing the viscoelastic such as hyaluronic acid is by injection of sHASEGP during or immediately following anterior segment or posterior segment surgical procedures although other methods of administration known in the art are possible as well. It is preferred if the hyaluronic acid and the sHASEGP are administered by injection into the anterior chamber during anterior segment ocular surgical procedures to allow the hyaluronic acid to act as a spacer during the start of the surgical procedure. In some cases of corneal transplantation the hyaluronic acid and sHASEGP combination may be placed on the surface of the intraocular structures prior to suturing the corneal transplant in place. This combination may also be used in posterior segment surgery such as retina or vitreous surgery.

In some cases it may be advisable to leave a visco elastic agent such as Healon Viscoat or other space occupying substances in the anterior chamber of the eye at the conclusion of surgery. This is especially true in positive pressure rise when the intraocular contents tend to come forward and press against the posterior surface of the cornea. If this occurs in an eye with a synthetic intraocular lens in place pressure on the corneal endothelium can cause significant damage to the cells and subsequent corneal swelling and opacification can occur which are associated with decreased vision. Typically if a patient s intraocular pressure is significantly elevated at the conclusion of the operative procedure it is necessary to give such a patient large doses of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors as well as topical eye drops such as beta blockers and alpha II agonists in order to decrease aqueous formation and or to increase aqueous outflow. These agents all have significant side effects and in some instances are contraindicated in patients with various types of medical conditions such as breathing problems heart disease or high blood pressure. However the use of sHASEGP in these situations will eliminate the necessity of giving these patients large doses of such drugs.

Furthermore there is a significant amount of hyaluronic acid in the trabecular meshwork. The sHASEGP will break this down and therefore improve the outflow of the aqueous through the trabecular meshwork. The patient s intraocular pressure will therefore decrease. The combination of sHASEGP with other anterior chamber agents such as a methylcellulose Ocucoat for example commercially available from Storz Instrument Co. used as spacers and or protective agents in cataract surgery will also be efficacious in preventing significant pressure rises because it will in effect open the trabecular meshwork and allow more aqueous humor drainage by breaking down a significant amount of the hyaluronic acid present in the trabecular meshwork.

Removal of glycosaminoglycans from the trabecular meshwork is also useful for the reduction of intraocular pressure in individuals suffering form open angle glaucoma. Human sHASEGP can be administered by subconjunctuval injection or injection directly in the anterior chamber. Since the sHASEGP acts enzymatically even relatively limited amounts of sHASEGP can effectively function as a viscoelastic antidote or for other situations that are aided or improved by application of a glycosaminoglycanase. As with other uses the units of hyaluronidase activity provided by the sHASEGP for optimum application will depend in part on the particular situation being treated especially the amount of glycosaminoglycan degradation that is desired but can be readily assessed using appropriate models and then optimized as appropriate for particular uses. By way of illustration the units of sHASEGP to be applied as an antidote will be influenced inter alia by the particular procedure employed and the amount of viscoelastic applied and also on whether any of the applied viscoelastic is to be removed using other procedures such as irrigation and aspiration. Where sHASEGP is used following irrigation and aspiration generally amounts providing in the range of 10 to 12 000 units typically 100 to 5 000 units more typically 500 to 2 000 units may be applied although this will again depend on the particular application. Where sHASEGP is used to obviate the need for irrigation and aspiration larger amounts will be applied in order to effectively digest a larger volume of applied viscoelastic with amounts generally providing in the range of 50 to 20 000 units typically 400 to 10 000 more typically 1 500 to 5 000 units may be applied although this will again depend on the particular application.

In the case of sHASEGPs being used to reduce intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma application of sHASEGPs can also be used as a primary treatment to reduce IOP associated with glaucoma and thereby potentially avoid the need for surgical procedures such as glaucomal filtration glaucomal drainage implants tube shunts laser trabeculoplasty cyclophotocoagulation or iridotomy. Thus sHASEGPs of the present invention can be introduced for example by injection into the anterior chamber of the eye to provide a minimally invasive means for reducing intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the administration of sHASEGPs in such settings can enhance fluid outflow via the trabecular meshwork and thus lower IOP by reducing hydrostatic and or oncotic pressures within the anterior chamber.

In the case of sHASEGPs being used to used to dissolve vitreous aggregates or floaters which are generally macroscopic opaque aggregates of vitreous fibers the administration of sHASEGP to the vitreous body can be used to promote disaggregation.

Similarly sHASEGPs as described herein can be applied to the vitreous to promote the resolution of vitreous hemorrhages i.e. extravasation of blood into the vitreous which can occur in connection with conditions such as diabetic retinopathy retinal neovascularization retinal vein occlusion posterior vitreous detachment retinal tears ocular traumas and the like. The presence of vitreous hemorrhages which are typically slow to resolve can delay complicate or prevent procedures that require the retina to be visualized through the vitreous for diagnosis and or for treatment procedures such as laser photocoagulation and the like which are often primary treatments for conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Use of sHASEGPs to promote resolution of such vitreous hemorrhages can thus be used to facilitate diagnosis of retinal conditions and or to obviate the need for more radical procedures such as vitrectomy.

In the case of sHASEGPs being used to promote vitreo retinal detachment in treating conditions such as diabetic retinopathy the administration of sHASEGP into the vitreous can be used to promote detachment or uncoupling of the vitreous body from the retina. In this context sHASEGP may not only promote the detachment but help it to occur in a manner that reduces the potential for retinal distortion or tearing.

sHASEGPs of the present invention can also be used for treating corneal opacities. In that regard a variety of distortions or deformities can affect the normally organized structure of the cornea and lead to disruptions in the passage of light through the cornea and concomitant impairments in vision. Thus a number of conditions and causes lead to corneal distortions that may appear as scars hazing or opacification. In applying sHASEGPs to the improvement or treatment of such corneal conditions the sHASEGP in a pharmaceutically acceptable solution which may comprise one or more additional pharmacologic agents can be introduced to the cornea by any of several routes of administration depending in part on the extent and location of the corneal injury. By way of illustration sHASEGPs can be introduced onto the outer surface of the eye using drops or other topical application for example potentially encapsulated within carriers such as liposomes and the like that can be used to facilitate transfer across the corneal epithelium by injection or microinjection onto or into the cornea itself or by other approaches to the corneal tissue. In addition to biochemical or mechanical aids for promoting delivery other means for promoting permeation such as iontophoresis can likewise be applied.

sHASEGPs of the present invention can also be used for example to enhance the permeability of agents employed in photodynamic therapy PDT . PDT is a treatment for choroidal neovascular membranes CNVM which are generally leaky vascular structures under the retina in the wet form of age related macular degeneration AMD . In PDT a photosensitive dye such as VISUDYNE verteporfin is typically administered intravenously IV and allowed to perfuse the CNVM as well as the remainder of the body. An ophthalmologist then generally treats the CNVM with a red laser of a specific wavelength e.g. 689 nm for about 90 seconds. The non thermal laser light activates the dye such as VISUDYNE producing an active form of oxygen that both coagulates and reduces the growth of abnormal blood vessels which in turn inhibits the leakage of fluid from the CNVM. sHASEGPs of the present invention can be used for example to promote more localized administration of a dye such as VISUDYNE directly to the eye and or to facilitate the delivery of other agents that are usefully administered to the eye in connection with procedures such as PDT.

The ganglion cyst also known as a wrist cyst Bible cyst or dorsal tendon cyst is the most common soft tissue mass of the hand. It is a fluid filled sac that can be felt below the skin. It is usually attached to a tendon sheath lining which lubricates the tendon in the hand or wrist or connected with an underlying joint however some have no obvious connection to any structures. These may also occur in the foot. It often occurs when there is a tear in the ligaments overlying the lining of tendons or joints and the lining herniates out of the ligamentous defect causing a bump under the skin. Because there is often inflammation associated the inflamed tissue produces a jelly like fluid that fills the protruding sac. They may be rock hard due to a high pressure of the mucous like fluid contained within the cyst and are often mistaken for a bony prominence.

sHASEGP can be used to ameliorate ganglion cysts. Intralesional injection of sHASEGP from 5 1000 Units followed by fine needle aspiration will remove the cyst without the need for surgery. Corticosteroids may be optionally injected as well with the sHASEGP. Additional injection may be required for some patients.

Glycosaminoglycan GAG infiltration of the skin is a feature of hyperthyroidism hypothyroidism pretibial myxedema scleromyxedema and scleredema. Hyaluronic acid is the main GAG in all the conditions and in normal skin. There is minimal histologic variability of GAG dermal distribution. The acquired cutaneous mucinoses exhibit similar skin GAG distribution and biochemical composition. The morphologic differences in fibroblastic activity suggest that the mucinoses of scleredema and scleromyxedema represent a local process whereas the GAG infiltration of thyroid diseases may have a systemic origin. These disorders may be ameliorated with a sHASEGP from both a local and systemic route of administration. For chronic therapy a PEGylated sHASEGP may be envisioned.

Levels of Hyaluronan in broncheoalveolar lavages BAL from normal individuals are generally below 15 ng ml. However BAL levels rise dramatically in conditions of respiratory distress Bjermer Clin Res Ed 1987 Oct. 3 295 6602 803 6 . In ARDS for example hyaluronan levels can increase to 500 ng ml whereas in farmers lung BAL levels can surpass 1000 ng ml Hallgren et al 1989 March 139 3 682 7 Larrson et al 1992 January 101 1 109 14 . The increased hyaluronan in the lung can prevent oxygen diffusion and gas exchange as well as activating neutrophil and macrophage responses.

Bovine preparations of hyaluronidase are no preferable for the treatment of such conditions for a number of reasons. First slaughterhouse testes derived preparations of hyaluronidase are known to be contaminated with serine proteases such as acrosin. Secondly the foreign nature of the bovine enzymes increase the probability of an anaphylactic reaction which could result in death of the patient. Thus a highly purified preparation of recombinant human sHASEGP can be delivered by either pulmonary or intravenous delivery. Human sHASEGP can also be administered to patients suffering from other pulmonary complications that are associated with elevated glycosaminoglycans or to enhance the delivery of other co delivered molecules to the lung.

The invention will now be described in greater detail by reference to the following non limiting examples

The following example provides for a rapid assay for measurement of the hyaluronidase activity of sHASEGP. This assay can be related to the TRU the IU or NFU through use of a W.H.O. standard preparation of hyaluronidase.

The free carboxyl groups on glucuronic acid residues of Hyaluronan are biotinylated in a one step reaction using biotin hydrazide Pierce Sulfo NHS Pierce and 1 Ethyl dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide Sigma . This biotinylated HA substrate is covalently coupled to a 96 well microtiter plate in a second reaction. At the completion of the enzyme reaction residual substrate is detected with an avidin peroxidase reaction that can be read in a standard ELISA plate reader. As the substrate is covalently bound to the microtiter plate artifacts such as pH dependent displacement of the biotinylated substrate does not occur. The sensitivity permits rapid measurement of Hyaluronidase activity from cultured cells and biological samples with an inter assay variation of less than 10 .

One hundred mg of HA Sigma Chemicals was dissolved in 0.1 M MES pH 5.0 to a final concentration of 1 mg ml and allowed to dissolve for at least 24 hr at 4 C. prior to coupling of biotin. Sulfo NHS Pierce Rockford Ill. was added to the CSOMES solution to a final concentration of 0.184 mg ml. Biotin hydrazide Pierce was dissolved in DMSO as a stock solution of 100 mM and added to the CSOsolution to a final concentration of 1 mM. A stock solution of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbidodiimide EDAC was prepared as a 100 mM stock solution in distilled water and added to the HA biotin solution at a final concentration of 30 mM. This solution was left stirring overnight at 4 C. Unlinked biotin and EDAC were removed by dialysis against water with 3 changes of 1000 volume of water. The dialyzed biotinylated HA bHA was aliquoted and stored at 20 C. for up to several months.

Sulfo NHS was diluted to 0.184 mg ml in water with the bHA at a concentration of 0.2 mg ml and pipetted into 96 well COVALINK NH plates NUNC Placerville N.J. at 500 per well. EDAC was diluted to 0.123 mg ml in water and pipetted into the COVALINK NH plates with the bHA solution resulting in a final concentration of 10 g well bHA and 6.15 g well EDAC. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 C. or for 2 hr at 23 C. which gave comparable results. After covalent immobilization of bCS0on the microtiter plates the coupling solution was removed by shaking and the plates were washed 3 times in PBS containing 2M NaCl and 50 mM MgSO Buffer A . The plates could be stored at 4 C. for up to one week.

The COVALINK NH plates with immobilized bHA were equilibrated with 100 l well assay buffer either 0.1 M formate pH 3.7 0.1 M NaCl 1 TRITON X 100 detergent 5 mM saccharolactone for lysosomal Hyaluronidase or 10 mM Hepes PH 7.4 with 1 mM CaCland 1 mg ml Human Serum Albumin ICN for neutral active enzymes. A set of standards for the calibration of enzyme activity against relative Turbidity Reducing Units rTRU s was generated by diluting bovine testicular hyaluronidase Sigma Type VI S in neutral enzyme buffer from 1.0 to 1 10rTRU well and assaying 100 l well in triplicate. Samples of acid active Hyaluronidase were diluted in lysosomal assay buffer from 1 10 to 1 130 000 were pipetted in triplicate at 100 l well. For most assays of tissue extracts and human plasma a 30 min incubation at 37 C. was sufficient. Positive and negative control wells no enzyme or no ABC see below respectively were included in triplicate.

The reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 l well of 6M Guanidine HCl followed by three washes of 300 l well with PBS 2 M NaCl 50 mM MgSO 0.05 TWEEN 20 detergent Buffer B . An avidin biotin complex ABC kit Vector Labs Burlingame Calif. was prepared in 10 ml of PBS containing 0.1 TWEEN 20 detergent which was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature during the incubation. The ABC solution was added 100 l well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The plate was washed five times with Buffer B then an o phenylenediamine OPD substrate was added at 100 l well by dissolving one 10 mg tablet of OPD in 10 ml of 0.1 M citrate PObuffer pH 5.3 and adding 7.5 l of 30 H0. The plate was incubated in the dark for 10 15 min then read using a 492 nm filter in an ELISA plate reader Titertek Multiskan PLUS ICN monitored by computer using the Delta Soft H plate reader software from Biometallics Princeton N.J. . A standard curve using the bovine testicular hyaluronidase was generated by a four parameter curve fit of the commercial hyaluronidase preparation and unknown samples were interpolated through their absorbance at 492 nm.

To analyze pH dependence of Hyaluronidases purified recombinant sHASEGP and bovine testicular hyaluronidase are used. The pH dependence of enzyme activity is measured by diluting purified sHASEGP or partially purified bovine testicular hyaluronidase to 0.1 rTRU in the following buffers 50 mM formate pH 3 4.5 50 mM acetate pH 5 6 50 mM MES pH 6 7 or 50 mM HEPES pH 7 8. Samples are assayed for 30 min at 37 C. and activity was expressed as a percent of maximal activity. NaCl was not used in buffers as it can alter the pH optima of testicular hyaluronidase preparations Gold 205 69 74 1982 Gacesa et al. 7 1287 1289 1979 physiological salt concentrations 0.15 M decreased the apparent pH optimum an effect that was more pronounced in purified preparations of the testicular enzyme than in the original crude sample.

Hyaluronan was biotinylated in a one step reaction using biotin hydrazide and EDAC. By limiting the EDAC which couples the free carboxyl groups on HA with biotin hydrazide only a small fraction of the total glucuronic acid residues on HA were labeled. This amount of EDAC 3 10M added to HA 2.8 10M results in a maximum of one molecule of biotin hydrazide coupled per 93 disaccharide units of HA.

A four parameter curve fit of bovine testicular hyaluronidase standard reactions measured at pH 3.7 and diluted from 1.0 to 1 10TRU well was prepared. Four parameter curve fits were established from the equation y A D 1 conc C B D where logy ln y 1 y y y D A D B b ln 10 and C EXP a B . The four parameters A B C D were calculated with a software program that utilized the 2 2 algorithm with linear regression Rodbard et al. 22 350 1976 . This curve fit incorporates the sigmoidal aspects the standard curve. Optimal accuracy for measurement of a sample typically occurs from 0.001 to 0.01 TRU well for a 30 min incubation. During a 60 min incubation 1 1000th of a TRU is detectable. A standard logarithmic curve also can be utilized over a shorter range of values to establish a standard curve fit.

Nucleic acid encoding Human sHASEGP may be obtained by one skilled in the art through a number of procedures including but not limited to artificial gene synthesis RT PCR and cDNA library hybridization for example see Gmachl et al 336 3 545 548 1993 Lin et al. 90 10071 10075 1993 . Alternatively clones encoding human sHASEGP may be obtained from IMAGE or other suppliers of human gene sequences Invitrogen Clone ID IOH10647 .

The full length human PH20 cDNA was calculated to be 2009 nucleotides in length and contained an open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides. The 5 UTR is unusually large which can indicate a retained intron and can inhibit translation by preventing the ribosome from binding to the correct initiating methionine codon due to 9 non coding start codons in the 5 UTR. The protein Genbank Accession number NP003108 is predicted to comprise 509 amino acids SEQ ID NO 1 with a calculated molecular mass of 58 kDa.

For sequencing of clones PCR amplified bands were excised and eluted with the Gel Extraction Kit Qiagen and cloned into the appropriate vectors with compatible ends after restriction digestion. All sequencing reactions were performed on double stranded DNA with the Taq dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit Applied Biosystems according to the manufacturer s instructions and run on an ABI Prism automated sequencer Applied Biosystems .

The human PH 20 open reading frame was obtained by amplifying a human testis cDNA library Clontech Palo Alto Calif. by Polymerase Chain Reaction using primers SEQ ID NO 14 and SEQ ID NO 47. PCR products were digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned into the NheI and BamHI sites of the vector IRESpuro2 Clontech .

A catalytically active secreted recombinant human sHASEGP expression vector capable of effective glycosylation in mammalian cells was generated as described below. Other expression constructs with promoters and selection genes for different species such as yeast and insect cells that are also capable of generating sHASEGP are contemplated. Positive selection genes such as Glutamine Synthase or Dihydrofolate Reductase DHFR may also be used. The examples given below is not intended to restrict but is rather provided as an example of several plasmid expression systems that may be used.

In order to construct secreted forms of sHASEGP truncation mutants that lack the hydrophobic C terminal end were constructed. Using a GPI cleavage prediction program the GPI anchor cleavage site was located around amino acid position N 483 in the full length GPI anchored protein. A set of seven nested 3 primers were used to construct a set of seven truncated deletion mutants lacking predicted GPI anchor starting at position Y 482 and deleted progressively by one amino acid. These primers were designed to have compatible NheI 5 and BamHI 3 sites to clone the truncation mutants in vector Irespuro2 either untagged with a stop codon in the 3 primer or as a C terminus His tagged protein for ease of purification and detection. For example reverse primers SEQ ID NO 8 SEQ ID NO 9 and SEQ ID NO 10 were used to generate deletion mutants ending at position Y 482 F 481 and I 480 without a 6 His tag. Other mutant primers were generated with the same base design with the appropriate modifications to include and exclude the particular amino acids. For generating His tagged variants the same set of primers are used as for non tagged variants except that primers lack the stop codon in the respective reverse primers the forward primer remaining the same for His tagged construction refer to primers with SEQ ID No 19 20 21 22 23 24 and 25 which are the reverse primers without stop codon corresponding to non tagged reverse primers for their respective constructs . Overlapping primers were used to construct a six amino acid spacer followed by hexahistidine within BamHI and NotI sites in Irespuro2 vector such that His tagged mutants were generated by ligation of the PCR amplified and restriction digested products within the NheI and BamHI sites in the his tag containing Irespuro2 vector.

To identify whether human sHASEGP could be modified at its carboxy terminus to generate a secreted and neutral active enzyme a series of truncations were made from the GPI anchor attachment site to the predicted catalytic domain based upon homology with the bee venom enzyme.

DNA encoding the human sHASEGP full length GPI anchored clone in IRESPuro2 was used as a template to generate the various truncated deletion mutants. Software modeling programs gave several predicted cleavage sites for the full length polypeptide. One of such predicted sites was at amino acid position N 483 SEQ ID NO 1 . PCR primers were designed to successively truncate the protein from N483 to generate six deletion mutants starting at Y 482 lacking N and ending at E 477 lacking P .

The full length GPI anchored sHASEGP clone between NheI and BanHI site in pIRESPuro2 was used as a template. This template was amplified with 5 primer containing NheI site that starts at starting Methionine of the native signal peptide at M 1 SEQ ID NO 14 and a 3 primer containing BamHI site that ends at Y 482 SEQ ID NO 8 . The PCR product was ran on a 1 agarose gel to resolve and confirm the correct sized amplified band gel purified restriction digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned into vector pIRESPuro2 Clontech between NheI and BamHI sites generating an expression vector for expressing this truncation mutant of sHASEGP ending at amino acid position N482 and lacking the GPI anchor with amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO 5 for the sequence of the resulting polypeptide of sHASEGP up to Y 482 and nucleotide sequence SEQ ID NO 48 coding nucleotides for polypeptide in SEQ ID NO 5 as indicated.

The same strategy was used with the only difference being using the appropriate 3 primer for each mutant. The respective 3 primers are as follows 

Further deletions in blocks of ten to twenty amino acids were made from the 3 end of innermost neutral pH active truncation mutant of sHASEGP which is sHASEGP up to E 477. The NheI forward primer SEQ ID NO 14 was used with an appropriately positioned 3 primer to PCR amplify a deletion mutant of sHASEGP of the desired length from the carboxy terminal end. For example PCR with primers described in SEQ ID NO 14 and SEQ ID NO 26 as the 5 and 3 primers respectively was used to generate the polypeptide in SEQ ID NO 49 when expressed from an expression construct in IresPuro2 vector. Similarly PCR with reverse 3 primers described in SEQ ID No 27 28 29 30 31 and 32 were used to generate deletion mutants ending at amino acid positions A 447 S 430 G 413 S 394 A 372 and S 347 respectively of the mature sHASEGP. The PCR products in each case were digested with NheI and BamHI enzymes and the digested product cloned into pIresPuro2 vector between NheI and BamHI sites. A few independent clones in the final expression construct from each group were tested for secreted neutral active sHASEGP activity by transient transfection in CHO cells in CD CHO serum free media Invitrogen CA and samples drawn at indicated time points for assay. Miniprep DNA prepared from overnight cultures was transfected with Genejuice Novagen Calif. transfection reagent following manufacturer recommended protocols. Hyaluronidase activity was measured by microtiter assay as described above.

Hyaluronidase activity was measured in sHASEGP truncation mutants to identify the minimally active domain for secreted neutral active hyaluronidase activity.

The results showed that all six one amino acid deletion mutants ending at indicated amino acids from Y 482 to E 477 gave higher secreted activity than GPI anchored sHASEGP.

The results also showed that deletions beyond A 467 eliminated any secreted activity. Secreted neutral activity from the A 467 clones decreased to approximately 10 of that found P478 or N 483 clones. It was therefore concluded that more of the carboxy terminal domain of human sHASEGP was required to create the neutral active hyaluronidase domain than previously assumed from the bee venom enzyme. The cysteines in the carboxy terminal domain are thus necessary for neutral activity. A very narrow range spanning approximately 10 amino acids before the GPI cleavage site at N 483 thus defined the minimally active domain.

Human sHASEGP possesses an unusually long predicted native leader peptide. Additionally the existence of two adjacent cysteine residues in the leader peptide may lead to aggregation of polypeptide multimers within the endoplasmic reticulum during high level expression and therefore prevent high level expression of a sHASEGP. A series of more efficient secretory leader peptides were therefore tested to examine for their ability to enhance the targeting of sHASEGP for secretion.

The Kappa leader peptide was constructed by overlapping primer annealing and extension PCR with primers corresponding to sequences in SEQ ID No 37 38 39 and 40. The resulting PCR amplified kappa sequence was amplified with flanking primers containing NheI site in the 5 end as described in SEQ ID NO 41 and EcoRI site at the 3 end as described in SEQ ID NO 42 . This allowed cloning the Kappa leader peptide the polypeptide sequence is as described in SEQ ID NO 43 in the Litmus 39 NEB vector between NheI and EcoRI sites. sHASEGP has an internal EcoRI site therefore this kappa construct between NheI site and EcoRI site was further amplified with a 5 SpeI primer as described in SEQ ID NO 44 and a 3 MluI primer as described in SEQ ID NO 45 . sHASEGP without GPI anchor ending at P 478 was cut out from pIresPuro2 with NheI and BamHI and cloned into a Litmus 39 NEB vector within the NheI and BamHI sites of the Litmus39 vector. This resulting sHASEGP containing Litmus vector was digested with SpeI and MluI restriction enzymes and the kappa leader construct amplified with SpeI and MluI was cloned into it. Site directed mutagenesis was performed on this Litmus 39 vector containing both Kappa and sHASEGP sequences to generate the in frame fusion of Kappa leader sequence to the mature polypeptide of sHASEGP. Primer pairs corresponding to SEQ ID NO 34 and 35 were used to generate the kappa leader with the native Asp as the terminal amino acid fused to the F 38 of sHASEGP up to P 478 as described in SEQ ID NO 46 for the polypeptide sequence of the fusion protein . Other primer pair combinations such as embodied by SEQ ID NO 33 with SEQ ID NO 35 were used to generate Kappa leader ending at the terminal Asp D fused to L 36 of sHASEGP SEQ ID NO 33 with SEQ ID NO 36 were used to generate Kappa leader ending at the Gly G before the terminal Asp D fused to L 36 of sHASEGP and SEQ ID NO 34 with SEQ ID NO 36 were used to generate Kappa ending at the Gly G before the terminal Asp D fused to F 38 of sHASEGP. The Kappa sHASEGP fusions obtained by site directed mutagenesis were gel purified digested with enzyme DpnI to digest any carryover parental DNA and then digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned in to the NheI BamHI digested HisIresPuro2 backbone which has the his tag six amino acid spacer followed by six histidines cloned in between BamHI and NotI sites in pIresPuro2 vector. Therefore upon ligation we obtain a construct that is NheI kappa sHASEGP BamHI His in pIresPuro2. Four sets of such construct were obtained that would correspond to the combinations of G or D at the Kappa leader end and L 36 or F 38 at the beginning of mature sHASEGP. A few independent clones from each type of construct were transfected into CHO cells in CD CHO medium Invitrogen CA to test whether the presence of kappa secretion leader would promote increased levels of secreted protein as compared to native secretion leader. Miniprep DNA prepared from overnight cultures were transfected with Genejuice Novagen Calif. transfection reagent following manufacturer recommended protocols and samples were drawn for testing by microtiter assay at indicated time points. Hyaluronidase activity was measured by microtiter assay as described above.

Mouse IgG Kappa chain leader peptide sHASEGP fusion constructs were tested to test for higher levels of secreted neutral active sHASEGP activity.

The enzyme assay results indicated that the IgG Kappa leader was capable of enhancing secretion of sHASEGP approximately 7 to 8 fold higher than the native secretion leader when compared with clones P478 Y 482 or N 483 that lacked such a leader. Other kappa leader constructs with variations of the leader fusion site from the Asp or the Gly of the Kappa leader to L36 or F38 of sHASEGP yielded increased levels of secreted neutral active hyaluronidase activity as well. These examples are intended to expand rather than limit the scope of the invention as other efficient secretory leader sequences may be utilized with the same technology.

A sHASEGP without an eptiope tag was generated by cloning into a bicistronic expression cassette HZ24 SEQ ID NO 51 . The HZ24 plasmid vector for expression of sHASEGP comprises a pCI vector backbone Promega DNA sequence encoding amino acids 1 482 of human PH20 hyaluronidase an internal ribosomal entry site IRES from the ECMV virus Clontech and the mouse dihydrofolate reductase DHFR gene. The pCI vector backbone also includes DNA encoding the Beta lactamase resistance gene AmpR an f1 origin of replication a Cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer promoter region CMV a chimeric intron and an SV40 late polyadenylation signal SV40 . The DNA encoding the sHASEGP construct contained a Kozak consensus sequence in the Methionine of the native signal leader and a stop codon at Tyrosine 482. The resultant construct pCI PH20 IRES DHFR SV40pa HZ 24 results in a single mRNA species driven by the CMV promoter that encodes amino acids 1 482 of PH20 and amino acids 1 187 of the dihydrofolate reductase separated by the internal ribosomal entry site.

The human PH20 open reading frame was amplified from an Invitrogen ORF clone IOH10647 Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. with a 5 primer that introduced an NheI site and Kozack consensus sequence before the Methionine of PH20 and a reverse primer that introduced a stop codon following Tyrosine 482 and introduced a BamHI restriction site. The resultant PCR product was ligated into the plasmid pIresPuro2 Clontech Palo Alto Calif. following digest of the PH20 PCR fragment with NheI and BamHI.

Non transfected DG44 CHO cells growing in GIBCO Modified CD CHO media for DHFR cells supplemented with 4 mM Glutamine and 18 ml Plurionic F68 L Gibco were seeded at 0.5 10cells ml in a shaker flask in preparation for transfection. Cells were grown at 37 C. in 5 COhumidified incubator with 120 rpm for shaking. Exponentially growing non transfected DG44 CHO cells were tested for viability prior to transfection.

60 000 000 viable cells of the non transfected DG44 CHO cell culture was pelleted and resuspended to a density of 20 000 000 cells in 0.7 mL of 2 transfection buffer 2 HeBS 40 mM Hepes pH 7.0 274 mM NaCl 10 mM KCl 1.4 mM NaHPO 12 mM dextrose . To each aliquot of resuspended cells 0.09 mL of the linear HZ24 plasmid 250 g was added and the cell DNA solutions were transferred into 0.4 cm gap BTX Gentronics electroporation cuvettes at room temperature. A negative control electroporation was performed with no plasmid DNA mixed with the cells. The cell plasmid mixes were electroporated with a capacitor discharge of 330 V and 960 F or at 350 V and 960 F.

The cells were removed from the cuvettes after electroporation and transferred into 5 mL of Modified CD CHO media for DHFR cells supplemented with 4 mM Glutamine and 18 ml Plurionic F68 L Gibco and allowed to grow in a well of a 6 well tissue culture plate without selection for 2 days at 37 C. in 5 COhumidified incubator.

Two days post electroporation 0.5 mL of tissue culture media was removed from each well and tested for presence of hyaluronidase activity.

Cells from transfection 2 350V were collected from the tissue culture well counted and diluted to 10 000 to 20 000 viable cells per mL. A 0.1 mL aliquot of the cell suspension was transferred to each well of five 96 well round bottom tissue culture plates. 0.1 mL of CD CHO media GIBCO containing 4 mM Glutamax 1 and without hypoxanthine and thymidine supplements were added to the wells containing cells final volume 0.2 mL .

Six HZ24 clones were expanded in culture and transferred into shaker flasks as single cell suspensions. Clones 3D3 3E5 2G8 2D9 1E11 and 4D10 were plated into 96 well round bottom tissue culture plates using a two dimensional infinite dilution strategy. Diluted clones were grown in a background of 500 non transfected DG44 CHO cells per well to provide necessary growth factors for the initial days in culture. Ten plates were made per subclone.

Clone 3D3 produced 24 visual subclones. Significant hyaluronidase activity was measured in the supernatants from 8 of the 24 subclones 50 Units mL and these 8 subclones were expanded into T 25 tissue culture flasks in the presence of 50 nM methotrexate. Clone 3D3 50 nM was further expanded in 500 nM methotrexate giving rise to clones producing in excess of 1 000 Units ml in shaker flasks clone 3D3 5M .

A vial of 3D3 5M was thawed and expanded from T flasks through 1 L spinner flasks in CHO CDM Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. supplemented with 100 nM Methotrexate and Glutamax Invitrogen . Cells were transferred from spinner flasks to a 5 L bioreactor Braun at an inoculation density of 4.0 10E5 viable cells per ml. Parameters were temperature setpoint 37 C pH 7.2 starting Setpoint with Dissolved Oxygen Setpoint 25 and an air overlay of 0 100 cc min. At 168 hrs 250 ml of Feed 1 Medium CD CHO 50 g L Glucose was added. At 216 hours 250 ml of Feed 2 Medium CD CHO 50 g L Glucose 10 mM Sodium Butyrate was added and at 264 hours 250 ml of Feed 2 Medium was added. This process resulted in a final productivity of 1600 Units per ml with a maximal cell density of 6 million cells ml. The addition of sodium butyrate was found to dramatically enhance the production of sHASEGP in the final stages of production.

Conditioned media from the 3D3 clone was clarified by depth filtration and tangential flow diafiltration into 10 mM Hepes pH 7.0. Soluble HASEGP was then purified by sequential chromatography on Q Sepharose Pharmacia ion exchange Phenyl Sepharose Pharmacia hydrophobic interaction chromatography phenyl boronate Prometics and Hydroxapatite Chromatography Biorad Richmond Calif. .

SHASEGP bound to Q Sepharose and eluted at 400 mM NaCl in the same buffer. The eluate was diluted with 2M Ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 500 mM ASO4 and passed through a Phenyl Sepharose low sub column followed by binding under the same conditions to a phenyl boronate resin. The sHASEGP was eluted from the phenyl sepharose resin in Hepes pH 6.9 after washing at pH 9.0 in 50 mM bicine without ASO. The eluate was loaded onto a ceramic hydroxyapatite resin at pH 6.9 in 5 mM PO1 mM CaCland eluted with 80 mM POpH 7.4 with 0.1 mM CaCl.

The resultant purified sHASEGP possessed a specific activity in excess of 65 000 USP Units mg protein by way of the microturbidity assay using the USP reference standard. Purified sHASEGP eluted as a single peak from 24 to 26 minutes from a Pharmacia 5RPC styrene divinylbenzene column with a gradient between 0.1 TFA HO and 0.1 TFA 90 acetonitrile 10 HO and resolved as a single broad 61 kDa band by SDS electrophoresis that reduced to a sharp 51 kDa band upon treatment with PNGASE F. N terminal amino acid sequencing revealed that the leader peptide had been efficiently removed.

Conflicting data exists as to whether sHASEGPs from different species require glycosylation for their catalytic activity. For example it is reported that enzymatically active bee venom hyaluronidase can be synthesized in cells that lack glycosylation machinery i.e. such as . Moreover treatment of purified bovine testes hyaluronidase with PNGase did not inactivate enzyme activity Yamagata et al 1997 . Other studies report loss of activity following deglycosylation and that disulfide bonds are additionally required.

As all such previous tests were made using either crude or partially purified preparations however it was not apparent whether the loss of activity was a result of exposure of deglycosylated enzyme to contaminating proteases in the crude preparations or a direct functional relationship between glycosylation and catalytic activity.

To determine if functional N linked glycosylation could be introduced into human sHASEGP using a CHO based expression system under protein free conditions a cDNA encoding human sHASEGP HIS6 was expressed in CHO cells using an IRESpuro bicistronic cassette in chemically defined media. Cells were grown for 72 hours in CHO CDM Invitrogen Gibco followed by concentration and tangential flow diafiltration on a Pellicon TFF unit Millipore with 30 kDa cutoff membranes. The concentrate was exchanged with 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 50 mM NaCl. The diafiltrate was then loaded on a DEAE streamline sepharose resin and eluted with a NaCl gradient from 0 1 M NaCl on a Pharmacia FPLC resin. Human sHASEGP eluted between 10 30 NaCl. Levels of sHASEGP in column fractions determined that the majority of enzyme was recovered in the 10 30 NaCl gradient. The enzyme from the 10 30 NaCl gradient was then further purified through affinity chromatography on an IMAC resin charged with Ni. Human sHASEGP was eluted from the IMAC resin after washing with 10 mM Imidizole with 50 mM Acetate pH 5.0. The protein was concentrated and dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes pH 7.4. The highly purified enzyme was determined to possess a specific activity of 97 000 Units mg protein in the presence of 1 mM Calcium and 1 mg ml HSA in the ELISA based biotinylated substrate microtiter assay.

To detect changes in protein relative molecular mass purified human sHASEGP was treated with PNGASE or Neuraminidase overnight followed by gel electrophoresis electotransfer and western blot analysis with an HRP linked anti His6 monoclonal antibody Qiagen and ECL detection.

Western blot analysis determined that the human sHASEGP produced in CHO cells was sensitive to PNGASE treatment. The relative molecule mass of human sHASEGP revealed that the protein was highly glycosylated. Upon complete overnight digestion with PNGASE human sHASEGP reduced to a single species confirming that mild heterogeneity of the undigested band could be attributed to N linked sugar residues. PNGaseF partial digestion showed a series of intermediates shifting from untreated and progressive shift with longer treatment. Although bands were somewhat diffuse on a 7 Gel at least 6 different intermediate isoforms could be visualized.

Treatment of sHASEGP with Neuraminidase revealed that CHO cells were in fact capable of synthesizing sialated human sHASEGP. Upon treatment with neuraminidase and Western Blot analysis of sHASEGP on 7 Gels CHO derived Human recombinant sHASEGP revealed an approximately 1 3 kDa shift in mobility compared to untreated sHASEGP. This is thus the first report of the generation of a substantially sialated human sHASEGP. This is very valuable for both stability and to enhance serum half life of a human sHASEGP as native sperm sHASEGP from many species lacks sialation and does not react with sialic acid specific lectins.

Analysis of active sHASEGP oligosaccharides by FACE analysis permits rapid determination of profiles of catalytically active sHASEGPs.

Purified Hyaluronidase from the 3D3 5M clone was evaluated using FACE N Linked Oligosaccharide Profiling Prozyme . Oligosaccharides were cleaved from 128.7 g of glycoproteins by enzymatic digestion with N Glycanase a.k.a PNGase labeled using the fluorophore ANTS and separated by electrophoresis. The relative positions of the oligosaccharide bands were determined by running the sample and dilutions of the sample alongside an oligosaccharide standard ladder which designated the migration distance in Degree of Polymerization DP units.

The N Profile for the Hyaluronidase sample consists of ten bands of which six running concomitant with the oligosaccharide standard bands G5 G12 had intensities greater than 9 . Furthermore the band running alongside the G9 standard was the most intense with intensities of 35 46 .

Samples of purified HIS6 sHASEGP were mixed with buffer containing Neuraminidase and PNGASE with and without 50 mM Octylglucoside overnight at 37 C. Oligosaccharides were verified to have been removed by gel shift from Western Blot analysis.

In addition to the microtiter based assay using HA the substrate specificity of sHASEGP towards other glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans can be tested using a gel shift assay with purified substrates to determine the activity of sHASEGP towards other glycosaminoglycans. Many Hyaluronidase assays have been based upon the measurement of the generation of new reducing N acetylamino groups Bonner and Cantey 13 746 752 1966 or loss of viscosity De Salegui et al. 121 548 554 1967 or turbidity Dorfman and Ott 172 367 1948 . With purified substrates all of these methods suffice for determination of the presence or absence of endoglucosamidic activity.

GEL SHIFT ASSAY Purified substrates are mixed with recombinant sHASEGP to test for endoglucosidase activity that give rise to increased mobility in substrate within the gel. Chondroitin Sulfate A Aggrecan and D were from Calbiochem. Hyaluronan Human Umbilical Cord Chondroitin Sulfate C Dermatan sulfate and Heparan sulfate are obtained from Calbiochem. Human umbilical cord Hyaluronan was obtained from ICN. Each test substrate is diluted to 0.1 mg ml. 10 l samples of purified sHASEGP or conditioned media from sHASEGP expressing cells as well as are mixed with 90 l of test substrate in desired buffer and incubated for 3 hours at 37 C. Following incubation samples are neutralized with sample buffer Tris EDTA PH 8.0 Bromophenol Blue and glycerol followed by electrophoresis on 15 polyacrylamide gels. Glycosaminoglycans are detected by staining the gels in 0.5 Alcian Blue in 3 Glacial Acetic Acid overnight followed by destaining in 7 Glacial Acetic Acid. Degradation is determined by comparison substrate mobility in the presence and absence of enzyme.

100 Units of sHASEGPin 10 l was incubated with 90 l 10 mM Hepes Buffer with 50 ug ml Human Serum Albumin for 2 hours at 37 C. containing 10 g of various glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Electrophoretic analysis followed by Alcian blue staining revealed increased mobility shifts to a single species in Chondroitin Sulfate A C and D Aggrecan and Hyaluronan but not Heparan Sulfate nor Chondroitin Sulfate B. Whereas the undigested glycosaminoglycans ran as a smear in the middle of the gel the digested products showed the majority of alcian blue stain running at the dye front with a small amount of material running as an incremental ladder.

In addition to the requirement of glycosylation for optimal enzyme activity human sHASEGP was found to be activated with cations for optimal enzyme activity. In the process of purification sHASEGP was found to have a low specific activity following successive chromatography steps. The HIS6tagged sHASEGP was found to have a very low specific activity when purified to homogeneity from DEAE followed by successive Ni IMAC purifications. As IMAC resins can chelate metal ions various metals were added back to sHASEGP to determine the relative enzyme activity.

Purified sHASEGP was tested following incubation with 0.1 mM nickel Ni Cobalt Co Zinc Zn Calcium Ca and Magnesium Mg for 2 hours at room temperature followed by determination of hyaluronidase activity in microtiter based assay.

A significant increase in hyaluronidase activity was found following incubation of sHASEGP with 0.1 mM Calcium or 0.1 mM Magnesium. No such activation was found following incubation with other metals. The addition of Calcium to sHASEGP increased the specific activity of the enzyme to approximately 97 000 units per mg protein based upon A280 measurement. A dose response curve of Calcium and Magnesium metals was then tested to determine the optimal concentration of metal ions to enzyme.

Activation of sHASEGP was found to occur in the micromolar range. Concentrations above 10 mM were inhibitory for both Calcium and Magnesium. To rule out nonspecific activation of substrate rather than enzyme Calcium Chloride in 10 mM Hepes buffer was incubated with the immobilized biotinylated substrate on the microtiter plate followed by washing. No activation was found when the enzyme was added to the Calcium preincubated plate that had been washed. The activation was also tested on phospholipase C released native sHASEGP which revealed a similar activation with Calcium ruling out an artifact of the carboxy terminus HIS6 epitope tag.

It was found that the dilution of recombinant rHUPH20 and other preparations of slaughterhouse testes derived hyaluronidases required albumin in addition to Calcium for optimal activity.

Human Serum Albumin ICN was diluted into 10 mM Hepes buffer with Calcium to determine the effects of albumin protein on enzyme activity. Enzyme assays with sHASEGP and commercial preparations were examined using both 1 mM CaCland 1 mg ml Human Serum Albumin.

Activation of hyaluronidase activity was found at high dilutions in the presence of albumin. It was not clear whether this activation was a result of preventing denaturation or if the albumin affected the availability of the substrate. A preferable formulation of human sHASEGP could therefore include Albumin and a metal salt consisting of either Calcium or Magnesium.

Purified sHASEGP in 10 mM Hepes PH 7.4 150 mM NaCl 0.1 Pluronic was diluted to 0.5 U l in pyrogen free water with 0.15M NaCl. A series of dilutions in 20 l final of Saline were made to give a total of 0.01 0.05 0.1 Units per injection. 20 l of Trypan Blue solution was added to a final volume of 40 l and injected subcutaneously into the lateral skin on each side of balb mice that had been previously anesthetized i.p. by ketamine xylazine administration. Dye areas were measured in 2 dimensions with a microcaliper from t 0 to t 45 min. Area was represented as mm. As a control recombinant Human HYAL1 that lacks neutral activity but is secreted was included.

Recombinant purified sHASEGPwas separated into 2 aliquots. One was heated to 95 C. for 15 minutes in a thermocycler with a heated lid. The other remained at room temperature. Thermal inactivation of enzyme activity was verified in the microtiter based enzyme assay. For kinetic analysis heat inactivated verses native material was tested. 4 Units of purified sHASEGP or equivalent heat inactivated material was injected subcutaneously with trypan blue dye. Areas were tested at various time points up to 15 minutes.

To establish the regeneration time of the pores opened with sHASEGP following subcutaneous administration 2 Units of purified sHASEGP or saline control was injected into two opposing lateral sites subcutaneously in animals at t 0 followed by injection with trypan blue at the same site at 30 min 60 min and 24 hours. Area of the dye diffusion at t 15 minutes post injection was recorded for each time point compared to the control.

The results demonstrate that the dermal barrier reconstitutes within 24 hours of administration of 2 Units of enzyme.

It was shown that human sHASEGP opened channels in the interstitial space sufficient to permit the diffusion of a small molecule i.e. trypan blue dye. However it was unknown what the upper limits were on the size of particles that could diffuse in the presence of sHASEGP.

Fluorescent molecules of varying sizes were used to determine the size of the channels opened by human sHASEGP Fluoresceinated Dextrans of 4 400 and 2 million Da Average Molecular Weight Sigma as well as fluorescein labeled beads of defined diameters from 20 nanometers to 500 nanometers Molecular Probes were administered subcutaneously in a volume of 40 l with following injection of sHASEGP or saline control in the same sites. Area of the dye front was then measured in two dimensions at 15 minutes post injection.

The results demonstrated that molecules from approximately 1 kDa Trypan Blue to 50 nm in diameter Latex Beads showed enhanced diffusion following administration of sHASEGP. While bovine serum albumin 66 kDA showed similar kinetics of diffusion to trypan blue the 50 nm latex beads required significantly more time to diffuse. 500 nm beads showed no diffusion up to 480 minutes.

Female Balb c mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine xylazine. The mice were then injected subcutaneously with 20 l of 0.5 mg ml solution of biotinylated mouse IgG mixed with 20 l of either saline or 20 l sHASEGP containing 4 Units of activity.

The results demonstrate that sHASEGP increases the kinetics of serum distribution of large molecules in circulation. Where no biotinylated IgG could be detected in the control group at 2 hours 360 ng ml was apparent by 2 hours in the sHASEGP group.

Four sites for dye injection were utilized per dose of each Test Article and carrier control. Dye injection was 45 minutes after i.v. injection. Each dose of test or control article was injected i.v. into 2 animals. Measurement of the dye front area post 45 minute enzyme administration was calculated at 2.5 5 10 and 15 minutes for each dose or carrier control.

Results demonstrated that highly purified sHASEGP was systemically available to distal tissues upon intravenous administration. The spreading activity of systemically administered sHASEGP was dose dependent with a 10 unit injection being indistinguishable from carrier control.

As an illustrative example of the use of pegylation to generate modified forms of sHASEGPs having improved pharmacokinetics such as increased serum half life we attached either linear or branched polyethylene glycol PEG moieties to an exemplary sHASEGP recombinant human PH20 rHuPH20 as described above.

A number of different functionally activated groups can be used for attaching PEG moieties to sHASEGPs such as rHuPH20 including by way of illustration aldehydes succinimides maleimides and others . A number of different pegylation reagents are commercially available from various sources including Nektar Therapeutics nektar.com as well as a number of other suppliers. For purposes of illustration the sHASEGPs in rHuPH20 have been PEGylated.

In addition to varying the functional group PEGs of a variety of different lengths and structures are available which can be incorporated using a particular functional group. For purposes of illustration PEG lengths ranging from 5 to 40 KDa have been conjugated to rHuPH20. Again a variety of different PEGs having different lengths and structures are readily available from sources including Nektar Sunbio Celares and others.

As an exemplary illustration of the PEGylation of an illustrative sHASEGP PEG aldehydes succinimides and maleimides have each been applied to conjugate PEG moieties to rHuPH20. Of these three chemistries succinimidyl PEGs have typically been the most convenient to use in the case of rHuPH20. For example rHuPH20 has been conjugated with exemplary succinimidyl monoPEG MPEG reagents including mPEG Succinimidyl Propionates mPEG SPA mPEG Succinimidyl Butanoates mPEG SBA and mPEG2 N Hydroxylsuccinimide. These pegylated succinimidyl esters contain different length carbon backbones between the PEG group and the activated cross linker and either a single or branched PEG group. These differences can be used for example to provide for different reaction kinetics and to potentially restrict sites available for PEG attachment to rHuPH20 during the conjugation process.

Succinimidyl PEGs as above comprising either linear or branched PEGs have been conjugated to rHuPH20. Using compositions and techniques as described in the art succinimidyl PEGs have been used to generate rHuPH20s reproducibly comprising a combination of molecules having between about three to six PEG molecules per sHASEGP. Such pegylated rHuPH20 compositions were readily purified to yield compositions having specific activities of approximately 25 000 Unit mg protein hyaluronidase activity and being substantially free of non PEGylated rHuPH20 less than 5 non PEGylated . As is known in the art and described for example in PEGylation references including those cited above a variety of reagents and techniques are also available for achieving mono disperse as opposed to poly disperse PEG products see e.g. the reviews and references cited above related to site specific monoPEGylation and site directed PEGylation .

Improvements in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have been observed in animal models following administration of a PEGylated sHASEGP as compared to the unmodified version of the sHASEGP. For example following intravenous administration to mice of either 1 000 Units of an unmodified rHuPH20 or 1 000 Units of rHuPH20 conjugated to PEGs having a molecular weight of approximately 40 kDa rHuPH20 PEG40 it was observed that the serum half life of neutral active hyaluronidase activity PH20 in serum of mice treated with rHuPH20 PEG40 was significantly longer 16 20 fold than that of mice treated with unmodified rHuPH20. In addition the effectiveness of rHuPH20 PEG40 has been compared to non PEGylated rHuPH20 in a rat stroke model. Initial results from these studies demonstrate greater effectiveness of rHuPH20 PEG40 greater than 75 survival versus less than 50 in controls in rat survival 7 days post stroke inducement.

As an illustrative example of the use of sHASEGP compositions of the present invention to promote spreading or diffusion of pharmacologic agents into and within organs and tissues in a mammal we assessed the use of rHUPH20 to promote penetration of dexamethasone dex an anti inflammatory agent used as an exemplary small molecule pharmacologic into tissues of the mammalian eye in vivo

For injection of agents such as anesthetics to the mammalian eye commonly used periorbital routes for achieving anesthetic blocks include peribulbar retrobulbar and sub Tenon s injections. For this illustrative example we compared sub Tenon s injections of dex with or without concomitant administration of sHASEGP into the episcleral space and then examined the concentrations of dex within tissues of the posterior of the eye particularly the choroid and retinal layers which are important drug targets but are often difficult to efficiently reach with pharmacologic agents.

New Zealand red male rabbits approximately 2.1 to 3.2 kg were employed and were placed under general anesthesia using intramuscular injections of ketamine hydrochloride 21 mg kg and xylazine hydrochloride 5.25 mg kg . Topical 0.5 proparacaine was used for anesthetizing the ocular surface. Pupils were dilated with 1 tropicamide and 2.5 phenylephrine. After opening the conjunctiva of the right eye of each rabbit using Vannas scissors the tip of a Medez tri port anesthetic cannula Eagle Laboratories Rancho Cucamonga Calif. was inserted into the episcleral space and 1.5 ml of either dex alone American Pharmaceutical Partners n 18 or dex plus sHASEGP 3000 units of rHUPH20 n 18 was injected adjacent to the posterior pole of the eye. A cotton tipped applicator was placed at the site of conjunctival entry to prevent egress of fluid.

At 1 2 3 or 6 hours after the injection rabbits were anesthetized as described above and sacrificed by intracardiac injection of pentobarbital sodium 120 mg kg . Following euthanasia 1 ml of blood sample was taken and both eyes were enucleated from each animal. Immediately after the enucleation a 2 ml sample of aqueous humor was collected via anterior chamber paracentesis with tuberculin syringe from each eye. After removal of anterior segment from enucleated eyes 1 ml of vitreous sample was withdrawn and placed into labeled Eppendorf tubes. The remainder of the eye was dissected and 6 mm trephine Fine Science Tools Foster City Calif. was used to punch the tissue sample inferior to the optic nerve where drug was injected on the extrascleral side. From the punched tissue the retina was scraped off with a blunt blade and placed into labeled tube as was the choroid.

Mass spectrometry was used to assess dex levels in tissues with the minimum quantifiable limits being on the order of 5 ng ml. For the choroid and retinal samples a buffer containing 50 mM Tris base 1 mM MgCl pH 9.0 was added to the tissue so the final concentration was 20 mg mL. The tissue was disrupted using an ultrasonic homogenizer BioLogics Inc. model 150 V T for 5 15 seconds. The samples of tissue homogenate the vitreous fluid aqueous fluid and plasma were all analyzed by the following procedure. Samples containing dexamethasone and prednisolone as the internal standard I.S. were extracted with methyl t butyl ether by vortex mixing for five minutes. The organic and aqueous layers were separated by centrifugation at 1 300 g for five minutes the aqueous layer was frozen at 70 C. for fifteen minutes and the organic layer was poured into new tubes and evaporated under a stream of nitrogen at 40 C. The residue was reconstituted with water acetonitrile 50 50 v v . The processed samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a Phenomenex Synery Polar RP column maintained at 45 C. The mobile phase was nebulized using heated nitrogen in a Z spray source interface and the ionized compounds were detected using a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer. Peak heights of dexamethasone and prednisolone were acquired and integrated using MassLynx software Micromass Beverly Mass. The calibration curves were obtained by fitting the peak height ratios of the standards to the internal standard a power equation in MassLynx . The equation of the calibration curve was then used to interpolate the concentration of dexamethasone in the samples using their peak height ratios.

The mass spec results revealed that the choroidal retinal and vitreous dexamethasone levels of rabbits treated with dex alone reached peak concentrations at the first time point i.e. 1 hour after injection whereas the choroidal and retinal dex concentrations of rabbits that received concomitant sHASEGP were higher and continued to increase to the second time point i.e. 2 hours after injection . Peak choroidal retinal and vitreous concentrations were approximately 10 fold 5 fold and 8 fold higher respectively in tissues that had been treated with sHASEGP and the areas under the curve AUC were also at least 50 higher.

These results indicate that the administration of sHASEGP can be used to substantially enhance the delivery of pharmacologic agents such as dex even to relatively difficult to reach tissues in vivo such as segments at the posterior of the mammalian eye. Furthermore since the relatively thick scleral layer forms a tissue barrier between the sub Tenon s injection space and the targeted choroid and retinal layers the high levels of pharmacologic agent delivered to the latter layers indicate that sHASEGP can be used to effectively promote delivery of pharmacologics across tissue layers within the body.

In the case of promoting transcleral delivery sHASEGP can thus be applied in a minimally invasive procedure to promote the delivery of agents used to treat conditions affecting the back of the eye which are of particular interest in a number of ocular disease situations. This can provide for example a less invasive delivery route for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization e.g. by administering steroids macular degeneration and other diseases affecting these tissues which are typically treated via intravitreal injection. There are a wide variety of agents currently used for these conditions such as but not limited to dexamethasone triamcinolone Macugen and VEGF antagonists.

In addition to the enzymatic activities of sHASEGP that contribute to spreading in the context of delivery routes such as via sub Tenon s injection it is also believed that the introduction of the sHASEGP in a volume of fluid that effectively fills or distends the tissue space into which it is injected generates positive hydrostatic pressures that serve to further drive delivery of fluids and the agents comprised therein into the surrounding tissues e.g. by promoting convective transport .

As described and illustrated herein sHASEGPs can be used to generate interstitial channels that can increase fluid flow and facilitate the delivery of pharmacologic and other agents to desired tissue sites in vivo. Tumors present a particularly important target issue for a number of known and regularly developed pharmacologic agents especially antineoplastics antimetabolites antiangiogenics and various cytotoxic and cytostatic agents. The challenges associated with targeting such pharmacologics to tumor sites in vivo are exacerbated by the fact that many tumors exhibit elevated interstitial pressures that tend to impede infusion of administered pharmacologics particularly to sites deep within a tumor mass. It is believed that sHASEGPs can reduce this impedance and therefore facilitate delivery of any of a variety of known and newly developed pharmacologic agents into tumors thereby rendering them more sensitive to and more treatable by a given dose of a pharmacologic. In these regards sHASEGPs of the present invention have been shown to be capable of promoting the formation of interstitial channels and to enhance the dispersion of markers of various sizes as described above. In addition we have observed that sHASEGPs can be used to increase hydraulic conductivity of interstitial tissues over ten fold.

As confirmation of these principles in the context of tumor cells application of an exemplary sHASEGP rHuPH20 50 Units to tumor cells in vitro resulted in substantial removal of pericellular matrices which are believed to be a major contributor to elevated tumor interstitial fluid pressure.

In addition administration of rHuPH20 in vivo in a xenograft human tumor model resulted in a significant reduction in tumor interstitial fluid pressure within one hour of administration.

As described in the detailed description of the invention above sHASEGPs of the present invention can be applied in combination with any of a number of known or newly developed antitumor agents for use in the treatment of various cancers.

As discussed above sHASEGPs can be used to modulate the pharmacokinetics of known or newly developed pharmacologic and other agents by example facilitating their absorption and or distribution with the body. Such improved pharmacokinetic parameters can in turn be used to improve the pharmacodynamics of a particular agent e.g. reducing local toxicity by lowering the amount of an agent left near a site of injection and or raising effectiveness by increasing the amount of an agent delivered to and or through a desired target . Alternatively since sHASEGPs can be used to effectively drive dispersion of a locally administered pharmacologic agent e.g. through a site of injection and into the bloodstream it is also possible to use the sHASEGP to essentially improve the pharmacokinetics of absorption and achieve similar pharmacodynamics with a reduced amount of applied agent.

As an illustrative example of the use of sHASEGPs to enhance the pharmacokinetics of a macromolecular drug that is normally administered by non intravenous parenteral injection we combined recombinant human PH20 rHuPH20 with a pegylated version of interferon alpha 2b PEG INTRON available from Schering Plough . PEG INTRON is a macromolecule of approximately 31 kD that is typically administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of Hepatitis C virus HCV generally in combination with the small molecule drug ribavirin . Like many macromolecules administered subcutaneously PEG INTRON is relatively slowly absorbed and a substantial portion of the agent never makes it to the bloodstream with bioavailability on the order of 50 60 . In addition a substantial fraction of patients typically more than half develop various injection site reactions presumably as a result of or exacerbated by the retained local concentrations of the pharmacologic. As appreciated by those of skill in the art the consequences of such pharmacokinetics are several fold and include not only the wasting of agent trapped near the injection site but also reactions to the locally metabolized compound.

We administered Iodine 125 labeled PEG INTRON by different routes of administration with or without concomitant administration of rHuPH20 to examine the effects of rHuPH20 on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the PEG INTRON. To determine the absolute bioavailability of rHuPH20 we also measured the pharmacokinetic parameters of PEG INTRON administered by intravenous administration.

Briefly eighteen Sprague Dawley rats each weighing approximately 225 250 grams were divided into three groups of six animals each. A first group was administered test article i.e. I 125 labeled PEG INTRON by intravenous administration 1.5 micrograms kg in a volume of 100 microliters via tail vein injection . Specific activity of the I 125 labeled interferon was 55 Ci microgram. Blood samples 100 microliters were collected pre dose and at 0.5 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 96 and 120 hours after dosing and processed for quantification of labeled drug by gamma counting expressed as Counts Per Minute CPM per gram plasma . A second group of six animals was administered an equivalent dose and volume of test article by intradermal injection into a shaved and prepared spot over the back of the neck and blood samples were processed as for the first group. A third group of six animals was administered an equivalent dose of test article mixed with rHuPH20 100 I.U. in a combined volume of 100 microliters by intradermal injection as in the preceding group and blood samples were then processed as for groups one and two. The results of this study are shown below in Table 24 1.

As can be seen in Table 24 1 the bioavailability of the exemplary pharmacologic PEG INTRON as assessed by AUC was dramatically improved when the intradermal dosing was combined with a dose of sHASEGP. In fact the absolute bioavailability achieved with an intradermal dosing in combination with sHASEGP were statistically indistinguishable from the direct intravenous administration where all of the material is delivered directly into the bloodstreams. Thus the use of sHASEGP in combination with a pharmacologic that is introduced by non IV parenteral administration can provide levels of delivery comparable to administration directly into the bloodstream. Although the Tmax is necessarily longer following ID administration since some amount of time is necessary for the agent to reach the bloodstream within several hours after ID dosing with sHASEGP the concentrations of agent in the bloodstream essentially reached those achieved by IV dosing and thereafter apparently exceeded them.

As discussed above sHASEGPs can be used to facilitate the delivery of known or newly developed pharmacologic and other agents by different routes of administration that may provide for greater convenience safety reduced costs and or other benefits. As an illustrative example of such a reformulation we used a sHASEGP to facilitate intradermal delivery of a macromolecular drug that is normally administered by intravenous injection. For this particular example we combined recombinant human PH20 rHuPH20 with a chimeric human murine anti TNFalpha monoclonal antibody Infliximab available as REMICADE from Centocor . REMICADE is a macromolecule of approximately 150 kD that is typically administered by intravenous injection for the treatment of arthritis or Crohn s disease. Administration of REMICADE thus generally requires the involvement if intravenous access and concomitant professional care and risks and also requires on the order of two hours for each dosing.

REMICADE 20 mg ml was labeled with .sup.125I to a specific activity of 10 Ci mg. Eighteen rats were divided into three groups of six animals each and were administered a mixture of radioactive and cold REMICADE combined 10 mg kg in a final volume of 100 l i by intravenous administration ii by intradermal administration or iii or by intradermal administration in combination with 100 Unit sHASEGP from a 100 000 U ml stock and then blood and tissues processed by gamma counting at various points after dosing essentially as described for the preceding example. The results are summarized in Table 

As can be seen in Table 25 1 the bioavailability of the exemplary pharmacologic REMICADE as assessed by AUC was dramatically improved when the intradermal dosing was combined with a dose of sHASEGP. As was observed with enhanced delivery of PEG INTRON the overall levels of REMICADE bioavailability achieved with an intradermal dosing in combination with sHASEGP were statistically similar to those of the intravenous administration when all material was delivered directly into the bloodstream. Although the REMICADE Tis necessarily longer following ID versus IV administration within twenty four hours after ID dosing with sHASEGP the concentrations of agent in the bloodstream exceeded that observed with IV dosing and thereafter approached or exceeded the IV concentrations. Compared with ID dosing without sHASEGP the observed Twas reached about twice as quickly with sHASEGP 24 hours versus 48 hours and the Cand bioavailability AUC both substantially increased by about 65 and 95 respectively .

As another illustrative example of the use of sHASEGPs to enhance the pharmacokinetics of a macromolecular drug that is normally administered by non intravenous parenteral injection we combined recombinant human PH20 rHuPH20 with recombinant human Factor VIII RECOMBINATE available from Baxter . Factor VIII is a large glycoprotein complex comprising multiple polypeptides and has a combined molecular of approximately 280 kD. Factor VIII is typically only administered by intravenous injection for the treatment of hemophilia. Like many macromolecules administered subcutaneously Factor VIII is relatively slowly absorbed and a substantial portion of the agent never makes it to the bloodstream with bioavailability on the order of 0.5 1 .

Eighteen rats were divided into three groups of six animals each and were administered 125 I labeled Factor VIII i by intravenous administration ii by intradermal administration or iii by intradermal administration in combination with sHASEGP and then blood and tissues processed at various points after dosing to measure counts per minute CPM per gram plasma essentially as described for the preceding example.

As shown in Table 26 1 co administration of Factor VIII with rHuPH20 significantly increased the systemic bioavailability relative to Factor VIII alone P

In a first set of studies sHASEGPs were evaluated in a rat model of stroke. Briefly stroke was surgically induced in Sprague Dawley rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion followed at various times by intravenous administration of either a control solution saline or a test solution saline comprising a sHASEGP . Animals were allowed to recover and were followed over a period of time to assess rates of survival in control versus test groups. In addition survivors were assessed over a range of timepoints using multiple analyses of behavioral conditions typically associated with stroke. Only rats that performed normally in an initial qualifying forelimb flexion test were included in the study and were then randomly assigned to a control or test group of animals.

Aseptic surgical procedures were performed by Zivic Laboratories essentially as follows. Rats were anesthetized in a chamber supplied with 2.5 halothane. A ventral midline incision was made and the musculature was separated to expose the right external carotid artery which was then isolated and double ligated. An untied but constrictive 5 0 polyamide ligature was then placed around the external carotid stump. A small hole was cut into the lumen of the stump and an 18 20 mm length of 4 0 microfilament suture material was inserted into the lumen and advanced into the internal carotid artery. When completely advanced the internalized tip of the monofilament should block flow into the middle cerebral artery. The constrictive polyamide ligature was then tied to secure the monofilament. Retraction was removed and the skin incision closed with a wound clip.

Intravenous injection procedures were performed essentially as follows. Rats were anesthetized in a chamber supplied with 2.5 halothane. A ventral skin incision was made to expose the jugular vein. A sterile 1 ml disposable syringe was fitted with a 30 gauge needle and loaded with injection material. Using the clavicle for support the syringe was inserted into the jugular vein using slight negative pressure on the syringe to draw bloodflow into the syringe and thereby confirm proper placement for IV injection and then the injection material was slowly injected into the jugular vein. After injection the needle was slowly withdrawn and any bleeding controlled with a sterile cotton applicator and then the skin incision was closed with a wound clip.

Survival of animals in the various groups approximately 40 animals in each group was monitored following induction of stroke and the number of survivors at each day were then plotted against days following stroke to generate a Kaplan Meier stroke curve. Substantial differences between the groups were apparent by the 3day following stroke. By one week following the induction of stroke more than half of the control animals had died whereas nearly three quarters of the sHASEGP treated animals had survived which was a statistically significant difference p 0.03 .

In addition to measuring rates of survival following stroke survivors were also tested at 1 2 3 and 4 weeks following stoke using other analyses designed to assess the incidence of certain behavioral problems associated with stroke. Behavioral conditions assessed included forelimb flexion torso twist hind limb gait disturbances and wall walk which were used to generate a PNEGS behavioral score higher scores reflecting an increase in behavioral problems associated with the stroke . By the second week following induction of stroke the sHASEGP treated animals exhibited significantly higher behavioral scores p 0.02 and the relative differences between the treated group and the control were even greater over subsequent weeks p 0.007 and p 0.003 for weeks three and four respectively .
