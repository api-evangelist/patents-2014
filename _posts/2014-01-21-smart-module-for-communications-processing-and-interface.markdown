While the Prior Art discloses a number of integrated data acquisition systems for use in data buoys weather stations and the like a need remains in the art for an inexpensive reliable and easy way to add sensors or other features to such data acquisition stations without disturbing the underlying electronics systems and communications systems in the data acquisition station. In addition a need exists in the art for a standardized packaged smart sensor module that can be applied singly or in a configuration of multiple modules to allow for flexible configuration of remote data acquisition systems.

The present invention provides a small very low power building block type module that may be used to interface new sensors or conduct testing of new processing schemes without heavy system development test and costs typically encountered in modifying the larger more complex system. In addition the small very low power device contains core functions of data collection processing and communication. Thus it can be repurposed to other uses such as backup to other functions e.g. GPS position reporting and environmental data transmission and control from shore . It contains readily available wireless communication components. Several of these devices may be organized into a wireless sensor and communications network.

The present invention includes a device which measures data signals receives data streams records processes and communicates data via wireless links from remote ocean locations to shore based systems or other nearby communication systems. It combines commercially available electronic parts operating system and enclosure with a custom circuit board and firmware. One uniqueness feature is the combination of Commercial Off The Shelf COTS components satellite services real time operating system and custom firmware to accomplish data acquisition and reporting needs not readily and commercially available or as economical.

The present invention includes a data collector processor transmitter location reporting and data storage device which provides bi directional satellite communications anywhere in the world. The combination uses very little power and is economical as compared to other devices. It may be used for many unattended remote data collection and reporting needs. In one embodiment the present invention may be used to measure and report remote marine data for marine weather analysis forecasts and warnings. The device may include wired and or wireless connections to interface with sensors a user or other devices.

The present invention has a number of applications and methods of use. In one embodiment the device may be attached to a data buoy or other data collection system to add additional sensor capabilities without having to disturb existing sensor equipment. Existing data buoys are often designed as a sensor package and if additional sensors were added to such a package the entire system would need to be modified and tested to insure that the additional sensors and software does not create conflicts with other sensors. By providing a stand alone packaged sensor solution the present invention may be readily installed in an existing data buoy with minimal labor and materials costs and without disturbing existing sensors data processors and communications systems.

The present invention has other applications as well including as a back up system which may be readily installed when other systems fail. It may also be used to provide a back up locator if a data buoy fails or is dislodged. In a fail safe mode the system of the present invention can upload a GPS location to an IRIDIUM satellite every day for nearly three years on battery power.

In addition the device of the present invention may be used in a modular arrangement where multiple devices may communicate with one another in wired or wireless modes. The device may be used as a Smart End Device to log data from a sensor or sensors. Another device communicating wirelessly or in wired mode with one or more Smart End Devices may serve as a Smart Coordinator accumulating data from other Smart End Devices and uploading the packaged data via satellite modem. In order to reduce the number of different module types in the field the smart modules of the present invention may be provided with similar or identical hardware and then programmed in the field to act as Smart End Devices logging data from sensors and Smart Coordinators accumulating data from Smart End Devices and uploading the data via satellite. In this manner the inventory of different device types is reduced and redundant capabilities are provided in the field. If one smart module fails in whole or in part another module may be configured even remotely to take over chores of the failed module.

The following description and Figures describe the overall features of the smart module of the present invention. More detailed description of the invention may be found in the Appendices of Provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 61 921 298 filed on Dec. 27 2013 and incorporated herein by reference. Appendix I contains the System Design Description for the Smart module of the present invention while Appendix II includes the schematic diagrams for the Smart module of the present invention. Appendix III includes the source code for the software operating in the present invention. All three Appendices are incorporated herein by reference. Appendix III is also provided as an Appendix I to the present application.

Most of the components illustrated in are commonly available parts except the custom circuit board and application firmware. The circuit board is what ties the common components together into a system. The application firmware is created by commonly available software development tools. Appendix III includes a copy of the application firmware. The specific function of the application will depend on the intended purpose for the module. Some government applications that have been completed are a converter of analog signals to calibrated digital signals data logger asset position reporter and environmental data message transmitter.

The device components including the antenna are enclosed in a NEMA 6P rated enclosure to resist harsh open ocean environments. The device is small and lightweight which makes it less susceptible to damage from the ocean environment. is a perspective view of the smart sensor module illustrating installation on an existing weather data buoy. As illustrated in the device of the present invention in detail B may be readily mounted to a weather data buoy without disturbing existing sensors or other hardware. Watertight enclosure may be mounted to a buoy mast using fasteners or even wire ties and the like. An external sensor may be connected to the buoy via connections and power supplied via connection . Power may be provided from battery pack and or solar panels .

The smart module of the present invention may be also used by private companies conducting commercial activities at sea in a similar manner. These may include oil and gas exploration companies. However a commercial rather than government Iridium gateway may have to be used which may add to communications costs.

The present invention provides a small very low power system building block to use in multiple ways in remote data acquisition and reporting systems. It provides a unique combination of commercially available functions needed to acquire process store and report data economically. It makes testing of new sensors or processing methods easier and with less risk to operational systems. Thus changes or additions to existing more complicated systems can be made faster more economically and with less risk to operational systems.

The smart module of the present invention is provided with advanced calibration firmware which may be used to calibrate both the smart module of the present invention and the sensor as one unit. Within user menus and under user control the smart module of the present invention automatically computes a second order calibration and stores the calibration coefficients in non volatile memory such as flash card . The calibration coefficients are later applied to acquired data. Thus the smart module of the present invention can increase the accuracy of a sensor. The smart module of the present invention may also have the capability to store data internally.

The software may run a Real Time Operating System RTOS known as Salvo provided by Pumpkin Inc. of San Francisco Calif. The RTOS greatly simplifies coding of the system and eases control of timing. For example normally code for switching back and forth from high power and low power modes would be sprinkled through the overall code. Also waking up from low power mode would have to be done many times. The application becomes complex because of going to low power mode and waking up has to be carefully planned. With Salvo going into low power mode and waking up is done in one location in the code. The Salvo scheduler handles all aspects of timing and low power cycling.

Wet mate plug may be used to interface with various sensors or other smart modules. Inputs from sensors may include three channels of sensor data and one channel of counter data which may be fed to analog signal conditioning circuit which in turn is tied to the A D input and counter input in MSP430 processor . Power to external sensors may be fed through wet made plug as well. Sensor data or user interface data in serial form may be fed through serial RS232 interface which in turn may transmit data to MSP430 processor .

In a wired mode the smart module of the present invention measures an analog input signal fed through wet mate plug averages the values in analog signal conditioning circuit or digitally in MSP 430 processor and then formats the data message and outputs an RS 232 serial data message through an RS232 interface or as output to 9602 Iridium Modem . The data message format is compatible with the National Data Buoy Center NDBC standard Coastal Marine Automated Network C MAN message format and does not require formatting by the NDBC payload. The smart module of the present invention can switch power to the sensor via wet mate plug as illustrated in . Some of the details like how long to measure and average are configurable through a user interface which may be wired through wet mate plugs and or through RS232 interface .

The Smart Sensor Module turns a dumb analog sensor into a digital or smart sensor. In one embodiment for example the system may be configured to provide a measurement of the Rotronics MP101A available from Rotronic Instrument Corp Hauppauge N.Y. humidity and temperature signals in the same manner as NDBC payloads e.g. ARES or AMPS .

An additional wet mate plug may be provided to input additional serial sensor or user interface data as well as provide power to the smart module custom board from for example battery bank or solar panels on data buoy . Of course other power sources may be used depending on system location and installation. Power from commercial power systems e.g. 110 VAC may be utilized for a land based system through suitable transformers e.g. wall pack or the like with a battery backup provided. Solar panels or even automotive power sources for mobile devices may also be applied. In marine environments other power sources such as wave power generated electricity may be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

Sensor data or user interface data in serial form may be fed through serial RS232 interface which in turn may transmit data to MSP430 processor . Power conditioning circuit receives input power from batteries solar panels or the like and filters the power input and outputs appropriate voltages for the various devices in the apparatus such as 3.3 Volts 5 Volts or the like as well as switched battery power as a backup.

In order to prevent confusion in the field and a possible misconnection of plugs wet mate plug may be female and wet mate plug may be male. In this manner a technician installing the device on a data buoy or other difficult environment does not have to remember which plug is which and the possibility of power being fed into data circuits and vice versa is eliminated.

Sensor data and other data may be processed in MSP430 processor and then output to 9602 Iridium modem for transmission via L band antenna to a central processing site where such data is collected and analyzed as is known in the art. L band antenna also receives GPS data which is processed by GPS receiver to provide position data to MSP430 processor . Position data may be transmitted as part of an overall data feed in normal use and or may be transmitted as will be described below as part of a backup emergency locator system to provide location transmitting capabilities for lost data buoys and the like.

Data may also be output or received through XBee interface . XBee is the brand name of a family of form factor compatible radio modules manufactured by Digi International of Minnetonka Minnesota. XBee radios are based on the 802.15.4 2003 standard designed for point to point and star communications at over the air baud rates of 250 Kbit s. The XBee radios can all be used with the minimum number of four connections power 3.3 V ground data in and data out UART with other recommended lines being Reset and Sleep. Additionally most XBee families have some other flow control I O A D and indicator lines built in. XBee interface may be used to retrieve data locally either for programming or testing purposes or to transmit and receive data to other data collection devices.

As previously illustrated in the smart module of the present invention includes a single custom printed circuit board with a pluggable XBee Pro IEEE standard 802.15.4 wireless modem . The printed circuit board contains an MSP430 processor sensor power switch RS 232 serial transceiver and gain circuits for analog signal conditioning . The A D resides on the MSP430 chip . The smart module of the present invention can switch power to a sensor read analog signals from the sensor and communicate with a payload or laptop through the RS 232 port . The XBee radio provides a short range connection to other wireless devices and smart modules.

Compact flash card may be provided to store data for later retrieval and also to store programming for the MSP430 processor . Using a compact flash card for programming of MSP430 processor allows the functionality of the device to be changed for different applications simply by changing flash cards. In the preferred embodiment all the applications are supplied in the program code. A user may access a configuration mode and then select the desired application e.g. backup transmitter smart sensor etc. 

Referring to in wireless mode the smart module of the present invention functions the same as the wired mode except that the smart module at the sensor may communicate with another smart module connected to the payload. The smart module at the sensor is called a Smart End Device and the smart module at the payload is called a Smart Coordinator. As illustrated in a number of Smart End Devices and may be provided each connected via port to a corresponding sensor or sensors A B C and D. Smart End Devices and may be connected wirelessly using XBee interface of to another smart module configured as a Smart Module Coordinator . All smart modules and whether configured as Smart End Devices or Smart Module Coordinators may be physically the same or substantially similar. The functionality of each device maybe programmed either on site remotely or before installation by altering the programming via compact flash card or by programming through XBee interface RS 232 interface or via 9602 modem . Data from Smart Module Coordinator may be sent to Iridium or other type of satellite or other wireless or wired communications network to ground station where data may be collected and analyzed. The modular nature of this design allows the use and re use of interchangeable modules rather than relying on custom one off integrated designs which are difficult to alter in the field.

Referring back to Smart Module Coordinator may communicate wirelessly to one or more Smart End Devices and to acquire data and then may send this data to the payload on a serial port or other data pathway. Smart Module Coordinator may be programmed to communicate with several Smart End Devices and . In this manner a number of Smart End Devices may be linked together and a data buoy or other data station may be upgraded and expanded without having to reprogram existing sensors A B C and D. The use of linked smart modules allows for a single data channel to be created for multiple modules limiting the need for multiple modems and antennas . Smart sensor modules may be combined in a number of combinations and communicate wirelessly or in a wired manner with each other and the system may be upgraded altered reworked or revamped in a modular fashion without having to redesign the underlying data acquisition system either existing legacy systems or a new smart module based system.

The use of the Smart Module Coordinator allows data from a number of different sensors A B C and D to be combined into one data payload and uploaded to satellite . Alternatively each of Smart End Devices and may communicate directly with satellite without the need for Smart Module Coordinator . However such a configuration may run the risk of different Smart End Devices and trying to transmit at the same time and thus interfering with each other s data signals. In such an event built in satellite communications protocols may handle re tries of data transmission. Note that the embodiment of is exemplary only and not limiting in the number and arrangement of configurations. For example one of Smart End Devices and may be designated as a Smart Module Coordinator logging data from a sensor and also receiving data from its fellow Smart Modules. If the Smart Module Coordinator fails another of the Smart End Devices may be programmed to take over the Smart Module Coordinator duties thus enhancing the robustness of the overall system.

Smart End Devices and may be constructed along the lines of or may be modified by deleting the 9602 Iridium modem and L band antenna a neutered Smart End Device . The Smart End Device may then log data from an attached sensor and then communicate this data in serial form via XBee interface or via wired serial interface through wet plug . Smart Coordinator may be provided in one embodiment without sensor interface through wet plug and receive data from Smart End Devices and via wired or wireless interface. Smart Coordinator may then package this data and upload it via 9602 Iridium Modem and L band antenna .

However in the preferred embodiment all of the smart modules of may have identical or similar electrical configurations so that they may be programmed and interchanged in the field thus reducing inventory requirements and reduce costs through economies of scale. Smart modules may be provided with similar or identical hardware and then programmed in the field to act as Smart End Devices logging data from sensors and Smart Coordinators accumulating data from Smart End Devices and uploading the data via satellite. In this manner the inventory of different device types is reduced and redundant capabilities are provided in the field. If one smart module fails in whole or in part another module may be configured even remotely to take over chores of the failed module even by remote configuration.

A battery backup in the form of four 4 9 volt batteries or other battery types e.g. rechargeable lithium ion batteries D cell batteries or the like may be provided within the smart module enclosure . This battery backup may be used to provide Compact Position Reporting. In the event of a power failure on a data buoy or other data acquisition device or other application the battery backup may be used to power the device which may then upload the current GPS position from GPS receiver via 9602 Iridium modem so that the device may be tracked. When processor detects a sustained power failure from power conditioning circuit the device may go into Compact Position Reporting mode. In this mode sensor data logging may be discontinued and an error or alarm message may be transmitted periodically along with GPS position data. The battery backup may be capable of delivering uninterrupted service of up to two years with two reports per day allowing more than sufficient time for service personnel to locate and service the device.

The present invention provides a stand alone smart sensor module which may be implemented to a data buoy or other data logging device without the need to reconfigure the data logging device or buoy to add additional sensor capabilities. The present invention provides a compact and easy to install module that stands alone from existing data acquisition systems and thus requires no interface to existing data acquisition systems. It is compact lightweight and inexpensive enough such that each new sensor may be provided with its own smart module thus eliminating the need to reprogram existing data logging systems when new sensors are added. A number of other applications are also possible.

The Smart Sensor Module may be reused and modified for other purposes in addition to its use as interface for an analog sensor. It may be used as a wireless coordinator to other Smart Module interfaced devices or used for higher level processing like the development underway with the aforementioned AIRMAR PB200 all in one sensor. Thus the sensor part of the name may be dropped to just Smart Module or SM. From a building block standpoint one can modify the firmware to accomplish a different task or processing need. Modifying the firmware is simplified from two standpoints. One it uses an RTOS which makes timing matters much easier. Second the application can be very specific and not as complex as the usual NDBC payload. Thus the required programming and testing is much less complex and time consuming.

Referring to on demand station data retrieval may be provided in one embodiment of the present invention. With code to interface smart end devices and and a wireless smart module coordinator connected to a payload a data acquisition operator may request missed transmissions from a payload. Such an embodiment may increase availability and allow for retrieving data reports from storms that were missed onshore. The smart module coordinator may routinely acquire a payload message and store it. Then upon request from the data center the smart module coordinator may send back whichever message the data center desired through the Iridium modem. The smart module coordinator may also provide the GPS time position and telemetry. The smart module coordinator with wireless capability may collect messages from any smart module end device and report them back to shore and be controlled by shore operators.

The smart module of the present invention may also be used as a standalone basic weather reporting system known as the Smart Weather Station SWS . The smart module may be interfaced with an all in one weather sensor providing basic weather data such as wind speed wind direction temperature dew point and the like and a small power system to make a small inexpensive portable basic weather station. Such a weather station may be useful where a service visit to a non reporting station occurs and discovers severe mast damage that cannot be fixed at sea or at a land location. The standalone weather system may be installed to acquire positioning and some basic level of weather data. Such an all in one weather system may be less expensive to deploy as it is based on the standard smart module thus reducing inventory costs and taking advantage of lower construction costs through large scale production.

There has been a long desire to be able to quickly install a small basic weather station package in the field when damaged or inoperative weather buoys are encountered. The smart module of the present invention makes this a real possibility. The smart module may be interfaced with an AIRMAR PB200 weather instrument as illustrated in . The Smart Weather Station provides a compact weather station which may be installed on a platform to acquire and report base meteorological data in situations where no other weather system is available e.g. destroyed buoy mast or inoperative non repairable systems encountered in the field .

The Smart Weather Station SWS is constructed as illustrated in . The AIRMAR PB200 and Smart Module are functionally tested and then the two are then integrated configured via user port and tested in a blue tag type test to verify readiness. The system is started by simply connecting power. The SWS then enters a deployment mode which acquires data for four minutes then transmits a standard NDBC National Buoy Data Center formatted message to shore. This cycle is repeated again at a five minute boundary five more times. Thus in total six transmissions are sent at five minutes apart. Depending on the startup time the first report may not contain data due to the short time to the five minute boundary. The SWS then exits deployment mode after 30 minutes. Data is then acquired and reported hourly. In buoy mode this is minute 42 to 50 followed by an immediate transmission. In C MAN mode this is minute 58 to 00 followed by an immediate transmission.

If the battery input voltage falls below 9.5V the SWS enters a fail safe mode where data collection and reporting stops. In this mode it will use its internal 9V battery pack to acquire and report a GPS position once per day. The pack will last three years with one report per day. If system power returns the SWS will complete the deployment mode again and then acquisition and reporting operation.

Other SWS capabilities include 32 GB of internal storage of raw time series data and engineering level system debug information back channel shore to SWS interface to reconfigure the SWS for longer reporting intervals or any of its many configuration parameters. One TAO battery canister two lithium packs is used to power the SWS for one year when configured for hourly reporting.

The SWS is designed to mount on three meter and six meter buoys. illustrates a 3 meter buoy . The SWS less the battery pack mounting hole matches the anemometer mount. The battery box installs on the upper mast of a three meter buoy near the beacon light and matches existing hole patterns. The SWS and battery box have mounting brackets that can be strapped to any floating structure using stainless steel tie wraps or u bolts or other appropriate means. The exact method used will be determined by the field service team at the particular buoy. In general the SWS should be installed as high as possible above the buoy deck like anemometers and away from metal obstructions over the enclosure lid or else the Iridium antenna under the lid will be blocked and transmissions will fail. The platform condition sea state and available ship time may force other options to be used.

The smart module of the present invention may be used as a standalone interface for non governmental sensors or systems. In some situations an external customer or agency may desire to install a sensor on a buoy and report data in real time. The Smart Module of the present invention may be used to create a combination to interface private sensors without modifying existing National Weather Service Climate or Tsunami warning systems. Alternately such private data may be passed through a Smart Module Coordinator and transmitted along with weather data to shore.

The smart module of the present invention may be applied to other applications such as the Wave Glider autonomous self powered buoy. The wave glider may provide power from onboard systems and the smart module may fit in the spare area called the payload of the glider. External antenna access may need to be provided as the payload area is behind the glider solar panels which would likely block RF signals to the Iridium satellite.

The apparatus and methods of the present invention may be applied to other applications in addition to weather data buoys and the likes. The smart module of the present invention may also be marketed as is or in a slightly modified configuration as portable weather station for enthusiasts in the general public. For example a smart weather station module may be configured to communicate data from a remote home weather station to a home computer smart phone or other device via a home wi fi network

Similarly a network of smart sensors may be installed across farms to better allocate water resources or in severe weather zones to help monitor tornadic derecho and other severe weather activity.

While disclosed in the context of weather data the apparatus and methods of the present invention may also be applied to security and industrial applications such as biohazard monitoring motion sensors security cameras and other types of data and security sensors without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

While the preferred embodiment and various alternative embodiments of the invention have been disclosed and described in detail herein it may be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
