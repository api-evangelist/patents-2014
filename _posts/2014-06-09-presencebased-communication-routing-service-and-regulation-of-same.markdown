The subject application is continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 756 473 entitled PRESENCE BASED COMMUNICATION ROUTING SERVICE AND REGULATION OF THE SAME and filed on Apr. 8 2010. The entirety of the above referenced application is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates to wireless and wireline communications and more particularly to communication routing service amongst wireless and wireline devices based on subscriber preferences and presence information of a mobile device in confined home or visited wireless environments and to regulation of the communication routing service.

Wireless communication offers an array of services that allow substantive personalization of mobile devices employed for telecommunication thus a significant segment of wireless service subscribers employ their mobile devices as primary point of contact with other parties even when the mobile devices operate indoors. Available wireline services such as digital television internet protocol IP television media on demand broadband internet access voice over internet protocol VoIP communications also can provide highly customized services and can satisfy the communication needs of the wireless service subscribers particularly within the confined environment in which the various devices that provide the wireline services are deployed. Even though a wireless subscriber has access to highly personalized service in both the wireless service domain and the wireline service domain a calling party to a wireless subscriber generally originates a communication without knowledge of communication mechanism preference e.g. wireless service or wireline service of the wireless subscriber. In addition the calling party typically does not know a current location of the wireless subscriber at home at the workplace in transit in a vehicle out of wireless service area etc. which can dictate election of a specific called device e.g. cellular telephone VoIP device associated with the wireless subscriber. As a result connectivity amongst the calling party and the wireless subscriber can suffer due to various usage pitfalls with the ensuing perceived quality of service degradation. For example the wireless subscriber may not be reached because the wireless subscriber was distanced from his mobile device when an important communication was directed to the mobile device thus the important communication can be directed to a voice mail inbox that is accessed at a time the communication has become irrelevant. As another example the wireless subscriber may not be reached because the calling party directed her call to a wireline telephone in the wireless subscriber s office while the wireless subscriber was outside the office.

While wireline networks can be integrated with network elements that provide wireless services in indoor and outdoor environments integration of wireless service domain and wireline service domain within indoor environments has been directed primarily to provision of certain control functions of specific devices and telecommunication enhancement and continuity e.g. call session preservation during handover from macrocell coverage to femtocell coverage . Generally network integration and regulation thereof have not been exploited to pursue robust connectivity that mitigates common usage pitfalls amongst other wireless service deficiencies that can lead to low perceived quality of service and related subscriber attrition.

The following presents a simplified summary of the subject disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects thereof. This summary is not an extensive overview of the various embodiments of the subject disclosure. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the subject disclosure nor delineate any scope thereof. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented hereinafter.

One or more embodiments of the subject disclosure provide systems methods and user interfaces that enable presence based customized routing of an incoming communication to wireless device s or wireline device s and regulation of the presence based customized routing. The customized routing is based on at least one routing preference and presence information of a mobile device in a confined wireless environment served by an access point. The spatial boundaries of the confined wireless environment are determined by the coverage range or radius of the access point and thus the confined wireless environment can correspond to a confined coverage area which can include indoor space outdoor space or a combination thereof. The at least one routing preference is specific to a subscriber who owns or leases and operates the mobile device and thus is a personalized routing preference. The at least one routing preference can be configured for a device wireless or otherwise that operates in a confined home or visited wireless environment whereas the confined coverage AP can be owned or leased by a subscriber associated with the incoming call or by a third party. The confined coverage AP provides wireless service to the confined wireless environment. The at least one routing preference is subscriber specific and configurable by the subscriber linked to the mobile device whereas the presence condition reveals if the mobile device is attached to the confined coverage AP and is automatically detected. Presence based customized communication routing of an incoming call based on a third party confined coverage AP can be provisioned in accordance with one or more events. In an aspect the one or more events can include for example update of an access control list that regulates access to the third party confined coverage AP and wireless coverage furnished thereby registration of a mobile device on a femtocell AP which can enable extrinsic forwarding service or the like. Add on communication services also can be provisioned and configured screening of incoming call s based on screening rule s specific to a confined coverage AP that hosts customized communication routing service is provided. Customized communication routing to equipment that operates in a confined area served by a third party confined coverage AP can be cancelled.

A routing server retrieves or receives or otherwise accesses the at least one routing preference and the presence information for the mobile device. The presence information for the mobile device can originate in i a confined coverage AP that serves a first confined area and is owned or leased by a subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device or ii in a confined coverage AP that serves a second confined area and is owned or leased by a third party. Accordingly the subscriber need not own or lease a confined coverage AP to benefit from presence based customized routing as described herein. In addition the at least one routing preference can be specific to a confined coverage AP owned or leased by the subscriber or a third party confined coverage AP. Based on routing logic applied to the at least one routing preference and the presence information the routing server directs the incoming communication to a set of wireline devices a set of wireless devices or a combination thereof.

In an aspect a customization server manages e.g. retrieves receives generates modifies or commits a set of routing preferences linked to a subscriber that consumes personalized communication routing the routing preferences in the set are personalized routing preferences. In one or more embodiments a configuration component that is part of the customization server provides a configuration environment e.g. a graphical user interface a user interface . . . to collect data that defines at least in part a routing preference that is personalized or specific to a subscriber. The routing preference can be configured for routing of an incoming communication based on presence condition in a confined coverage AP owned or leased by the subscriber that configures the routing preference or in a third party confined coverage AP. As part of the configuration environment distinctive ringing can be configured for a device that operates in a confined wireless area served by the third party confined coverage AP and receives a presence based custom routed call session. In such one or more embodiments the configuration component also can provide a disparate configuration environment to collect data that establishes the screening rule s to be employed with a filtering service which can be at least one of several add on communication services available in conjunction with presence based customized routing.

An interface component can render the configuration environment to receive the data the interface component conveys the data to the customization component which can commit the data in routing preference storage or process e.g. decode modify the data prior to data commitment in the routing preference storage. The configuration component is remote to the customization component and communicates thereto via an interface that can include at least one of wired links wireless links or network functional elements. In alternative or additional embodiments the interface component and the customization component can be integrated in a subscriber device e.g. a mobile device . Collected data that defines a routing preference is delivered to the customization server for management of at least one routing preference.

In another aspect a client server architecture enables generation of presence information of the mobile device based in part on processing of attachment signaling exchanged with a confined coverage access point generation can include detection processing and reporting of a presence condition of the mobile device. Based on deployment e.g. installation configuration testing and acceptance the client server architecture can implement various procedures to ascertain a presence condition of the mobile device. The procedures include a network based procedures wherein a presence client component embodied in a network element executes at least part of the procedures b access network based procedures wherein the presence client component resides in an confined coverage access point and executes at least part of procedures and c mobile device procedures wherein the presence client component in the mobile device executes at least part of the procedures. For the various procedures a presence server in the telecommunication network platform of a wireless service provider supplies e.g. produces and stores one or more presence condition records based on attachment notification s and related location data such records can be retained in a memory and reveal whether a mobile device is attached to a femtocell access point or not.

Aspects features or advantages of the subject disclosure are network and radio technology agnostic and can be exploited in substantially any network and through most any or any wireless communication technology. For example Wi Fi wireless fidelity Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX IS 95 Enhanced General Packet Radio Service Enhanced GPRS Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Long Term Evolution LTE Third Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 Ultra Mobile Broadband UMB 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS High Speed Packet Access HSPA High Speed Downlink Packet Access HSDPA High Speed Uplink Packet Access HSUPA or LTE Advanced. Additionally substantially all or all aspects of the subject disclosure can include legacy telecommunication technologies.

While various aspects features or advantages of the subject disclosure are illustrated in reference to femtocell femto access point s such aspects and features also can be exploited in other types of confined coverage access points e.g. home based access point s enterprise based access point s that provide wireless coverage to a confined wireless environment through substantially any or any disparate telecommunication technologies such as but not limited to Wi Fi or picocell telecommunication.

Data and signaling streams can be packetized or frame based flows. It is noted that context in the subject specification generally distinguishes amongst a base station that provides or is intended to provide primarily outdoor wireless coverage and a facility based access point e.g. femtocell AP that provides or is intended to provide primarily indoor wireless coverage or outdoor wireless coverage within a confined range. Explicit distinction between indoor serving AP and outdoor serving base station is made when context may be insufficient to distinguish the utilized terms.

Furthermore the terms user subscriber customer consumer and the like are employed interchangeably throughout the subject specification unless context warrants particular distinction s among the terms. It should be appreciated that such terms can refer to human agent s or automated component s supported through artificial intelligence e.g. a capacity to make inference based on complex mathematical formalisms which can provide simulated vision sound recognition and so forth.

As an illustration a set of devices includes one or more devices a set of access points includes K access points with K a natural number greater than or equal to unity a set of attributes spans one or more attributes etc.

As described in detail below the subject disclosure provides system s and method s that enable routing of an incoming communication or incoming call to wireless device s or wireline device s based in part on at least one routing preference and presence information of a mobile device in a confined wireless environment served by a confined coverage access point. The at least one routing preference is specific to a subscriber who owns or leases and operates the mobile device and thus the at least one routing preference is personalized to the subscriber. A routing server retrieves or receives or otherwise accesses the at least one routing preference and the presence information for the mobile device. In an aspect the routing server is functionally coupled to or integrated at least in part with one or more functional elements of a telecommunication network platform that enable standard call processing.

While aspects or features of the subject disclosure are illustrated in terms of applicability to femtocell access points such aspects and features are also applicable to and can be exploited in other radio access points such as Wi Fi APs picocell base station microcell base stations or the like which may provide greater radio access capacity.

Various illustrative scenarios are set forth herein to represent example operational environments that exploit one or more features of communication routing based on femtocell present intelligence as described herein and reveal the utility of such one or more features. The various illustrative scenarios are of course not exhaustive of the multiple operational environments in which the one or more features described in the subject disclosure can be exploited. In addition the various illustrative scenarios and related examples are intended to be non limiting without restricting the applicability or utility of the various embodiments of systems and methods described herein or any modification or variations thereof.

With respect to the drawings illustrates a schematic deployment of a macrocells and a femtocells for wireless service coverage in accordance with aspects of the subject disclosure. In wireless environment two areas represent macrocell macro cell coverage each macrocell is served by a base station which includes a set of one or more antennas and various equipment or apparatuses that enable operation of the base station. It should be appreciated that macro cells are illustrated as hexagons however macrocells can adopt other geometries generally dictated by the deployment or floor plan geographic areas to be covered e.g. a metropolitan statistical area MSA or rural statistical area RSA and so on. Macro coverage is generally intended to serve mobile wireless devices like UE in primarily outdoor locations. An over the air wireless link provides such coverage the wireless link comprises a downlink DL and an uplink UL and utilizes a predetermined band of the radio frequency RF spectrum. As an example UE can be a Third Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS mobile phone. It is noted that a base station its associated electronics circuitry or components and a wireless link operated in accordance to the base station form a radio access network RAN . In addition base station communicates with macro network platform via backhaul link s through one or more components e.g. radio network controller s aggregator component s . . . that are part of access network s aspects and deployment of the one or more components are dictated by the underlying radio technology employed for telecommunication. In cellular wireless technologies e.g. 3rd Generation Partnership Project 3GPP Universal Mobile Telecommunication System UMTS Global System for Mobile Communication GSM macro network platform represents a core network. In an aspect macro network platform controls a set of base stations that serve either respective cells or a number of sectors within such cells. Macro network platform also communicates with other base stations not shown that serve other cells not shown . Backhaul link s can include a wired backbone link e.g. optical fiber backbone twisted pair line T1 E1 phone line a digital subscriber line DSL either synchronous or asynchronous an asymmetric ADSL or a coaxial cable . . . . Backhaul pipe s link disparate base stations .

In wireless environment within one or more macro coverage cells a set of femtocells served by respective femtocell femto access points APs can be deployed. While in illustrative wireless environment three femtocells are deployed per macrocell aspects of the subject innovation are geared to femtocell deployments with substantive femto AP density e.g. 10 10femto APs per base stations . A femtocell typically covers an area that includes confined area which is determined at least in part by transmission power allocated to femto AP path loss shadowing and so forth. While coverage area associated with femtocell and confined area typically coincide it should be appreciated that in certain deployment scenarios coverage area can include an outdoor portion e.g. a parking lot a patio deck a recreation area such as a swimming pool and nearby space while area spans an enclosed living space. The coverage area associated with femtocell typically is spanned by a coverage radius or coverage range that ranges from 20 to 100 meters. The confined coverage area can encompass a setting that can span about 5000 sq. ft. and can include a residential dwelling a business space an entertainment area a worship area an educational facility a wellness area a hospital etc. and access to wireless service typically is regulated. In addition or in the alternative the confined coverage area can be mobile for example it can be part of a vehicle a car an elevator an aircraft a vessel etc. . It should be noted that the confined coverage area is substantially smaller e.g. 1 3 orders of magnitude smaller than a macrocell .

In the subject disclosure a confined coverage area such as confined coverage area embodies a confined wireless environment which as indicated supra can include indoor space outdoor space or a combination thereof. In addition femtocell AP e.g. or any other type of access point e.g. Wi Fi AP picocell AP that serves the confined coverage area e.g. is referred to as confined coverage AP to denote that such an AP provides wireless service coverage to a confined wireless environment. Moreover a confined coverage AP transmits electromagnetic radiation e.g. radiates at lower power than a base station intended for outdoor coverage and that serves a macrocell. In an aspect an AP e.g. femtocell AP picocell Wi Fi AP that serves the confined coverage area e.g. can be deployed within the indoor space e.g. within a building or structure that the AP serves outdoor space that is part of the confined coverage area e.g. confined coverage area also is served by the AP. In yet another aspect an AP that covers the confined coverage area e.g. can be deployed in the outdoor space that the AP serves in certain deployments the AP can be mounted on or attached to non residential structure present in the outdoor space that is part of the confined area. A confined coverage area e.g. confined coverage area referred to in the subject disclosure is owned or leased by the owner or lessee of the AP that serves the confined coverage area where the AP is deployed as part of structure mobile or stationary within the confined coverage area.

A femto AP typically serves a few for example 1 5 wireless devices e.g. subscriber station within confined coverage area via a wireless link which encompasses a downlink DL and an uplink UL . A femto network platform can control such service in addition to mobility handover from macro to femto handover and vice versa and registration and provisioning of femto APs. Control or management is facilitated by backhaul link s that connect deployed femto APs with femto network platform through one or more components of access network s . The one or more components can include a network interface device NID a gateway node a digital subscriber line DLS access multiplexer DSLAM or the like. In addition the one or more components of access network s can be functionally coupled to an access aggregator node which can be embodied in a broadband remote access server B RAS such aggregator node generally is functionally coupled to a femtocell gateway node not shown deployed e.g. installed configured and active within femto network platform . Backhaul pipe s are substantially the same as backhaul link s . In UMTS based radio technology backhaul link is embodied at least in part in Iuh interface.

In an aspect of the subject innovation part of the control effected by femto AP is based on measurements of radio link conditions and other performance metrics. Femto network platform also includes components e.g. nodes gateways and interfaces that facilitates packet switched PS e.g. internet protocol IP traffic and signaling generation for networked telecommunication. It should be appreciated that femto network platform can be femto AP can integrate seamlessly with substantially any packet switched PS based and circuit switched CS based network such as macro network platform . Thus operation with a wireless device such as is substantially straightforward and seamless when handover from femto to macro or vice versa takes place. As an example femto AP can integrate into an existing 3GPP Core Network via conventional interfaces or reference links such as Iu CS Iu PS Gi or Gn. In addition femto AP can serve a mobile device that operates in accordance with 3GPP radio technology ies without dedicated functionality such as Wi Fi receivers.

It is to be noted that substantially all voice or data active sessions associated with subscribers within femtocell wireless coverage e.g. area are terminated once the femto AP is shut down in case of data sessions data can be recovered at least in part through a buffer e.g. a memory associated with a femto gateway at the femto network platform. Coverage of a suspended or hotlined subscriber station or associated account can be blocked over the air interface. However if a suspended or hotlined customer who owns a femto AP is in Hotline Suspend status there is no substantive impact to the customers covered through the subject femto AP . In another aspect femto AP can exploit high speed downlink packet access either via an interface with macro network platform or through femto network platform in order to accomplish substantive bitrates.

In addition in yet another aspect femto AP has cell identifier s e.g. in UMTS based radio technology a LAC location area code or a RAC routing area code that is different from the underlying macro network. It should be appreciated that in macro networks cell identifiers IDs such as LAC and RAC are reused over several base stations or Node Bs and large areas so location information or intelligence accuracy and attachment procedure s e.g. LAU or RAU frequency are relatively low. It should be noted that based at least in part on radio technology deployment for macro networks cell ID reuse granularity may differ wherein radio technologies with distributed processing and more signaling capacity may afford more granular cell ID e.g. LAC and RAC assignments.

Femto LAC and RAC are used to identify subscriber station location for a variety of reasons most notably to direct incoming voice and data traffic to appropriate paging transmitters and emergency calls as well. As a subscriber station e.g. UE that exploits macro coverage e.g. cell enters femto coverage e.g. area the subscriber station e.g. UE attempts to attach to the femto AP through transmission and reception of attachment signaling. The signaling is effected via DL UL in an aspect of the subject innovation the attachment signaling can include a Location Area Update LAU and or Routing Area Update RAU . As an example of attachment procedure and mechanis s associated therewith UMTS handsets monitor network pilots e.g. generated through a femtocell or femtocell AP while in the idle mode each pilot includes LAC and or RAC. As a subscriber station moves between pilots e.g. moves within a macro sector and reaches vicinity of a femto cell the subscriber station probes for a change in LAC or RAC. When a change in LAC or RAC is detected the subscriber station performs LAU and or RAU so mobile network s becomes aware of subscriber station location in order to properly route incoming call pages. Attachment attempts are thus a part of procedures to ensure mobility so voice calls and data sessions can be initiated even after a macro to femto transition or vice versa.

It is to be noted that UE can be employed seamlessly after either of the foregoing transitions. In addition femto networks typically are designed to serve stationary or slow moving traffic with reduced signaling loads compared to macro networks. A service provider network e.g. an entity that commercializes deploys or utilizes femto access point or macrocell base stations is therefore inclined to minimize unnecessary LAU RAU signaling activity at substantially any opportunity to do so and through substantially any available means. It is to be noted that substantially any mitigation of unnecessary attachment signaling control is advantageous for femtocell or femtocell AP operation. Conversely if not successful UE is generally commanded through a variety of communication means to select another LAC RAC or enter emergency calls only mode. It is to be appreciated that this attempt and handling process can occupy significant UE battery and femto AP capacity and signaling resources e.g. communication of pilot sequences as well.

When an attachment attempt is successful UE is allowed on femtocell and incoming voice and data traffic are paged and routed to the subscriber through the femto AP . To facilitate voice and data routing and control signaling as well successful attachment can be recorded in a memory register e.g. a Visited Location Register VLR or substantially any data structure stored in a network memory. It is to be noted also that packet communication e.g. voice and data traffic and signaling typically paged routed through a backhaul broadband wired network backbone e.g. optical fiber backbone twisted pair line T1 E1 phone line s T3 phone line s digital level zero line DS0 digital subscriber line DSL either synchronous or asynchronous an asymmetric DSL a coaxial cable . . . . To this end femto AP is typically connected to the broadband backhaul network backbone via a broadband modem not shown . In an aspect of the subject innovation femto AP can display status indicators for power active broadband DSL connection gateway connection and generic or specific malfunction. In another aspect no landline is necessary for femto AP operation.

An incoming call is initially processed in accordance with standard call processing logic which in an aspect of the subject disclosure is configured e.g. adapted or modified to enable processing of the incoming call in accordance with customized call processing logic such enablement illustrated with a dashed arrow outgoing from block to block . The incoming call can be a wireless call or a wireline call. Customized call processing logic consumes information generated as part of presence intelligence collection logic and called party routing preferences collection logic . In the subject specification and annexed drawings routing preferences are also referred to as preferences. A subscriber that utilizes the customized communication routing service can configure at least one routing preference. The presence intelligence collection logic produces a femtocell presence condition associated with a location of a destination mobile device e.g. UE the femtocell presence condition can be embodied in a record e.g. a logical variable or a field entry in table retained in a memory or memory element such as a database or a memory register. Based on at least one of a presence condition and a routing preference customized call processing logic determines appropriate call handling to apply and after applying such handling it provides signaling and related payload data to standard call processing logic such provision is illustrated in the subject drawing as an outgoing dashed arrow. Standard call processing logic consumes such signaling and related payload data and completes call session establishment resulting in setup call which can be consumed in a wireline device or a wireless device or any combination thereof.

The various aspects disclosed herein in connection with customized call processing do not affect adversely the operational features of wireless devices and wireline devices that establish a call session according to aspects described herein. A subscriber that consumes the customized routing service set forth in the subject disclosure continues to be able to utilize their wired and wireless devices to communicate without operation features thereof being degraded.

Implementation of the logic described in connection with diagram enables at least the communication scenarios illustrated in . In diagram of a first communication scenario a confined area is afforded wireless service through femtocell AP also referred to herein and annexed drawings as femto AP . The femtocell AP is connected to an access network e.g. via NID . The confined area is illustrated as a residential dwelling such as a single family home or an apartment with four living areas and one exterior space e.g. a deck patio veranda garage or combination thereof covered by femtocell AP . It should be appreciated that while a single femto AP is illustrated features of the subject communication scenario are also realized in dwelling areas covered by a plurality of two or more femtocell access points. It should further be appreciated that the confined area can be embodied in other locations such as a business space e.g. a hotel an enterprise place of operation a factory an entertainment area which can include bars night clubs or the like a worship area such as a church or mosque an educational facility which can include open and semi open spaces as it may be the case in a college campus a wellness area e.g. a health club a hospital or nursing home etc. In addition femto AP or one femto AP in the plurality of one or more femtocell APs can supply wireless service to more or less than four indoor areas and one exterior space.

In an aspect of the subject first scenario mobile device can be located in living area within an enclosure e.g. a purse located in an upstairs bedroom or deposited in a piece of furniture e.g. dresser in the upstairs bedroom . A subscriber linked to the mobile device e.g. the mobile device s owner can roam throughout the residential dwelling without carrying mobile device . In particular the subscriber illustrated with a solid star can be at living area e.g. the kitchen of residential dwelling conducting a specific activity e.g. cooking with grandchildren or cooking and watching television when an incoming call directed to mobile device is effected. As an example incoming call can be a voice call placed by the subscriber s neighbor to alert the subscriber that the subscriber s dog is loose in the neighbor s backyard. In conventional communication scenarios that do not exploit customized call processing logic the subscriber misses the established call session . In contrast if customized call processing logic is configured in instances the subscriber is at the residential dwelling incoming call intended for mobile device can be automatically routed as a call session e.g. voice call to one or more devices wireless or wireline within residential dwelling e.g. devices or or a combination thereof. In particular call session can be established through wireline telephone placed in living area and thus the subscriber can answer the call session . Such communication behavior has at least the following advantages with respect to conventional communication scenarios i Improved service experience for the subscriber and related customer satisfaction with the ensuing enhanced service provider stickiness e.g. lessened churn reduction and ii increased connectivity and related service delivery.

In the foregoing communication scenario the instances in which the subscriber is within confined area can be asserted based at least on a presence condition extracted from data on attachment to femtocell AP . Likewise instances in which the subscriber is outside area of femtocell service coverage also can be asserted based at least on a presence condition gleaned from data on attachment to a macrocellular base station not shown in . As described in greater detail below changes in presence conditions associated with mobility of mobile device outside femtocell service coverage can result in incoming calls intended to mobile device no longer being routed to one or more devices within the confined area .

In another aspect of the subject first communication scenario the subscriber can be in a semi open area e.g. area separated from mobile device when incoming call e.g. voice call directed to mobile device is effected the subscriber represented by an open star in . In view that the subscriber is distanced from the mobile device in conventional communication scenarios that do not exploit customized call processing logic the subscriber typically misses the incoming call . Yet when customized call processing logic is enabled and active e.g. configured with a set of routing preferences and based on at least one routing preference and a presence record the incoming call can be routed as a call session to one or more devices e.g. wireless devices and that are attached to femtocell AP . The at least one preference can be configured e.g. generated conveyed or committed by the subscriber via at least one functional element e.g. a device or apparatus . Proximity of such mobile stations to the subscriber represented by open star and the subject customized routing prevent the subscriber from missing the incoming call and enable the subscriber to engage in the call session originating from incoming call . In an aspect the subject disclosure allows simultaneous or substantially simultaneous ringing of mobile device and mobile stations and . Specific ringtones can alert the subscriber and bearers of mobile stations and that the established call session is intended for the subscriber. As an illustration after entering confined area the subscriber can leave the mobile device in her purse in living space while bearers of mobile stations and who can be family members of the subscriber carry such mobile stations with them while inside the confined area . If the subscriber represented with an open star and the bearers of mobile stations and are located in exterior space and incoming call intended for mobile device is effected by an end user linked to the subscriber such as a friend of the subscriber a call session can be established with the mobile device and mobile stations and based on at least one of one or more customized routing preferences linked to the subscriber and presence record that reveals mobile device is within confined area . Bearers of mobile stations and can identify the end user and provide the subscriber with one of the mobile stations or so the subscriber can respond to the call session and thus not miss the incoming call.

In yet another aspect of the subject first scenario incoming call e.g. voice call can be a wireline call intended for a wireline device e.g. telephone within residential dwelling . Conventionally in communication scenarios that do not exploit customized call processing logic a subscriber misses the incoming call when the subscriber is outside residential dwelling and related femtocell service coverage area. In contrast in accordance with aspects of the subject innovation at a time customized call processing logic is configured such deficiency is mitigated or avoided if the subscriber is linked or associated to a mobile device e.g. or other one or more devices not shown with wireless capability that operate in close proximity of the subscriber. In particular in an instance the subscriber is outside residential dwelling and based on at least one routing preference the incoming call e.g. voice call intended for the wireline device e.g. telephone can be routed automatically e.g. without human intervention as a call session to the mobile device e.g. or the other one or more devices with wireless capability that operate in close proximity of the subscriber. In an aspect the at least one routing preference is associated with the subscriber the association can be a one to one relationship or a one to many relationship. In another aspect the one or more devices operating in proximity to the subscriber can include a wearable device with enabled wireless capability that is attached to the subscriber s garment or gear goggles helmet etc. . In diagram a dashed star within a coverage cell represents the subscriber being outside area of femtocell coverage provide by femtocell AP and associated with dwelling . As an illustration such customized routing functionality can allow an end user to communicate with the subscriber while unbeknownst to the end user the subscriber is outside the residential dwelling e.g. shopping in grocery store and despite the end user being memory challenged and attempting to communicate through the subscriber s home phone number which the end user has used for the past several e.g. 30 years because the end user s fails to remember subscriber s mobile device number. It should be appreciated that for the end user e.g. the subscriber s aging mother with a perceived imperative need to contact the subscriber as it may be the case when the end user is worried about results of her most recent doctor visit enhanced connectivity can provide an increased perceived quality of service related to the telecommunication service provider.

The functionality afforded by implementation of customized call processing logic in the foregoing scenario results in at least the following advantages with respect to conventional communication scenarios i Improved service experience for the subscriber and related customer satisfaction with the ensuing enhanced service provider commercial stickiness e.g. lessened churn reduction and ii increased connectivity and related service delivery.

The communication scenarios described supra are characterized herein as intrinsic forwarding service scenarios in that the presence intelligence that dictates in part the customized routing is associated with a femtocell AP e.g. femto AP that is owned or leased by the subscriber that consumes the customized communication routing. However at least one additional or alternative communication scenario can be realized Extrinsic forwarding service as described in connection with .

In diagram customized call processing enables an incoming call directed to a first device of a subscriber to be routed to a second device that operates in a Visited area served by femtocell AP which can be leased or owned by a third party e.g. a relative friend colleague a vendor e.g. a dentist a childcare provider or employer of the subscriber. Home area and Visited area can overlap at least in part. The first device of the subscriber can be a mobile device or a wireline device e.g. or which operates within a confined Home area associated with the subscriber. The second device can be a mobile device of the subscriber e.g. or wireless or wireline device deployed within area . Even though a femtocell AP owned or leased by the subscriber is shown within Home area it is noted that extrinsic forwarding service or extrinsic forwarding can be effected in scenarios in which wireless service within Home area is not provided by a femtocell AP. Stated in alternative terms extrinsic forwarding service can be provided to the subscriber even though the subscriber does not own or leases a femtocell AP because extrinsic routing of an incoming call is based on at least femtocell presence intelligence and at least one routing preference rather than the subscriber having femtocell service. At least an advantage of the latter is that an enterprise subscriber e.g. a car dealer a department store a restaurant chain a coffee shop chain that owns or leases a set of femtocell APs or other types of confined coverage APs can offer extrinsic forwarding service to customers of the enterprise subscriber. It should be appreciated that in an embodiment in which femto AP is absent or non operational for at least partially overlapping areas and the presence condition can be dictated by attachment to femto AP while the routing preference can direct calls to wireline devices that operate within area .

Moreover in one or more embodiments a plurality of M Visited areas can allow extrinsic forwarding of an incoming call wherein M is a natural number greater than unity and its magnitude is determined by characteristics of the visited areas. As an example in an enterprise scenario the subscriber can be provided with extrinsic forwarding service in each or at least one facility of an employer e.g. a car dealer or a vendor e.g. the car dealer a restaurant chain a coffee shop chain accordingly M can be large e.g. 50 500. As another example in a residential scenario the subscriber can be allowed extrinsic forwarding service in a group of family members and friends who have access to femtocell service accordingly M can be small e.g. 1 5. In a particular scenario if the frequently visits a relative for example while caring for an aging parent or providing child care service etc. and the relative has an active femtocell AP then the subscriber can be provisioned extrinsic forwarding service.

Similarly to intrinsic routing extrinsic routing can be effected based in part on at least one routing preference and femtocell presence information such as a presence condition record. In comparison to intrinsic routing extrinsic routing further improves i service experience for the subscriber and related customer satisfaction and ii connectivity and related service delivery. The following operational scenario is provided as an illustration of extrinsic forwarding advantages and utility. For a Visited area for which extrinsic forwarding service is active e.g. provisioned and configured for a subscriber that utilizes mobile device the subscriber can receive an incoming communication extrinsically forwarded as a call session to the mobile device and to wireline device which is deployed within the Visited area when the subscriber is within area . The subscriber illustrated with a solid star can thus engage the communication through wireline device which is in proximity of the subscriber even if the mobile device is distanced from the subscriber. For example the subscriber is enjoying a preferred activity such as watching a television movie in a media room with an owner or lessee of Visited area and the mobile device is within the subscriber s purse or coat in a living room that is part of Visited area . It should be appreciated that an incoming call intended for a wireline device that operates within the subscriber s Home area also can be similarly extrinsically routed to mobile device or wireline device or both. In a conventional communication system however the subscriber typically misses the incoming communication in such a situation not a desirable operational aspect since the incoming communication can be a critical communication from the party associated with the subscriber.

The incoming communication that is extrinsically forwarded is intended to the subscriber and effected by a party associated with the subscriber e.g. the subscriber s spouse . Accordingly in an aspect the wireline device can effect a predetermined specific ringtone or alerting pattern to identify the call session as an incoming call that has been extrinsically forwarded and is intended for the subscriber that utilizes mobile device . In another aspect wireline device or another wireline device e.g. a television set not shown can render and identifier code or token to disclose the originator of the incoming call that has been extrinsically forwarded. The foregoing distinctive indicia and identifying information enable the subscriber to engage in the call session rather than the owner or lessee of Visited area .

It should be appreciated that extrinsic forwarding service increases the connectivity of a mobile device of a subscriber during a period the mobile device operates within a visited confined area where femtocell wireless service is available the visited confined area associated with a first geographic location different from a second geographic location linked to the mobile device. Thus the primary beneficiary of the extrinsic forwarding service beneficiary is the subscriber of the mobile device and not the party that owns or leases the femtocell AP that provides wireless coverage to the visited confined area. Accordingly it is desirable and intended for the extrinsic forwarding service to have minimal or no impact to operation of the femtocell communication infrastructure e.g. software or hardware devices access network or core network components of the party that owns or leases the femtocell AP.

It should further be appreciated that in one or more scenarios the owner or lessee of the femtocell AP that provides service to the visited area can be the subscriber that utilizes the mobile device . As an example a business owner with a femtocell AP at his business location can activate extrinsic forwarding service in order to route his home calls automatically to his business location e.g. to a wireline telephone in the business owner s desk.

To provide customized communication routing invocation the at least one component can execute one or more methods for implementing personalized handling of an incoming call wherein the one or more methods can be embodied in at least one set of code instructions retained in a memory in the standard call processing platform s . In an embodiment the one or more methods can be integrated in mechanisms conventionally employed to effect add on communication services in order to modify such mechanisms and afford the one or more features and advantages of the subject disclosure. For example the one or more methods when implemented e.g. executed by at least a processor can exploit Serving Call Session Control Function S CSCF to apply the IMS filter rule that can initiate customized communication routing.

Customized routing server receives the indication to effect customized communication routing. In response the customized routing server retrieves or otherwise accesses a femtocell presence information e.g. a presence condition record of a mobile device associated with the incoming call and b at least one routing preference for customized communication routing. The femtocell presence information establishes if a mobile device of a subscriber that consumes the customized communication routing service is inside a confined area of femtocell coverage service or outside the confined area. In an aspect in an instance the mobile device is inside the confined area the presence condition record can adopt an In Premises value whereas in other instances in which the mobile device is outside the confined area the presence condition record can adopt a Not In Premises value. The In Premises value can be a composite value e.g. a 2 tuple that includes an indicator an alphanumeric flag a set of bits etc. that characterized the femtocell AP that serves the confined area for instance In Premises can equal In 3P In own or In At Home which indicate respectively that the confined area is served by a third party femto AP or by femto AP owned or leased by the subscriber associated with the mobile device for which the presence condition record is established. Other format s for In Premises value that can characterize ownership of the femtocell AP that serves the confined area are also possible. The at least one routing preference can be gathered based in part on the collected presence information in an aspect intrinsic driver can collect the at least one preference in case a presence condition record that embodies the presence information adopts one of In Premises At Home or Not In Premises values whereas extrinsic driver can collect the at least one routing preference if the presence condition record is In Premises At Party Name .

Based on the at least one routing preference for customized communication routing and the femtocell presence information the customized routing server effects personalized communication routing and establishes in part call session . In the illustrated embodiment of customized routing server in example system collection component can retrieve or otherwise access the at least one routing preference from routing preference s storage . Collection component also can extract or otherwise access the presence condition record from presence intelligence storage also referred to as presence intelligence in the subject disclosure. In addition in the illustrated embodiment customized server includes a routing component that directs the incoming communication to one or more devices e.g. device s to establish in part setup call session based in part on the at least one routing preference and the presence condition record. Device s can include mobile devices e.g. cellular telephone cellphone laptop computer with wireless connectivity card netbook DVR . . . and wireline devices e.g. POTS telephone home manager IP based telephone . . . that utilize wireless network resources to telecommunicate voice or data.

Depending in part on the at least one routing preference incoming communication e.g. a wireless call or a wireline call can be routed to a wireless device a wireline device or any combination thereof represented in example system by device s . In an example in a scenario in which the incoming communication is intended to a mobile device e.g. a wireless call if the presence condition record has a value of In Premises and if the at least one routing preference conveys a subscriber associated with the mobile device desires to receive the wireless call on both the mobile device and one or more wireless home devices and one or more wireline home devices then the incoming call e.g. the wireless call is routed to at least one of a wireline number and a wireless number e.g. a cellphone number . The one or more wireless home devices and the one or more wireline home devices are determined in part by the discriminator in In Premises that conveys whether the mobile device is registered on a femto AP owned or leased by the subscriber that owns or leases or is otherwise responsible for the mobile device or a disparate femto AP owned or leased by a third party. In another example in a scenario in which the incoming communication is intended to a wireline home telephone e.g. a wireline call if the presence condition record has a value of Not In Premises and if the at least one routing preference conveys a subscriber associated with the wireline home telephone desires to receive the wireline call on a subscriber mobile device when the subscriber is not at home and the subscriber does not desire their wireline calls to provide alerting when they are not at home then the wireline call is routed to the subscriber mobile device number and not the subscriber s wireline home telephone number.

Routing component can operate in at least one of two routing modes intrinsic forwarding and extrinsic forwarding. In intrinsic forwarding mode routing component implements its functionality as described herein via intrinsic driver component also referred to as intrinsic driver . In extrinsic forwarding mode routing component implements at least part of its functionality through extrinsic driver component also referred to as extrinsic driver . Operation in extrinsic forwarding mode can be provisioned based at least on one or more events that can initialize extrinsic forwarding service extrinsic driver can provision and activate extrinsic forwarding service for a mobile device. The one or more events can include for example update of an access control list that regulates access to femtocell wireless service registration of a mobile device on a femtocell AP which can host extrinsic forwarding service or the like. It should be appreciated that a subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device or operates on the mobile device on behalf of the owner or lessee as it can be the case when the mobile device is a business mobile device owned by the subscriber s employer need not own or lease a femtocell AP in order to be exploit extrinsic forwarding service as described herein.

In an aspect extrinsic driver prioritizes customized communication routing for a mobile device for which intrinsic forwarding service and extrinsic forwarding service are provisioned. In such scenario a first set of routing preferences associated with a presence condition record with In Premises 3P or In Premises Party Name value is assigned precedence over a second set of routing preferences associated with Not In Premises presence condition record. In another aspect extrinsic driver can manage service interaction. To at least that end extrinsic driver can implement e.g. execute at least one protocol or procedure to ensure integrity of communication routing in a scenario in which an owner or lessee of a 3P femtocell AP that enables at least in part extrinsic forwarding service has a disparate call forwarding service provisioned. In such scenario extrinsic driver can deliver a directive to render a service management environment e.g. one or more user interfaces and related navigational indicia in a device wireless or otherwise of the owner or lessee and a subscriber that benefits from extrinsic forwarding service. Extrinsic driver can collect and analyze configuration data for a plurality of call forwarding services and identify integrity issues or potential integrity conflicts amongst extrinsic forwarding service and other call forwarding service s . In yet another aspect extrinsic forwarding driver can administer implementation of specific ringing features based on presence condition record and a routing preference. In a scenario extrinsic forwarding driver can identify a ringtone configured for a device wireless or wireline and deliver a directive to a network node e.g. an AS within IMS core network to set up a session call e.g. setup call employing in part the ringtone.

Presence server determines and maintains generates modifies stores etc. dynamic femtocell presence information which presence server can store in presence intelligence storage within memory . In an aspect based on data the presence server automatically determines the femtocell presence information based in part on whether or not the mobile device is registered on or attached to a femtocell AP that supplies wireless service to the confined area. To provide such functionality the presence server can execute a first set of procedures which can be embodied in one or more sets of code instructions retained in a machine readable or computer readable storage medium. Presence server can be part of a telecommunication network platform e.g. macro network platform or femto network platform or a backend service platform thereof. In an embodiment the presence server can be an application server deployed external to other components of the telecommunication network platform or the backend service platform conventional standardized or proprietary interfaces can be utilized to functionally connect e.g. communicatively couple presence server to the other components. In another embodiment the presence server can be integrated within an existing node in the telecommunication network platform or the backend service platform. For example the existing network node can be a CAMEL serving node in the circuit switched CS domain of the telecommunication network platform a femtocell gateway node or an internet protocol IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS Telephony Application Server TAS .

Data can be generated through execution of a second set of procedures which determine the scope e.g. data domain or data structure of the data various components within at least one of a telecommunication network platform e.g. CN in UMTS based technologies an access network AN or a group of end user devices can execute the second set of procedures. The second set of procedures also can be embodied in one or more sets of code instructions retained in a machine readable or computer readable storage medium. The first set of procedures and the second set of procedures form a group of presence procedures.

The second set of procedures can be categorized based on the component s that can execute such procedures Network based procedure s access network based procedure s and subscriber device based procedure s . Network based procedure s affects primarily one or more components in a telecommunication network platform AN based procedure s affects mainly a femtocell AP while subscriber device based procedure s particularly impacts at least one user device e.g. a mobile device linked to a subscriber that has customized routing service as described herein .

Network Based Procedure s . The second set of procedures can be retained in a memory within the telecommunication network platform administered by a telecommunication carrier or external network s functionally coupled thereto. A procedure in this category is determined in part by the underlying operational features of the telecommunication network platform or the external network s e.g. CS network platform e.g. 2G 2.5G networks or PS network platform e.g. 3G 3.5G or 4G networks . 1 A CS based procedure can exploit Signaling System 7 SS7 signaling and related payload data. In an aspect the CS based procedure can include a group of code instructions retained in memory e.g. memory that can be part of Customized Applications for Mobile Enhanced Logic CAMEL . Presence server can execute the group of code instructions in order to exploit the CAMEL functionality that discloses mobility management events and related data to a Service Control Function SCF component and generate e.g. determine and maintain femtocell presence information. In an aspect a wireless subscriber can be provisioned with CAMEL service s particularly with relevant CAMEL subscription information to support mobility management events. Example mobility management events that presence server can consume to generate a presence condition record associated with femtocell presence information include the following. Location update within a Visited Location Register VLR service area location update to a disparate VLR service area IMSI attach mobile device initiated IMSI detach or explicit detach e.g. the mobile device is powered off or network initiated IMSI detach or implicit detach. The foregoing location update events occur in response to movement of a mobile device between macrocell coverage area e.g. and femtocell coverage area e.g. whereas IMSI attach occurs if a mobile device is powered on and explicit detach occurs if the mobile device is turned off. At least one of the example mobility events can trigger the CAMEL functionality that conveys data on the at least one of the example mobility events to the SCF component based on this conveyance of data the SCF component accesses femtocell presence information which can be delivered to the presence server . Further to femtocell presence information the SCF component can access or otherwise acquire information related to routing incoming calls e.g. . An incoming call destined to a mobile telephone number TN provisioned with customized communication routing can invoke the CAMEL service s . Service logic which can be part of routing logic can be exploited by the SCF component to determine how to route a call based at least on presence condition record s . It should be noted that in certain embodiments when SCF component is invoked and routing information is to be returned or exchanged the SCF component returns a single destination address or number in response to the invocation however in such embodiments various destination addresses can be supplied sequentially. In addition or in the alternative the group of code instructions that are part of the CS procedure can be retained in VLR. As part of the CS procedure the VLR can receive a Location Update message when e.g. at a time or after a time a mobile device of a subscriber that is provisioned customized routing service moves from macrocell coverage to femtocell coverage or from femtocell coverage to macrocell coverage. The VLR can analyze Serving Area Information SAI and determined of the mobile device is attached to a femtocell AP owned or leased by the subscriber or a third party and based on the analysis notify the presence server that the mobile device is in In Premises presence condition or Not In Premises presence condition. For In Premises value a discriminator that characterized the femtocell AP that established femtocell presence intelligence is included. In the alternative or in addition the VLR can send the SAI to presence server which can analyze the information to determine if the presence condition of the mobile device either In Premises or Not In Premises .

 2 A PS based procedure when executed by a functional element can exploit at least one or more components of a PS domain in the telecommunication network for example the one or more components can be part of an IMS core network. As part of the PS based procedure presence server can receive an indication to supply femtocell presence information in response to an incoming call attempt to a mobile device. The incoming call attempt is received by the one or more components which in response apply a filter criterion or filter rule to convey the indication in an aspect the filter criterion can be provisioned in a Home Subscriber Server within the PS domain. The indication can be delivered as part of data . As discussed supra to supply femtocell presence information the presence server can generate or update a presence condition record and deliver it.

An advantage of PS based procedure s is that access to femtocell presence information can be integrated with various PS based e.g. IP based applications that support a myriad of interfaces such as APIs and services including web based services. Another advantage of PS based procedure s is integration of one or more aspects of SS7 interfaces and related functionality for example presence server can exploit SS7 signaling are related payload data to produce femtocell presence information and supply such information as part of the PS based procedure s .

AN based procedure s . The second set of procedures can be retained within a femtocell AP which can be owned or leased by the subscriber or a third party 3P such as a relative friend colleague vendor e.g. a dentist or employer of the subscriber. Data includes femtocell presence information of the mobile device associated with a subscriber that consumes customized routing service. A femtocell AP conveys the femtocell presence information to presence server through signaling delivered in part over a backhaul network e.g. an IP broadband backhaul network such as backhaul link s and at least one component of access network s . In an aspect a client component in the femtocell AP generates a presence information record at a time or a predetermined period after the time a mobile device registers on the femtocell AP or deregisters from the femtocell AP. For instance when e.g. at an instant or after the instant the mobile device registers on the femtocell AP as part of the registration procedure and in response to registration the client component generates a presence condition record with a value of In Premises for the mobile device and delivers a notification message within data to the presence server to convey the presence condition record. When the mobile device de registers from the femtocell AP in response to de registration the client component updates the presence condition record for the mobile device or generates a new presence condition record for the mobile device to reflect a condition value of Not In Premises and delivers a notification message to the presence server to disclose the updated presence condition record or the new presence condition record. It should be appreciated that the response s of the client component to registration de registration of the mobile device with the femtocell AP can be enabled by execution of the second set of procedures. At least a portion of the second set of procedures can modify conventional registration procedures to accomplish the described aspects of the subject disclosure.

In one or more embodiments the client component can be a Session Initiation Protocol SIP based client running on the femtocell AP and can alert e.g. deliver signaling to a SIP based AS in an IMS core network. The client component in the femtocell AP can execute the second set of procedures. In the alternative at least one processor in the femtocell AP can execute the second set of procedures by executing the client component.

The subject AN based procedure s can be advantageous in communication scenarios in which wireless devices that are not dual transfer mode DTM capable are expected to operate in the confined area s covered by femtocell wireless service. In such scenarios femtocell presence information and associated signaling to a presence server e.g. is not affected by the precedence of voice calls over data sessions in wireless devices that are not DTM capable.

Subscriber device based procedure s . The second set of procedures can be retained within a mobile device of a subscriber that consumes the customized communication routing service described herein. The subject procedure s are a client based approach. A client component that resides in the mobile device can execute at least a portion of the second set of procedures in response to detection of attachment to a femtocell AP owned or leased by the subscriber or a third party or detection of attachment to a macrocell base station. As a result the client component can produce e.g. generate or update a presence condition record and deliver a notification message to the presence server to supply the presence condition record. The presence condition record can adopt a value of At Home or an In Premises value if attachment to the femtocell AP is detected whereas detection of attachment to the macrocell base station leads to a Not At Home or a Not In Premises value value for the presence condition record. The client component can deliver the notification message as part of data through various protocols or mechanisms e.g. SIP signaling or H.323 signaling in PS domain short message service SMS or conventional SS7 signaling in GSM based or UMTS based radio technology peer to peer protocol such as Extensible Markup Language XML Document Management Server XDMS protocol.

In one or more embodiments the client component can be SIP client executing on the mobile device via at least one processor to enable interaction of the mobile device with IMS operational environment or platform over an IP access network e.g. AN s . In an aspect the client component can perform a SIP registration over a femtocell AP data channel when e.g. at a time it detects that the mobile device is registered with the femtocell AP. Such registration attempt and related attachment signaling is relayed to presence server which can be embodied in an IMS AS. In an additional or alternative embodiment the client component can communicate with the presence server in accordance with other packet based e.g. IP protocol or signaling mechanism to convey femtocell presence information.

Memory can be embodied in at least one of a Home Location Register HLR or a Home Subscriber Server HSS or a data repository functionally coupled to a femtocell gateway node in a femtocell network platform e.g. . Memory also can be embodied in a memory integrated or operationally coupled to a server in an external network functionally connected to a macro network platform a Core Network in UMTS based radio technology . In an example memory can be functionally connected to an AS the server in an IMS the external network . In another example memory can be functionally connected to a broadband remote access server B RAS the server and the internet the external network in this example memory can be either a conventional data repository or a cloud web based file server. In addition in an embodiment memory can be part of a memory platform in a backend service infrastructure such as a consolidated data repository that centralizes data of one or more network platforms that provide wireline or wireless service s . The data can be operational data and administrative data.

In one or more additional or alternative embodiments presence intelligence storage can be part of a customer premises equipment CPE e.g. a femtocell AP a component that aggregates one or more femtocell APs a switch or router or a private branch exchange PBX apparatus or b a user device e.g. a mobile device a personal computer or other home networking component. Compared to storage in a memory deployed within a telecommunication network platform e.g. storage of a presence condition record in a memory in accordance with aspects a and b results in increased flexibility and accessibility to the presence condition record by an end user or user device. The increased flexibility and accessibility is provided at the expense of call session processing efficiency in view of increased signaling that might be incurred in order to access data e.g. the routing preference remote to the telecommunication network platform. Specific operational scenarios can afford such tradeoff.

Routing logic storage also referred to as routing logic in the subject disclosure can include default logic and exception handling logic wherein logic is a set of one or more rules. For a subscriber that consumes customized communication routing service example default logic can comprise the following rules. 1 Route all incoming calls to a mobile device of the subscriber and a set of wireline devices linked to a physical address of the subscriber if the presence condition for the mobile device is In Premises or In Premises At Home . 2 Route an incoming call intended for a mobile device of the subscriber and an incoming call intended for a wireline device linked to the physical address of the subscriber to the mobile device and not the wireline device if presence condition for the mobile device is Not In Premises . It should be appreciated that the foregoing rules are illustrative and additional or alternative rules can compose the default logic. In particular default logic can route an incoming call to one or more wireless devices e.g. and registered on a femto AP e.g. femto AP utilized as a reference for presence intelligence associated with a mobile device e.g. of the subscriber. To implement such default logic routing component can convey a directive to collection component to extract one or more presence condition records for the one or more wireless devices and based on the one or more presence condition records direct the incoming call to the one or more wireless devices. Routing component can identify the one or more wireless device via at least one access control list that regulates access to the femto AP e.g. the ACL can be retained in a network based memory such as a subscriber database in HSS. It is noted that in one or more embodiments routing of an incoming call to a set of mobile devices registered on a femtocell AP that establish presence condition can be effected only if the presence condition of the mobile device is in In Premises or other suitable alphanumeric value . In addition for the subscriber exception handling logic can route an incoming call in anomalous scenarios For example for the subscriber becomes hotlined for lack of service payment a customized routing service deactivation notice e.g. a SMS communication or an automated voice recording can be delivered to a mobile device utilized by the subscriber to convey the service anomaly.

In addition routing logic storage can include schedules or profiles that regulate application of at least one routing preference. For instance for a specific mobile device such as a business cellular phone customized communication routing is inactive during weekends e.g. from 8 00 p on Friday until 5 00 a on following Monday . Routing logic storage also can include discriminator s that establish level of personalization of customized routing e.g. customization for residential subscribers can be different from that for enterprise or business subscribers. At least one discriminator can be employed for security or safety As an example the at least one discriminator can trigger collection of data related to a routed incoming call traffic called numbers calling numbers etc. as part of Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act CALEA employer monitoring or parental control. As another example the at least one discriminator can override a routing preference that includes a specific group of one or more devices wireless or otherwise.

Routing logic storage also can include criteria to manipulate an incoming communication. For example the criteria can dictate that the incoming communication is to be reformatted prior to delivery and select a specific device for certain types of communication A digital picture frame can be selected for MMS communication selection can be automatic or based on a ranking which can be configured by a subscriber that exploits the customized routing service.

Customization server manages e.g. creates modifies receives or delivers routing preferences of a subscriber that consumes customized communication routing service as described herein. The routing preferences enable in part the femtocell presence based routing or customized call processing and can be retained in memory . While illustrated as a separate functional element in one or more embodiments memory can be integrated in customization server . In an aspect customization server can be a dedicated server or it can be integrated in one or more servers that provide other functionality. In an aspect the customization server can be integrated in a server that is part of a macrocell network platform or a femtocell network platform .

Example UI is directed to configuration of at least one routing preference for Not in Premises category of presence condition. Indicia illustrates a configured routing preference that establishes an incoming communication e.g. incoming call is routed to Mobile 1 e.g. a subscriber s cellphone if intended to Mobile 1. In addition the configured routing preference establishes that the incoming communication is offloaded to device Aux. 1 which can be an auxiliary wireline device. A soft button allows to include an additional routing preference associated with a set of mobile devices e.g. Mobile 1 and Mobile 2 . Indicia conveys additional routing preferences the direct an incoming communication e.g. incoming call to Mobile 1 if the incoming call is intended to device Wireline 1 or to device Wireline 3. In an aspect indicia illustrates rendition of content or information as a result of actuating soft button Add button to configure an additional routing preference in an aspect the actuating can be implemented via various gestures touch speech movement etc. . Indicia presents a set of wireline devices that can be selected as prospective destination addresses that result in routing of an incoming communication to wireless device Mobile 1 .

With respect to example UI various routing preferences are illustrated for wireless device Mobile 1. Routing preferences establish that incoming communication s intended to Mobile 1 are to be routed to Mobile 1 and to Wireline 1 e.g. home manager IP based telephone . Indicia illustrate a menu of optional devices allowed to be utilized in a routing preference the menu can be toggled on through actuation of soft button . It should be noted that the menu presents Mobile 2 as an optional device such device can be a wireless device authorized to receive femtocell service through the femtocell AP that determines presence condition of the wireless device e.g. Mobile 1 for which the example UI is employed to configure a routing preference. Identity of the wireless device Mobile 2 can be extracted from an access control list associated with the femtocell AP that determines presence condition the identity can convey a number code or token for the wireless device and a tag the characterizes ownership e.g. owned by friend owned by employee owned by relative thereof. Characterization of ownership can guide at least in part configuration of a routing preference.

Example UI also enables generation of one or more routing preferences that direct an incoming communication e.g. a SMS message to all available wireline devices e.g. POTS home telephone home manager telephone . . . in case All Wireline option is selected in such option is unchecked. Routing preferences disclose that an incoming communication intended to Mobile 1 Wireline 1 or Wireline 3 are routed to Mobile 1 for instance a VoIP call session intended for PC can be directed to mobile device . Soft button can be render support information for at least one of configuration of a routing preference registration of a mobile device or wireline device to be included in menus of available devices or the like. In an aspect identity of a wireline device can be extracted through various mechanisms which can be implemented by a configuration component or a processor that enables at least in part the functionality of the configuration component 1 Device handshake. The configuration component that transmits a directive to render a configuration environment can deliver a request for identification data to one or more devices provisioned in a wireline network e.g. broadband network for packet base services with an associated physical address e.g. billing address that matches the physical address of a femto AP employed as reference for presence intelligence. In response an active wireline device can acknowledge the request and deliver the identification data which can be employed to populate a menu of available devices. 2 Identification data mining. The configuration component extract identification data for a wireline device provisioned in the wireline network and that has a physical address that matches the physical address of the femto AP. It should be appreciated that in one or more embodiments actuation of soft button does not provide a set of pre populated fields but rather an empty form field into which data can be entered to identify a device wireless or otherwise to which a communication is intended to or to which the communication is to be routed to.

It should be appreciated that in mobile devices or wireline devices are identified with tags Mobile 1 Mobile 2 Wireline 1 Wireline 2 Wireline 3 Wireline 4 Wireline 5 and Aux. 1 Aux. 2 and Aux. 3. Each of those tags can be one of various device identifiers codes or tokens that uniquely identify a device such as an international mobile subscriber identity IMSI temporary IMSI TIMSI a mobile subscriber integrated services digital network MSISDN an international mobile equipment identifier IMEI a mobile directory number MDN a mobile identification number MIN a Telecommunications Industry Association TIA electronic serial number ESN or a multi bit identification number like the mobile identity number MEID .

Extrinsic forwarding service can include at least one add on service that can enhance perceived customer service for the subscriber who benefits from the extrinsic forwarding service and a customer that allows in part the extrinsic forwarding service. The following communication scenario illustrates a filtering service that can embody the at least one add on service. As described supra when a mobile device of a subscriber that has been provisioned with extrinsic forwarding service is attached to a 3P femtocell AP that enables at least in part extrinsic forwarding service the subscriber can have an incoming call e.g. intended to the mobile device automatically routed to a wireline device that operates within the coverage area e.g. of the 3P femtocell AP. The extrinsic forwarding service automatically routes the incoming call to the mobile device based on at least one of presence intelligence of the mobile device and one or more routing preferences associated with the mobile device. However in certain scenarios the one or more routing preferences are based in part of identification of terminating point s of an incoming call rather than the originating point of the incoming call. As a result of substantive connectivity afforded by the extrinsic forwarding service incoming call s originated from undesired parties debt collectors sale persons former friends or spouses etc. or effected at inconvenient times e.g. praying time in a Bible study meeting held at the coverage area of the 3P femtocell AP . Thus the undesired incoming call is routed to wireline device annoying the subscriber and the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP.

The foregoing scenario can be mitigated through provision of a filtering service that is an add on e.g. complements or supplements the extrinsic forwarding service. In such filtering service prior to routing an incoming call intended to the mobile device of the subscriber that utilizes the 3P femtocell AP for extrinsic forwarding service one or more components apply one or more of a first screening rule associated with e.g. defined by the subscriber or a second screening rule associated with e.g. defined by owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP. Application of either the first screening rule or the second screening rule or both such rules blocks the incoming call. As a result neither the subscriber nor the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP are annoyed by undesired incoming call s .

Example UI can be displayed in response to selection of the Extrinsic category. Available 3P femtocell APs to enable extrinsic forwarding service can be disclosed in a menu in the illustration five femtocell APs are listed and one e.g. femto 3 is shown as selected for configuration of a routing preference. Selection of a listed 3P femtocell AP e.g. femto 3 associates at least in part the selected device e.g. Mobile 1 with the 3P femtocell AP and related identification ID information. Such information can include name of the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP a nickname e.g. Granny femto Doc s femto Sally s femto that further characterizes the 3P femtocell AP and an alphanumeric label e.g. Equipment ID that characterizes the 3P femtocell AP for identification to technical support or vendors such as customer representative that can assist with configuration of extrinsic forwarding service described herein. It should be appreciated that a single entity e.g. the name of owner or lessee can be sufficient to characterize the 3P femtocell AP for configuration of a routing preference. Example UI presents an alternative or additional rendition of available 3P femtocell APs and associated information. The set of five available 3P femtocell APs are displayed as a windows that can be selected through actuation of selection indicia via for example pressure sensitive gestures e.g. finger swipes . Other renditions also can be exploited such as a sequence of one or more screens or tabs that switched through various navigation gestures such as actuation of Back Previous or Forward Next indicia arrows pop up window etc. or other navigation indicia commonly utilized in navigation of a graphical user interface GUI .

It should be appreciated that in one or more embodiments interface component can render a stand alone or independent environment e.g. a web based user interface or portal to configure ringing of devices wireline or otherwise that are part of extrinsic forwarding routing. To render such embodiment configuration component via preference driver can execute a dedicated software application or firmware application to provide the environment to configure the ringing of devices.

In similar fashion to example UI in example UI when All Wireline e option is selected an incoming communication e.g. a SMS message is routed to all available wireline devices e.g. POTS home telephone home manager telephone . . . that operate in the area of coverage of Sally s femto in such option is unchecked. Routing preferences disclose that an incoming communication intended to Mobile 1 Wireline 1 or Wireline 2 are routed to Wireline 1e . Thus incoming calls intended to the subscriber associated with Mobile 1 Wireline 1 and Wireline 2 can be routed to wireline device Wireline 1e that operates within the area of coverage of Sally s femto . Soft button can be actuated render support information for at least one of configuration of a routing preference registration of a mobile device or wireline device to be included in menus of available devices or the like. In an aspect identity of a wireline device can be extracted through various mechanisms which can be implemented by a configuration component e.g. or a processor e.g. that enables at least in part the functionality of the configuration component 1 Device handshake. The configuration component that transmits a directive to render a configuration environment can deliver a request for identification data to one or more devices provisioned in a wireline network e.g. broadband network for packet based services with an associated physical address e.g. billing address that matches the physical address of the 3P femtocell AP e.g. Sally s femto employed as reference for presence intelligence. In response an active wireline device can acknowledge the request and deliver the identification data which can be employed to populate a menu of available devices. 2 Identification data mining. The configuration component extracts identification data for a wireline device provisioned in the wireline network and that has a physical address that matches the physical address of the femto AP. It should be appreciated that in one or more embodiments actuation of soft button does not provide a set of pre populated fields but rather an empty form field into which data can be entered to identify a device wireless or otherwise to which a communication is intended to or to which the communication is to be routed to. In addition configuration of one or more routing preferences is specific to a subscriber that utilizes customized communication routing service data received by a device that renders one or more of the user interfaces described herein is provided by the subscriber and thus the one or more routing preferences are personalized routing preference s specific to the subscriber.

In an example scenario an event can be an update of an access control list that regulates access to femtocell wireless service. For such event broker component can receive an indication that a mobile device or an identity thereof is included in an access control list for a femtocell AP that can host extrinsic forwarding service e.g. femto AP . The indication can be received as part of implementation of the notification service. In an example embodiment which is illustrated in access list management component can supply the notification service through which the access list management component can issue a notification or direct a network node to issue a notification if a mobile device identity has been updated in an access control list retained in subscriber database for example an owner or lessee of a femtocell AP has populated the access control list with the identity of the mobile device. The access management component administers configuration e.g. generation modification . . . of a set of access control list s e.g. access list s linked to one or more subscriber account s . Broker component can generate a message to be delivered to the mobile device to convey that the mobile device has access to femtocell wireless service. The message can be part of the prompt in a user device to activate extrinsic forwarding service and the broker component can supply the message either directly to the user device or to a network node or component for delivery to the user device. In an aspect the message can be embodied in a voice mail message communicated to the mobile device that is granted access to femtocell wireless service. In another aspect the message can be embodied in a SMS communication if directed to the mobile device that is granted access to femtocell wireless service or an email communication to an email address linked to the subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device. When the message is rendered via for example interface component the user device prompts for activation of extrinsic forwarding service.

In another example scenario an event can be registration of a mobile device on a femtocell AP which can host extrinsic forwarding service. For such an event if the femtocell AP is not configured to host extrinsic forwarding service broker component can receive an indication the mobile device is registered on the femtocell AP and trigger a prompt in the mobile device to activate extrinsic forwarding service. In an aspect to trigger the prompt broker component can deliver a directive to an interface component e.g. to render a configuration environment and in response to the directive the interface component can render the configuration environment. In an aspect the directive can be transmitted to a configuration component and relayed to an interface component broker component can communicate with the configuration component through various interfaces . In one or more embodiments the interface component e.g. can reside in the mobile device. In additional or alternative embodiments an interface component e.g. deployed within the mobile device can render an environment to configure extrinsic forwarding service when e.g. upon or after the interface component receives an indication the mobile device is registered on the femtocell AP and the interface component receives or retrieves an indication the mobile device lacks a configured extrinsic forwarding service for the femtocell AP.

In yet another example scenario the event can be end user intervention and associated signaling and related payload data received by broker component . For example a subscriber can manually invoke initialization of forwarding service when the subscriber arrives at a location or facility in which a confined coverage AP is in operation in this scenario data that enables at least in part extrinsic forwarding service can be supplied by the subscriber via an interface component e.g. a keypad a touch screen or the like particularly in cases that values for the data are not made available e.g. prepopulated by the interface component or other component s functionally coupled therewith.

Broker component can receive a response to the prompt to activate extrinsic forwarding service. In a scenario in which the response conveys activation of the extrinsic forwarding service broker component can generate a service record that discloses that extrinsic forwarding service has been provisioned for a set of mobile devices broker component can store the service record in configuration data storage . In addition broker component can generate a mapping that establishes an association amongst a mobile device in the set of mobile devices and a set of femtocell APs that provide femtocell presence intelligence broker component can store the mapping in configuration data storage .

Collection component retrieves or receives or otherwise accesses identification data that defines in part the extrinsic forwarding service. Identification data that is retrieved received or otherwise accessed can be retained at least temporarily in configuration data storage . The identification data can include at least the following i Femtocell identity ID e.g. equipment ID which can be a serial number specific to femtocell access points ii name of femtocell owner or lessee iii a set of device identifiers associated with a set of respective devices wireline or wireless or iv at least one routing preference which can be a default routing preference defined in default routing logic retained in routing logic .

The identification data can be retrieved or received or otherwise accessed if an affirmative response to activate the extrinsic forwarding service is received by broker component and related signaling is delivered to configuration component . In another aspect the identification data can be retrieved or received or otherwise accessed in different modalities based in part on the one or more events that can result in adoption of extrinsic forwarding service and initialization thereof. In an embodiment in which the event is an update of an access control list collection component can request the identification data from at least one of an access list management component e.g. a femtocell AP associated with the access control list or a configuration component e.g. . In addition or in the alternative the identification data can be retrieved or received or otherwise accessed as part of generation of the message to be delivered to the mobile device to convey that the mobile device has access to femtocell wireless service through a specific femtocell AP. In such scenario as an example broker component can request collection component to retrieve the identification data from the various sources described hereinbefore and supply the information data in order to enter such data in the message. For instance the following information can be included in the message. Femtocell ID and name of owner or lessee of the femtocell AP both of which can be provided by the femtocell AP a set of device numbers which can be supplied in part e.g. for wireless devices by the femtocell AP or the access list management component and in part by the configuration component via an interface component and at least one routing preference which can be supplied by the configuration component e.g. .

In an embodiment in which the event is registration of a mobile device on a femtocell AP collection component can be deployed e.g. installed configured and operable in the mobile device. In an aspect the collection component can receive part of the identification data from an interface component e.g. and part of the identification data from the femtocell AP e.g. broadcast by the femtocell AP . The interface component can be deployed in the mobile device and receive data from an end user. The portion of identification data can be the name of femtocell owner or lessee a set of device identifiers associated with a set of respective devices wireless or wireline and a least one routing preference. The portion of identification data received from the femtocell AP can be the femtocell ID e.g. a home node B HNB name or Home PLMN Public Land Mobile Network which can be hidden from a subscriber that operates the mobile device e.g. the femtocell ID need not be displayed nor confirmed.

The collection component can deliver the received identification data to a customization server . In another aspect based on at least the femtocell ID broadcast by the femtocell AP the collection component can query a network node within a telecommunication carrier network platform e.g. to obtain at least a portion of identification data the femtocell owner or lessee a set of device identifiers associated with a set of respective devices etc. The network component can be an AAA server a billing server a subscriber database such as HSS HLR VLR or manager component s thereof or the like. In this aspect information related to configuration of extrinsic forwarding service e.g. and and related disclosure can be automatically furnished to reduce end user intervention and improve perceived customer service. For instance the following information data can be automatically furnished Femtocell ID as provided in femtocell broadcast message name of femtocell AP owner or lessee as supplied by the network component the set of one or more device numbers associated with a set of respective devices wireline or wireless and at least one routing preference which can be part of previously configured default routing. Automatic provision of such information can result in a pre populated UI such as that illustrated in . An end user either a subscriber linked to the mobile device that attached to the femtocell AP or the owner or lessee of the femtocell AP can received the pre populated UI and confirm the validity of the information or modify the information in case inaccuracy is present or different settings are desired.

In one or more scenarios broker component can receive a directive to terminate submission of prompts to activate extrinsic forwarding service in response to the one or more events the directive can be received in response to a prompt to activate extrinsic forwarding service. In one or more embodiments when the one or more events include attachment of a mobile device to a femtocell AP the mobile device can transmit an instruction to broker component to discontinue prompting for information when the mobile device attaches to a femtocell AP that is not configured as a host for extrinsic forwarding service. In scenarios in which the mobile device registers frequently or predominantly in public femtocell APs e.g. femto APs deployed in public libraries prompts or requests to adopt extrinsic forwarding service can produce a low perceived quality of service in addition to increased battery drainage.

In an aspect of the extrinsic forwarding service before an incoming call e.g. directed to a first device associated with e.g. owned or leased by a subscriber who is granted extrinsic forwarding service is routed to a second device wireline or otherwise that operates within the coverage area of a 3P femtocell AP that enables in part the extrinsic forwarding service confirmation to establish that routing the incoming call to the second device can be agreed upon is effected with the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP. Such destination routing confirmation can be implemented e.g. initiated and performed at any time subsequent to provisioning of extrinsic forwarding service. In an example destination routing confirmation can be implemented substantially upon or upon a mobile device of a subscriber that exploits the extrinsic forwarding service registers on the 3P femtocell AP. In another example the destination routing confirmation can be implemented at the time or after the time at least one routing preference is defined or initialized. Provisioning component through broker component can confirm destination routing with a 3P femtocell AP or equipment wireless or wireline associated thereto.

Broker component can effect confirmation and collect related data in several modes. In an example mode in response to configuration of a routing preference and associated data configuration component can deliver an indication of the configuration event. Broker component can receive the indication and implement a confirmation call directed to one or more devices associated with the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP that enables in part extrinsic forwarding service. The implementation can be automatic and can include generation and delivery of the confirmation call transmission of a request to network node s e.g. Interactive Voice Response IVR platform or other system s or component s within a Core Network to generate and deliver the confirmation call or the like. In an aspect the network node s can be an automated voice recognition or key recognition system employed as a proxy for the subscriber that exploits the extrinsic forwarding service to enquire if the owner or lessee of the 3P femtocell AP has agreed to this service.

Cancellation component monitors event s that can result in termination or deactivation of extrinsic forwarding service. In response to detection of an event that terminates filtering service the cancellation component updates a service record in configuration data storage to reflect termination of the filtering service and triggers various update procedures. In an example an event that terminates extrinsic forwarding service is removal of a mobile device number code or token from an access control list for a femtocell AP e.g. utilized as a source of presence intelligence. For such an event at the time of or after removal the mobile device is no longer allowed to register to the femtocell AP and thus presence condition record for the mobile device ceases to be available accordingly extrinsic forwarding service is discontinued. In addition for the event cancellation component can deliver a message e.g. an SMS communication an email communication . . . that conveys termination of filtering service and requests a subscriber who owns or leases the mobile device that is removed from the access control list to update at least one routing preference associated with extrinsic forwarding service. In the alternative the at least one routing preference is automatically updated. Such update can include logic deletion e.g. a logical variable or parameter is set to a value that conveys the at least one routing preference is unavailable or physical removal of data from memory e.g. the at least one routing preference is physically removed from routing preference s storage . In another example removal of a femtocell AP from a list of hosts see e.g. for extrinsic forwarding service is an event that cancels such service. The removal causes an update of routing preference s storage and can be accomplished in part through preference driver via for example execution of a software application or firmware application to configure a routing preference. In an illustrative scenario for a device wireless or wireline for which extrinsic forwarding service is configured selection of Extrinsic in a service menu can render the list of hosts for extrinsic forwarding service that have one or more routing preferences configured. In an aspect an active femto AP that serves as such host e.g. Femto 3 can be listed with a selected checkbox e.g. soft button or radio button that represents extant configuration of the one or more routing preferences when the checkbox is unselected the active femto AP is deactivated for extrinsic forwarding service. It should be appreciated that indicia other than checkbox es also can be employed. As part of execution of the software application or firmware application and in response to unselecting the femto active AP confirmation indicia can be rendered to confirm deactivation of the extrinsic forwarding service enabled in part by the unselected femto AP. Namely a confirmation dialog box can be displayed or aural confirmation prompts can be played wherein the confirmation dialog box or aural confirmation prompts can convey the message Are you sure you do not want to route your calls to Sally s home when you are at her house and can receive related Yes or No answers or any other type of affirmative or negative answers.

The various components that are part of provisioning component can exchange data and signaling through a bus which can be embodied in at least one of a memory bus a system bus an address bus a message bus or one or more reference link s or interface s .

At act an indication to effect customized call processing to route an incoming call is received routing the incoming call is based in part on presence information of a mobile device in a confined area. A femtocell AP or any type of confined coverage access point can serve the confined area while the mobile device is associated with a called device in the incoming call. The presence information can be embodied in a presence condition record retained in a memory or computer readable or machine readable storage medium. The mobile device can be the called device in which case the association is the identity. In an aspect the indication can be received in response to invoking a CAMEL service when the incoming call is intended for a mobile device associated with e.g. owned or leased by a subscriber that consumes personalized communication routing service described in the subject disclosure. In another aspect the indication can be received as a result of invoking an AS within an IMS core network when the incoming call is directed to the mobile device of the subscriber.

At act customized call processing to route the incoming call based on at least one of the presence information or a set of routing preferences is effected. In an embodiment the subject act can include various acts as illustrated in which displays a flowchart of an example method for effecting customized call processing according to aspects described herein. Server s component s or processor s that effect at least act also can effect the subject example method. At act presence information for a mobile device associated with a called device in an incoming call is collected. As described supra the presence information can characterize the location of the mobile device and can be embodied in a presence condition record retained in memory 1 In Premises At Home which conveys the mobile device is attached to a femto AP or any other type of confined coverage access point that is owned or leased by a subscriber who owns or leases or is otherwise responsible for the mobile device 2 In Premises At Party Name which conveys the mobile device is attached to a femto AP owned or leased by a third party a relative a friend or a colleague a vendor such as a dentist a mechanic or a childcare provider an employer of the subscriber etc. or 3 Not In Premises which conveys the mobile device is registered on at least one macrocell. At act at least one routing preference in a set of routing preferences associated with the called device is acquired retrieved received etc. based in part on the presence information as described supra. At act it is determined if a filtering service is active. In the negative case flow is directed to act but in the positive case a screening rule is applied to the incoming call to establish if the incoming call is to be blocked or allowed. If outcome of applying the screening rule dictates that the incoming call is to be blocked the incoming call is terminated at act . Conversely if outcome of applying the screening rule dictates that the incoming call is to be allowed flow is directed to act in which the at least one routing preference is applied to the incoming call according to the presence information for the called device. As described supra the at least one routing preference is personalized to a subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device personalization effected by the subscriber. At act the incoming call is routed based on an outcome of applying the at least one routing preference to the incoming call.

At act customized routing server applies a routing preference based in part on presence intelligence which discloses registration status of a mobile device associated with the mobile TN on a confined area AP owned or leased by a subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device or by a third party. Accordingly the presence intelligence not only can disclose if the mobile device is In Premises or Not In Premises but it can convey a discriminator that denotes if the mobile device is At Home or At Party name Home for example. The routing preference can be retained within a memory element e.g. routing preference s storage functionally connected to customized routing server . The customized routing server can receive presence intelligence from a repository e.g. presence intelligence storage functionally linked thereto. At act the customized routing server submits an INVITE message with PSTN TN as source address and a wireline TN as the destination address to the IMS . It is noted that in one or more embodiments a plurality of INVITE messages can be delivered. At act the IMS initiates a call session with the wireline endpoint indentified by the destination address by relaying the INVITE message received from the customized routing server .

Regarding the incoming call is directed or routed to a wireless device UE . At act an initial address message is delivered to IMS from GMSC . The address message includes references to a destination number IMRN and a source number PSTN TN . In response at act the IMS submits an INVITE message to customized routing server the invite message is directed to IMRN from PSTN TN. At act the routing server applies a routing preference based in part on presence intelligence this act is substantially the same as act and shares most or all aspects thereof and conveys an INVITE to IMS . The INVITE is directed to the wireless device through a reference to a mobile telephone number TN associated with the wireless device. The INVITE message has a reference to the source number PSTN TN . In view of the reference to the mobile TN IMS delivers an initial address message to GMSC at act . The GMSC responds by supplying an initial DP with references to IMRN and PSTN TN to IMS at act . IMS conveys at act signaling to continue the call session towards destination address IMRN. GMSC receives such signaling and validates destination address with a mobility management component such as a Home Location Register HLR validation acts not depicted in . After validation GMSC delivers at act an initial address message with references to mobile TN as source and PSTN TN as destination the initiation address message is delivered to mobility switching center MSC Visited Location Register VLR . In response to the initial address message MSC VLR exchanges signaling and related payload data through various acts with at least one component of a radio access network RAN for call setup. The RAN exchanges signaling and related payload data with the intended wireless device UE via one or more acts . The various acts and the at least one component of RAN are specific to the radio technology employing for wireless communication.

In example method at act an initial address message is delivered to IMS by one or more components within PSTN not shown represented with a solid circle in the drawing . In response at act IMS invokes personalized routing and delivers an INVITE message to routing server at act the INVITE message includes references to destination address wireline TN and source address PSTN TN . At act the applies a routing preference based in part on presence intelligence. Similarly to act presence intelligence discloses registration status of a mobile device associated with the mobile TN on a confined area AP owned or leased by a subscriber that owns or leases the mobile device or by a third party. Accordingly the presence intelligence not only can disclose if the mobile device is In Premises or Not In Premises but it can convey a discriminator that denotes if the mobile device is At Home or At Party name Home for example. In an aspect in the illustrated scenario a routing destination address is a mobile device address mobile TN and customized routing server submits at act an INVITE message to IMS with references to mobile TN as destination address and PSTN TN as source address. In response to the received INVITE message and since the destination address is a mobile device address IMS delivers an initial address message to GMSC at act . After the initial address message is received at act GMSC conveys an initial DP message with references to PSTN TN as the calling party and mobile TN as the called party. IMS recognizes the destination address as the wireless device address and conveys a CONTINUE message to GMSC to proceed with call session establishment towards the wireless device.

Subsequent to routing validation not shown GMSC responds at act by delivering an initial address message with references to PSTN TN as calling party and mobile TN as called party to MSC VLR . It should be appreciated that in one or more embodiments such initial address message can be delivered to a MM component determined by a specific radio technology utilized to establish wireless call session s . In one or more acts MSC VLR exchanges a set messages for call set up with one or more components of RAN . Likewise in one or more acts the one or more components of the RAN exchanges messages for call setup with UE . As discussed supra packet based network platforms other than IMSs can provide the functionality described herein and administer telecommunication services as part of the subject customized call routing. Other protocols for session initiation such as H.323 also can be employed.

At act a notification of a mobility event is received. The mobility event includes attachment towards either a macrocell base station or a femtocell AP and the notification can include information that characterizes the location of the macrocell base station or the femtocell AP. Receiving the notification can include receiving a notification message or message according to a peer to peer communication protocol as described supra.

At act presence intelligence based at least in part on the notification is updated. In an aspect updating the presence intelligence includes creating or modifying at least one record in a presence intelligence database or memory element.

At act user equipment attaches to a femtocell access point or any other type of confined coverage AP and delivers at act a notification of the attachment to presence server . As indicated supra the notification can be delivered according to a proprietary data delivery protocol or one or more standardized data delivery protocol such as XDMS XCAP HTTP or the like. In an aspect UE can deliver the notification via a presence client component e.g. described herein or a processor that executes the presence client component and resides within the UE . At act the presence server updates a presence condition which can be retained in a presence record e.g. a logical flag a database entry stored in a memory e.g. presence intelligence store accessible to the presence server . The presence record or presence condition record discloses attachment status of the UE to the confined coverage AP owned or leased by a subscriber that owns or leases UE or by a third party. Accordingly the presence record not only can disclose if UE is In Premises or Not In Premises but it can convey a discriminator that denotes if the mobile device is At Home or At Party name Home for example. After the update is completed e.g. upon completion substantially upon completion or after a predetermined period subsequent to completion presence server delivers acknowledgement signaling to UE .

At act the UE attaches to a macrocell base station and delivers at act a notification of attachment to presence server . Attachment to the macrocell base station can arise as a result of UE moving outside the area of coverage afforded by the femtocell AP. In response the presence server updates the presence condition at act . As described supra after the update is completed e.g. upon completion substantially upon completion or after a predetermined period subsequent to completion presence server delivers acknowledgement ACK signaling to UE .

Example method can be implemented in a scenario a mobile device e.g. UE attaches to or registers in a femtocell upon powering on. At act UE powers on within area of coverage of femtocell AP and delivers location update signaling thereto at act . The location update signaling is specific to the radio technology utilized by the femtocell AP e.g. in UMTS based technology attachment signaling can include location area update LAU or routing area update RAU . Since UE powers on the location update signaling can include an IMSI attach request the updated location can be area information. Femtocell AP relays at act the location update signaling to femtocell gateway GTY node which conveys at act the location update signaling to mobility management MM component . In turn at act MM component delivers a location notification to presence server . It should be appreciated that MM component can be specific to the radio technology implemented for telecommunication through macro network platform for instance in 3GPP LTE networks MM component can be embodied in a mobility management entity MME whereas in the 3GPP UMTS network MM component can be embodied in a MSC. In an aspect acts through embody notification act the location notification embodies notification of attachment delivered in act . At act presence server updates presence condition or presence intelligence for UE by creating or modifying values of a presence flag to In Premises with a suitable discriminator e.g. At Home Own etc. or 3P Party Name etc. which characterizes the femtocell AP . While the subject example method is illustrated for a femtocell AP and related access network element s the subject example method can be advantageously exploited for other types of confined coverage access points Wi Fi AP picocell AP etc. .

At act MM component delivers ACK signaling to femtocell GTY node which relays at act the ACK signaling to femtocell AP . At act the femtocell AP conveys the ACK signaling to UE . It is noted that the order of acts and can be reversed without affecting the functionality provided by the subject example method. In addition in one or more additional or alternative embodiments presence server can receive the location notification from femtocell GTY in such embodiments the presence server can be embodied in one or more servers within a femtocell network platform e.g. .

Example method can be implemented in a scenario a mobile device attaches to a femtocell AP as a result of a mobility event that leads the mobile device into the coverage area of the femtocell AP. At act UE moves from femtocell to macrocell and at act delivers location update signaling to femtocell AP which relays at act the location update signaling to femtocell gateway node . As indicated supra the location update signaling is specific to the radio technology utilized by the femtocell AP e.g. in UMTS based technology attachment signaling can include location area update LAU or routing area update RAU . Since UE moves into femtocell service coverage the location update signaling can include LAU request. In turn the femtocell GTY node delivers at act the location update signaling to MM component which conveys at act a location notification to presence server . In an aspect acts through embody notification act the location notification embodies notification of attachment delivered in act . In response to receiving e.g. collecting and processing the location notification at act presence server updates presence condition or presence intelligence for UE by creating or modifying a value of a presence flag to reflect In Premises. In a scenario extrinsic forwarding service is enabled In Premises value can be composite including a field attribute that identifies femtocell AP as an At Home or Own femtocell AP. Similarly to example method while the subject example method is illustrated for a femtocell AP and related access network element s example method can be advantageously exploited for other types of confined coverage access points Wi Fi AP picocell AP etc. 

In response to receiving e.g. collecting and processing the location update signaling MM component delivers at act ACK signaling to femtocell GTY node which transmits at act the ACK signaling to femtocell AP .
