Mobile devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in everyday use including in home office and educational environments. For example school districts are starting to implement one to one technology programs that provide each student access to a mobile device such as a tablet computer. As another example many corporations provide employees with mobile devices to perform job related functions on the go. To maintain control of the devices a school or corporation may rely on information technology IT administrators that maintain a roster of devices and statuses of each device. However relying on IT administrators for all mobile device management MDM may be inefficient and expensive. For example at a large corporation with thousands of employees it may take weeks for IT administrators to recall each device install a software application on each of the devices and return the devices to the employees. Moreover it may be difficult for the IT administrators to quickly determine which devices have a particular application installed and which devices need updating.

The present disclosure provides systems and methods that enable a mobile device management MDM server to maintain and update inventory information based on smart groups. As used herein a smart group may be a group whose membership is dynamically updated in response to certain events. To illustrate an IT administrator may create a group that has particular membership grouping criteria. The membership of the group may be dynamically updated as managed devices e.g. mobile phones tablet computers laptop computers etc. check in with the MDM server and provide updated inventory information. An IT administrator may use the dynamically updated group to more easily and quickly perform MDM actions. As an illustrative non limiting example a dynamically updated group may be created for devices that have not backed up data to the MDM server or another external backup device in the last 30 days. To send a reminder message regarding backup to all devices that have not backed up in the last 30 days an IT administrator may select the group as a recipient of the message which may be faster and easier than the IT administrator identifying each individual device that has not backed up in the past 30 days. For example using dynamic groups of managed devices to select targets of MDM actions may be faster than the IT administrator querying a device database or requesting individual device users to indicate when their respective devices were backed up.

It should be noted that although various embodiments may be described herein with reference to educational or corporate settings this is an example only and not to be considered limiting. The teachings of the present disclosure may be applied to other mobile device environments including but not limited to home environments retail environments etc.

Referring to a particular embodiment of a system that is operable to maintain dynamically updated groups of devices is shown and generally designated . The system includes a mobile device management MDM server that is communicably coupled to a push notification service one or more managed computers e.g. an illustrative managed computer one or more managed mobile devices e.g. an illustrative managed mobile device and an e mail server . It should be noted that although one managed computer and one managed mobile device is shown in the present disclosure is not limited to any particular configuration or number of devices. In alternate embodiments a different number of managed computers and or managed mobile devices may be present. For example more than one managed computer and more than one managed mobile device may be registered with the MDM server .

The managed computer may be a portable computing device with wired and or wireless networking capability. For example the managed computer may be a desktop computer a laptop computer a server etc. The managed mobile device may be a portable device with wireless networking capability. For example the managed mobile device may be a tablet computer a mobile phone a portable media player an electronic book eBook reader or any combination thereof.

The managed computer may include an operating system OS and the managed mobile device may include a mobile OS . Each OS may control computing functions such as input output e.g. a touchscreen display speaker microphone camera etc. and networking e.g. cellular Bluetooth Wi Fi Ethernet etc. . Each OS may also support execution of applications apps and provide such applications access to device resources and data . Examples of applications include but are not limited to a web browser e mail a calendar social networking a document eBook reader a media player etc. Applications may correspond to software instructions that are stored in a memory and executed by a processor hardware circuits that implement application functionality or both. The applications may be pre installed e.g. as part of or along with an OS or may be installed after being downloaded e.g. via a storefront or sideloaded e.g. from an external storage device . In a particular embodiment each OS stores a passcode . For example the passcodes may be used to secure device access. When a user attempts to operate a device the user may be prompted to input a passcode and access to the device may not be enabled unless the input passcode matches the stored passcode .

The MDM server may correspond to hardware and or software that implements MDM functions. As an illustrative non limiting example in an educational context the MDM server may manage teacher and student computers and mobile devices. The MDM server may include a graphical user interface GUI generation module . The GUI generation module may generate a GUI that is operable to e.g. that can be used to define dynamic groups. For example the MDM server may send the generated GUI to a computing device associated with a user e.g. an IT administrator and may receive user input via the GUI. The user input may define grouping criteria for one or more dynamic groups as further described herein. The MDM server may store grouping criteria received via the GUI. Examples of the GUI generated by the GUI generation module are further described with reference to .

The MDM server may include a grouping criteria evaluation module and may store or have access to an inventory database and group membership data as shown. The inventory database may include data regarding each managed entity e.g. a computer or a mobile device in the system . An example of the data stored in the inventory database is further described with reference to . In a particular embodiment the inventory database includes values of various inventory attributes for each managed entity. As an illustrative non limiting example inventory data for a managed computer may include values for one or more of the following inventory attributes 

As another illustrative non limiting example inventory data for a managed mobile device may include values for one or more of the following inventory attributes 

The group membership data may include a list of devices that are members of each dynamic group maintained by the MDM server . The group membership data may be updated in response to various events that occur in the system . As illustrative non limiting examples the group membership data may be updated responsive to a managed device being added to the system a managed device being removed from the system a managed device providing updating inventory data to the MDM server etc. An example of updating the group membership data is further described with reference to . In a particular embodiment the MDM server transmits an alert in response to a change in membership of a group. For example the MDM server may send an e mail message to the user or to another IT administrator via the e mail server . Additional examples of alerts may include but are not limited to short message service SMS messages instant messages GUI alerts automated telephone calls etc.

In a particular embodiment the user input may include data identifying an action to be performed with respect to managed entities e.g. managed devices of a particular dynamic group. For example a Low Battery Laptops dynamic group may include laptops that have battery levels less than a threshold Battery Level

Examples of MDM actions may include but are not limited to installing an application at a managed device adjusting a configuration setting at a managed device providing content to a managed device sending a message to a managed device setting or clearing a passcode editing one or more inventory data attributes sending a communication message e.g. an e mail or a SMS message deleting data sending remote commands etc.

In response to receiving the user input the grouping criteria evaluation module may determine based on the membership data and or the inventory database which laptops are members of the Low Battery Laptops group and may initiate transmission of a push notification to such laptops. As further described herein the MDM server may have previously received and stored information regarding the battery level of the laptops based on inventory data updates provided by the laptops. Alternatively or in addition the MDM server may request battery level information responsive to receiving the user input . In a particular embodiment the MDM server may send a notification request to a push notification service where the notification request identifies the laptops.

In an illustrative embodiment the GUI enables the user to define dynamic groups via recursive application of grouping criteria. For example the user input may define a first dynamic group based on first grouping criteria and a second dynamic group based on second grouping criteria . The first grouping criteria may be based on at least the second grouping criteria and a logical operator.

To illustrate the second dynamic group may be called Science Department Mobile Devices and may include mobile devices that are the property of or assigned to a science department at a school. Accordingly the second grouping criteria may include a value Science of an inventory attribute Department e.g. the second grouping criteria may be Department Science. The first dynamic group may be called Chemistry Building Mobile Devices and may include science department mobile devices that are located in the chemistry building of the school. Accordingly the first grouping criteria may be 

Thus the first dynamic grouping criteria e.g. chemistry building mobile devices may be based on at least the second dynamic grouping criteria e.g. science department mobile devices and a logical operator e.g. an AND operator . Examples of logical operators that can be used in grouping criteria include but are not limited to and or not is is not has does not have member of not member of organizational operators e.g. open parenthesis close parenthesis etc. and mathematical operators e.g. equal to not equal to greater than less than etc. .

It should be noted that although various embodiments are described herein with reference to educational settings this is for example only and not to be considered limiting. The teachings of the present disclosure may be applied to other environments including but not limited to home environments corporate environments retail environments etc.

During operation the MDM server may receive the user input where the user input includes dynamic grouping criteria and or identifies action s to be performed with respect to the devices of a particular dynamic group. In an illustrative embodiment the user may be prompted for authentication credentials e.g. a username a password a uniform resource locator URL of the MDM server etc. prior to being granted access to the GUI. Communication between the various components of the system may occur via secure e.g. encrypted channels such as encrypted internet protocol IP connections.

When the user input indicates that an action is to be performed with respect to devices of a group the grouping criteria evaluation module may determine which devices are members of the group. The MDM server may send a notification request to the push notification service where the push notification request identifies the devices that are determined to be members of the group. The push notification service may correspond to one or more network accessible servers that are configured to send push notifications to devices of the group such as the managed computer and or the managed mobile device .

In a particular embodiment the push notifications may be associated with check in events and that cause the managed computer and the managed mobile device to check with the MDM server to see if there are any actions to be performed by the managed computer or the managed mobile device . For example actions specified by the user input may be queued by the MDM server and may be retrieved by the managed computer and the managed mobile device in response to the push notifications .

In an alternate embodiment the push notifications may include or identify the action to be performed. For example the push notifications may utilize an application programming interface API of the OS or to instruct the managed computer or the managed mobile device to perform the action. In yet another alternate embodiment a notification and or an action may be pushed by the MDM server directly to the managed computer or to the managed mobile device . For example when the managed mobile device is an iOS device the command may be compatible with an iOS MDM API protocol such as a device lock command a clear passcode command etc. iOS is a registered trademark of Cisco Systems Inc. of San Jose Calif. and is used by Apple Inc. of Cupertino Calif. under license .

During operation the managed computer and the managed mobile device may provide updated inventory information to the MDM server . The updated inventory information may indicate change s in inventory attribute s associated with the managed computer and the managed mobile device . A managed device may provide updated inventory information to the MDM server in response to a particular event e.g. performance of a MDM action relocation into a different building power on wake from sleep mode etc. . Alternatively or in addition updated inventory information may be provided periodically or in response to user input or in response to a request from the MDM server . In a particular embodiment to reduce an amount of data transmitted to the MDM server the updated inventory information only identifies changed values of inventory attributes instead of values of all inventory attributes. In response to receiving the updated inventory information or the MDM server may update a record in the inventory database for the corresponding managed computer or managed mobile device . When the updated inventory information results in addition of the managed computer or the managed mobile device to a dynamic group or removal from a dynamic group the MDM server updates the group membership data . To illustrate the MDM server may receive an update from a device where the update indicates that the device has moved to the chemistry building at the school. The MDM server may update a record in the inventory database for the device to reflect that the device has moved to the chemistry building. The MDM server may also update the group membership data which may include group membership lists by adding the device to group s whose grouping criteria include Building Chemistry and removing the device from group s whose grouping criteria include a different value for Building. 

The system of may thus support creation and updating of dynamic groups and transmission of push notifications to devices that are in a particular dynamic group. Using dynamic e.g. smart groups to perform MDM actions is typically faster than a user selecting devices one at a time. It will also be appreciated that the system may update group membership automatically based on inventory updates from managed devices and may evaluate group membership just in time e.g. in response to a MDM action request so that appropriate managed devices are targeted for the MDM action as opposed to targeting devices based on stale inventory information .

Referring to a particular embodiment of inventory data is shown and generally designated . In an illustrative embodiment the inventory data may be stored in an inventory database such as the inventory database of .

The inventory data may include managed computer inventory data and managed mobile device inventory data . The managed computer inventory data may include inventory data associated with one or more managed computers that are registered with a MDM server e.g. the MDM server of . In the illustrated example the managed computer inventory data includes data associated with a first managed computer Computer . The data associated with the first managed computer may include values of one or more inventory attributes which may include but are not limited to active directory status customer care ID application title bar code battery capacity etc. Additional inventory attributes associated with managed computers are described with reference to .

The managed mobile device inventory data may include inventory data associated with one or more managed mobile devices that are registered with a MDM server e.g. the MDM server of . In the illustrated example the managed mobile device inventory data includes data associated with a first managed mobile device Mobile Device . The data associated with the first managed mobile device may include values of one or more inventory attributes which may include but are not limited to activation lock bypass air playback password customer care ID asset tag battery level etc. Additional inventory attributes associated with managed mobile devices are described with reference to .

Referring to an illustrative embodiment of dynamically updating group membership is shown and generally designated . In the example of group membership for a Low Battery Level group is shown. The grouping criteria for the group is Battery Level

In the example of mobile device mobile device mobile device and mobile device are initially members of the low battery level group as shown at . Thus the group membership data of for the low battery level group may identify mobile device mobile device mobile device and mobile device . Inventory data in the inventory database of may store a most recently known e.g. received battery level for the mobile devices.

A MDM server e.g. the MDM server of may receive updates from mobile devices during operation. For example as shown at the MDM server may receive a first update that a battery level of mobile device is 8 and a second update that a battery level of mobile device is 95 .

In response to receiving the updates the MDM server may store the received battery level information in the inventory database. The MDM server may also dynamically update group membership data for one or more groups that include battery level as a grouping criterion. For example as shown at mobile device is added to the low battery level group and mobile device is removed from the low battery level group. In a particular embodiment instead of modifying group membership data in response to each update from each managed device e.g. in real time or near real time the MDM server may queue updates and may process updates asynchronously e.g. when the MDM server has available resources to process the queued updates . In such an embodiment if a MDM action is requested by a user the update queue may be processed e.g. emptied before group membership data is evaluated to identify devices to be notified regarding the MDM action.

It should be noted that the examples shown in are for illustration only and not to be considered limiting. At any given time a managed device may be a member of any number of dynamic groups. A device may be removed from a group added to a group or both removed from one group and added to another group in response to an update. For example in response to the update that the battery level of the mobile device is 95 the mobile device may be removed from the low battery level group and added to a high battery level group having grouping criteria Battery Level 90 . Thus as illustrated in a MDM server may dynamically update group membership data based on updated information received from managed devices. It should be noted that although illustrates updating group membership data based on a change in a single attribute device updates may include updated values for multiple attributes and group membership data may be updated in response to changes in multiple attributes.

In a particular embodiment a MDM server e.g. the MDM server may maintain static groups as well as dynamic groups. Static groups may have fixed membership that is not dynamically updated. For example a static group having the grouping criteria Manufacturer Company X may have a fixed membership including managed devices manufactured by company X.

Although various embodiments have been described herein with reference to managed computers and managed mobile devices dynamic groups of other types of managed entities may also be crated and used. For example the MDM server may support creating and using dynamic groups of users. Each user may be associated with one or more managed devices e.g. computers or mobile devices and sending a push notification to a user may result in sending a push notification to one or more managed devices associated with a user. Grouping criteria for dynamic user groups may include values for inventory attributes such as one or more of the following 

Referring to a first embodiment of a GUI is shown and generally designated . The GUI includes elements e.g. icons links buttons etc. and to select managed computer options managed mobile device options and managed user options respectively. In the illustrated example the element for mobile devices is selected. The GUI also includes elements and that are selectable to display a list of smart e.g. dynamic mobile device groups and a list of static mobile device groups respectively. In the illustrated example the element for smart mobile device groups is selected.

As shown in the GUI may include a count of a number of active groups. In the illustrated example three dynamic groups are active All Managed Tablets All Managed Phones and All Managed Music Players. A user may select e.g. click on tap on etc. a link for an active managed group or a button to define a new dynamic mobile device group. Selecting an active managed group may enable the user to modify grouping criteria and or other settings associated with the selected group. Selecting the new button may enable the user to define grouping criteria for a newly added dynamic group.

For example illustrates a particular embodiment of a GUI corresponding to selection of the new button of . The GUI includes a Mobile Device Group tab and a Criteria tab . In the example of the Mobile Device Group tab is selected. The user is creating a new dynamic group for mobile devices and as shown at has entered the name Outdated Mobile Devices for the group. The user has also selected an option to cause a MDM server e.g. the MDM server of to initiate sending an e mail notification to the user e.g. to a device associated with the user when membership of the Outdated Mobile Devices group changes. To illustrate the e mail notification may correspond to the e mail message of .

Continuing to a particular embodiment of a GUI corresponding to selection of the Criteria tab of is shown and is generally designated . The GUI may include various elements. In the example of a button may be used to add another criterion to the grouping criteria. An element is used to include an open parenthesis operator in the grouping criteria. At an inventory data attribute Model e.g. mobile device model is selected for inclusion in the criteria. As shown at and the sub criteria involving the Model attribute includes an IS operator and the value 2014 Phone. Thus the Model sub criteria may be satisfied by managed mobile devices having a value of 2014 Phone for the Model inventory attribute. At an AND operator is selected to combine the Model is 2014 Phone sub criteria with a Display Name is Test Phone sub criteria. A close parenthesis operator is selected at and an OR operator is selected at to combine the sub criteria within the parentheses to a sub criteria Model is 2013 Phone. Thus an overall grouping criteria defined in the GUI of is 

Accordingly mobile devices that are members of the Outdated Mobile Devices group will be 2014 model test e.g. beta phones or 2013 model phones. The user may select a button to save the grouping criteria and finish defining the Outdated Mobile Devices group. When the Outdated Mobile Devices group is saved the count of active groups may increase from 3 to 4 and a link for Outdated Mobile Devices may be displayed along with the previously displayed links for All Managed Tablets All Managed Phones and All Managed Music Players. 

Referring to a particular embodiment of a GUI displayed responsive to selection of a previously created dynamic group is shown and generally designated . In particular the GUI corresponds to a user selecting the link for the previously created Outdated Mobile Devices group. The GUI includes a Done button to save changes to the group a History button to view history information associated with the group e.g. how the grouping criteria of the group has evolved over time and a View button to view members of the group. After selecting the view button a user may select an action to be performed with respect to members of the group as further described with reference to .

The GUI also includes a Clone button to create a copy of the group. For example as shown in the GUI of selection of the clone button may result in creation of an Outdated Mobile Devices copy group. It is noted that the grouping criteria of the Outdated Mobile Devices copy group is identical to the grouping criteria for the Outdated Mobile Devices group shown in . Cloning a group such as for testing purposes may be faster and more convenient than having to manually define a new group with identical grouping criteria as an existing group.

The GUI further includes a Delete button to delete the group and the associated grouping criteria and membership data. If a deleted group is used in a recursive group definition for another group the other group may also be deleted. Alternatively the user may be prompted regarding whether the other group should be deleted or whether the grouping criteria for the other group should be modified. The GUI includes an Edit button to edit the group e.g. edit the name e mail notification status and or grouping criteria of the group .

As described with reference to the present disclosure enables users to recursively define dynamic groups based on membership in other dynamic groups. illustrates a particular embodiment of a GUI used to define recursive grouping criteria and is generally designated . In the example of grouping criteria for an Outdated Mobile Device with Low Battery dynamic group is defined. A mobile device is a member of the dynamic group if the mobile device is a member of the Outdated Mobile Devices group described with reference to and if the mobile device has a battery level of less than 10 . As shown at a pseudo inventory attribute called Mobile Device Group may be used to recursively define grouping criteria where the value of the Mobile Device Group attribute is the name of another e.g. previously defined dynamic group. Corresponding pseudo inventory attributes for managed computers and managed users may be called Computer Group and User Group respectively.

In a particular embodiment a GUI generated in accordance with the described techniques may facilitate entry of grouping criteria by maintaining and displaying a list of frequently used grouping criteria e.g. inventory data attributes . Referring to a particular embodiment of maintaining such a shortlist is shown and generally designated . When an inventory attribute is added to a grouping criteria e.g. by selecting the button of the shortlist of frequently used inventory attributes may be shown instead of a list of all available inventory attributes. In the example on the left of the shortlist includes building department display name last inventory update MDM profile removal allowed mobile device group model supervised and username. An All Criteria option may also be shown at . Selection of the All Criteria option may display a complete list of all of the available inventory attributes that can be used to define grouping criteria. The shortlist and the complete list may differ based on whether grouping criteria is being defined for managed mobile devices managed computers or managed users.

The shortlist of frequently used attributes may be updated as users define dynamic groups. For example as shown at after Last Backup is selected one or more times during definition of grouping criteria the Last Backup attribute may be added to the shortlist. In a particular embodiment the shortlist may have a fixed size and an overflow condition may occur when adding an attribute to the list. In response to the overflow condition when the attribute is added to the fixed size shortlist another e.g. least recently used attribute may be removed from the shortlist.

The GUI s generated in accordance with the present disclosure may also be used to indicate an action to be performed with respect to members of a dynamic group. Examples of MDM actions may include but are not limited to installing an application at a managed device adjusting a configuration setting at a managed device providing content to a managed device sending a message to a managed device setting or clearing a passcode editing one or more inventory data attributes sending a communication message e.g. an e mail or a short message service SMS message deleting data sending remote commands etc. Referring to a particular embodiment of a GUI that can be used to select an action to be performed with respect to members of a dynamic group is shown and generally designated . In an illustrative embodiment the GUI may be after selection of the view button of .

To illustrate when the view button is selected a GUI may be displayed that includes a list of managed entities e.g. computers mobile devices and or users that are members of a particular dynamic group. The list of managed entities may be based on the group membership data of . In a particular embodiment membership of the dynamic group may be re evaluated e.g. updated when the user clicks the view button of .

A user may select an element e.g. button on the GUI including the list of managed entities to cause the GUI to be displayed. The GUI may include a list of mass actions that can be performed with respect to each device that is a member of the dynamic group. In the example of the list of actions includes editing a building or department of one or more managed entities of the group editing a site of one or more managed entities of the group sending a notification to one or more managed entities that have a particular application content or feature e.g. self service mobile in installed activated deleting one or more managed entities e.g. from the group the inventor database altogether etc. and sending remote command s to one or more managed entities. In alternative embodiments different mass actions may be available. When an action is selected the action may automatically be performed with respect to each managed entity of the group or the user may be provided an option to select particular managed entities within the group as targets of the action.

Referring to a particular embodiment of operation at a MDM server is shown and generally designated . In an illustrative embodiment the method may be performed at the MDM server of .

The method may include generating at a server configured to access inventory data associated with a plurality of managed entities a GUI that is operable to define grouping criteria for one or more dynamic groups of managed entities e.g. managed computers managed mobile devices and or managed users at . For example to generate a dynamic grouping GUI such as one of the GUIs described with reference to a MDM server may access inventory and or group membership data and include in the GUI one or more elements e.g. links buttons etc. that are based on the inventory and or group membership data. The MDM server may also enable and or disable certain GUI elements based on the inventory and or group membership data. For example if no managed computers are registered with the MDM server GUI elements relating to managed computers may be disabled e.g. grayed out and or unselectable by a user .

The method may also include receiving first grouping criteria via the GUI at where the first grouping criteria is based on at least second grouping criteria and a logical operator. For example the MDM server may receive via the GUI of the grouping criteria for the Outdated Mobile Device with Low Battery dynamic group which is based on the grouping criteria for the Outdated Mobile Devices dynamic group and an AND operator. In a particular embodiment the first grouping criteria may be received based on user input. For example a MDM server may receive data via a wired or wireless network from a computing device that displays the GUI and receives the user input. The data may include a value typed by a user in a text field an indication of a button selected by a user etc. The MDM server may extract such data from received packets messages and determine the first grouping criteria based on the extracted data.

The method may further include receiving data via the GUI that identifies an action to be performed with respect to managed entities that satisfy the grouping criteria at and determining based on the inventory data a group of managed entities that satisfy the first grouping criteria at . The managed entities may include managed mobile devices managed computers managed users or any combination thereof. In a particular embodiment the data identifying the action may be received based on user input. For example a MDM server may receive data via a wired or wireless network from a computing device that displays the GUI and receives the user input where the data identifies an action selected by a user e.g. from the GUI of . The MDM server may extract such data from received packets messages and determine the selected action based on the extracted data. The MDM server may determine the group of managed entities that satisfy the first grouping criteria by filtering an inventory database using the first grouping criteria as filter parameters. Alternatively or in addition a list of members may that satisfy the first grouping criteria may be available in the form of group membership data where the group membership data is updated in response to receiving updates from individual managed entities.

For example as illustrated in the MDM server may receive a selection of the Send Remote Commands action of that is to be performed with respect to mobile devices in the Outdated Mobile Devices with Low Battery group.

The method may include initiating by the server a transmission of a push notification regarding the action that is sent to each managed entity in the group of managed entities at . For example to initiate the transmission of the push notification the MDM server may generate a push notification request that includes a list of group members and or data regarding the action to be performed and may send the push notification request to a push notification service e.g. via a wired or wireless network . When communication to and from the MDM server is encrypted receiving and transmitting data may also include encryption and or decryption operations. To illustrate in the grouping criteria evaluation module may identify members of the dynamic group and the MDM server may send the notification request to the push notification service . In response to the notification request the push notification service may send push notifications e.g. the push notifications and or to members of the dynamic group e.g. the managed computer and or the managed mobile device .

It should be noted that the order of steps or operations described with reference to is to be considered illustrative and not limiting. In alternate embodiments the order of steps may be different. Further one or more steps may be optional and or replaced by other steps. For example in particular embodiments the steps and may be optional e.g. a dynamic group may previously have been defined and the method may begin at step when a user selects an action to be performed with respect to members of the dynamic group . In addition one or more steps may be consolidated. In accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure one or more methods functions and modules described herein may be implemented by software programs executable by a computer system.
