This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 169 634 filed Jun. 27 2011 the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

Mobile devices with various methods of connectivity are now for many people becoming the primary gateway to the internet and also a major storage point for personal information. This is in addition to the normal range of personal computers and furthermore sensor devices plus internet based providers. Combining these devices together and lately the applications and the information stored by those applications is a major challenge of interoperability. This can be achieved through numerous individual and personal information spaces in which persons groups of persons etc. can place share interact and manipulate or program devices to automatically perform the planning interaction and manipulation of webs of information with their own locally agreed semantics without necessarily conforming to an unobtainable global whole.

Furthermore in addition to information the information spaces may be combined with webs of shared and interactive computations or computation spaces so that the devices having connectivity to the computation spaces can have the information in the information space manipulated within the computation space environment and the results delivered to the device rather than the whole process being performed locally in the device. It is noted that such computation spaces may consist of connectivity between devices from devices to network infrastructure to distributed information spaces so that computations can be executed where enough computational elements are available. These combined information spaces and computation spaces often referred to as computation clouds are extensions of the Giant Global Graph in which one can apply semantics and reasoning at a local level.

Networks composed of mobile and immobile devices associated with the wide spectrum of distributed information and computation spaces communicate with each other via methods of connectivity based on various paradigms of communication or radio such as for example cognitive radio wave telephony fiber optics orbiting satellites the Internet etc. A recent development in radio communication technology referred to as cognitive radio provides a paradigm for wireless communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its transmission or reception parameters to communicate efficiently while avoiding interference with other users either licensed or unlicensed. In one embodiment this alteration of parameters is based at least in part on the active monitoring of several factors in the external and internal radio environment such as radio frequency spectrum user behavior and network state. By way of example cognitive radio can provide many advantages over traditional radio communication paradigms for example by 1 enabling use of all available frequencies leading to efficient use of the radio spectrum 2 providing each user with the optimal connectivity for the use and the occasion 3 providing easy access control and identification management 4 providing new levels of interaction among various radio types etc. Because of the benefits of cognitive radio many network managers may opt for using cognitive radio as their preferred way of communication. In order to be able to benefit from the advantages of cognitive radio the users may need to share information about themselves with radio management systems so that the management systems can match user needs with available connectivity. However on one hand the users may be reluctant to reveal detailed information about themselves in exchange of services while on the other hand the more information cognitive radio management systems have on the users the better they can serve users needs. Therefore a balance between the privacy level and provided services should be achieved.

Therefore there is a need for an approach for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

Examples of a method apparatus and computer program for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

In one embodiment cognitive radio may provide the possibility to multiply the current network speeds and or capacity. For example cognitive radio technology can be configured to understand the language of any radio protocol. This characteristic of the cognitive radio combined with new simple radios embedded in any object can provide interaction between any physical objects. This can also provide solutions for communication between people using communication devices with different setups such as for example different languages and cultures etc.

For example at a big event such as a concert or a sports event the local network may get overloaded. Based on the current spectrum usage limitations the provided capacity may not be enough for all the users. In one embodiment cognitive radio technology can use all available frequencies and connectivity methods. It can quickly adapt to the unusual situation and ensure proper operation of the networks. The devices can connect not only through the network cells but also by forming spontaneous networks. This enables many more users to transmit information such as for example messages phone calls real time video streams etc.

Furthermore the cognitive connectivity and radio communication paradigm generally provides and or relies on location dependent information on available bandwidth rules and tuning setups associated with a communication network. Accordingly a cognitive radio enabled system often is equipped with one or more centralized databases in addition to local coexistence management for every device to interact and request operational parameters. More specifically cognitive radio enabled devices can request and or inform their spectrum findings to the cognitive radio database and local coexistence management and in return receive settings and other response information to configure devices and utilize settings correctly at certain locations which are under certain regulations. These interactions often involve sharing and or distributing cognitive radio information among participating devices. In addition a cognitive enabled device should provide information to the coexistence manager in order for the coexistence manager to be able to provide a proper type of available connectivity to the device using the provided information. The coexistence manager may also exchange the information regarding individual devices with other e.g. global databases. However users may be reluctant to reveal private information about them and let that information to be stored in a central cognitive radio database. On the other hand the more information cognitive connectivity system has about the users the better it can serve users needs. Therefore there is a need for a balance between the amount of shared information and the services provided so that an optimum amount of information about the users is revealed.

To address this problem a system of introduces the capability to provide optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The cloud computing environments provide aggregated sets of information information spaces and computations computation spaces from different sources. This multi sourcing is very flexible since it accounts and relies on the observation that the same piece of information or computation can come from different sources. In one embodiment information and computations within the cloud are represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework RDF RDF Schema RDFS OWL Web Ontology Language FOAF Friend of a Friend ontology rule sets in RuleML Rule Markup Language etc. Furthermore as used herein RDF refers to a family of World Wide Web Consortium W3C specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. It has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information and computations that is implemented in web resources using a variety of syntax formats.

The basic concept of information space technology provides access to distributed information for various devices within the scope of the cloud in such a way that the distributed nature of the information is hidden from users and it appears to a user as if all the information exist on the same device. The information spaces also enable a user to have control over information distribution by transferring information between devices that the user has access to. For example a user may want to transfer information among work devices home devices and portable devices other private and public devices etc. Furthermore as computing environments become more and more personalized as well as localized the need for more sophisticated sharing mechanisms between information spaces increases. For example users may tend to own more than one mobile devices and using them for various purposes such as a work phone a personal phone a media player a browser etc. These sharing mechanisms while at the outset appear to be simple union and partitioning of the information proved more difficult because of the internal interactions of the information and the semantic structures governing that information. For example operations such as split dividing an information space into two or more smaller information spaces merge joining two or more information spaces into larger information spaces projection extracting information from an information space injection adding information to an existing information space etc. facilitate sharing information among devices.

In one embodiment cognitive radio enabled communication networks interact with the information spaces of a cloud environment create mappings between related architectures find commonalties in order to determine how cognitive radio can fit into wireless mobile environments e.g. via platform application programming interfaces APIs such as core APIs and or mobile functionality specific APIs wherein platform APIs add mobile device features to the standard application development platforms .

In one embodiment a distributed information space is constituted by different namespaces wherein a namespace is an abstract environment holding logical groupings of unique identifiers associated with the information space content. In this embodiment the information associated with cognitive radio e.g. cognitive radio parameters may be stored in different namespaces associated with distributed information spaces and the namespaces within the distributed information spaces are accessible to one or more cognitive radio enabled devices so that the cognitive radio enabled devices can use the stored parameters for communication within the wireless environment.

In one embodiment integrated services and architectures enable the cognitive radio communication networks and other systems such as distributed information spaces and communication spaces in a cloud environment to communicate with each other via a common language. In this way information spaces or cloud entities can be considered as aggregated information sets from different sources. In one embodiment this multi sourcing provides considerable flexibility by enabling the same piece of information to come from different sources.

It is noted that cognitive radio may use any available radio spectrum. For example in the United States cognitive radio devices include TV band devices TVBDs that can use available TV white space spectrum or the unused TV spectrum for communications. To facilitate such use a cognitive radio database can be created to record uses or applications of the TV white space to ensure that cognitive radio uses do not interfere with other uses of the same radio frequencies e.g. for TV broadcasts etc. In other words the application of cognitive radio technology to white spaces may provide intelligent combination of the white spaces with other licensed and unlicensed bands to increase total system capacity and reliability. However since a cognitive radio database may contain sensitive and private information ensuring the privacy of the database content and prevention of unauthorized access to the information is an important issue. In order to provide efficiency flexibility and scalability to the users a cognitive radio system should also provide privacy services and integrate privacy enabler and filtering architectures to offer cognitive connectivity with other existing systems. Additionally privacy functionality should be integrated into the cognitive radio database into different places in the cognitive radio TV white space other local domain systems Radio Frequency RF memory tag systems or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment a device can access the cognitive connectivity white space database architecture and other cognitive connectivity information via the distributed information spaces and communication spaces in a cloud environment. Therefore cloud environment as a communication standard can be also utilized for exchange of cognitive connectivity information among devices.

In one embodiment the cognitive connectivity and radio provide location dependent information on available bandwidth rules and tuning setup. Cognitive radio has access to centralized databases and local coexistence management for every device to interact and request operational parameters. However certain information may be more sensitive e.g. with privacy aspects assigned . When exchanging such private information to devices a privacy enabler functions as a gatekeeper between the information requesting component and other components of the cognitive radio environment and filters the sensitive information. Additionally privacy databases accessible via the cloud may exist which control privacy in environments such as social networks etc. The privacy control can be done based on requester s ID credentials and location data etc.

In one embodiment the privacy enabler needs to create a balance between the amount of user information revealed to the cognitive connectivity and radio provider such that user privacy is ensured at the same time as acceptable quality of service is provided to the user. The privacy enabler should provide a balanced service quality in terms of connectivity and the level of detail individual users are willing to reveal.

In one embodiment users are divided into service classes such as for example classes A B and C. The users in the highest service class e.g. class A may reveal all available information on them as accurately as possible and can receive in return highest level of optimized cognitive connectivity. Such revealed information may include location device used connectivity subscriptions available e.g. an operator data plan with a flat rate fee applications used etc. In this embodiment since the cognitive connectivity infrastructure has the maximum information available it can provide the best connectivity. However in the lowest service class e.g. class C the information revealed can be of lowest quality and as a result the connectivity provided will be of lowest quality.

In one embodiment a link between the service class of a user and the privacy aspects for the used is generated that indicates in order to receive a particular quality of service to what extent information can be shared. The privacy aspects may include the owner of the data provenance or system of record of the data e.g. ownership history the sensitivity of the data the allowed usages of the data the agents or entities with access to the data access control e.g. access credentials data retention e.g. data archival policies and rules etc.

In one embodiment service classes are allocated to devices based on capabilities visibility and the amount of information revealed by the cognitive radio enabled device. Table 1 shows an example service class allocation.

In one embodiment the capabilities provided to cognitive radio enabled devices at a specific location are determined based on the quality of information that each device is revealing. As seen in Table 1 the less information revealed more privacy for the devices is provided. In this embodiment a mechanism is used to balance information privacy and other capabilities sets in order to provide optimum allocations for each cognitive radio enabled device.

In one embodiment a device may belong to one or more groups of devices wherein a group has certain set of rules and benefits. Devices of a group may reveal less information outside the group strict rules than the information they share among group members less strict rules in order to receive a certain quality of service in cognitive connectivity. In this embodiment group information and shared information among group members can be used for providing services with higher quality to the members of the group. A device may have multiple roles specified with regards to different groups the device is a member of and each role may provide a different level of cognitive connectivity to the device based on the characteristics specific to the group.

In one embodiment one or more incentive programs can be created so that users can receive incentives for a certain level of detailed information that they are willing to reveal while using cognitive connectivity. For example a loyalty program can be created based on which the service classes assigned to a device work as stimuli for users to trade the information they own in return for having certain levels of quality of service provided by operator cognitive connectivity provider or a combination thereof.

As shown in the system comprises sets of user equipments UEs having connectivity to the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform via a communication network . By way of example the communication network of system includes one or more networks such as a data network not shown a wireless network not shown a telephony network not shown or any combination thereof. It is contemplated that the data network may be any local area network LAN metropolitan area network MAN wide area network WAN a public data network e.g. the Internet short range wireless network or any other suitable packet switched network such as a commercially owned proprietary packet switched network e.g. a proprietary cable or fiber optic network and the like or any combination thereof. In addition the wireless network may be for example a cellular network and may employ various technologies including enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. worldwide interoperability for microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi wireless LAN WLAN Bluetooth Internet Protocol IP data casting satellite mobile ad hoc network MANET and the like or any combination thereof.

The UEs are any type of mobile terminal fixed terminal or portable terminal including a mobile handset station unit device multimedia computer multimedia tablet Internet node communicator desktop computer laptop computer notebook computer netbook computer tablet computer personal communication system PCS device personal navigation device personal digital assistants PDAs audio video player digital camera camcorder positioning device television receiver radio broadcast receiver electronic book device game device or any combination thereof including the accessories and peripherals of these devices or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the UEs can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

In one embodiment the optimized privacy of the information in a cognitive radio information sharing environment can be provided in an ad hoc mesh network. An ad hoc mesh network is for instance a serverless device to device network e.g. a mobile ad hoc network MANET created using short range radio technology e.g. wireless local area network WLAN or Bluetooth . Alternatively ad hoc mesh networks may be created using close proximity radio technology for very short distances such as Radio Frequency Identification RFID Near Field Communication NFC RF memory tag systems etc. A close proximity network can be part of a bigger ad hoc mesh network the last centimeter distances from cognitive mobile reader writer device to the RF memory tag or other peer devices. Within the ad hoc mesh network each wireless device may be mobile and is within communication range of any number of other wireless devices . Accordingly the set of wireless devices that are within communication range of any a particular wireless device is transient and can change as the wireless devices move from location to location.

In one embodiment policies e.g. privacy policies can be presented in a direct way wherein the user of a user equipment UE can have direct control over policies using a User Interface UI on the UE traditional approach . In other embodiments the policies can be implicitly enforced behind the scene wherein the UEs can interact implicitly for example via a contact list.

In one embodiment the privacy optimization is applied to cognitive radio specific systems architecture e.g. white space ad hoc mesh networks distributed information architectures e.g. clouds etc. The cognitive radio privacy optimization platform can utilize cognitive radio capabilities which can provide additions to policy languages.

In one embodiment the cognitive radio privacy optimization data can be integrated with privacy database e.g. central database which can control privacy of the cognitive radio database and access privacy to and or from the database. Alternatively the privacy optimization data can be distributed with equivalent privacy enabler to cognitive radio white space architecture blocks and to different places in cognitive radio white space such as for example TV Band Devices TVBD Coexistence Enablers CE Coexistence Managers CM Coexistence Discovery and Information Servers CDIS remote CMs etc.

In other embodiments the cognitive radio spectrum and device settings including privacy settings can be locally put under selected privacy policies cloud or ad hoc mesh network environments can provide privacy enabler interaction means and the combination of these privacy enforcements can provide agreed upon privacy optimization options for different ranges of local and distributed communications. As a result a privacy optimization can be integrated into the cognitive radio system.

By way of example the UEs and the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform communicate with each other and other components of the communication network using well known new or still developing protocols. In this context a protocol includes a set of rules defining how the network nodes within the communication network interact with each other based on information sent over the communication links. The protocols are effective at different layers of operation within each node from generating and receiving physical signals of various types to selecting a link for transferring those signals to the format of information indicated by those signals to identifying which software application executing on a computer system sends or receives the information. The conceptually different layers of protocols for exchanging information over a network are described in the Open Systems Interconnection OSI Reference Model.

Communications between the network nodes are typically effected by exchanging discrete packets of data. Each packet typically comprises 1 header information associated with a particular protocol and 2 payload information that follows the header information and contains information that may be processed independently of that particular protocol. In some protocols the packet includes 3 trailer information following the payload and indicating the end of the payload information. The header includes information such as the source of the packet its destination the length of the payload and other properties used by the protocol. Often the data in the payload for the particular protocol includes a header and payload for a different protocol associated with a different higher layer of the OSI Reference Model. The header for a particular protocol typically indicates a type for the next protocol contained in its payload. The higher layer protocol is said to be encapsulated in the lower layer protocol. The headers included in a packet traversing multiple heterogeneous networks such as the Internet typically include a physical layer 1 header a data link layer 2 header an internetwork layer 3 header and a transport layer 4 header and various application layer 5 layer 6 and layer 7 headers as defined by the OSI Reference Model.

In one embodiment per step of flowchart in the analysis module determines cognitive radio connectivity information provided by at least one user via one or more UEs . The cognitive connectivity information which enables the cognitive radio connectivity system to provide requested connectivity for the user may include at least in part location information device type and configuration identity information connectivity subscriptions information e.g. an operator data plan with a flat rate fee group membership information one or more incentive program participation information on one or more applications using the cognitive radio connectivity or a combination thereof.

Upon the determination of the cognitive radio connectivity information the analysis module processes the information to determine a quality an amount or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio connectivity information. The analysis by the analysis module enables the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform to evaluate level of the cognitive radio connectivity information revealed by UEs from the privacy point of view. The analysis module may be equipped with certain mechanisms to determine the privacy level of the UEs based on the amount and quality of the cognitive radio information provides by the UEs as seen in Table 1.

In one embodiment each UE may be a member of one or more groups one or more incentive programs etc. A group or an incentive program may have certain rules for the amount of information the members should reveal in return for a certain service class or quality service they receive. In one embodiment the UEs can then provide the group membership information program participation information or a combination thereof to the cognitive connectivity provider. The provider can then determine the service class pre determined for the corresponding groups or the programs.

In one embodiment if multiple group memberships and or multiple incentive program participations exist for a UE the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform may use various optimization methods e.g. to balance connectivity requirements against available connectivity in order to determine a service class for the UE 

In one embodiment per step of the analysis module processes the cognitive radio connectivity information to determine one or more privacy aspects. The one or more privacy aspects may include for example an ownership of the cognitive radio connectivity information a provenance of the cognitive radio connectivity information indicating the ownership history of the information a sensitivity level of the cognitive radio connectivity information one or more usage rights of the cognitive radio connectivity information associated to a device a user or a combination thereof one or more entities with access to at least a portion of cognitive radio connectivity information for example a device a user an application or a combination thereof a retention of the cognitive radio connectivity information indicating the persistence of the information the legal and business requirements regarding the information or a combination thereof or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment per step of the analysis module determines whether a request for the cognitive radio connectivity specifying one or more operations has been received. The request may be initiated by a user by an application activated by the user by an application activated by a UE by a network component by a computation cloud or a combination thereof. If the request specifies parameters per step of the recommendation module determines a recommended service class based at least in part on the one or more operations. Furthermore per step the recommendation module determines one or more information sharing recommendations to achieve the recommended service class. For example if the specified operation requires a high level of accuracy a high service class such as for example class A in Table 1 is recommended otherwise is the operation has no accuracy requirement a service class B or C may be recommended. It is noted that since various levels of accuracy can be measured various classes of service may be defined and associated with the devices users applications etc. Following the determination of a recommended service class the recommendation module may recommend an information sharing level which for example has a direct relationship with accuracy level and an inverse relationship with privacy level.

In one embodiment if no operations are specified by the request of step in step the information collector determines resource information security information privacy information or a combination thereof associated with the at least one UE 

In one embodiment per step of the analysis module processes the cognitive radio connectivity information previously determined per step to determine one or more parameters that affect the cognitive radio connectivity. For example a parameter for connectivity can be the distance over which connectivity takes place. In this case the cognitive connectivity may be tuned based on other parameters to deduct an optimal distance for providing suitable service e.g. a service with requested level of privacy and providing required level of accuracy .

In one embodiment per step the balancing module determines an extent to which the quality the amount or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio connectivity information affects the one or more parameters. The extent may be determined based on pre defined factors

In one embodiment per step of the analysis module determines one or more costs functions the one or more cost functions relating at least in part to one or more privacy levels one or more accuracy levels or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio connectivity information.

In one embodiment per step of the service class module determines at least one service class for providing cognitive radio connectivity to the at least one device based at least in part on the quality the amount or a combination thereof of the cognitive radio information provided by analysis module . In addition to the quality and the amount the service class module determines the service class based at least in part on the privacy aspects determined by the analysis module the resource security and privacy information determined by the information collector or a combination thereof the extent determined by the balancing module the cost functions determined by the analysis module or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment per step of the mapping module checks whether the cognitive radio connectivity is available from a plurality of communities. If a plurality of communities offers cognitive radio connectivity the mapping module per step determines a first community that provides at least one service class. Subsequently the mapping module per step of causes at least in part a mapping of the at least one service class to at least one other service class provided by at least one other of the plurality of communities. The mapping enables the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform to assign any of the available equivalent service classes to the requesting UE 

In one embodiment per step of the mapping module causes at least in part a joining of the at least one UE to at least one of the plurality of communities based at least in part on respective service classes provided by the plurality of communities using the mapping of step .

In one embodiment cognitive radio communication utilizes the TV band TV whitespace secondary usage opportunity where there are cognitive radio rules for each action and a central database from where the broadcast for selected frequency is acquired for each device UE and in . The UEs and need to check the cognitive radio database regularly. In cognitive radio TV white space the accuracy in X Y two dimensional space is 50 meters. For example for UE within the circle without direction vector and height Z the third dimension information about available frequency in the respective X Y space and within the 50 meters radius is provided. In other embodiments in addition to the location of a UE in locality information on direction of connectivity third dimension of axis Z is included. As seen in the UE has access to the basic level of cognitive radio connectivity based only on location no direction involved while UE has access to an advanced cognitive radio including direction vector Z.

In one embodiment each cognitive radio device and needs to reveal and receive certain set of information with various accuracy levels for the cognitive radio specific characteristics such as location time place situation application used etc. For example a device or needs to know where it is located what kinds of connections are available at the location what direction are the connections available from etc.

In one embodiment cognitive radio enabled devices broadcast based on certain location capabilities and accuracy levels. Privacy setting requirements affect the overall device capabilities such as for example cognitive radio device to cognitive radio device cognitive radio device to RF memory tags local cognitive radio device neighborhood settings based on selected accuracy etc. If limited amount of information is requested or achieved by a cognitive radio device the interpretation by the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform may be that local capabilities of the cognitive radio device are limited and therefore the device may be highly dependent on the capabilities of the available cognitive radio base stations .

In one embodiment the cognitive radio decision quality in is based on capabilities such as privacy security load energy etc. These capabilities may affect cognitive radio location decision capability which need to be in balance with the set of cognitive radio privacy decision capabilities of derived from user each UE one or more applications group of cognitive radio devices infrastructure and cloud privacy requirements or a combination thereof. The cognitive radio target and selected result level for decision making by the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform is dependent on what set of capability levels are chosen and at what cost given a cost function . In one embodiment cost function may determine that a tuple privacy information revealed needs to primarily satisfy a the connectivity best downgrade b the speed c the storage battery levels and d device type or class of device e other relevant properties or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment cognitive radio rules are derived from various sources such as for example a central cognitive radio database a privacy database the storage of the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform or a combination thereof where privacy affects the cognitive radio system level or local resources such as location dependent local dependent targets such as available RF memory tags for cognitive radio or devices. For example some requirements for balanced capabilities may be User U needs best connectivity and upgraded cognitive radio location accuracy Application A needs to downgrade the location accuracy due to privacy upgrade needs. Device needs to transfer information to device with fastest connectivity possible and with downgraded privacy Due to the fact that devices need privacy information level needs to be downgraded and due to that suboptimum performance is reachable. etc. As a result the tuple privacy information revealed forms optimum selected cognitive radio quality settings cognitive radio specific parameters . If certain cognitive radio specific data is revealed this may affect cognitive radio capabilities of a device or a group of devices causing for example missing out certain part s of the spectrum certain frequency re use location accuracy privacy settings etc.

In one embodiment in UE requires the highest level of privacy level while other UEs and have the lowest privacy requirement of level . As a result the UE is assigned with the lowest accuracy of level . On the other hand UEs and have the highest level of accuracy requirement of level which in return leads to lowest privacy of level . However UEs and that may have a medium requirement for accuracy of level can have a privacy level of either equal to the accuracy level of medium level or a lower privacy level of 1 the lowest level .

In one embodiment the balance between privacy level and accuracy level can be determined based on a cost function. For example a cost function may be used to calculate that with a certain level of accuracy required how much information should be revealed in order for the cost not to exceed a certain threshold.

In one embodiment if factors such as time location neighboring devices device characteristics e.g. battery device plug in device etc. change or extra cost or upgrade of device capability resources is allowed then medium levels of privacy and accuracy may select highest levels of accuracy or privacy respectively as their other pair. For example a device with privacy level medium may be able to select the accuracy level highest if cost increase is allowed.

In one embodiment decision rules are selected by the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform not only based on required and revealed information for privacy and accuracy levels but based on other capabilities pair of capabilities that form needed results. For example if circles and show the location information for UEs respectively a UE may make the request for a transmission T via cognitive radio as I am located at location . There are UEs and in my vicinity. I need cognitive radio connectivity with best with any with what available radio that is sufficient for transmission T.

In one embodiment the users within a group can trade their information and receive in return better offerings in terms of service class and or quality of service. If enough information is shared by members of a group the members can be promoted to a next group with higher benefits. On the contrary if provided information is insufficient the group members may be downgraded to less privileged groups. As seen in table of a group in position with highest level of privacy sharing as little information as possible receives an economy class of service. However if members of the group are willing to share more information and lower their privacy level to medium or low their quality of service will increase accordingly to business class and first class respectively. On the other hand members of a group in position with low privacy by requiring more privacy to medium or high will be downgraded with respect to the quality of service.

Such group upgrades can be offered for different types of service classes starting from the bottom up to the top. For example if the group of users with lowest service class privilege is offered with an incentive the group may be upgraded to a different service class or can trade such premium with other users or other groups for a certain benefit.

In one embodiment the highest service class offers the premium of top like connectivity due to best information available resulting in most suitable frequencies and connectivity methods to be selected. If a member of a group belongs to a higher level loyalty program the member or even the connectivity provider may trade the level of loyalty program in exchange of an incentive in return.

In the embodiment of the privacy enablers and control the privacy of cognitive radio information sharing respectively between the coexistence discovery and information server and the coexistence manager between the coexistence manager and the coexistence enabler between the coexistence manager and the coexistence manager and between the coexistence enabler and the TV band device . Each privacy enabler also has connectivity to a privacy database wherein the privacy databases may be distributed databases communicating with each other be components of a centralized database or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment the privacy enabler sets the privacy client for the path between TVDB and the coexistence enabler to ON status and updates selected rules and settings in the privacy database

In one embodiment the coexistence enabler requests capabilities from the coexistence manager . The privacy enabler checks the privacy database for answers to questions such as what is the cognitive enabler allowed to do using the privacy enabler settings as parameter.

In one embodiment the coexistence manager collects information such as locations request neighborhood who else is there etc. from the coexistence discovery and information server using privacy enabler settings as parameter.

In one embodiment the coexistence manager may be local while the coexistence manager may be a remote coexistence manager wherein the privacy of interaction between the coexistence managers and can be may provided by the privacy enabler associated with the privacy database

In one embodiment a white space architecture may utilize privacy policy rules for what data it is allowed to access from upper levels of the architecture and what it is not for example by setting a privacy enabler on or off. Additionally each level of the architecture can be treated independently with privacy policy rules for what they are allowed to forward as plain visible text and what they are not between the cognitive radio white space blocks. Those blocks may also have the ability to independently utilize other or same privacy policy rules for output data.

In one embodiment regular users of cognitive connectivity can be offered better quality of service than the level of information they reveal would otherwise allow them to get by joining a group such as for example a loyalty group. The group identity or identities are attached to the privacy information such that as a result the collective information on the group can be used to provide a higher class of service a better quality of service to the group members. For example if users allow that their usage patterns be recorded e.g. by joining a loyalty program their information including past information can be used to optimize the quality of service. Additionally the longer users are with a group e.g. use the cognitive connectivity via the group the higher their rank can be in the group which can affect the quality of service the users receive. On the other hand accumulation of history information regarding group members enables the cognitive radio providers to provide better connectivity to the users. The more information the users reveal on themselves the faster can they raise their rank in the group.

In one embodiment the backend environment is a network infrastructure. The backend environment may also be a virtual run time environment within a cloud associated with the owner of one or more UEs or on another UE associated with the user. The backend environment may include one or more components backend devices and one or more Application Programming Interface API such as a convenience API that may include APIs tailored to the software development environments used e.g. JAVA PHP etc. . Furthermore UEs may include client APIs not shown each API enabling interaction between devices and components within another device or an environment. For example the convenience API enables interaction between the backend device and agents and wherein each agent is a set of processes that handle computations within the backend environment .

The storage is a repository of information and computations that can be accessed and used by all the UEs and infrastructure components having connectivity to the backend environment .

In one embodiment the backend device may be equipped with a data manipulation layer that monitors and manages any access to the storage .

In one embodiment the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform extracts cognitive radio specific parameters by sniffing interrogation or a combination thereof from the backend environment associated with cloud and translates the parameters into specific expressions of the cognitive radio. The cognitive radio privacy optimization platform may also utilize storage which is part of the information space for storing shared cognitive radio information white space database or a combination thereof.

In one embodiment one or more UEs . . . may request and inform their spectrum findings to the common cognitive radio database e.g. storage in the backend device storage of cognitive radio privacy optimization platform backend environment or a combination thereof . In response the backend device may send settings and other response information back to configure UEs .

The backend environment may include several layers e.g. L1 L2 L3 shown as circle which provide fine instruments for developers to access particular layers for development. The layers describe different abstraction layers attached to different convenience layers convenience API . In one embodiment the cognitive radio functions can be mapped to level L3 as a cognitive radio domain specific API. The cognitive radio domain can be built based on location frequency and rules information.

In one embodiment the cloud may have a platform API which is specific to mobile applications defining location bearer short range communications etc. and when cognitive radio specific functions e.g. cognitive radio domain information are mapped into the platform API it forms a cognitive radio specific platform API.

In one embodiment the Data Manipulation Layer DML provides connectivity privacy security policies API which will fetch policy rules from storage or any other storage spaces associated with cloud and apply them to the ongoing data stream.

In one embodiment the cognitive radio database information is based on locations wherein each location may be under certain regulations legislation allowing certain frequencies to be used at the location.

In one embodiment as previously described there may be two options functions for cognitive radio specific operations namely sniffing associated radio sensing and listen before talk such as for example transmitting sniffing vacant channels channel numbers characteristics and interrogation with local agreement . In the interrogation method the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform has knowledge of occupied channels and provides protocols for communication among UEs including rules candidate neighbors operation and measurement configurations etc.

In one embodiment sniffing includes scanning the environment whereas interrogation provides more local and global interactions also selecting the used setup. Sniffing is a subset of interrogation as interrogation provides more information.

In one embodiment the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform uses sniffing or interrogation methods and reutilizes the methods in the convenience API . The cognitive radio specific API may consist of information such as regulations bandwidth information and their characteristics etc. in order to provide cognitive radio specific operations method of choice e.g. sniff or interrogate the cognitive radio information from the environment .

In one embodiment mapping is performed on the technologies of the CR architecture environment and the cloud backend environment .

In one embodiment the cognitive radio specific API may consist of location API Connectivity Privacy Security Policies API frequency API or a combination thereof. As seen above the frequency API may be a new API at the backend environment . Alternatively the frequency can be mapped to a current Bearer API not shown . The cognitive radio privacy optimization platform may use sniffing interrogation or a combination thereof to determine vacant and occupied frequencies with support from cloud environment .

In one embodiment for example a cognitive radio enabled UE may be associated with a specific location and the connectivity privacy security policy rules API regulation with tune up parameters attached to the location. In this embodiment particular information associated with the location can be extracted from the cloud 

In another embodiment a cognitive radio enabled UE may be associated with a specific location and the connectivity privacy security policy rules API regulation with tune up parameters attached to the location and to a selected frequency. In this embodiment particular information associated with the location and the frequency can be extracted from the cloud 

In one embodiment a cognitive radio enabled UE may request direct subscription for device to device communication from location parameters cloud backend environment Data Manipulation Layer figuring equivalent parameters and enabling these devices to communicate directly. If no DML database exists a wrapper may be used to provide connection to device storage .

In one embodiment a virtual copy of the local findings and settings of cloud based cognitive radio database can be used at UE level locally to allow direct device to device e.g. UE to UE cognitive radio connections. The two UEs can form a group in which findings and settings are treated as group findings and are updated to the backend as well.

In one embodiment personal or private area settings on a UE may be locally available on a Radio Frequency RF memory tag e.g. home mode wherein the cognitive radio environment may be more static than other outdoor or public environments where each cognitive radio enabled UE can pull and push settings for that area from to RF memory tag.

The connectivity component of the knowledge processors not shown contains the logic and functionality to communicate to various information spaces . Connectivity is over some network protocol to a semantic information broker SIB . A semantic information broker contains the logic for parsing messages and pointers to subscription handlers between the knowledge processors and the information space . A knowledge processor may potentially connect to more than one information spaces at a time thus distributing and synchronizing the operations across all connected information spaces.

The basic functionality provided by the connectivity protocols at this level for manipulating information and for connection to an information space is given below 

The information space is virtual in nature in the sense that its existence is provided by the underlying semantic information brokers which are the elements that physically exist. Within the scope of an information space capabilities for local reasoning over the information contained in that information space are provided through a deductive closure calculation mechanism not shown . The mechanisms for managing connections and operations of knowledge processors and for distributing the information around information spaces can be implemented by more than one SIB distributed over different processing elements.

The interaction among knowledge processors and information spaces is accomplished by network connections to one or more SIBs providing or representing the information space. As far as the user or designer of a knowledge processor is concerned there are knowledge processors and information spaces and the connectivity layer abstracts away the physical connection to a SIB 

Additionally the semantic information brokers may be distributed over a number of different devices . For example SIB is on device and SIBs and are on device . However as seen in each set of SIBs represent one information space at a time. For example SIBs and represent information space while SIBs represent information space . Some devices can run more than one SIB representing different information spaces concurrently. For example device runs SIB which represents information space and at the same time runs the SIB that represents information space

The system can be implemented on various platforms including mobile devices personal computers etc. The main requirement of such implementation platforms is that the devices support the runtime environments and that enough processing power and storage is available. Given that knowledge processors can be distributed over devices with more processing power and or storage as necessary usually smaller hand held devices are adequate for running these knowledge processors.

In one embodiment a SIB may run on systems supporting the Python runtime environment and additionally versions for C specifically exist for Linux Unix and Open C for Symbian operating system. Client libraries for knowledge processors may exist in Python C C Linux Unix and Symbian as well as Java. Other environments based on Web services and Javascript can also be used.

In another embodiment the system implementations run on Mobile Devices including N800 810 N95 and personal computers Unix Linux Windows . The knowledge processors can run on sensors etc. Communication is made over TCP IP and HTTP protocols which can be used over Ethernet GPRS and 3G transports.

The information spaces can be represented using Semantic Web standards such as Resource Description Framework RDF RDF Schema RDFS OWL Web Ontology Language FOAF Friend of a Friend ontology rule sets in RuleML Rule Markup Language etc. For example RDF is a family of World Wide Web Consortium W3C specifications originally designed as a metadata data model. RDF has come to be used as a general method for conceptual description or modeling of information that is implemented in web resources using a variety of syntax formats. The underlying structure of any expression in RDF is a collection of triples each consisting of three disjoint sets of nodes including a subject a predicate and an object. A subject is an RDF Uniform Resource Identifier URI reference U or a Blank Node B a predicate is an RDF URI reference U and an object is an RDF URI reference U a literal L or a Blank Node B . A set of such triples is called an RDF graph. Table 2 shows sample RDF triples.

The basic operations on an information store are insertion of a graph retraction deletion of a graph querying and subscription for information. Insertion and retractions may be combined into a single transactional structure in order to admit atomic updates through the atomic application of retract and insert. All other forms of operations are constructions and refinements of the above. For example update is constructed out of a set of retracts and inserts. Further rewrite rules can simplify the recurrent application of operations.

In one embodiment a query is evaluated based on the current snapshot of the information in the information space . Queries can be performed by Wilbur query language WQL or simple RDF triple pattern matching. WQL is a lisp like path based query language. One important difference between WQL and RDF triple pattern matching is that Wilbur s static reasoning engine only runs with WQL queries. WQL queries return a set of RDF graph nodes while the pattern queries return an RDF graph. Furthermore other query languages such as SPARQL are also supported.

In another embodiment subscriptions are implemented as persistent queries that is a given query is evaluated whenever the information in the information space changes and thus the same methods are available. The results are transmitted to the knowledge processors only when they are changed. Depending on parameters either the full results or a differential is transmitted.

According to the stated ontologies no attempt is made by the information space to enforce consistency or integrity of information. However internal reasoning knowledge processors not shown may be present which can perform this activity if the information space has been configured accordingly. Information is explicitly semi structured and may take on any form that the knowledge processors insert or retract.

Presence of typing constructs and namespaces does not necessarily mean that a knowledge processor querying for that information will interpret the information according to the implied ontology. A namespace is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique identifiers or symbols e.g. names . The semantics of the information is interpreted by the reader merely implied by the writer and grounded in the real world context of the knowledge processors . Therefore any two given knowledge processors may disagree about the semantics. This concept is generally referred to as pragmatic or intentional semantics.

The information spaces provide further functionality regarding the joining and leaving of knowledge processors and policy management. Knowledge processors have a set of credentials which are passed during the join operation. The counterparts of the knowledge processor instantiated leave and join operations are the information spaces instantiated invite and remove operations. These operations are not necessarily provided by every information space nor understood by every knowledge processor 

Connectivity is provided through a set of listeners which provide access via any given specified transport protocol. TCP IP is the most used transport but a Bluetooth based listener or one that uses HTTP S have also been developed. Listeners can provide pre processing of the incoming messages if necessary for example with Bluetooth profiles. Any number of listeners may be provided at any time at least one is necessary .

Furthermore and in some respects similar to that of the principles of information distribution the connectivity of an information space can also be seen as a union of all listeners in all SIBs . However not all listeners may be available on all physical locations consider Bluetooth or TCP IP over WLAN for example .

In one embodiment the cognitive radio privacy optimization platform performs the process described by the flowchart of to manage cognitive radio information sharing among cognitive radio enabled devices using the information spaces wherein the information spaces are configured based on the architecture described in .

The processes described herein for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing may be advantageously implemented via software hardware firmware or a combination of software and or firmware and or hardware. For example the processes described herein may be advantageously implemented via processor s Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

A bus includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus . One or more processors for processing information are coupled with the bus .

A processor or multiple processors performs a set of operations on information as specified by computer program code related to providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The computer program code is a set of instructions or statements providing instructions for the operation of the processor and or the computer system to perform specified functions. The code for example may be written in a computer programming language that is compiled into a native instruction set of the processor. The code may also be written directly using the native instruction set e.g. machine language . The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information shifting positions of units of information and combining two or more units of information such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR exclusive OR XOR and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor such as a sequence of operation codes constitute processor instructions also called computer system instructions or simply computer instructions. Processors may be implemented as mechanical electrical magnetic optical chemical or quantum components among others alone or in combination.

Computer system also includes a memory coupled to bus . The memory such as a random access memory RAM or any other dynamic storage device stores information including processor instructions for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. The computer system also includes a read only memory ROM or any other static storage device coupled to the bus for storing static information including instructions that is not changed by the computer system . Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus is a non volatile persistent storage device such as a magnetic disk optical disk or flash card for storing information including instructions that persists even when the computer system is turned off or otherwise loses power.

Information including instructions for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing is provided to the bus for use by the processor from an external input device such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus used primarily for interacting with humans include a display device such as a cathode ray tube CRT a liquid crystal display LCD a light emitting diode LED display an organic LED OLED display a plasma screen or a printer for presenting text or images and a pointing device such as a mouse a trackball cursor direction keys or a motion sensor for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display . In some embodiments for example in embodiments in which the computer system performs all functions automatically without human input one or more of external input device display device and pointing device is omitted.

In the illustrated embodiment special purpose hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of ASICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network speech recognition and interfaces to special external devices such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.

Computer system also includes one or more instances of a communications interface coupled to bus . Communication interface provides a one way or two way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors such as printers scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link that is connected to a local network to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example communication interface may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus USB port on a personal computer. In some embodiments communications interface is an integrated services digital network ISDN card or a digital subscriber line DSL card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments a communication interface is a cable modem that converts signals on bus into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example communications interface may be a local area network LAN card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links the communications interface sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical acoustic or electromagnetic signals including infrared and optical signals that carry information streams such as digital data. For example in wireless handheld devices such as mobile telephones like cell phones the communications interface includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In certain embodiments the communications interface enables connection to the communication network for providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing to the UEs 

The term computer readable medium as used herein refers to any medium that participates in providing information to processor including instructions for execution. Such a medium may take many forms including but not limited to computer readable storage medium e.g. non volatile media volatile media and transmission media. Non transitory media such as non volatile media include for example optical or magnetic disks such as storage device . Volatile media include for example dynamic memory . Transmission media include for example twisted pair cables coaxial cables copper wire fiber optic cables and carrier waves that travel through space without wires or cables such as acoustic waves and electromagnetic waves including radio optical and infrared waves.

The term computer readable storage medium is used herein to refer to any computer readable medium except transmission media.

Logic encoded in one or more tangible media includes one or both of processor instructions on a computer readable storage media and special purpose hardware such as ASIC .

Network link typically provides information communication using transmission media through one or more networks to other devices that use or process the information. For example network link may provide a connection through local network to a host computer or to equipment operated by an Internet Service Provider ISP . ISP equipment in turn provides data communication services through the public world wide packet switching communication network of networks now commonly referred to as the Internet .

A computer called a server host connected to the Internet hosts a process that provides a service in response to information received over the Internet. For example server host hosts a process that provides information representing video data for presentation at display . It is contemplated that the components of system can be deployed in various configurations within other computer systems e.g. host and server .

At least some embodiments of the invention are related to the use of computer system for implementing some or all of the techniques described herein. According to one embodiment of the invention those techniques are performed by computer system in response to processor executing one or more sequences of one or more processor instructions contained in memory . Such instructions also called computer instructions software and program code may be read into memory from another computer readable medium such as storage device or network link . Execution of the sequences of instructions contained in memory causes processor to perform one or more of the method steps described herein. In alternative embodiments hardware such as ASIC may be used in place of or in combination with software to implement the invention. Thus embodiments of the invention are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and software unless otherwise explicitly stated herein.

The signals transmitted over network link and other networks through communications interface carry information to and from computer system . Computer system can send and receive information including program code through the networks among others through network link and communications interface . In an example using the Internet a server host transmits program code for a particular application requested by a message sent from computer through Internet ISP equipment local network and communications interface . The received code may be executed by processor as it is received or may be stored in memory or in storage device or any other non volatile storage for later execution or both. In this manner computer system may obtain application program code in the form of signals on a carrier wave.

Various forms of computer readable media may be involved in carrying one or more sequence of instructions or data or both to processor for execution. For example instructions and data may initially be carried on a magnetic disk of a remote computer such as host . The remote computer loads the instructions and data into its dynamic memory and sends the instructions and data over a telephone line using a modem. A modem local to the computer system receives the instructions and data on a telephone line and uses an infra red transmitter to convert the instructions and data to a signal on an infra red carrier wave serving as the network link . An infrared detector serving as communications interface receives the instructions and data carried in the infrared signal and places information representing the instructions and data onto bus . Bus carries the information to memory from which processor retrieves and executes the instructions using some of the data sent with the instructions. The instructions and data received in memory may optionally be stored on storage device either before or after execution by the processor .

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC . A DSP typically is configured to process real world signals e.g. sound in real time independently of the processor . Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a more general purpose processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein may include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

In one embodiment the chip set or chip includes merely one or more processors and some software and or firmware supporting and or relating to and or for the one or more processors.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to provide optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The memory also stores the data associated with or generated by the execution of the inventive steps.

Pertinent internal components of the telephone include a Main Control Unit MCU a Digital Signal Processor DSP and a receiver transmitter unit including a microphone gain control unit and a speaker gain control unit. A main display unit provides a display to the user in support of various applications and mobile terminal functions that perform or support the steps of providing optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The display includes display circuitry configured to display at least a portion of a user interface of the mobile terminal e.g. mobile telephone . Additionally the display and display circuitry are configured to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal. An audio function circuitry includes a microphone and microphone amplifier that amplifies the speech signal output from the microphone . The amplified speech signal output from the microphone is fed to a coder decoder CODEC .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile terminal speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In one embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as enhanced data rates for global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like or any combination thereof.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone any other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile terminal are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU not shown .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile terminal to provide optimized privacy in cognitive radio information sharing. The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the terminal. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile terminal .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art. The memory device may be but not limited to a single memory CD DVD ROM RAM EEPROM optical storage magnetic disk storage flash memory storage or any other non volatile storage medium capable of storing digital data.

An optionally incorporated SIM card carries for instance important information such as the cellular phone number the carrier supplying service subscription details and security information. The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile terminal on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile terminal settings.

While the invention has been described in connection with a number of embodiments and implementations the invention is not so limited but covers various obvious modifications and equivalent arrangements which fall within the purview of the appended claims. Although features of the invention are expressed in certain combinations among the claims it is contemplated that these features can be arranged in any combination and order.
