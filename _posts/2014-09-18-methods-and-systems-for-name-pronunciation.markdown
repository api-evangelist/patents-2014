The present application is a continuation of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13 626 501 entitled Methods And Systems For Name Pronunciation filed on Sep. 25 2012 the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present disclosure generally relates to data processing systems. Specifically the present disclosure relates to methods systems and computer storage devices for providing a pronunciation of a person s name and more specifically for providing the pronunciation of a person s name who is a member or user of an email system and or a social or business networking system.

In today s global business and social networking world people from all over the globe interact with people from many different countries and cultures. Additionally people from all over the world relocate to other countries and cultures for business educational cultural and social reasons. Consequently people are connected to people from many different cultures or countries that may be foreign to them. In many cases a slight to severe language barrier may exist between these peoples and such a barrier may include something as simple as the correct pronunciation of a person s name.

The present disclosure describes methods systems and computer storage devices for providing the correct pronunciation of a person s name. In an embodiment the person whose name is being correctly pronounced is a member or user of an email system a social networking system or a business networking system. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of different embodiments of the present invention. It will be evident however to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without all of the specific details.

In an embodiment a system a method and a computer storage device provide a correct pronunciation of a person s name. The embodiment is described in connection with which respectively illustrate a flowchart like diagram of a method to provide the correct pronunciation of a person s name and a block diagram of features of a system to provide the correct pronunciation of a person s name. includes a number of process blocks . Though arranged serially in the example of other examples may reorder the blocks omit one or more blocks and or execute two or more blocks in parallel using multiple processors or a single processor organized as two or more virtual machines or sub processors. Moreover still other examples can implement the blocks as one or more specific interconnected hardware or integrated circuit modules with related control and data signals communicated between and through the modules. Thus any process flow is applicable to software firmware hardware and hybrid implementations. With some embodiments some of the method operations illustrated in may be performed offline by means of a batch process that is performed periodically e.g. two times a day daily weekly and so forth while in other embodiments the method operations may be performed online and in real time as requests for correct name pronunciations and similar member profiles are being received and processed. In addition some profile features may include data received from a data source external to an email system or a social or business networking service. Accordingly an audio clip of the correct pronunciation of a person s name or data associated with such an audio clip and data from a member s profile e.g. a name or other identifying data may be used to query an external data source for additional information about the member.

Referring now specifically to at a database of a plurality of persons is created provided and or maintained. In an embodiment the database is a stand alone database. In another embodiment the database is part of another system such as a profile in an email system or a social or business networking system. Consistent with embodiments of the invention that are used in connection with a social or business networking service and as described in detail throughout this disclosure a social or business networking service includes member profiles and in an embodiment the necessary logic to identify member profiles for a variety of reasons such as identifying member profiles that are similar to a given member profile. In yet another embodiment the database is either a stand alone database or a database that is part of another system and it is further linked to the other system via a network or other similar means. In any of these embodiments the database includes audio clips of pronunciations of names of persons in the database although all persons in the database need not have an audio clip associated with them. However in a typical embodiment at least a first person in the database has associated with him or her an audio clip of the pronunciation of the first person s name.

At it is determined from a calendar database or similar database that a second person has an event in common with the first person. The calendar database can be part of the database referred to in the previous paragraph or it can be a separate database. At an indication is transmitted to a device associated with a second person that the database includes the pronunciation of the name of the first person. This indication can be in any form known to those of skill in the art such as an instant message an email message an audible signal played at a device associated with the second person or other indication. At the pronunciation of the first person s name is then output via the device associated with the second person. The pronunciation output can be automatic such as in connection with an instant message or it can be in response to some action by the second person such as clicking on a user interface element or reading an email message.

In another embodiment the system method or computer storage device allows for the first person to provide the correct pronunciation of his or her name. Specifically as illustrated at input of the pronunciation of the name of the first person is received from the first person. As indicated below this input can be received in several different ways. Referring to at the input of the correct pronunciation of the first person s name is received based on the ethnicity of the first person s name and a geographical location that is associated with the first person. For example if the name of the first person is of Russian origin and the first person is living and working in another country that is not familiar with Russian names that person will be requested encouraged and or required to provide the correct pronunciation of his or her name. In an embodiment after supplying the correct pronunciation of his or her name the pronunciation of the first person s name as provided by the first person can be played back to the first person. The first person can then either indicate that the pronunciation is acceptable at which point the pronunciation will be stored as the audio clip or the first person can indicate that he or she would like to re pronounce his or her name before it is stored as the audio clip. In another embodiment the first person is permitted to record and store an alternate pronunciation s of his or her name.

At the input received from the first person is stored in a database. The input can then be associated with a profile of the first person. The database or profile can be part of an email system an online social network or an online business network. The general structure and features of an online social or business network are described below in connection with .

At the second person requests to receive an output of the correct pronunciation of the first person s name. As noted above this request can be via any form known to those skilled in the art that is associated with a device and in particular a mobile device of the second person.

As indicated above at the input of the correct pronunciation of the first person s name is received based on the ethnicity of the first person s name and a geographical location that is associated with the first person. In another embodiment as illustrated at the name pronunciation system analyzes data within the profile associated with the first person and identifies the first person as having a difficult name to pronounce based on the analysis. This analysis can take one or more of several forms. For example at the first person s name is compared against a database of names that are not difficult to pronounce. For example for persons living in the United States names such as Brown Smith and Jones are not considered difficult to pronounce so such names would not necessarily have an audio clip associated with them. However in other portions of the world names that are considered common or easy to pronounce in the United States may be considered difficult to pronounce in other parts of the world. Such factors and considerations can be programmed into the name pronunciation system. As indicated at this analysis can invoke the use of the profile associated with the first person and this profile can include information such as a given name a surname a citizenship a location of a residence a nationality and an ethnicity of the surname. With this profile information the name pronunciation system can for example compare the surname of the person and the residence of the person. So once again if the person s profile indicating a Russian surname also indicates that that person has a residence in Des Moines Iowa this could indicate that the pronunciation of the person s name should be provided. As another example the system can determine if the first person s name has a string of multiple consecutive consonants which the system can then flag as difficult to pronounce. As indicated at the profile of the first person is associated with an email account of the first person. In such an embodiment where the person s profile is linked to a person s email account the email account can be linked to an audio recording website as indicated at . Such an audio recording website can record the correct pronunciation of the person s name and store the recordation of the person s name in the audio clip. At such an email system can prompt the first person to record the first person s name upon logging into the email account. In another embodiment the profile associated with the first person includes a length of a given name of the first person and a length of a surname of the first person as indicated at . Using this information the name pronunciation system can determine which names may be considered difficult to pronounce with the assumption that longer names are generally more difficult to pronounce than shorter names.

At the name pronunciation system can notify a second person of the pronunciation of the first person s name as a function of one or more of a location of the second person a time of day a location of an upcoming event and a time of the upcoming event. In a particular embodiment this can be implemented using a calendar system. A typical calendar system is associated with an email system or a social or business networking system and records appointments and reminds system users of those appointments. At the notification includes a link to an audio clip to play the pronunciation of the first person s name.

In another embodiment the name pronunciation system can include a coupling to an automatic telephone system. Specifically at the name pronunciation system initiates a telephone call to the first person. At the first person is prompted to pronounce his or her name. At the first person s name as spoken by the first person is recorded for example in the above mentioned database. At the first person s name as spoken by the first person is stored in the audio clip.

In yet another embodiment the name pronunciation system includes a text transcription module. Specifically at the text transcription module transcribes the name of the first person into an audible pronunciation of the name of the first person. This transcription is normally a machine implemented pronunciation. The text transcription module can then store the audible pronunciation of the name of the first person in the audio clip.

In yet another embodiment the database can be independently queried for the correct pronunciation of a name without any coupling or connection to an email system or a calendar system. For example as indicated as a person can input into the name pronunciation system a text version of a person s name geographic name or any other word. The name pronunciation system then searches the database for the text name at . At the name pronunciation system outputs the audio clip of the text name via a text transcription module.

At the name pronunciation system stores in the profile the meaning of a person s name and the system makes available the name s meaning to the second person. For example in some cultures people are not given names that serve only as names for persons such as Peter David Johnathan etc. although even these names can have some meaning associated with them such as beloved for David . Rather they are given names using a combination of one or more words from the language or culture such as strong big and man such that a person s name may literally mean big strong man . In either or any situation the name pronunciation system can be configured to provide to users of the system the meanings of names.

As shown in the front end consists of a user interface module e.g. a web server which receives requests from various client computing devices and communicates appropriate responses to the requesting client devices. For example the user interface module s may receive requests in the form of Hypertext Transport Protocol HTTP requests or other web based application programming interface API requests. The application logic layer includes various application server modules which in conjunction with the user interface module s generate various user interfaces e.g. web pages with data retrieved from various data sources in the data layer. With some embodiments individual application server modules are used to implement the functionality associated with various services and features of the social networking service. For instance the ability to identify member profiles similar to a user selected source member profile a service that may be recognized by the name People Like This or Profiles Similar to This may be a service implemented in an independent application server module . A recommendation engine can identify similarities between different recommendation entity types e.g. such as member profiles job listings groups advertisements and so forth consistent with some embodiments of the invention. The name pronunciation system can be implemented via the audio clip engine which can be implemented as a stand alone audio clip engine or which can be embodied in the application server modules .

As shown in the data layer includes several databases such as a database for storing recommendation entity data for example such as member profiles job listings interest groups companies advertisements events news discussions tweets questions and answers and so forth. With some embodiments the recommendation entity data is processed in the background e.g. offline to generate pre processed entity data that can be used by the recommendation engine in real time to make recommendations generally and to identify member profiles similar to a source member profile specifically. For example the recommendation engine may retrieve and process member profile data in the database with reference number to identify member profiles similar to a source member profile. The database with reference number in is shown to be storing application configuration data including one or more configuration files for use with the recommendation engine .

Consistent with some embodiments when a person initially registers to become a user of an email system or a member of a social or business networking service the person will be prompted to provide the correct pronunciation of his or her name along with some personal information such as his or her age e.g. birthdate gender interests contact information home town address the names of the member s spouse and or family members educational background e.g. schools majors etc. employment history skills professional organizations and so on. The correct pronunciation of the person s name can be provided to the audio clip engine and can be stored in the audio clip database . The personal information can be stored for example in the database with reference number .

Once registered on the social or business networking system a member may invite other members or be invited by other members to connect via the social or business networking service. A connection may require a bi lateral agreement by the members such that both members acknowledge the establishment of the connection. Similarly with some embodiments a member may elect to follow another member. In contrast to establishing a connection the concept of following another member typically is a unilateral operation and at least with some embodiments does not require acknowledgement or approval by the member that is being followed. When one member follows another the member who is following may receive automatic notifications about various activities undertaken by the member being followed. These configurations may affect whether or not a correct pronunciation of a person s name is available to another member of the social or business networking system .

The social or business networking service may provide a broad range of other applications and services that allow members the opportunity to share and receive information often customized to the interests of the member. For example with some embodiments the social or business networking service may include a photo sharing application that allows members to upload and share photos with other members. With some embodiments members may be able to self organize into groups or interest groups organized around a subject matter or topic of interest. With some embodiments members may subscribe to or join groups affiliated with one or more companies. For instance with some embodiments members of the social networking service may indicate an affiliation with a company at which they are employed such that news and events pertaining to the company are automatically communicated to the members. With some embodiments members may be allowed to subscribe to receive information concerning companies other than the company with which they are employed. With many of these applications and services one or more recommendation entities are involved. For instance in addition to identifying member profiles that are similar to a source member profile the recommendation engine may be configured and customized to identify groups companies or photos that are likely to be of interest to a particular member. As noted in the previous paragraph these different features and configurations may affect the functionality of the name pronunciation feature.

With some embodiments the client of the audio clip engine may simply be a server side application that is requesting the information from the audio clip engine such as may be the case when the name pronunciation system automatically provides a correct name pronunciation to a user or member of the system based on an upcoming event .
