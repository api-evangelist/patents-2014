title: Throughput for inter-radio access technology handover
abstract: Aspects describe renegotiation of quality of service parameters to resolve maximum bit rate mismatches and/or other quality of service parameter mismatching issues that might arise during an inter-radio access technology handover. At about the same time as a mobile device moves from a source network to a target network, the target network dynamically initiates a quality of service modification procedure. The quality of service modification procedure can help resolve the maximum bit rate mismatches and/or the other quality of service parameter mismatching issues.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 112 655 filed May 20 2011 and entitled IMPROVED THROUGHPUT FOR INTER RADIO ACCESS TECHNOLOGY HANDOVER the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

The subject disclosure relates to wireless communications and more particularly to inter radio access technology mobility.

With increasingly high demand for mobile broadband services network operators are rushing to deploy large scale networks. Such networks include Long Term Evolution LTE networks as well as other types of networks. The services that can be supported on the networks include both data including video and voice.

In some wireless data networks e.g. CDMA2000 EV D Code Division Multiple Access 2000 Evolution Data UMTS Universal Mobile Telecommunication System networks the maximum bit rates available are governed by both settings in the network both core and radio and by a category and or a capability of the mobile device. In some cases the mobile device can support higher maximum bit rates than the network can support and in this case the network sets the upper limit for the maximum bit rate. When the mobile device transitions from a first network e.g. a current network or source network to a second network e.g. target network the second network might be able to support a higher maximum bit rate than the first network was able to support. However since the maximum bit rate has already been set changes cannot be made when the device transitions to the second network. This is the case even if the device can support a higher maximum bit rate that is also supported by the second network. Thus even though available the device cannot take advantage of the higher maximum bit rates which has a direct impact on the user experience.

The above described deficiencies of today s systems are merely intended to provide an overview of some of the problems of conventional systems and are not intended to be exhaustive. Other problems with conventional systems and corresponding benefits of the various non limiting embodiments described herein may become further apparent upon review of the following description.

A simplified summary is provided herein to help enable a basic or general understanding of various aspects of exemplary non limiting embodiments that follow in the more detailed description and the accompanying drawings. This summary is not intended however as an extensive or exhaustive overview. Instead the sole purpose of this summary is to present some concepts related to some exemplary non limiting embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description of the various embodiments that follow.

Various embodiments are configured to enable a capable device to utilize the benefits of higher data rates provided by a target network. When a device moves from a source network to a target network the target network can dynamically initiate a quality of service modification procedure. The quality of service modification procedure can help resolve maximum bit rate and or other quality of service parameter mismatching issues when the device moves between networks.

For example the target network can proactively initiate an upward quality of service negotiation in order to support the device with higher data rates which are supported by the target network. Such benefits can be obtained as part of the inter radio access technology mobility procedure which allows the benefits to be realized at substantially the same time as the device is handed off from the source network and or when the device is registered with the target network.

In various wireless data networks e.g. CDMA2000 EV D UMTS networks the maximum bit rates MBR available are governed by both settings in the network both core and radio and by the category and or capability of a device. For example typical MBR that can be achieved by a device in the uplink direction e.g. from device to network and in the downlink direction e.g. from network to device under ideal radio conditions is normally limited to around 5 Mbps Mega bits per second and about 21 Mbps respectively. In a 3GPP network for example once a mobile device or User Equipment UE Data Session Context is established the MBR rates are recorded in a final negotiated bearer Quality of Service QoS profile stored in a SGSN PDSN Serving General Packet Radio Service GRPS Support Node Packet Data Serving Node . The final negotiated bearer QoS profile is used in subsequent data transmissions. During the inter RAT Radio Access Technology mobility procedure these QoS parameter sets in the source network bearer QoS profile are carried over to the target network e.g. a 4G network in order to maintain session continuity. However the target network may support data rates that are higher or even much higher than the data rates available in the source network. Based on current standards e.g. 4G standards the Mobility Control Nodes e.g. SGSN 4G SGSN MME Mobility Management Entity are not able to modify e.g. upgrade the QoS of a capable device and therefore the device and device user is not able to have the higher target network data rates after the inter RAT mobility procedure.

Thus it would be beneficial to enable a capable device to utilize benefits of higher data rates provided by a target network. Such benefits can be obtained as part of the inter RAT mobility procedure which allows the benefits to be realized at substantially the same time as the device is handed off to the target network.

An aspect relates to an apparatus that includes a receiver component configured to obtain information related to a first set of QoS parameters supported by a source network. The apparatus also includes an evaluation component configured to perform a comparison of the first set of QoS parameters and a second set of QoS parameters supported by a target network and with a capability of a device that moved to the target network from the source network. Further the apparatus includes a context modification component configured to negotiate a third set of QoS parameters as a function of the comparison.

In an implementation the receiver component is further configured to receive an identity of the device a current location of the device and a last location of the device. The context modification component is configured to negotiate the third set of QoS parameters based on the comparison.

In another implementation the apparatus includes a transmitter component configured to convey the third set of QoS parameters to the device. The receiver component is further configured to receive an acknowledgement of the third set of QoS parameters from the device.

In some implementations the apparatus includes a transmitter component configured to convey to the device a maximum bit rate and an allocation retention priority.

In various implementations the first set of QoS parameters includes a first maximum bit rate and the second set of QoS parameters includes a second maximum bit rate. The context modification component is configured to negotiate the third set of QoS parameters based at least in part on an analysis of the first maximum bit rate and the second maximum bit rate performed by the evaluation component.

In a further implementation the context modification component is configured to set a third maximum bit rate of the third set of QoS parameters to a level between the first maximum bit rate and the second maximum bit rate. In some implementations the context modification component is configured to set the third set of QoS parameters to the capability of the device.

According to some implementations the apparatus includes a procedure initiation module configured to initiate a context modification procedure. In other implementations the apparatus includes a data store configured to retain data related to the device the source network and the target network.

According to an aspect is a method that includes obtaining by a target network configured to support a first data rate a first set of QoS parameters associated with a device that moved from a source network configured to support a second data rate lower than the first data rate. The method also includes comparing the first set of QoS parameters with a second set of QoS parameters supported by the target network. Further the method includes negotiating a third set of QoS parameters for the device in the target network.

In an implementation the negotiating the third set of QoS parameters includes determining a capability of the device and setting the third set of QoS parameters to the capability of the device. In some implementations the setting includes setting the third set of QoS parameters at a level that is lower than a level supported by the target network.

In an implementation the method includes initiating a context modification procedure based on the comparing. The context modification procedure is initiated before the negotiating.

According to some implementations the obtaining includes receiving an identity of the device a current location of the device and a last location of the device. In this implementation the comparing includes reviewing the identity the current location and the last location for compatibility. The negotiation is based on the compatibility.

The comparing includes evaluating maximum bit rates included in each of the first set of QoS parameters and the second set of QoS parameters. The negotiation is based in part on the evaluation according to some implementations.

The comparing includes assessing a first allocation retention priority value included in the first set of QoS parameters and a second allocation retention priority value included in the second set of QoS parameters. The negotiation is based on the assessing in accordance with some implementations.

The method also includes transmitting the third set of QoS parameters to the device and receiving from the device an acknowledgement of the third set of QoS parameters in some implementations.

Another aspect relates to a system that includes a first component configured to verify identity information of a device that moved from a source network to a target network. They system also includes a second component configured to compare subscribed quality of service parameters for a packet data session of the target network with original quality of service parameters of the source network. Further the system includes a third component configured to initiate a modification procedure to negotiate a modified quality of service parameter in the target network. A fourth component configured to convey the modified quality of service parameter to the device is also included in the system.

In an implementation the second component is further configured to compare a first maximum bit rate of the subscribed QoS parameters with a second maximum bit rate of the original QoS parameters. The modification procedure is initiated based on a difference between the first maximum bit rate and the second maximum bit rate.

In another implementation the second component is further configured to compare a first set of allocation retention priority values of the subscribed QoS parameters with a second set of allocation retention priority values of the original QoS parameter. The modification procedure is initiated based on a difference between the first set of allocation retention priority values and the second set of allocation retention priority values.

Herein an overview of some of the embodiments for providing improved throughput when a device moves from a first network to a second network when the second network is capable of supporting a higher data rate and also the device is capable of supporting the higher data rate . As a roadmap for what follows next various exemplary non limiting embodiments and features for improved throughput are described in more detail. Then some non limiting implementations and examples are given for additional illustration followed by representative networks and environments in which such embodiments and or features can be implemented.

By way of further description with respect to one or more non limiting ways to provide improved throughput during inter RAT Radio Access Technology mobility procedures a high level block diagram of an exemplary communication system is illustrated generally by . A device can be registered in a source network that is configured to provide a first bit rate level . The device can include a category or a set of capabilities that include among other information data rates that can be supported by the device . The data rates that can be supported by the device might be higher than the first bit rate level supported by the source network . Thus when the device is registered in the source network the device is limited to the first bit rate level supported by the source network .

When the device is moved into a coverage area supported by a different network such as target network a registration procedure is performed between the source network and the target network . As part of the registration procedure the first bit rate level is recorded e.g. in a data store and used by the target network for subsequent data transmissions with the device . However the target network might be able to support a second bit rate level which can have rates that are higher than the rates supported by the first bit rate level . Even though the target network and device can support higher data rates in conventional systems such rates cannot be utilized for subsequent data transmissions and the first bit rate level is instead used.

In accordance with the various aspects disclosed herein the target network is configured to support higher data rates e.g. second bit rate level than the data rates e.g. first bit rate level supported by source network . Thus according to an aspect a sub procedure is performed between the source network and the target network . The sub procedure allows for negotiation of the bits rates. Thus if both the target network and the device can support higher data rates than the rates supported by source network the higher data rates are utilized for subsequent data transmissions. In such a manner the device and device user can benefit from the higher data rates which can increase system speed and enhance a user experience.

In accordance with some aspects source network is configured to support a defined 2G or 3G telecommunication technology and target network is configured to support a defined 4G telecommunication technology. In some aspects source network can be configured to support one of GSM Global System for Mobile Communications UMTS CDMA2000 Ev DO or another technology. Further in some aspects the target network can be configured to support one of HSPA High Speed Packet Access HSPA LTE WiMax Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access or another technology.

In an embodiment the communication system illustrated by can differ in operation from a conventional communication system in order to provide additional benefits over those achievable by systems that employ original Session Context including an original QoS setting.

A User Equipment UE e.g. device powers on under a 2G 3G coverage area e.g. UMTS CDMA2000 EV DO and starts a Registration Procedure. The Registration Procedure can be started when the UE sends a Registration Request to a 2G 3G Radio Access Network RAN which relays the Registration Request to a 2G 3G packet core control node . The UE can convey its identity and its current location e.g. source network identification to the 2G 3G packet core control node .

The 2G 3G packet core control node processes the Registration Request and validates the information received from the UE . Then the 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node e.g. SGSN PDSN sends a Location Update Request to a Home Location Register HLR . The Location Update Request includes the UE identity and the RAT technology where the UE is currently located. In accordance with some aspects the HLR and a Home Subscriber Server HSS can be combined.

The HLR verifies the information in the Location Update Request . The HLR looks up the subscriber database based on the UE identity provided in the Location Update Request and sends the subscription data to the current serving Packet Core Control Node e.g. 2G 3G Packet Core control node . The subscription data includes the services the UE subscribes to and the subscribed QoS for each service. The subscribed QoS is based on the RAT information received from the Location Update Request . In the 2G 3G network the MBR of a data session might be limited to less than about 5 Mbps for the Uplink and less than around 21 Mbps for the downlink.

The 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node sends an acknowledgement ACK to acknowledge the successful receipt of the UE subscription information. The HLR acknowledges ACK the Location Update. The 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node accepts the Location Registration from the UE by sending the Registration ACK to the 2G 3G RAN which relays the Registration ACK to the UE . The initial mobility management procedure ends here.

The UE can start initiating a data session for any particular service by sending an Active Data Session Request to the 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node . The Active Data Session Request can include the Packet Data Network Service Name. The 2G 3G RAN relays the Active Data Session Request from the UE the 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node .

The 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node verifies whether the PDN Packet Data Network Service is authorized. If the PDN Service is authorized by the subscription profile the 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node sets up the data session for the UE with the QoS provided in the subscription. The uplink MBR can be less than about 5 Mbps for the Uplink and less than around 21 Mbps for the downlink. The Packet Core Control Node sends the Acknowledgement of the Active Data Session to the UE . The 2G 3G RAN relays the Data Session Activation Acknowledgement to the UE .

At this point the uplink and the downlink data paths are established and the UE can send and or receive data to from the packet data network.

At the UE moves into a 4G RAN coverage area and initiates a new location registration procedure to register with the 4G network. The UE sends a Location Registration Request to the 4G Packet Core Control Node . The Location Registration Request includes the UE identity the current location of the UE e.g. target network and the last location of the UE e.g. source network . The 4G RAN relays the Location Registration Request to the 4G Packet Core Control Node .

The 4G Packet Core Control Node e.g. 4G SGSN MME verifies the information in the Location Registration Request . Then based on the old location information proved by the UE the new 4G Packet Core Control Node will derive the old 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node and send a UE Context Request to the old 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node . The old 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node verifies the old e.g. source location information and the old e.g. source identity information in the UE Context Request Message. Then the old 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node will forward the UE Mobility Context and Data Session Context to the new 4G Packet Core Control Node for session continuity. The original QoS assignments are included in the Data Session Context transferred. In other words now the 4G Packet Core Control Node has the UE Data Session Context with the uplink limited to less than about 5 Mbps and the downlink limited to less than around 21 Mbps.

The 4G Packet Core Control Node sends an Update Location Request to the HSS . The Update Location request includes the UE identity and the current RAT where the UE resides e.g. target network .

The HSS verifies the UE and sends an Update Location Response with the 4G subscription data to the 4G Packet Core Control Node . Note that in the 4G network the subscription data can be sent within the Update Location Response message. Also note that the HSS HLR may be the same platform.

The 4G Packet Core Control Node saves the subscription data and only verifies the UE identity information and Mobility Management restrictions in the subscription records in this case. Then the 4G Packet Core Control Node uses the original Session Context including QoS setting received from the old 2G 3G Packet Core Control Node for data session continuity. Even though the 4G subscription data indicates that higher MBR rates are possible the 4G packet core will not initiate an upwards QoS negotiation due to the procedure carried over from the standards e.g. legacy 3GPP standards . The 4G Packet Core Control Node sends a Location Registration Accept to the UE . The 4G RAN relays the Location Registration Accept to the UE .

The UE is now registered with the 4G network. However its MBR rates are still limited by the original 2G 3G data rates.

The disclosed aspects can provide improved throughput when a device moves from a source network to a target network. Even though the source network supports a lower data rate than the target network the target network can be configured to renegotiate the data rates. Through the renegotiation the device can be supported by the target network at a higher data rate which can be the data rate supported by the target network or the data rate capabilities of the device if lower than the data rate supported by the target network .

A receiver component is configured to obtain a first set of QoS parameters associated with the device at about the same time as the device moves into the coverage area of the target network . For example device can be registered in source network that supports a geographic area. As the device is moved it can be moved into a geographic area supported by the target network . Based on this movement an inter RAT mobility procedure is initiated.

An evaluation component is configured to compare the first set of QoS parameters with a second set of QoS parameters supported by the target network . The comparison is utilized to determine differences if any between the first set of QoS parameters and the second set of QoS parameters .

Based on the comparison a context modification component is configured to negotiate a third set of QoS Parameters for the device in the target network . In accordance with some aspects the third set of QoS Parameters are substantially the same as the first set of QoS parameters or are substantially the same as the second set of QoS parameters as a function of capabilities of the device . In some aspects the third set of QoS parameters includes a third data rate that is selected as a function of capabilities of the device .

The 4G Packet Core Control Node saves the subscription data. The 4G Packet Core Control Node verifies the identity information and Mobility Management restrictions in the subscription records and compares the subscribed 4G QoS for each Packet Data Session with the original QoS parameters received in the Context Exchange procedure with the 2G 3G core network. If the MBR rates are different and or the Allocation Retention Priority ARP value is different the 4G Packet Core Control Node should prepare for initiation of a QoS modification procedure at about the same time as completion of the Location Registration Procedure. The 4G Packet Core Control Node sends a Location Registration Accept first to the UE . The 4G RAN relays the Location Registration Accept to the UE .

The 4G Packet Core Control Node sends the QoS Modification Request to the UE . The QoS Modification Request includes the MBR parameters and the new data rate value and or the new ARP value . In this example the MBR rates are 4G data rates which can range between about 20 to about 50 or more Mbps Uplink and around 20 to around 100 Mbps Downlink which are higher than the rates that 2G 3G networks can offer. The 4G RAN relays the QoS Modification Request message to the UE .

The UE upgrades its data rates associated with the current active data sessions which have been carried over from the 2G 3G network side. The UE also sends a QoS Modification Acknowledgement to the 4G Packet Core Control Node . The 4G RAN relays the QoS Modification Acknowledgement to the 4G Packet Core Control Node .

Now the UE has completed the registration procedure with the 4G network and both the UE and 4G Packet Core Control Node have been updated specific to the data session QoS settings in order to obtain the full benefit of the 4G network or as much benefit of the 4G network that the device has the capability to support.

Included in system is a receiver component that is configured to receive a first set of QoS parameters associated with a device that moved from a source network or first network . The first set of QoS parameters can include information related to a first data rate. In accordance with some aspects the first set of QoS parameters can include information related to QoS parameter mismatching issues which can include a mapped Allocation Retention Priority value throughput differences and or service class mismatching for example.

In accordance with some aspects the receiver component is configured to receive an identity of the mobile device. The receiver component is also configured to receive information related to a current location of the device and a last location of the device. In accordance with some aspects the last location is the source network and the current location is the target network.

Also included in system is an evaluation component configured to compare the first set of QoS parameters with a second set of QoS parameters supported by system . In accordance with some aspects the evaluation component includes a verification module that is configured to review the identity of the mobile device the current location and the last location for compatibility. For example the review by the verification module can reveal if the device has the capability to support a higher data rate supported by the current location a data rate supported by the last location or can support a data rate there between.

In accordance with some aspects the evaluation component includes an evaluation module that is configured to evaluate a first maximum bit rate 1st MBR included in the first set of QoS Parameters and a second maximum bit rate 2nd MBR included in the second set of QoS parameters . The evaluation of the maximum bit rates by the evaluation module can be utilized to determine changes that might need to be made to improve a user experience. For example a modification procedure is initiated based on a difference between the 1st MBR and the 2nd MBR .

According to some aspects the evaluation component includes an assessment module that is configured to evaluate a first set of allocation retention priority values included in the first set of QoS parameters with a second set of allocation retention priority values included in the second set of QoS parameters . The allocation retention priority values assessed by the assessment module are utilized to resolve conflicts in demand for network resources. The allocation retention priority values can indicate the priority of an allocation and retention of the services data flow.

For example in a 2G 3G network there can be a limited amount of priority values such as three values. However in 4G for example there can be a larger number of values such as fifteen values. When the device is moved from the 2G 3G network to the 4G network the priorities might not be well aligned and the evaluation can determine the misalignment which can be subsequently corrected.

System also includes a context modification component that is configured to negotiate a third set of QoS parameters for the device. The third set of QoS parameters can include a third maximum bit rate and or a third set of allocation retention priority values .

The context modification component will be discussed further with respect to which illustrates an apparatus configured to provide support for a device that moves from a first network e.g. source network to a second network e.g. target network according to an aspect.

Similar to apparatus includes a receiver component that is configured to obtain various information needed to provide support to the device. Apparatus also includes an evaluation component configured to analyze the various information obtained by receiver component with respect to various information associated with apparatus . Such information can include QoS parameters maximum bit rates allocation retention priority values throughput differences service class mismatching as well as other QoS parameter mismatching issues.

Apparatus also includes a context modification component configured to negotiate a different QoS parameter than the QoS parameter supported by the source network according to an aspect.

Included in context modification component is a procedure initiation module that is configured to initiate a context modification procedure based on the comparison by the evaluation component . Procedure initiation module is configured to initiate the context modification procedure at about the same time as an indication that the device is to register with the target network is received. In accordance with some aspects the context modification procedure can be initiated by procedure initiation module at about the same time as the evaluation component determines that there is an opportunity to increase a bit rate or resolve one or more other mismatches that occur when the device moves from the source network to the target network.

Also included in context modification component is a categorization module that is configured to determine at least one capability of the device. For example the capability of the device can be ascertained based on information associated with the identity of the device as obtained by receiver component .

Also included in context modification component is an adjustment module that is configured to set a third set of QoS parameters to the at least one capability of the device. In accordance with some aspects the adjustment module sets the third set of QoS parameters at a level that is lower than a level supported by the target network. For example the capabilities of the device might be lower than the target network can support but higher than the support provided by the source network. Since the device has capabilities lower than the capabilities of the target network the support provided by the target network is synchronized with the device capabilities.

In accordance with some aspects receiver component receives an identity of the device a current location of the device and a last location of the device. The evaluation component reviews the identity the current location and the last location for compatibility. For example the compatibility can include whether there are differences between one or more of QoS parameters maximum bit rates allocation retention priority values throughput differences service class mismatching as well as other QoS parameter mismatching issues. If there is compatibility e.g. there are no or substantially no differences the device can be supported at about the same level as the device was supported by the source network. However if there are differences detected an adjustment to the support provided to the device can be implemented by a negotiation module .

In accordance with some aspects the evaluation component evaluates maximum bit rates included in each of a first set of QoS parameters and a second set of QoS parameters. In this aspect the negotiation module is configured to perform negotiation based at least in part on the evaluation

In accordance with some aspects apparatus includes a transmitter component configured to convey information to the source network the device other networks and or other devices. In an example transmitter component is configured to convey the third set of QoS parameters to the device. The third set of QoS parameters can include a set of MBR a set of priority and or other parameters. Receiver component can receive from the device an acknowledgement of the third set of QoS parameters e.g. by receiver component .

In accordance with some aspects apparatus can include at least one data store configured to retain one or more parameters associated with the device the source network and or the target network.

By way of example and not limitation the disclosed aspects are configured to resolve a MBR rate and or other QoS parameter mismatching issues when a device moves from a 2G 3G network or other network to a 4G network or other network . After a 4G packet core receives a HSS subscription data the 4G Packet Core Control Node e.g. 4G SGSN MME can compare the subscribed QoS parameters in the 4G network with the QoS parameters received from the 2G 3G network through a context exchange procedure. If there is a discrepancy the 4G Packet Core Control Node can initiate a context modification procedure both towards the device and other Core nodes e.g. Serving Gateway PDN Gateway to renegotiate the QoS parameters in the 4G network following the location registration procedure. Thus the disclosed aspects can proactively initiate an upward QoS negotiation and the device will be able to utilize the 4G network benefits at about the same time as the device registers with the 4G network.

At the first set of QoS parameters are compared with a second set of QoS parameters. If the comparison indicates that the first set of QoS parameters are the same or substantially the same as the second set of QoS parameters no further action is taken. However if the comparison indicates that the first set of QoS parameters are different e.g. higher than the second set of QoS parameters a third set of QoS parameters are negotiated at .

The negotiation can take into consideration the capabilities of the device. For example if the capabilities of the device cannot support the first set of QoS parameters a different set of QoS parameters are negotiated that the device can support. However if the device has the capability to support the first set of QoS parameters then the first set of QoS parameters are utilized to support the device.

At the first set of QoS parameters are compared with a second set of QoS parameters supported by a target network. At a context modification procedure can be initiated based on the comparison performed at . A third set of QoS parameters is negotiated at . In accordance with some aspects negotiating the third set of QoS parameters can include determining at least one category and or capability of the device and setting the third set of QoS parameters to the at least one capability or category of the device. In some aspects setting the third set of QoS parameters can include setting the third set of QoS parameters at a level that is lower than a level supported by the target network.

In accordance with some aspects obtaining the first set of parameters at includes receiving an identity of the device a current location of the device and a last location of the device. In this aspect the comparison at includes reviewing the identity the current location and the last location for compatibility. Further the negotiation at is based at least in part on the compatibility determination.

According to some aspects the comparison at includes evaluating maximum bit rates included in each of the first set of QoS parameters and the second set of QoS parameters. In this aspect the negotiation at is based at least in part on the evaluation.

In some aspects the comparison at includes assessing a first allocation retention priority value included in the first set of QoS parameters and a second allocation retention priority value included in the second set of QoS parameters. In this aspect the negotiation at is based at least in part on the assessment.

At the third set of QoS parameters are transmitted to the device. An acknowledgement of the third set of QoS parameters is received from the device at . In an aspect the third set of QoS Parameters are substantially the same as the first set of QoS parameters as a function of the one or more device capabilities. In another aspect the third set of QoS parameters are substantially the same as the second set of QoS parameters based on the one or more device capabilities. In a further aspect the third set of QoS parameters includes a data rate that is selected as a function of capabilities of the device. The data rate is different from a rate supported by the source network and the rate supported by the target network according to an aspect.

At operation at a second bit rate occurs in the second network. For example the first bit rate can be a bit rate supported by the first network and the second bit rate can be a bit rate supported by the second network. In an example the second bit rate has a higher or faster capacity than the first bit rate. In another example the second bit rate has a value that is higher than the first bit rate but lower than a bit rate that can be supported by the second network e.g. if the device capability and or category does not support a higher bit rate that is supported by the second network .

Operating at the second bit rate at can occur after a QoS request from the target network is received and an acknowledgement of the QoS request is transmitted to the target network.

As discussed herein the disclosed aspects can enable a capable device to utilize benefits of higher data rates offered by a network at about the same time as the device registers with the network. For example the device can move from a first network that supports a first data rate to a second network that supports a second data rate which is faster than the first data rate . At about the same time as the device moves into the second network the second network can automatically initiate a quality of service modification procedure.

By way of further description with respect to one or more non limiting ways to provide improved throughput for inter radio access technology handover is a schematic example wireless environment that can operate in accordance with aspects described herein. In particular example wireless environment illustrates a set of wireless network macro cells. Three coverage macro cells and comprise the illustrative wireless environment however it should be appreciated that wireless cellular network deployments can encompass any number of macro cells for example coverage macro cells. Coverage macro cells and are illustrated as hexagons however coverage cells can adopt other geometries generally dictated by a deployment configuration or floor plan geographic areas to be covered and so on. Each macro cell and is sectorized in a 2 3 configuration in which each macro cell includes three sectors demarcated with dashed lines in .
