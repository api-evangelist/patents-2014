Sealing rings also known as annular seals or O rings are widely used in industrial automotive and machinery applications. Typical sealing rings are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2 392 182 7 857 322 3 288 475 3 052 478 2 888 281 2 841 429 3 228 705 3 047 301 3 183 008 3 612 551 and 5 002 290 U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20130113165 European Patent No. EP0806594 and Chinese Patent No. CN201047442.

A common prior art technique of accomplishing bidirectional sealing entails the use of two C seals or spring energized seals facing back to back to handle pressure on the inner diameter or the outer diameter. Each seal must be positioned in a separate groove to provide support from the pressure on the opposite side of the seal. Positioning the seals in separate grooves is necessary because if the seals were positioned in the same groove the seals would slide into each other thereby compromising the sealing integrity of both seals.

The present invention is a sealing ring having in a diametrical cross section a body section and a first pair of sealing legs and that extend outwardly from and are integral with the body section and are angularly spaced apart by a first angle. The sealing ring further includes in the diametrical cross section a second pair of sealing legs and that extend outwardly from and are integral with the body section and are spaced apart by a second angle. Each sealing leg and extends to a beveled end and respectively which is configured to form a seal with a surface when the sealing ring is subjected to compression or compressive stress. Sealing legs and are substantially coplanar. Sealing legs and are substantially coplanar. The plane in which sealing legs and are lying intersects the plane in which sealing legs and are lying. Stated another way the plane of sealing legs and intersect the plane of sealing legs and . Sealing ring further comprises in the diametrical cross section a first centering leg that outwardly extends from and is integral with the body section and is located between and angularly spaced apart from sealing leg and sealing leg and a second centering leg that outwardly extends from and is integral with the body section and is located between and angularly spaced apart from sealing leg and sealing leg . The first and second centering legs and are substantially coplanar. When sealing ring is positioned in annular groove the first and second centering legs and center the sealing ring and limit the lateral movement of the sealing ring .

Referring to each beveled end and of each sealing leg and respectively is beveled in accordance with a predetermined bevel angle . Sealing ring is fabricated from a material that provides sealing ring with a degree of resiliency such that when sealing ring is subjected to compression or a compressive stress there is a slight deformation in sealing legs and that causes the entire surface of each beveled end and respectively to fully contact and become flush with the channel walls or other surfaces that confront the beveled ends and . This is illustrated in . Sealing ring is disposed within a channel or groove and is subjected to a compressive force created by components and . As a result of this force and the degree of resiliency of sealing ring the entire surface of each beveled end and fully contacts and becomes flush with surface of component and the entire surface of each beveled end and fully contacts and becomes flush with surface of component thereby creating a high integrity seal between components and . In one embodiment the predetermined bevel angle is seven degrees.

Referring to sealing ring has a free height FH which is the maximum height of sealing ring when sealing ring is uninstalled and not subjected to any compression or compressive forces. The free height FH may be measured between edge of sealing leg and edge of sealing leg .

The design and configuration of sealing ring allows sealing ring to be used in situations wherein there are two sources of pressure one on either side of sealing ring wherein each source of pressure could be positive pressure or negative pressure. Examples of positive pressure are positive hydraulic pressure hydrostatic pressure pneumatic pressure or a positive vacuum pressure. The positive pressure would be on both the inner diameter and outer diameter of the sealing ring . An example of negative pressure is a negative vacuum pressure. Typical applications for sealing ring include offshore drilling wells wherein there would be hydrostatic pressure on one side of sealing ring and oil pressure on the other side of sealing ring . For positive pressure sealing the pressure is on the inner and outer diameters to pressure energize sealing ring . For negative vacuum pressures the negative pressure may be on either side of sealing ring . An application wherein the negative pressure may be on either side of sealing ring is a retort wherein there is vacuum pressure on the outer diameter or inner diameter and positive pressure on the opposite side of sealing ring . An example of positive pressure is atmospheric pressure or higher pressure. Sealing ring may also be used as a redundant seal that functions as a back up seal in the event the first seal fails. Sealing ring requires only a single groove channel or cavity in contrast to the prior art C seals or spring energized seals. Centering legs and locate sealing ring relative to the channel groove or cavity to prevent sealing ring from sliding and the loss of sealing integrity with pressure or variations in pressure on the outer diameter or the inner diameter. Sealing ring has sufficient stiffness to prevent seal leakage and to prevent sealing ring from being de energized.
