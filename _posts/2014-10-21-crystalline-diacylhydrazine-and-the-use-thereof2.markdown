Host cell transformation is well known in the art and may be achieved by a variety of methods including but not limited to electroporation viral infection plasmid or vector transfection non viral vector mediated transfection mediated transformation particle bombardment and the like. Expression of desired gene products involves culturing the transformed host cells under suitable conditions and inducing expression of the transformed gene. Culture conditions and gene expression protocols in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are well known in the art. Cells may be harvested and the gene products isolated according to protocols specific for the gene product.

In addition a host cell may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted polynucleotide or modifies and processes the polypeptide product in the specific fashion desired. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. glycosylation cleavage e.g. of signal sequence of proteins. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the desired modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. For example expression in a bacterial system can be used to produce a non glycosylated core protein product. However a polypeptide expressed in bacteria may not be properly folded. Expression in yeast can produce a glycosylated product. Expression in eukaryotic cells can increase the likelihood of native glycosylation and folding of a heterologous protein. Moreover expression in mammalian cells can provide a tool for reconstituting or constituting the polypeptide s activity. Furthermore different vector host expression systems may affect processing reactions such as proteolytic cleavages to a different extent.

Two or more individually operable gene regulation systems are said to be orthogonal when a modulation of each of the given gene switches by its respective ligand results in a measurable change in the magnitude of expression of the gene that is regulated by that gene switch and b the change is statistically significantly different than the change in expression of all other gene switches that are in the host cell. In one embodiment regulation of each individually operable gene switch system effects a change in gene expression at least 2 fold 3 fold 4 fold 5 fold 10 fold 20 fold 50 fold 70 fold 100 fold 200 fold 300 fold 400 fold or 500 fold greater than all of the other operable gene switches in the host cell.

Table 7 lists the PXRD peak positions peak intensities and d values of Compound I Form VIII. TG FTIR investigation showed a loss of 63.0 wt. benzyl alcohol from 25 C. 250 C.

The solvent based experiments are in principle thermodynamic stability tests between Compound 1 Forms II and III because mixtures of both forms were suspended. Below 45 C. Form III is the more stable form in 3 2 v v n heptane toluene. Above 55 C. Form II is the more stable form in 3 2 v v n heptane toluene. At 50 C. a mixture of both Form II and Form III was obtained in 3 2 v v n heptane toluene. This is not unexpected. Close to the transition temperature the thermodynamic driving force would be expected to be very small leading to slow transition rates. Possibly the kinetics of transformation were too slow for the transformation to occur on the timescale of the experiment. According to these suspension equilibration experiments Form II and Form III are enantiotropic polymorphs. The thermodynamic transition temperature between Form II and Form III is between 45 C. and 55 C.

The safety tolerance transgene function and immunological effects of intratumoral injection s of adenoviral transduced autologous dendritic cells engineered to express hIL 12 and one or more other immunodulators under control of the RTS in human subjects with stage III and IV melanoma is evaluated through procedures such as those described below.

A study involving study human subjects with stage III and IV melanoma is conducted in 4 cohorts groups of subjects each subject receiving a single intratumoral injection into a melanoma tumor of adenoviral transduced autologous reinserted into the same subject that they came from dendritic cells DCs engineered to express human interleukin 12 hIL 12 and one or more other immunodulators at a dose of 5 10in combination with daily oral doses of one or more crystalline polymorphic forms of Compound 1 or a composition thereof referred to collectively in this example as the activator drug . The study will use injections of dendritic cells transduced ex vivo after the cells are removed from the subjects with adenoviral vector for inducible expression of human IL 12 and one or more other immunodulators. The production of IL 12 and the one or more or other immunomodulators is turned on induced from the injected DCs through the activation of the RTS by the oral administration of the activator drug. Safety and tolerance is assessed through physical examinations including ECOG performance status vital signs measurements serum chemistry urinalysis hematology adverse events side effects and antibodies and cellular immune response to the adenovirus components of RTS and the activator drug. To evaluate progress single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics ADME of the activator drug analysis of hIL 12 levels other immunomodulator levels and cellular immune response T cells in biopsies of the target tumors draining lymph nodes and peripheral circulation as well as a serum cytokine profile is measured.

For instance 16 subjects with stage III and IV melanoma are divided into four cohorts with cohorts 1 and 2 containing three subjects and cohorts 3 and 4 containing 5 subjects. All subjects will receive a single intratumoral injection of 5 10autologous DC transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human IL 12 and one or more other immunodulators under the RTS control. For example the subjects are administered an intratumoral injection of autologous DC transduced with adenoviral vector encoding human IL 12 under the RTS control and an immunomodulator such as IL 15 or IL 21.

The subjects will receive a single daily oral dose of the activator drug cohort 1 0.01 mg kg cohort 2 0.1 mg kg cohort 3 1.0 mg kg or cohort 4 3 mg kg the first dose starting approximately 3 hours prior to the DC injection on day 1 and continuing for 13 more consecutive days. Additional injection s of adenovirally transduced autologous dendritic cells in combination with 14 single once daily oral doses of activator drug may be administered to eligible subjects who meet the criteria for retreatment. Safety tolerance and dendritic cell function are assessed for all subjects in each group of cohort 1 for up to one month after injection of the in vitro engineered dendritic cells before enrolling subjects to receive the next highest dose of the activator drug. The safety assessment will continue in all subjects for 3 months after the initial injection of the engineered dendritic cells with the possibility of extending the follow up period to a total of six months to monitor subject safety if toxicity is observed or the subject receives additional injection s of the dendritic cells.

Such a study demonstrates the safety and tolerance of a single or multiple intratumoral injection s of adenoviral transduced autologous dendritic cells in combination with the oral activator drug in subjects with melanoma. The study provides steady state pharmacokinetics ADME of the oral activator drug. The study demonstrates functionality of the RTS in subjects by measuring hIL 12 expression and the expression of the one or more other immunomodulators of adenovirus transduced autologous dendritic cells in target tumor and or draining lymph nodes in response to the activation of the RTS by the oral administration of the activator drug. Furthermore the study demonstrates the immunological effects of the adenoviral transduced autologous dendritic cells in terms of the cellular immune response in the target tumor draining lymph nodes and peripheral circulation following oral administration of the activator drug.
