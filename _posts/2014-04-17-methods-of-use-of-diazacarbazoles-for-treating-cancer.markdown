The invention relates to 1 7 diazacarbazole compounds which are useful as kinase inhibitors more specifically useful as checkpoint kinase 1 chk1 inhibitors thus useful as cancer therapeutics. The invention also relates to compositions more specifically pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of using the same to treat various forms of cancer and hyperproliferative disorders as well as methods of using the compounds for in vitro in situ and in vivo diagnosis or treatment of mammalian cells or associated pathological conditions.

Individual cells replicate by making an exact copy of their chromosomes and then segregating these into separate cells. This cycle of DNA replication chromosome separation and division is regulated by mechanisms within the cell that maintain the order of the steps and ensure that each step is precisely carried out. Involved in these processes are the cell cycle checkpoints Hartwell et al. Science Nov. 3 1989 246 4930 629 34 where cells may arrest to ensure DNA repair mechanisms have time to operate prior to continuing through the cycle into mitosis. There are two such checkpoints in the cell cycle the G1 S checkpoint that is regulated by p53 and the G2 M checkpoint that is monitored by the serine threonine kinase checkpoint kinase 1 chk1 .

Chk1 and chk2 are structurally unrelated yet functionally overlapping serine threonine kinases activated in response to genotoxic stimuli reviewed in Bartek et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001 vol. 2 pp. 877 886 . Chk1 and chk2 relay the checkpoint signals from the ATM and ATR which phosphorylate and activate them. Chk2 is a stable protein expressed throughout the cell cycle activated mainly by ATM in response to double strand DNA breaks DSBs . In contrast Chk1 protein expression is largely restricted to S and G2 phases. In response to DNA damage ChK1 is phosphorylated and activated by ATM ATR resulting in cell cycle arrest in the S and G2 M phases to allow for repair of DNA damage reviewed in Cancer Cell Bartek and Lukas Volume 3 Issue 5 May 2003 Pages 421 429. Inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to abrogate cell cycle arrest leading to enhanced tumor cell death following DNA damage by a range of chemotherapeutics. Cells lacking intact G1 checkpoints are particularly dependent on S and G2 M checkpoints and are therefore expected to be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic treatment in the presence of a chk1 inhibitor whereas normal cells with functional G1 checkpoints would be predicted to undergo less cell death.

The term package insert is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products that contain information about the indications usage dosage administration contraindications and or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.

The term chiral refers to molecules which have the property of non superimposability of the mirror image partner while the term achiral refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.

The term stereoisomer refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution and connectivity but different orientations of their atoms in space that cannot be interconverted by rotation about single bonds.

 Diastereomer refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties e.g. melting points boiling points spectral properties and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as crystallization electrophoresis and chromatography.

 Enantiomers refer to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non superimposable mirror images of one another.

Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker Ed. 1984 McGraw Hill Book Company New York and Eliel E. and Wilen S. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds John Wiley Sons Inc. New York 1994. The compounds of the invention may contain asymmetric or chiral centers and therefore exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention including but not limited to diastereomers enantiomers and atropisomers as well as mixtures thereof such as racemic mixtures form part of the present invention. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms i.e. they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane polarized light. In describing an optically active compound the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center s . The prefixes d and 1 or and are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane polarized light by the compound with or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50 50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms racemic mixture and racemate refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species devoid of optical activity.

The term tautomer or tautomeric form refers to structural isomers of different energies which are interconvertible via a low energy barrier. For example proton tautomers also known as prototropic tautomers include interconversions via migration of a proton such as keto enol and imine enamine isomerizations. Valence tautomers include interconversions by reorganization of some of the bonding electrons. For example any reference to a structure of 2 hydroxypyridine include its tautomer 2 oxo 1 2 dihydropyridine also known as 2 pyridone and vice versa. Similarly compounds of Formula I a include the tautomeric form i.e. Formula I c and compounds of Formula I b include the tautomeric form i.e. Formula I d .

The phrase pharmaceutically acceptable salt as used herein refers to pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic salts of a compound of the invention. Exemplary salts include but are not limited to sulfate citrate acetate oxalate chloride bromide iodide nitrate bisulfate phosphate acid phosphate isonicotinate lactate salicylate acid citrate tartrate oleate tannate pantothenate bitartrate ascorbate succinate maleate gentisinate fumarate gluconate glucuronate saccharate formate benzoate glutamate methanesulfonate mesylate ethanesulfonate benzenesulfonate p toluenesulfonate pamoate i.e. 1 1 methylene bis 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoate salts alkali metal e.g. sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal e.g. magnesium salts and ammonium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt may involve the inclusion of another molecule such as an acetate ion a succinate ion or other counter ion. The counter ion may be any organic or inorganic moiety that stabilizes the charge on the parent compound. Furthermore a pharmaceutically acceptable salt may have more than one charged atom in its structure. Instances where multiple charged atoms are part of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counter ions. Hence a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and or one or more counter ion.

Aromatic halogen substituents in the compounds may be subjected to halogen metal exchange by treatment with a base for example a lithium base such as n butyl or t butyl lithium optionally at a low temperature e.g. around 78 C. in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran and then quenched with an electrophile to introduce a desired substituent. Thus for example a formyl group may be introduced by using N N dimethylformamide as the electrophile. Aromatic halogen substituents may alternatively be subjected to metal e.g. palladium or copper catalysed reactions to introduce for example acid ester cyano amide aryl heteraryl alkenyl alkynyl thio or amino substituents. Suitable procedures which may be employed include those described by Heck Suzuki Stille Buchwald or Hartwig.

Aromatic halogen substituents may also undergo nucleophilic displacement following reaction with an appropriate nucleophile such as an amine or an alcohol. Advantageously such a reaction may be carried out at elevated temperature in the presence of microwave irradiation.

Administration of the compounds of the present invention hereinafter the active compound s can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes intraduodenal routes parenteral injection including intravenous subcutaneous intramuscular intravascular or infusion topical inhalation and rectal administration.

The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated the severity of the disorder or condition the rate of administration the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day preferably about 1 to about 35 mg kg day in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g day preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g day. In some instances dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.

The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or in combination with one or more chemotherapeutic agents for example those described herein. Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of treatment.

The pharmaceutical composition may for example be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet capsule pill powder sustained release formulations solution suspension for parenteral injection as a sterile solution suspension or emulsion for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents carriers adjuvants etc.

Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions for example aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered if desired.

Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may if desired contain additional ingredients such as flavorings binders excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration tablets containing various excipients such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch alginic.acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose gelatin and acacia. Additionally lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials therefore include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents coloring matters or dyes and if desired emulsifying agents or suspending agents together with diluents such as water ethanol propylene glycol glycerin or combinations thereof.

Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a specific amount of active compound are known or will be apparent to those skilled in this art. For examples see Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Ester Pa. 15.sup.th Edition 1975 .

Full length human mutant recombinant protein histidine tagged and expressed in insect cells is used as source of enzymatic activity Invitrogen chk1 from product PV3982 and chk2 from product PV3983 .

The chk1 AlphaScreen assay is carried out for 30 minutes in the presence of 10 M ATP using biotinylated Akt substrate 1 peptide Cell Signalling Technology product 1065 as a substrate. Phosphorylation of the substrate is detected and quantified using AlphaScreen technology. This consists of an anti phospho Akt substrate 1 antibody Cell Signalling technology Product 9611 and two AlphaScreen beads Perkin Elmer one product coated with Protein A which binds the antibody Ig chain Product 6760137 and one coated with Streptavidin which binds the biotin on the biotinylated Akt substrate peptide 1 Product 6760002 . Chk1 activity results in the production of phosphorylated Akt substrate peptide 1 an event which causes the two bead species to be brought into close proximity in the presence of antibody leading to the generation of luminescence which is detected on a Perkin Elmer reader Fusion .

The ATP Radiometric ChK1 assay is carried out by incubation for 30 minutes in the presence of 10 M ATP containing 0.3 Ci P ATP per sample and using ChKTide peptide sequence KKKVSRSGLYRSPSMPENLNRPR as a substrate. Following acidification with 1 phosphoric acid and washing to remove unincorporated ATP phosphorylation of the substrate is detected and quantified by measurement of radioactivity incorporated using a Perkin Elmer Topcount.

The chk2 AlphaScreen assay is carried out for 30 minutes in the presence of 30 M ATP using biotinylated tyrosine hydroxylase ser 40 peptide Cell Signalling Technology product 1132 as a substrate.

Compounds are tested in a cellular assay using the human colorectal adenocarcinoma derived cell line HT 29 ATCC HTB 38 .

The cell line is maintained in DMEM F12 1 1 media Invitrogen Gibco 31331 supplemented with 10 FCS at 37 C. in a 5 COhumidified incubator.

Cells are seeded in 96 well plates at 30 000 cells well and after 24 h they are exposed to 20 nM SN 38 in 0.4 DMSO. One column of 8 wells on each plate was used to generate a maximum signal control. These cells are treated with 0.4 DMSO without SN 38. Cells are grown for a further 16 h then the media containing DMSO plus or minus SN 38 is removed and replaced with media containing 300 nM nocodazole alone to determine baseline or in combination with ten concentrations of chk1 inhibitor final DMSO concentration is 0.4 . Cells are grown for a further 24 h. The media is removed and replaced with 50 l lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. This buffer contains detergent to bring about cellular disruption. Following complete cellular disruption 25 l lysate is transferred to a MesoScale 96 well 4 spot plate coated with an antibody to Histone H3 MesoScale Discovery MSD Product K110EWA 3 which have been previously blocked with 3 bovine serum albumin in Tris buffered saline. Following the transfer of lysate to the MSD plate Histone H3 in the lysate is captured on the coated antibody by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Following the capture step the plate is washed and then incubated with an antibody to phosphorylated Histone H3 which is conjugated with a Sulfo Tag. This tag gives a signal when in proximity to the electrode on the base of the MSD plate. Binding the tagged antibody to the captured protein allow detection on a MSD reader.

The ECis defined as the concentration at which a given compound achieves 50 decrease of the measured levels of phospho Histone H3 within the range of a normal sigmoidal dose response curve compared to the signal generated by 300 nM nocodazole alone. ECvalues are calculated using the XLfit software package version 2.0.5 or Graphpad Prism version 3.03 fitting a sigmoidal curve with a variable slope.
