This is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 903 880 filed Oct. 13 2010 which is a Continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 009 317 filed Jan. 16 2008 now U.S. Pat. No. 7 818 803 which claims the priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 880 800 filed Jan. 16 2007. These documents and other publications referenced herein are fully incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

The present invention relates to a security module for devices e.g. electronic devices particularly a security module for communicating with an external site for remote monitoring of the devices for purposes such as tracking assets and assisting in the recovery of stolen or lost assets and more particularly a wireless security module for such purposes. Such devices may include without limitations processor controlled devices such as computers and systems which include processor based devices such as photocopiers.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 818 998 assigned to Lo Jack Corporation describes a method for the theft recovery of automobiles in which police tracking vehicles home in on periodic transponder radio transmissions automatically activated by command activation signals broadcast on the same carrier frequency with encoded vehicle identification information that causes the intended vehicle transponder to reply.

GM s OnStar technology provides a generic wireless platform for delivering services to a mobile system. In the case of OnStar the mobile system is an automobile not a user portable device such as a laptop. OnStar can be used for theft recovery and may be used to deliver other services as well. With OnStar a device contacts a remote station upon a user initiated event.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 748 084 relates to an object tracking communication and management system for a laptop computer or similar device wherein a beacon or transceiver in the computer implements file integrity or device recovery steps such as transmitting destroying or encoding sensitive data and emitting a trackable RF signal. A combination of hardware and software within the beacon and the host system initiates and coordinates the operation of communications or security features. For example communication may be initiated by failure to enter a correct password a tampering event or by a broadcast signal to the device. Under normal circumstances the beacon implements a standard communication function for the device such as email voice or fax. Tamper detection logic is implemented in software or hardware. An incoming data call preferably contains low level beacon control commands which are interpreted by the beacon prior to the alerting or passing of the data to the computer. Preferably low level codes operate at the BIOS level for performing emergency functions when higher level software or plug in components have been overridden or removed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 362 736 provides a system for automatically locating a personal electronic object. The system comprises at least two wireless communicators. When security of the system is compromised as determined by a tamper sensor or by a user becoming aware of its theft and access to a computer network or a wireless network is available the location as determined by a GPS device is transmitted through a communicator.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 636 175 discloses an invention which allows a user to locate a remote paging device located on a person or piece of property to determine its physical position. The position of the remote device is determined by a GPS transceiver and is sent to a position service provider. The position of the remote device is then displayed on a map for the user. In one embodiment a Bluetooth communications network is used for example in an amusement park or a shopping mall where Bluetooth hubs can be set up at regular intervals.

U.S. Pat. No. 6 950 946 describes a method for discovering and optionally recovering stolen or lost network attachable computer systems. A network attachable computer system generates identity information which comprises a secure identifier ID which is protected using an encryption key. This identity information is automatically sent via a network interface to a server module where it is used to determine whether the respective computer system is reported lost or stolen. The scheme is preferably implemented in hardware because alternately an operating system OS or software implementation can be modified to deactivate the scheme.

US Patent Application Publication No. 2003 0117316 discloses systems and methods for locating and tracking a wireless device comprising a remote database for storing location information for the wireless device. The systems and methods may include and work in conjunction with a safety mode of the wireless device which directs the wireless device to enter a low power use mode a sleep mode or a shut down mode during periods of device inactivity. An electronic wake up call or a password are preferably required to inactivate or cancel the safety mode.

US Patent Application Publication No. 2006 0123307 discloses a computing platform security apparatus systems and methods. Apparatus and systems as well as methods and articles may operate to receive status from an OS independent module capable of providing OS independent geolocation information associated with a device to a network at some time before executing an operating system. The OS independent module may be attached to co located with or separated from the device.

The foregoing referenced systems share at least a common drawback namely the inability to communicate externally should the existing communication interface becomes unavailable or non functional.

Absolute Software Corporation the assignee of the present invention has developed and is marketing Computrace a product and service that securely tracks assets and recovers lost and stolen assets and AbsoluteTrack a secure asset tracking and inventory management solution powered by the Computrace technology platform. Computrace deploys a stealth agent which is a software client that resides on the hard drive of host computers. Once installed the agent automatically contacts a monitoring center on a regular basis transmitting location information and all auto discovered asset data points. Ongoing communication between the agent and the monitoring center requires no user intervention and is maintained via an Internet or phone connection. As long as the computer is turned on and has either a connection to a telephone line or access to the Internet through an ISP or through a company network the Computrace agent will be able to report asset data to the monitoring center. The user intervention free communication between the agent and a monitoring center ensures the authorized user of the agent to have secure access to up to date location information and comprehensive asset data about their entire computer inventory. Whether used stand alone or as a complement to an existing asset management tool AbsoluteTrack has been a cost effective application service for helping businesses of all sizes monitor remote mobile and desktop computers and perform daily hardware and software inventory tracking functions. Computrace has been an effective tool to track theft of mobile computers and to recovery of stolen mobile computers.

The technology underlying various Computrace products and services have been disclosed and patented in the U.S. and other countries which patents had been commonly assigned to Absolute Software Corporations. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 715 174 5 764 892 5 802 280 6 244 758 6 269 392 6 300 863 and 6 507 914 and related foreign patents. Further information concerning AbsoluteTrack has been published by Absolute Software Corporation e.g. AbsoluteTrack Secure Computer Asset Tracking Solution a white paper published Apr. 25 2003 .

The modes of communication available to the agent directly impact the ability to track the computer. While the Computrace agent is currently able to communicate via an ethernet Wi Fi other internet or phone connections it would be desirable to develop an apparatus which would permit the agent to communicate should these existing connections be unavailable or become unavailable for example due to not using or connecting the computer for an extended period of time. It would be desirable to initiate communications in real time as opposed to a scheduled call. It would also be desirable to communicate if the Computrace agent is unable to do so due to absence of a host OS presence of an unsupported OS presence of a firewall or the host system not being powered. It would be desirable to report on attributes of the OS even if the OS is not running. It would also be desirable to have the ability to wake up the host system and carry out data protection measures or other servicing operations. One or more of these desirable features are provided by the theft recovery and asset tracking system described below.

The invention is directed to a security module deployed in a host device e.g. an electronic device which provides a secondary agent that operates in coordination with the host agent in the host device but operates independently of the host operating system of the host device to independently access existing communication network interface in the host device or a separate dedicated network interface if available. The security module may be deployed in conjunction with services that may include asset tracking asset management asset recovery data delete software deployment etc.

In one aspect the present invention enables robust theft recovery and asset tracking services. The system comprises a monitoring center one or more monitored devices a security module in the monitored devices one or more active communications networks a subscription if needed for at least one communications network. Monitored devices may be stand alone devices such as computers e.g. portable or desktop computers or a device or a subsystem included in a system. A monitored device comprises a security module a host agent and software to support the host agent that runs in the monitored device s OS.

In one embodiment the security module comprises one or more network interfaces or shared access to the host s interfaces an application processor that interfaces with the network persistent storage from which the operating environment or system of the security module or subsystem and applications that run on the application processor are loaded a secondary firmware agent that runs in the operating environment or system running on the application processor persistent storage for use by the firmware agent zero or more location determination technologies such as GPS. The security module may have a network interface which is dedicated to security related communications. One or more of the network interfaces may be a WWAN interface. The security module comprises optional interface hardware and software permitting the security module to cause the booting or resuming of the host OS. The security module may or may not have its own power supply.

The security module or subsystem may or may not provide the functions of a normal cellular data modem including 1 permitting the monitored computer to establish an IP connection and 2 in the case of a security module with a cellular data interface module permitting the monitored computer to send and receive SMS messages.

Preferably the presence and operation of the security module is stealthy or unobvious to the user of the computer. In the case where the security module does not have its own power supply the system as a whole may or may not be designed to provide independent power to the security module.

If required a data subscription is established for the networks available to the security module or subsystem. Alternatively the service is provisioned just in time through interfaces between the monitoring center and communications network.

The security module in accordance with the present invention enables robust theft recovery and asset tracking services with certain behavioral aspects one or more of which may be incorporated in various embodiments of the system. For example the host agent calls the monitoring center on a predetermined schedule or upon an interesting change in the attributes of the monitored computer for example a change in its IP address and it prefers calling the monitoring center on established network connections. The host agent uses network connections that typically have zero or low cost including IP connections over Ethernet or WiFi networks. The host agent and firmware agent interface so that if the host agent is calling normally only the host agent calls. In this respect the firmware agent is like a fail safe or backup communications system.

The host agent and or host agent support software transfers attributes of the monitored computer and OS that would be typically unavailable to an embedded module including the computer s serial numbers the host operating system s type the applications installed in the host operating system etc. This transfer may happen periodically or as a result of a change in one or more of the attributes.

If the host agent does not call for any reason or is disabled the firmware agent will call. Because of the transfer of attributes from the host agent to the security module the firmware agent is able to report to the monitoring center the same attributes that the host agent reports permitting the computer to be identified and the attributes to be uploaded to the monitoring center.

Separate from its regular call capability the host agent is able to send and receive messages to and from the monitoring center. Messages from the monitoring center may for example indicate that the host agent should call the monitoring center to invoke a data protection measure. These messages may be over SMS.

Separate from its regular call capability the firmware agent is also able to independently send and receive messages to and from the monitoring center. Messages from the monitoring center may for example indicate that the firmware agent should wake up the host so that a data protection measure can be invoked.

If a location determination technology is available on the security module or another subsystem then the host agent and or firmware agent may report this position to the monitoring center.

If the host OS is re installed the security module is detected via plug and play or other hardware detection and driver selection process and the driver agent and support software for the security module can be re installed from Windows or other OS installation media and via on line sources for drivers such as Windows Update.

In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention an asset to be protected for example an electronic device such as a laptop computer comprises an agent that executes from the laptop s OS and additionally a wireless security module that can transmit and receive and which may be similar to a regular embedded cellular wireless module. The wireless module comprises firmware which can instruct the module to call a monitoring center independently of the host agent. The firmware may make the call on a regular cellular subscriber channel or on a dedicated security channel.

The monitoring center is able to initiate a request for a subscription for a dormant communications channel. The advantage of this feature is that a user does not have to maintain a cellular communications subscription if it is not required for that user s normal usage of the laptop. In the event of a theft the user can inform the monitoring center of the theft so that just in time provisioning of a wireless communications channel can be made in order for recovery or data protection steps to be taken.

The principal commercial uses of the disclosed technology may include theft recovery of stolen computers and asset tracking management of computers. Since the fundamental characteristics of the technology are to be persistent and difficult to accidentally remove even by authorized users and to have a reliable communications pipe which is dormant and can be brought to life or is repairable the technology can be used for many purposes including guaranteeing the installation of applications of any type. The applications that most benefit from such features are system management applications.

An advantage of the system when implemented in a host system such as a laptop with a cellular radio interface is that it may connect to a monitoring center at any time and place where there is network coverage. It does not have to wait for a wired or WiFi Internet connection to be established. In the case of an independently powered module this advantage is even clearer as communications can be made without having to wait until the laptop is powered on. Communications with the laptop can be made even if there is no OS or an unsupported OS is installed on the host system. It can withstand attacks on the integrity of the host agent. It can circumvent firewalls that might block the host agent.

In accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention the security module may support a wireless communications channel dedicated to security purposes only allowing data and air charges to be billed to a theft recovery service provider. This permits communications even if the subscriber has not acquired personal wireless service or if the subscriber s personal service is terminated for whatever reason including theft of the system. Availability of both a dedicated security channel and a subscriber channel permits the development of logic to select an appropriate communications channel based on cost optimization for both the subscriber and the security monitoring provider. For example the subscriber s channel could be used and the subscriber billed until that channel is unavailable for whatever reason.

The theft recovery and asset tracking system may include or interact with one or more of the various components features and services which have been disclosed and patented in the U.S. and other countries and commonly assigned to Absolute Software Corporation. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 715 174 5 764 892 5 802 280 6 244 758 6 269 392 6 300 863 and 6 507 914 which are hereby fully incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

It is understood that the security module of the present invention may be used for other services such as computer management backup and recovery applications remote data deletion operations etc. without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.

The detailed descriptions that follow are presented largely in terms of methods or processes symbolic representations of operations functionalities and features of the invention. These method descriptions and representations are the means used by those skilled in the art to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. A software implemented method or process is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of steps leading to a desired result. These steps require physical manipulations of physical quantities. Often but not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It will be further appreciated that the line between hardware and software is not always sharp it being understood by those skilled in the art that software implemented processes may be embodied in hardware firmware or software in the form of coded instructions such as in microcode and or in stored programming instructions.

The inventive security module can be deployed in a host device e.g. an electronic device which provides a secondary agent that operates in coordination with the host agent in the host device but operates independent of the host OS of the host device to independently access existing communication network interface in the host device or a separate dedicated network interface if available. The overall system comprises a monitoring center one or more monitored host devices a security module in the monitored host devices one or more communications networks a subscription for at least one communications network.

A monitored device comprises a security module a host agent and software to support the host agent that runs in the monitored device s OS.

The security module of the present invention may be deployed as a component or subsystem that complements existing asset tracking applications. For example the security module may be deployed as a component of the AbsoluteTrack and or Computrace developed by Absolute Software Corporation the assignee of the present invention. Computrace is a product and service that securely tracks assets and recovers lost and stolen assets and AbsoluteTrack a secure asset tracking and asset management asset recovery data delete software deployment etc. solutions powered by the Computrace technology platform. Computrace deploys a stealth agent which is a software client that resides on the hard drive of client computers.

The technology underlying various Computrace products and services have been disclosed and patented in the U.S. and other countries which patents had been commonly assigned to Absolute Software Corporation. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 715 174 5 764 892 5 802 280 6 244 758 6 269 392 6 300 863 and 6 507 914 and related foreign patents. Details of persistent agent and various related services are disclosed in co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 093 180 filed Mar. 28 2005 now published U.S. Patent Publication No. US2005 0216757 which corresponds to PCT Application Publication No. WO 2006 102399 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 386 040 filed Mar. 20 2006 now published U.S. Patent Publication No. US2006 0272020 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 726 352 filed Mar. 20 2007 now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2007 0234427 A1 which corresponds to PCT Application Publication No. WO 2007 109366 .

Further information concerning AbsoluteTrack has been published by Absolute Software Corporation e.g. AbsoluteTrack Secure Computer Asset Tracking Solution a white paper published Apr. 25 2003 . These documents are fully incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

Asset tracking and theft recovery is an example of the services that can be enabled with supported by and or provided with the device identification application of the present invention. The device or asset to be protected by the theft recovery and asset tracking system disclosed herein is referred to as a host. The host may be a laptop computer a cellphone a Blackberry a portable electronic gaming console a personal digital assistant an audio or visual entertainment device medical equipment any system or device which includes a computer any other electronic device or a dedicated electronic tracker for securing electronic or non electronic assets such as motor vehicles boats and goods in transit.

Referring to the asset tracking system in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention involves a client server architecture which may comprise the following main components a host device A consisting of for example any one of the electronic devices shown which have been implanted with an optional persistent host agent and a security module in accordance with the present invention. The host agent and the secondary agent in the security module run in a coordinated manner on the host devices A for the purpose of reporting deploying applications including for example reporting information to and receiving instructions from a remote server to program the host agent to support and execute a desired function. b a communication link B such as an information exchange network which may include switched communications networks the Internet private and public intranet radio networks satellite networks and cable networks and c a host monitoring system C which include a host monitoring server that monitors the communications between the host device A and the host monitoring system C which is contacted on a regular or scheduled basis by the host devices records information from the host devices. The monitoring server also provides instructions to the host on what actions to perform including what actions the host is to perform what data to collect and the hosts next scheduled call time.

In accordance with the present invention the host monitoring system C is configured to communicate with the host agent in the host device A and the secondary agent in the security module in the host device A which remotely determines the identity of the host devices being monitored e.g. by evaluating the data points collected using the device attribute collection application residing in the host devices as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 726 352 filed Mar. 20 2007 now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2007 0234427 A1 which corresponds to PCT Application Publication No. WO 2007 109366 . The host devices A contact the monitoring server via the communication link B. The host monitoring system C may include a reporting and administration portal which provides customers administrators and asset tracking service providers the ability to view data and manage the functions of the monitoring server and the host devices.

With the exception of the inventive security module and the integration of such in the host devices each of the components shown in has been fully disclosed in the copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 386 040 filed Mar. 20 2006 now U.S. Patent Application Publication No. US2006 0272020 which corresponds to PCT Application Publication No. WO 2006 102399 .

Host devices A that are implemented with the inventive security module in accordance with the present invention include may be selectively operated activated or configured by a program application routine and or a sequence of instructions and or logic stored in the devices in addition to the base host operating systems resident in the devices. In short use of the methods described and suggested herein is not limited to a particular processing configuration. By way of example and not limitation the present invention is described in reference to examples of deployments and implementations in reference to a laptop or notebook computer as the host device A computer A is schematically represented as a desktop device but may instead comprise a portable computing device .

Communication links B includes any form of information exchange networks in which the present invention may be deployed for asset tracking. The information exchange network accessed by the host device including the security module in accordance with the present invention may involve without limitation distributed information exchange networks such as public and private computer networks e.g. Internet Intranet WWAN WAN LAN etc. value added networks communications networks e.g. wired or wireless networks broadcast networks cable networks cellular network radio networks and a homogeneous or heterogeneous combination of such networks. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the networks include both hardware and software and can be viewed as either or both according to which description is most helpful for a particular purpose. For example the network can be described as a set of hardware nodes that can be interconnected by a communications facility or alternatively as the communications facility or alternatively as the communications facility itself with or without the nodes. It will be further appreciated that the line between hardware firmware and software is not always sharp it being understood by those skilled in the art that such networks and communications facility and the components of the persistent agent technology platform involve software firmware and hardware aspects.

The various parts of the theft recovery and asset tracking system that employs a security module and in particular a wireless security module devices comprising the security module and modes of operation will now be described in more detail. As a descriptive example a laptop computer is used as the device to be protected and in the present application is defined to be the host to the wireless security module and the various software and firmware agents included in the security system. Parts of the system include a host the security module a persistent host agent a firmware agent supporting software and a monitoring center.

Support software in the form of computer readable instructions in or on a computer readable medium is stored in the host. The support software comprises a driver and an application programming interface API layer to interface the wireless module with the host. Both the driver and API are based on the standard driver for a cellular wireless module but extended in the following ways. The API is extended to support the additional APIs required to interface with the firmware agent. The API is extended to support access to the attribute storage on the security module. The API is extended to permit only trusted applications to invoke sensitive functions of the security module including each of the above API extensions. If the security module supports use of a dedicated OTA security communications channel the API and driver are extended to allow trusted applications to create manage and use the dedicated security communications channel.

Three main components interact to facilitate the asset tracking and theft recovery functions including a security module a primary host agent and a monitoring center.

The general attributes of the security module or subsystem are a secondary agent in the form of a firmware agent for example or in other form loaded from persistent application storage a network interface and data storage for the firmware agent to read from and write to. The secondary agent is enabled with specific functions dedicated to coordinating with the host agent to communicate externally and related functions further described herein. The firmware agent in the security module or security subsystem may run on the application processor of a cellular wireless module but it may instead reside elsewhere in the monitored computer. Other suitable locations include a separate processor on the motherboard or on a board separate from the motherboard. The firmware agent has access to persistent data storage to which it may read and write.

The firmware whether located in the wireless module or elsewhere may or may not be extended to support a dedicated OTA security communications channel. The firmware includes a firmware agent which can trigger a wireless call to a monitoring center independently of a host agent implemented in the OS. Using the stored attributes in the persistent data storage to which it has access the firmware agent can act as a surrogate of the host agent.

The host interface firmware supports mechanisms to configure and use the security communications channel interface with and control the firmware security agent and store attributes of the host computer on the security module. In each case these mechanisms are themselves protected with security measures to ensure that the security communications channel can only be used by authorized applications.

The security module comprises one or more network interfaces or shared access to the host s interfaces. The security module may have a network interface which is dedicated to security related communications. One or more of the network interfaces may be a WWAN interface.

The security module comprises optional interface hardware and software permitting the security module to cause the booting or resuming of the host OS.

In accordance with the present invention there are a number of different physical forms the wireless security module can take as follows 

This module is a hardware module that can be incorporated into hosts such as highly portable computers. It implements functions similar to a regular embedded cellular wireless module. In fact unless the security features of the present invention are enabled the module operates uniquely like a regular embedded cellular wireless module.

The wireless security module may support one or two independently billable communications channels. One way of achieving two independently billable channels is for the module to behave like two independent cellular devices with separate equipment identifiers. To switch between channels the module deregisters from the current network to which it is subscribed and then subsequently reregisters on the network or a different network with a different equipment ID. Alternatively the module may simply support two entirely separate base bands each reporting different equipment identifiers. Alternatively a completely different mechanism may be used to permit independent billing of the communications. In another alternative the module may be configured or be configurable to support future OTA protocols that permit one cellular wireless module with one equipment identifier to support multiple independently billed data channels.

Various laptops are available from the OEMs include cellular modems aka mobile broadband modules etc. . E.g. www.dell.com www.hp.com www.lenovo.com etc. These modules usually have two processors most commonly now on the same die . See also Broadcom Corporation published Product Brief Publication No. BCM2133 PB07 D1 Nov. 30 2006 http www.broadcom.com collateral pb 2133 PB07 R.pdf . The firmware agent would typically run on the application processor on the module.

This has the same functionality as i except that the hardware chip or chips are located on a motherboard rather than in a module.

In this case the functionality of the security module or subsystem is incorporated in a processor which is separate from the main processor of the laptop. For example it may be incorporated in a separate processor that can inject and filter packets into and out of the host s network controller. An example of a such an embodiment could comprise the secondary agent running as a service in the Management Engine firmware framework within the Intel AMT architecture See published Sep. 19 2007. http softwarecommunity.intel.com articies eng 1032.htm. In AMT the second processor runs on auxiliary power.

In this case the functionality of the security module or subsystem runs in a virtual environment on the main processor of the computer. The host OS runs as normal and is completely unaware of the security environment and firmware agent. For further information concerning virtualization see http www.virtualization.org Virtualization Introduction to Virtuaization.html . The firmware agent could run as part of the hypervisor or in a completely separate OS instance.

In accordance with one embodiment the host agent is a tamper resistant client module embodied in inside the host. In the present application it refers to an agent that runs from the host OS. The host OS supports running of user applications for the device e.g. a computer running Microsoft OS a cell phone running Symbian OS etc. In prior art the host agent or components of it may be referred to an agent an intelligent agent a transparent agent a segmented agent a persistent agent a servicing agent a tamper resistant servicing agent an application agent a tracking agent a stealth agent an extensible agent a calling agent a full function driver agent a partial driver agent a Computrace agent or other similar terms.

The host agent calls the monitoring center periodically or when an interesting change occurs on the monitored computer. During the call it may report on the attributes of the monitored computer and may include attributes to establish a cellular data connection if necessary.

The host agent detects the presence of the security module or subsystem installs the required interfacing and support software and interfaces with and controls it. This includes synchronizing calling behaviour so that normally only the host agent calls the monitoring center and the firmware agent does not. But it may be desirable to permit the firmware agent to call the monitoring center on occasion to verify correct operation of the system. It also includes transferring attributes to the host agent.

If the security module includes a cellular interface the host agent can send and receive SMS messages using this interface. The monitoring center can ask the host agent to bring up a cellular data connection via an SMS message.

The host agent also provides sufficient information to a monitoring center in order for the monitoring center to activate a subscription to a security communications channel if and when such a channel becomes necessary. This includes for example providing the unique equipment identifier of the wireless module.

In another embodiment of the present invention the agent uses the security communication channel only if necessary for reporting location of the host or for carrying out urgent or important servicing tasks. In one mode the security communication channel is only employed if a subscriber channel is unavailable for whatever reason such that service and overhead expenses incurred by a monitoring center are kept to a minimum. In one embodiment the agent is configured to establish a cellular data connection under special circumstances for example if attempts to connect via the internet have been unsuccessful for more than a predetermined time period. Other operational modes can also be envisioned.

In one embodiment the agent supports calls initiated by a monitoring center rather than having the monitoring center wait for a scheduled call from the host. The monitoring center may initiate a data call to allow the agent to communicate over a cellular network rather than via the internet. In order for cost optimization the monitoring center may transmit a Short Message Service SMS call which triggers the firmware agent to initiate a host originated call. Such an SMS call or essentially similar type of call may cause the firmware agent to wake up the host and allow the host agent to make a call.

The agent may be in a passive mode an active mode or in alert mode. In the passive mode the agent is present but does not do anything until activated by the user establishing a subscription for security monitoring or asset tracking. In the active mode the agent calls out to the monitoring center at regular predetermined or random intervals. In the alert mode the host has been stolen and the agent has been given an instruction by the monitoring center to call in more frequently or carry out protective tasks such as data encryption.

In accordance with the present invention the monitoring center is configured to communicate with the host device network interface access of which is managed by the host agent in coordination with the secondary agent in the security module. Monitoring centers are sometimes also referred to using other terms including a remote station remote server server host monitoring system host system remote host system and monitoring server.

In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention a typical monitoring centre may comprise call servers and software web servers and web applications database servers and databases authentication systems administrative systems and back end processing systems. A monitoring center can take calls from host agents over various bearer services such as IP or PSTN and can identify computers determine their licensing level and record their attributes and location install and update software on monitored computers and set up data delete services and theft recovery tools. A monitoring centre can provide a web interface for users to generate reports of their monitored assets and their locations.

Further the monitoring center of the present theft recovery and asset tracking system comprises one or more new features. These include interfaces with gateways for SMS messaging for example which allow the initiation of theft recovery operations earlier than if the monitoring center waited for the devices to be protected to call in according to their schedule. An additional benefit is that the monitoring center can potentially communicate with offline computers. A further additional benefit is that the monitoring center can potentially communicate with computers which are switched off but have with separately powered security modules via a wake up call.

The monitoring center may be a staffed monitoring service station. A plurality of monitoring systems may be distributed across the communication networks for example in different geographic regions.

In relation to the security module in accordance with the present invention a monitoring center server comprises a processor a hard disk and hard disk controller or other data storage means and is configured to carry out one or more of the additional functions described below. A keyboard and screen may be operatively connected to the server to allow data input to and data readout from the server and to permit an operator to interact with a monitoring server.

A first additional function of the monitoring center is to detect the presence of the security module during a host agent call and to configure it and the synchronization of the calling behaviour of the host agent and of the firmware agent.

A second additional function of the monitoring center is to collect and store the new attributes collected from clients with security modules. These new attributes include for example the equipment identifier for the security module.

A third additional function of the monitoring center is to activate a subscription for the security communications channel if required at appropriate times. This activation process requires interfaces with carrier systems. Alternatively on notification from an owner of a tracked device that it has been stolen staff at the monitoring center may contact via phone email fax or other method a telecommunications company to establish a subscription for the wireless module in the tracked device which has been stolen.

A fourth additional function of the monitoring center is to initiate calls to the tracked computers. This function is useful in particular when the tracked device has been notified as stolen. Instead of waiting for the tracked device to call in to the monitoring center at its next scheduled time via the tracked device may be called immediately and the host agent put into alert mode. This technology may be implemented over SMS or another service with similar capabilities permitting real time inbound communication to the monitored computer.

A fifth function of the monitoring center is to record additional location information relating to the location of the tracked device or information that can be used to infer the location of the tracked device. This information may include coordinates collected from a GPS transceiver built into the security module or a GPS unit separate from the security module the IDs of the visible cell towers and their respective signal strengths the MAC addresses and signal strengths of the visible WiFi routers. In the case where the location of the device is provided directly e.g. in the case of GPS the location is stored directly in the database. In the case where the location is inferred from collected attributes e.g. the MAC addresses and signal strengths of the visible WiFi routers the monitoring center interfaces with a system to infer the location of the monitored computer.

The device to be protected or host is a laptop computer . Some of the components and modules of the laptop are shown to help understanding of the invention and others have been omitted for clarity. The host agent is shown to reside in the OS together with other features such as the network stack OS services and other drivers . The host agent has a persistence module residing in the BIOS . This persistence module restores the host agent pre boot if required. The host agent may be installed in the host via a computer readable distribution medium on which is carried computer readable instructions forming an MSI file installer together with the necessary code and files for installing the host agent. Other types of computer readable medium may be used. Also installed in within the OS is a module driver for allowing the host agent to interact and control the cellular wireless security module . The module driver may include a compressed agent and may be configured to restore the host agent if required thus providing an extra level of self repair of the agent. The host agent enables driver based persistence. The module driver comprising the compressed agent may be installed into the OS from a computer readable medium which carries computer readable instructions forming the module driver installer and the necessary driver code and files and a compressed version of the host agent . The wireless module driver and compressed agent may also be installed via a Microsoft update which includes the necessary driver code and compressed agent . Alternatively the host agent may also be directly installed during the operating system installation or by Windows Update. The laptop also includes an Ethernet interface a WLAN interface and a Wi Fi or other modem .

The cellular wireless security module comprises a firmware agent and non volatile data storage device . While the firmware agent and non volatile data storage device have been shown to be located in the wireless module they may alternately be located elsewhere in the laptop either together or separate from each other. The firmware agent causes computer attributes such as details of installed software to be electronically stored in the data storage device . An optional power supply is operatively connected to the wireless security module to enable the firmware agent and wireless security module to operate when the host is switched off or is not connected to a power source.

The host agent is configured to interface with and control the security module and or the firmware agent . The host agent and firmware agent are configured to retrieve location information if a location determination technology is included in the system. The firmware agent will only call if the host agent is not calling. For example the firmware agent will call if the host agent does not ping the firmware agent in a configurable timeout period.

When a user or owner of the laptop becomes aware that the laptop has been stolen the user contacts the monitoring center via telephone fax email or any other available method. The fact that the laptop is stolen is recorded in a database in a server in the monitoring center either manually by a monitoring center member of staff or automatically if the notification is made via an internet connection or automated telephone answering system.

If it is not desired to wait for the next scheduled call from the host agent the monitoring center may attempt to communicate with the host and or firmware agent via the transmission of an SMS message. This message instructs the host agent and firmware agent to call. Since the host agent and firmware agent receive the message at nearly the same time the firmware agent waits a configurable timeout to see of the host agent will call. If it does not call the firmware agent will bring up a cellular data connection and call.

If there does not exist a cellular data subscription for the monitored computer the a subscription may be set up by a monitoring staff member contacting a cellular network operator provider company and proving them with the equipment identifier for the wireless module or this may be done automatically via programmatic interfaces with one or more cellular network operators. A subscription is likely to be set up after a laptop has been stolen or a data delete request has been submitted.

The agent subsequently checks to see if it is time to call the monitoring centre. The time to call the monitoring center could be set to be every 24 hours for example. If it not yet time to call the host agent returns to the wait mode . If it is past the time to call the host agent checks whether an internet connection is available and if so makes a call to the monitoring center via the internet. Prior to the call the monitoring center is in a state of wait in which it is waiting for an incoming call to be made. On receipt of a call the monitoring center processes the call after which it returns to a state of waiting for a subsequent call. If there is no internet connection available the host agent checks whether a cellular connection is allowed and if so it brings up a cellular data connection which it uses to call the monitoring center.

If the call is not successful the host agent goes back to the state of a short wait and repeats the process described. If the call is successful the host agent saves the time for its next call.

During a successful call the monitoring center may record the location and identity of the computer calling in and provide further instructions to the host agent. Further instructions to the host agent may be to initiate a data delete process a program update or an encryption key change and may include instructions to be executed after termination of the call.

If there is a both user cellular channel and a dedicated wireless security channel the host agent may be configured to call on the user channel before attempting to connect on the dedicated security channel. The host agent may instead be configured to call on the security channel before attempting to connect on the user channel. Alternately the choice of channel may be controlled by a cost minimizing algorithm.

In the case of an inactive host agent the firmware agent is in a short period of waiting . After this period of waiting the firmware agent checks whether it is past the time to call the monitoring center . If it is not past this time the firmware agent returns to the wait state . If it is past the time to call the firmware agent brings up a cellular data connection which it uses to call the monitoring center. Prior to the call the monitoring center is in a state of wait in which it is waiting for an incoming call to be made. On receipt of a call the monitoring center processes the call after which it returns to a state of waiting for a subsequent call.

If the call is not successful the firmware agent goes back to the state of a short wait and repeats the process described. If the call is successful the firmware agent stores the attributes and next call time in the non volatile memory to which it has access. The stored attributes may include attributes of the OS and details of the programs installed on the computer.

The wireless call made by the monitoring center may be an SMS call. If the host agent is inactive for example if the computer has been turned off or if the host agent is damaged the firmware agent accepts the call and processes the SMS message . However if the host agent is active it processes the SMS call itself.

In the case where the host agent is active the SMS call instructs the host agent to call back the monitoring center. The SMS call ends the monitoring center enters a state of waiting for an incoming call from the protected device and the host agent checks whether there is an internet connection. If so it makes an internet based call to the monitoring center but if not it brings up a cellular connection on which it calls the monitoring center. The monitoring center processes the call and then returns to a state of wait . Following a successful call the host agent stores the next time at which it needs to call the monitoring center which in the case of a stolen computer may be considerably sooner than when not stolen. For example only the next call time could be set to be in 15 minutes time. The host agent interfaces with the firmware agent which stores the attributes and next firmware agent call time in the non volatile memory to which it has access. An example call time would be in 25 minutes time. After this the host agent enters a state of waiting after which it follows the procedure as shown in .

In the case where the host agent is inactive the firmware agent interprets the SMS call as an instruction to call back the monitoring center. The SMS call ends and then the firmware agent brings up a cellular data connection on which it calls the monitoring center. The monitoring center processes the call and then returns to a state of wait . The call may involve for example an instruction to the firmware agent to switch on the computer and or wake up the host agent.

Following or during a successful call the firmware agent stores the attributes and next firmware agent call time in the non volatile memory to which it has access. The firmware agent then proceeds to a state of waiting and continues the process described in .

An alternate embodiment envisioned is the full integration of the wireless security module into the motherboard of the host system. This would effectively eliminate the possibility of disabling the security module via physically removing the module.

The disclosed technology is not limited to cellular wireless communications but may employ other wireless or mobile technologies including personal area network PAN wireless local area network WLAN and satellite based technologies.

In another embodiment the wireless module may be capable of both Wi Fi and or WIMAX and or cellular wireless communications.

The security module may be implemented using virtualization techniques where the firmware agent runs in a virtual environment on the computer s main processor and shares the system s network interfaces in a manner completely unbeknownst to the computer s main OS.

The wireless security module may be powered by an independent power supply. This may be in the form of a dedicated battery or simply independent connections to the laptop s main power supplies. The advantage of such a configuration is that the firmware agent can communicate even when the host computer system is off.

In the case of a independently powered module the wireless security module may be able to wake up the host system. If this is the case the monitoring center can communicate with the firmware agent and wake up the host computer to execute for example a data protection operation.

System administrators are also able to determine the physical location of tracked systems. They may also enforce geographic based policies e.g. computer X cannot be moved outside of a defined geographic boundary. The agent may call in to a monitoring center every time a change in location of the laptop is detected as well as calling in according to a predetermined schedule. Alternately it may call in every time it detects that it is in a new location rather than a changed location. Location information may be provided by cellular triangulation WiFi signal strength triangulation RFID tagging techniques IP look up or GPS devices.
