The 553 application is the non provisional of and claims priority to and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application U.S. Ser. No. 61 751 357 filed on Jan. 11 2013 and entitled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR A DIGITAL NETWORK. All of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure generally relates to providing a system and method for switching messages between network participants.

Providers of services often face roadblocks to forming relationships and developing product offerings for consumers of services due to the immense logistical roadblocks and costs which hamper new product rollout. For example the marketplace is usually fragmented and generally lacks defined systems and conduits for service providers and service consumers to interact in a flexible integrated highly scalable way. The marketplace also typically lacks standardization in that many potential relationships either never materialize or are not completed because of a lack of a framework to facilitate the interaction. Moreover many service providers often cannot devote sufficient resources time effort and money to accomplish the steps that comprise integration and new service rollout. Also service providers often cannot devote sufficient resources time effort and money to accomplish the steps that comprise modifications to existing product offerings. Attempts to address these fragmentation and standardization issues include large service providers establishing a one to many solution. However these attempts often fall short of providing a universal end to end solution for all service providers to use substantially concurrently.

As such a long felt need exists for a universal end to end automated standards driven solution that is open to all or a subset of service providers and service consumers and that provides standardized tools to service providers and service consumers to mix and match their preferred offering slate.

A web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network such as the Internet. This may be a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network. The present system and method comprises an improved market place for providing and using web services and web service messages. Using the present system generally via one or more APIs an entity changing service providers and or associated services provided may make this change with relative ease. The present system allows authorization and trackable consumption of those services. Moreover the present system comprises a method for integrating value added services within a network of participants for instance a payment network. The system can use service switching capabilities to route service calls to and from the service consumers and service providers using routing attributes appended to a message. Network participants can be both consumers and providers of services. The system can route service messages to the appropriate provider depending on details in the message.

While the preferred embodiments of the present disclosure are described and illustrated herein it will be appreciated that they are merely illustrative and that modifications can be made to these embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus the disclosure is intended to be defined only in terms of the following claims.

A system and method for switching web service messages is disclosed. Descriptions of specific embodiments and applications are provided only as examples and various modifications will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. The general principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus the present disclosure is to be accorded the widest scope encompassing numerous alternatives modifications and equivalents consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein. For purpose of clarity details relating to technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the disclosure have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure the present disclosure.

In general a web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network e.g. the Internet . This may be a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network. The present system and method comprises an improved marketplace for providing and using these services e.g. a digital network . Using system via one or more APIs an entity changing service providers may do so with ease. System is a robust network supporting revenue generating partnerships and fee based services through configurable interfaces backed by a proven business methodology.

Digital network comprises a foundational infrastructure to support a variety of use cases. Digital network may serve as a marketplace of services and provide brokering capabilities thereof. For instance use cases services may include location based services social media applications financial services loyalty programs travel systems consumer system transaction services virtual wallets registered offers coupons deals marketing systems and or the like. These services may be mixed and matched as desired. Thus digital network substantially enables an open marketplace of services. Within this marketplace the brokering of services may be accomplished which will also enable the monetization of switching data e.g. routing web service messages . By adhering to a standard and substantially uniform policy and or policies governing the digital marketplace service providers and service consumers may seamlessly cater their product offerings as desired and scale their offering set as needed.

According to various embodiments digital network is based upon a service orientated architecture SOA . According to the definitions controlling the SOA federation is increased through widespread deployment of standardized reusable services each of which may encapsulate a capability provided in a consistent manner. Thus interoperability is achieved and the technology architecture used by a service consumer is not tied to or locked to any one vender. Digital network is a secure multi tenant environment which has contracted controls over at least one of standards capabilities performance security and or monitoring.

Via this system service providers and service consumers experience streamlined processes elimination of redundancy and reduced operating costs. Various aspects of the present system leverages cloud architecture and cloud architecture principals to create a highly scalable elastic infrastructure which may allow for consumption based pricing and or performance based pricing. The present system is in general technology and language agnostic. Thus through a single platform partners may join and offer new services as desired to present additional opportunities for their existing customer base and growth thereof.

In contrast to the varied silo ed technologies offered previously and which required tremendous amounts of customization in order to allow two independent systems to interact. Digital network presents a single integration model so that participants e.g. users service providers service consumers can integrate with this single platform and utilize the variety of solutions that are offered through it. Thus participants may make use of new services to grow their businesses provided by these other participants coupled to digital network . In various embodiments a participant joining digital network may select a menu of services to offer from any other participant . Based on the capabilities provided a participant may pay for use. In this way risk is greatly reduced. As actual use is being monitored tracked and recorded as discussed herein a participant may have reduced risk. For instance instead of paying a pre negotiated fee such as an upfront fee or an annual or quarterly fee to service providers to use services service consumers may pay for actual use e.g. based on each message switched over the network . For instance as messages traverse digital network appropriate billing codes are allocated to those messages. These messages are dispatched to a clearing and settlement platform creating an automated mechanism for integrating the web service messages into billing reporting and accounting systems.

For instance in response to a message entering into digital network due to the centralized nature of this distributed system business logic may be applied to each switched message. As the messages are switched within the network information relevant to what systems hardware and or software were used to switch each message may be tagged to each message. However the switched message and its attributes that are exposed publicly e.g. outside of digital network is scrubbed of this contextual information. However in various embodiments prior to the scrubbing and generally just prior to the message being delivered out of digital network the message is processed and then stored in a log database to present a full picture such as via XML type information including which server processed the message how long it took who sent it where was it going confirmation the message arrived and or the like.

The present system is not limited to a service provider interfacing over a network through an API coupled to a service consumer also coupled to the network through an API. Stated another way the present system is not limited to this one to one or even a one to many landscape. Instead the present system facilitates a many to many marketplace. According to various embodiments today s service provider may be tomorrow s service consumer and vice versa.

An API may be an interface implemented by a software program which enables the API to interact with other software. An API may include a programming language that enables communication between computer programs such as programs of a merchant and programs of a financial institution and or third party fraud prevention provider programs. An API may be implemented by applications libraries and operating systems to determine vocabularies and calling conventions and may be used to access services associated therewith. An API may include specifications for routines data structures object classes and protocols for communication. An API may describe the ways in which a particular task is performed. API may define a set of request messages along with a definition of the structure of response messages. The API may be a backward compatible API. In some cases the API may replace the need for and or supplement middleware.

For example with reference to this many to many relationship is depicted. Though particular example applications are presented they are for example purposes only and may be substituted with other applications and service providers service consumers.

Digital network comprises established practices and principals for connecting disparate parties to support unified product offerings. For example network principals may be foundational development and deployment philosophies to enable participant transaction processing and support product value. The systems and architecture of digital network may include globally oriented architectures designed with reusable frameworks flexibility and scalability. These include secure controlled connection mechanisms to manage transaction integrity. The policies and standards of digital network may include leveraging expertise in creating and communicating equitable standards and policies to manage potentially conflicting interests of participants and the network. The product operations of digital network may include leveraging established participant management and product execution operations such as those known to a transaction account issuer transaction processor for switching transactions. For instance many of the concepts used relevant to a transaction account issuer transaction processor may be applied to digital network . For instance the concepts of reliability secure data data conservatorship brand strength quality of product offerings user experience may be readily applied to digital network framework.

With reference now to an exemplary block diagram illustrating major system components for enabling digital network processes is presented. Digital network employs authentication server security gateway to validate credentials such as a digital identity assign proper permissions review certificates maintain security and retrieve preference information for authorized user s of digital network and or web switching capabilities.

In various embodiments digital network employs security gateway to manage various applications and utilities that are utilized by system . In various embodiments application server digital network utilizes APL Win and JBOSS utilizing SEAM Richfaces JBPM and other Java libraries jQuery and Javascript JAX WS Apache POI and Quartz. In various embodiments digital network interacts directly with the various systems and components disclosed herein.

Digital network may comprise an API management engine database. This API management engine database may certify functionality of an API and that APIs coupled to the system conform to a standard. The API management engine database may catalog the service providers and or service consumers coupled to digital network . API management engine database may comprise templates for API creation modification.

Digital network may comprise utility services responsible for reconciliation of digital network services. These duties may include metering reporting auditing logging services verifying security token use monitoring services and or testing elements of digital network .

Digital network may comprise a provider integration engine. This provider integration engine may perform service level agreement management assist with identity federation perform functions related to the security token and or the like.

System may include any number of computing platforms and databases such as for example accounting systems financial transaction systems reporting systems new accounts systems management information systems business information systems external data sources proprietary systems and the like. Each of the systems may be interconnected within by a network in via any method and or device described herein. A middleware server and or application server may serve as an intermediary between the various systems to ensure appropriate communications between disparate platforms. A report engine retrieves and or is provided with data from the various systems in order to generate notices bills contracts messages audit reports and the like.

The consumers of web services may be web users financial transaction account issuers acquirers merchants mobile users vendors and other interfaces. The system may be capable of interfacing with at least one application program interface API . Each message switched by the system is a switchable trackable writable message. For example an automated journal entry and or an automated funds exchange message may each correspond to a message switched by system .

The providers of web services may be any entity that offers an electronic service. These services may be querying a database calculating formula providing data and or more complex tasks such as offering location based services such as offers discounts or services virtual card functionality pay with point capabilities mobile reporting loyalty banking loyalty catalog services prepaid account services and or the like. The providers of web services may utilize backend analytics to provide services.

The tracking of the messages follows the messages that are switched through digital network . With reference to this tracking may be facilitated by tagging the messages at various points within digital network such as via a message broker. For instance according to various embodiments as each message enters digital network leaves digital network and or traverses hardware elements of digital network the switched message is appended with data to detail this path taken. This appended data may include designation identifiers of the hardware elements used in the message switching. This appended data may be metadata appended to the each message. This data may be tagged to each message. This appended data may include designation identifiers of the sender and or the recipient of the message. This appended data may include ordinal information such as time to process the message when the message entered digital network and when the message was delivered to a recipient.

In concert with this tracking a validation system of digital network may confirm that the sender and or recipient of the message are authorized to send messages over digital network . For instance as described in further detail herein this confirmation may include verifying that a service level agreement SLA is in place and or verifying the call against the terms agreed upon in a license or contract that is in place. For instance the tracking may verify that the terms of the agreement in place are not violated. For instance that a level of service is appropriate. This may include at least one of verifying that the volume of messages being switched within a measured period do not exceed a threshold that the speed of the message switching is within tolerances of the agreement that the participant is current on their payment plan and or the like.

Prior to the message leaving digital network the path taken by each message may be recorded and stored to a database and each message may be scrubbed such as prior to consumption and or delivery by a consumer of web services and or providers of web services.

The present system allows for authorization and trackable consumption of those services e.g. switching messages . The system provides the capability of tracking with a high degree of granularity cost and volume of web switched messages traversing digital network . Thus a cost and volume per service may be produced and ensure that services are provided and consumed with the correct pricing scheme. These schemes may be based on each message switched batches of switched messages time ranges of switched messages and or the like.

The systems and methods provide an improved tangible integrated online service marketplace. Various embodiments may be implemented by a system computer readable medium or a method or any combination thereof. The systems and methods include a unique combination of one or more features associated with a service marketplace. In various embodiments the system provides a marketplace for service providers and service consumers to engage in message switching transactions. The system may be implemented as a web based system that provides a process for managing the brokering message switching transactions. The system enables a one stop resource for service providers to interact together and with service consumers providing not only a marketplace for message switching transactions but centralized access to service providers. In various embodiments the system references service agreements rules of service agreements and versions of service agreements.

Exemplary benefits of the system include providing standardized integration processes and security to participants of digital network . The participants of digital network benefit by the efficiency and choice created by this standardization. Service providers are better able to market and commercialize their services. Service consumer s benefit from being able to perform comparative analysis for service providers that are presented in a standardized manner. Digital network provides new revenue streams to the service providers by helping to merchandise services. Moreover efficiencies are gained by creating a community of service provider s service consumers trusted third parties and or brokers that transact web service messages across a common platform.

According to various embodiments and with reference to a transaction account holder customer may log into an issuer site and access a loyalty points bank 1 . This may be a third party provider loyalty points bank such as Loylogic. The issuer may authenticate the request and prompts for a Digital ID 2 . The transaction account holder customer may create a Digital ID if not previously registered 3 . Digital Network may check for association with the loyalty points bank for Digital ID provided 4 . Upon approval that an association exists such as a contractual association Digital Network transfers the request to the loyalty points bank e.g. the loyalty points bank system 5 . The loyalty points bank retrieves Points balance and User Profile through Digital Network APIs 6 . The loyalty points bank presents a catalogue to the transaction account holder customer to shop and check out 7 . Then the loyalty points bank calculates points required and calculates additional currency 8 . The loyalty points bank may present a summarized transaction to transaction account holder customer to verify 9 . The loyalty points bank may update Points Bank 10 . The Points Bank is updated through Digital Network APIs 11 . The loyalty points bank completes transaction and confirms the same to transaction account holder customer 12 .

According to various embodiments and with reference to using aspects of the present system from the customer point of view the customer makes an election to a pay with points service by linking a loyalty membership with their transaction account. For instance the customer may then select to pay an online merchant with alternative currency such as over digital network via an API. In this embodiment both the merchant and the customer may be coupled to digital network either directly or via a merchant portal. For example an issuer website may provide a web based user interface to the consumer for linking loyalty points. At this point the customer may be directed to a registration site if not previously accomplished. For example the merchant may call digital network web service requesting alternative currencies linked to the customer account. The merchant may call digital network web service requesting point balance and local currency exchange rate. The digital network may be associated with the central authorization system CAS which may be linked to address verification AAV and or card security code CID verification services. In response digital network may call the issuer web service requesting current point balance. In response digital network may call the prearranged exchange rate. For example digital network may reference a point translation contract database to determine the current exchange rate between the issuer loyalty point system and the transaction currency. The issuer may periodically update digital network with new contracts and exchange rates. Each of these calls may be one or more distinct web service switched messages. Each is appended with data to detail the sender and the recipient and any hardware elements used such as servers and or applications used to switch the message. As messages exit digital network this appended data may be removed and or recorded such as for invoicing.

The customer may confirm the amount of loyalty points to allocate to the purchase. In response to this confirmation the merchant may request authorization over digital network . The merchant may call digital network requesting authorization on a loyalty point transaction. Digital network may call the issuer web service to authorize the transaction amount. The issuer may respond with an authorize or decline response. Digital network may respond with an authorization or decline response.

One skilled in the art will appreciate that system may employ any number of databases in any number of configurations. Further any databases discussed herein may be any type of database such as relational hierarchical graphical object oriented and or other database configurations. Common database products that may be used to implement the databases include DB2 by IBM White Plains N.Y. various database products available from Oracle Corporation Redwood Shores Calif. Microsoft Access or Microsoft SQL Server by Microsoft Corporation Redmond Wash. or any other suitable database product. Moreover the databases may be organized in any suitable manner for example as data tables or lookup tables. Each record may be a single file a series of files a linked series of data fields or any other data structure. Association of certain data may be accomplished through any desired data association technique such as those known or practiced in the art. For example the association may be accomplished either manually or automatically. Automatic association techniques may include for example a database search a database merge GREP AGREP SQL using a key field in the tables to speed searches sequential searches through all the tables and files sorting records in the file according to a known order to simplify lookup and or the like. The association step may be accomplished by a database merge function for example using a key field in pre selected databases or data sectors.

More particularly a key field partitions the database according to the high level class of objects defined by the key field. For example certain types of data may be designated as a key field in a plurality of related data tables and the data tables may then be linked on the basis of the type of data in the key field. The data corresponding to the key field in each of the linked data tables is preferably the same or of the same type. However data tables having similar though not identical data in the key fields may also be linked by using AGREP for example. In accordance with one aspect of system any suitable data storage technique may be utilized to store data without a standard format. Data sets may be stored using any suitable technique including for example storing individual files using an ISO IEC 7816 4 file structure implementing a domain whereby a dedicated file is selected that exposes one or more elementary files containing one or more data sets using data sets stored in individual files using a hierarchical filing system data sets stored as records in a single file including compression SQL accessible hashed via one or more keys numeric alphabetical by first tuple etc. Binary Large Object BLOB stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC 7816 6 data elements stored as ungrouped data elements encoded using ISO IEC Abstract Syntax Notation ASN.1 as in ISO IEC 8824 and 8825 and or other proprietary techniques that may include fractal compression methods image compression methods etc.

In various embodiments the ability to store a wide variety of information in different formats is facilitated by storing the information as a BLOB. Thus any binary information can be stored in a storage space associated with a data set. As discussed above the binary information may be stored on the financial transaction instrument or external to but affiliated with the financial transaction instrument. The BLOB method may store data sets as ungrouped data elements formatted as a block of binary via a fixed memory offset using fixed storage allocation circular queue techniques or best practices with respect to memory management e.g. paged memory least recently used etc. . By using BLOB methods the ability to store various data sets that have different formats facilitates the storage of data associated with system by multiple and unrelated owners of the data sets. For example a first data set which may be stored may be provided by a first party a second data set which may be stored may be provided by an unrelated second party and yet a third data set which may be stored may be provided by an third party unrelated to the first and second party. Each of these three exemplary data sets may contain different information that is stored using different data storage formats and or techniques. Further each data set may contain subsets of data that also may be distinct from other subsets.

As stated above in various embodiments of system the data can be stored without regard to a common format. However in one exemplary embodiment the data set e.g. BLOB may be annotated in a standard manner when provided for manipulating the data onto the financial transaction instrument. The annotation may comprise a short header trailer or other appropriate indicator related to each data set that is configured to convey information useful in managing the various data sets. For example the annotation may be called a condition header header trailer or status herein and may comprise an indication of the status of the data set or may include an identifier correlated to a specific issuer or owner of the data. In one example the first three bytes of each data set BLOB may be configured or configurable to indicate the status of that particular data set e.g. LOADED INITIALIZED READY BLOCKED REMOVABLE or DELETED. Subsequent bytes of data may be used to indicate for example the identity of the issuer user transaction membership account identifier or the like. Each of these condition annotations are further discussed herein.

The data set annotation may also be used for other types of status information as well as various other purposes. For example the data set annotation may include security information establishing privileges and or access levels. The annotation may designate hardware systems utilized. The access levels may for example be configured to permit only certain individuals levels of employees companies or other entities to access data sets or to permit access to specific data sets based on the transaction merchant issuer user or the like. Furthermore the security information may restrict permit only certain actions such as accessing modifying and or deleting data sets. In one example the data set annotation indicates that only the data set owner or the user are permitted to delete a data set various identified users may be permitted to access the data set for reading and others are altogether excluded from accessing the data set. However other access restriction parameters may also be used allowing various entities to access a data set with various permission levels as appropriate.

One skilled in the art will also appreciate that for security reasons any databases systems devices servers or other components of system may consist of any combination thereof at a single location or at multiple locations wherein each database or system includes any of various suitable security features such as firewalls access codes encryption decryption compression decompression and or the like.

System enables users e.g. digital network participant such as a service provider and or service consumer to interact via routing calls and switching service messages. These switched messages may be associated with transactions for goods and services however they are not limited to transactions of goods and services. System combines unique standardization process improvement workflow data integration searching and data security features to enable a seamless feature rich message switching marketplace.

Digital network may invoke an authentication server to verify the identity of user and verify SLA permissions and or access rights. This may include a determination of the efficiency of the systems used to process the request. In this way based on this information retrieved by the authentication server the routing of the message may be affected. For instance a user may have contracted for message switching at a set speed which can be processed by a certain class of hardware such as a tiered class of hardware. To access the application server or other components of digital network Internet server may invoke an authentication server in response to user submissions of requests for routing service calls being received by digital network . When a request to access system is received from Internet server Internet server determines authentication from the sender credentials and or characteristics of the message. When user is authenticated user may access various applications and their corresponding data sources. This access may be restricted only to certain aspects of digital network . For instance certain service providers may have contracts to interact with a set of service consumers. For instance a transaction account transaction processor may offer a loyalty point bank to their members. These members may be able to spend the loyalty points at a specific online catalog. This online catalog may be one of many catalogs coupled to digital network . Based on the SLA digital network based on this information retrieved by the authentication server may route the various services calls to the proper service providers. Note in the above example the transaction account transaction processor is a service consumer of the loyalty point bank service provider the loyalty point bank service provider is a service consumer of the online catalog service provider. As can be seen the roles of service requestor and service provider may be designated by the entity requesting and providing data respectively.

According to various embodiments a service consumer may desire the use of a membership points redemption service. Instead of a plurality of users such as a plurality transaction account issuers leveraging a single point redemption service the present system allows for multiple membership point catalog providers. In this way the issuers would be able to have choice with whom they would like to integrate and offer services. Thus after a new SLA is put in place the system allows for competition between those providers a marketplace of services. Based on the framework of digital network and in general APIs between the service providers and service consumers and the standardization in this case the issuer is able to switch between the service providers e.g. the multiple membership point catalog providers without changing their integration. In this way an issuer e.g. service consumer and service provider may shop around as to what services they want to utilize to offer their products. Due to the standardization of the interfaces and the framework not only may a service consumer switch between similar service providers which offer similar services but a service consumer may add remove or exchange services offered with ease. For instance an issuer whom has historically offered a loyalty points catalogue service to its members may toggle to offering a partnership with a frequent flier system with relatively little difficultly. The system makes it easier for partners to consume services without the need to integrate different services individually which saves the participants time and money.

According to various embodiments digital network manages the services offered at the network level rather than individually from the service providers to reduce the demands on the users.

Participants in digital network may conform to a standard such as a standard similar to an ISO standard. This standard may define technical details such as defining layout of a participant s interfaces and or define business process such as defining penalties for not meeting obligations. This may be limited to the participant s API layout or to participant s back end services. According to various embodiments the standard may be used as a template for developing an API for interfacing with digital network . According to various embodiments the system does not use commercial XML CXML . According to various embodiments the on boarding process for participants includes a certification process. This certification process may help ensure that participants can actually provide the services they represent they can provide. It may include a test phase and or warranties for non performance. The on boarding process may include do a technical certification that their compliance to the standard.

According to various embodiments fees may be assessed on the transactions e.g. switch messages that flow across digital network . These fees on integration messages may be assessed on all switched messages that traverse the network or a subset of messages that flow across digital network . For instance these messages may be or may not be financial in nature. Thus these feed messages can be non financial messages. As an example a non financial message may be a message where there is no exchange of money associated with the message. A facilitation fee for facilitating the movement of messages across the network may be assessed.

According to various embodiments a service consumer such as a global exchange and clearinghouse for virtual currencies such as loyalty points or miles e.g. LoyLogic have a user may desire to make a purchase via a catalog. Interacting with an issuer s website the user may from the virtual catalog request a call from a points bank. In this way the catalog calls the points bank. However the user s identity is provided across the network without actually exposing the credentials of the user. Thus the system leverages passing data regarding the user s credentials and the date without actually exposing the user s credentials such as by offering tokens with stand in the place of sensitive data. This secure transfer of information over digital network is applicable to any web switching message that traverses digital network .

In this way the issuer may assert what can be done against that token as far as what permissions the user has with respect to the services offered they wish to leverage for their membership and digital network may be able to control execution of those permissions within the network. In this way digital network controls that privacy is being honored. Thus the identity of the user is protected and the security of digital network is protected. Also the privacy and the compliance requirements around the user s transaction account information are secure.

This is in contrast to a typical service oriented solution by shifting the logic around network protection into the network space. For instance typically you would have a service provider and all of the authorization permissions would be held at the service provider such as who has access to what permissions. The present system moves that high level logic out of the service provider application into digital network . In the scenario where a message is moving across the network where the message is being sent and the security around all the different participants is carefully controlled by the system .

According to various embodiments identification of fraud risk prevention can be increased and broadened. For instance with traditional fraud risk prevention there is generally a substantial data storage that feeds into a system that understand spending behavior nature and payment behavior taking into account velocity checks historical patterns and the like. In contrast digital network facilitates capture of real time transactional information as it is moving across digital network and stores it in a database in real time. For instance a user may use a Pay with Points service and or virtual wallet service each of which is facilitated via digital network . A fraud prevention service provider may also be a participant on digital network . These may all be linked to a user links via digital network . A message may be communicated to digital network participant and or service consumers that there is a potential fraudulent activity associated with a user. All participants consuming that fraud service may benefit from the information and take action as appropriate. Similar scenarios with respect to credit alerts are contemplated.

According to various embodiments a social media application such as Open Table or Yelp may include a community of people discussing how they like a restaurant or product offerings. An offer system provided through digital network leveraging analytics may present the best offers from a merchant perspective and or from an issuer perspective such as how much money does this person traditionally spend on restaurants or is it the right offer Depending on the API s a service consumer is partnered with multiple benefits and cross leveraging of services may be achieved. For instance depending on the various participants a percent off or the amount of a bill and or bonus points may be deposited into a loyalty point bank and or into a virtual wallet system in response to acceptance of an offer or writing a review. For instance in response to a star ranking and or review provided by a user on a restaurant ranking system coupled to digital network such as Yelp a service provider coupled to digital network may present an offer such as a Registered Card offer or Groupon offer at similar class geographically relevant restaurants depending on which service providers each user and or service consumer is contracted with to leverage.

Due to the framework of digital network e.g. the network is in the middle and the policies and security models in place to protect the user data and the on call privileges digital network can enforce on call principles at the network level. Thus digital network is able to control and dictate based on the attributes of each message that a service consumer may call upon data such as from any provider coupled to the digital network. Digital network can block requests they are not on call compliant based on the attributes of the request.

According to various embodiments users are verified to digital network . For instance a user requests a digital ID. The user may be certified prior to being issued a Digital ID. Once issued a digital ID the user may use their registered Digital ID and request switching of service call messages over digital network . The user may register for digital network services. This may entail registering and signing a licensing agreement to use services from service providers. These licensing agreements may be word documents and or coded rules. Access to aspects of digital network may depend on compliance with these documents and or specific coded rules.

Due to the security framework of digital network data is protected between participants of digital network . Thus any one participant is not able to see the data of any other participant.

According to various embodiments a participant need not reconfigure their existing interfaces and structure to interface with digital network . Instead an additional API may be inserted between the existing interface of the participant and digital network so to maintain the unified cohesive marketplace of services. A non exhaustive list of participants of digital network may include digital prepaid account such as Serve acquirers issuers risk mitigation monetization providers loyalty account providers geo location based offers registered card offers analytics currency exchanges social media providers customer relationship management providers internet merchants complete merchant solutions credit bureaus travel services transportation access mobile applications and or mobile application developers. For instance additional details regarding these service providers that may be participants and the services provided may be appreciated from U.S. Ser. No. 13 411 281 entitled System and Method for Providing Coupon less Discounts Based on a User Broadcasted Message filed Mar. 2 2012 U.S. Ser. No. 12 874 063 API Based Fraud Mitigation filed on Sep. 1 2010 and U.S. Ser. No. 13 540 216 entitled Systems and Methods for Transferring Value via a Social Network filed on Jul. 2 2012 the disclosures of each are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for any purpose.

According to various embodiments in response to a transaction occurring on digital network accurate risk fraud calculations based on analytics and or VI analytics may be made with regard to the user. For example a customer shopping at a mall may imitate a transaction with a store where the transaction is processed via digital network . The store identifier and or point of sale device may indicate to digital network the location of the user. In response to receiving this information the back end system of digital network may initiate calculations on the risk of the transaction being fraudulent default etc. . For instance the calculations may include the internal data such as a customer s payment history purchase history amount of membership reward points and or the like. Digital network may cross reference a database which stores merchant offers and perform a real time calculation to determine success or probability of relevance of a unique offer specifically customized for this customer. For instance the customer may receive a message on their phone to go to a geographically nearby merchant and use membership reward points to redeem purchase of a specific item and receive a discount.

Each service provider partnered with digital network may be cross referenced to create services for users. For instance loyalty services may be combined with risk and or a fraud services. Marketing campaigns may be combined with analytics of credit risks. These relationships may hone campaigns. For instance a marketing campaign may not be sent to a user who is currently at risk at default. Digital network and its framework allows for relatively easy combination of services. In essence according to various embodiments participants of digital network may mix and match the services desired and or consumed and orchestrate them together to create experiences that wouldn t be possible with traditional the one to one relationships. In another example a work flow and sales force may integrate with and use information from Facebook and or other social media applications. Thus digital network can add and consolidate services by utilizing multiple third party service providers.

Internal data is any data a credit issuer possesses or acquires pertaining to a particular consumer. Internal data may be gathered before during or after a relationship between the credit issuer and the consumer. Such data may include consumer demographic data. Consumer demographic data includes any data pertaining to a consumer. Consumer demographic data may include consumer name address telephone number email address employer and social security number. Consumer transactional data is any data pertaining to the particular transactions in which a consumer engages during any given time period. Consumer transactional data may include transaction amount transaction time transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location. Transaction vendor merchant location may contain a high degree of specificity to a vendor merchant. For example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular gasoline filing station in a particular postal code located at a particular cross section or address. Also for example transaction vendor merchant location may include a particular web address such as a Uniform Resource Locator URL an email address and or an Internet Protocol IP address for a vendor merchant. Transaction vendor merchant location may also include information gathered from a WHOIS database pertaining to the registration of a particular web or IP address. WHOIS databases include databases that contain data pertaining to Internet IP address registrations. Transaction vendor merchant and transaction vendor merchant location may be associated with a particular consumer and further associated with sets of consumers. Consumer payment data includes any data pertaining to a consumer s history of paying debt obligations. Consumer payment data may include consumer payment dates payment amounts balance amount and credit limit. Internal data may further comprise records of consumer service calls complaints requests for credit line increases questions and comments. A record of a consumer service call includes for example date of call reason for call and any transcript or summary of the actual call.

Internal data may further comprise closed loop data and open loop data. Closed loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s closed loop transaction system. A closed loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of one party. Closed loop transaction systems may be used to obtain consumer transactional data. Open loop data includes data obtained from a credit issuer s open loop transaction system. An open loop transaction system includes transaction systems under the control of multiple parties.

Participants in digital network may earn loyalty points for switching messages via digital network or any of the other processes disclosed herein. The system also facilitates redeeming these loyalty points for value and or discounts.

According to various embodiments a computer based method of the present system may include receiving a request to route a service call message from a requestor to a service provider through an API within an electronic marketplace of service providers and service consumers e.g. digital network . Digital network may verify privileges of the requestor to request services from the service provider. Digital network may tag the service call message with data indicating the results of the verifying. Digital network may store the tags of the service call message to a database. After storing digital network may scrub the tags of the service call message. Digital network may route the service call message to the service provider in response to positive verification that the requestor may request services from the service provider and based on the attributes of the service call message. Digital network may audit at any time the efficiency of the routing of the first and second call messages such as to verify that the routing occurs within SLA tolerances and or agreed upon rates.

According to various embodiments digital network may receive a response to the routed service call message such as through an API. Similar to the request digital network may verify privileges of the service provider to deliver services to the requestor. Digital network may tag the response to the service call message with data indicating the results of the verifying. Digital network may tag the response to the service call message with data identifying the requestor of the service call message information identifying an intended recipient of the service call message information identifying an actual recipient of the service call message information identifying a time of an origination of the request and or information identifying a time of the delivering the request to the actual recipient. Digital network may store the tags of the response to the service call message to a database which is separate from storing the tags to the message itself. Digital network may store the tags of the response to the service call message to the message itself. Digital network may store the tags of the response to the service call message to the database instead of saving the tags to the service call message. Digital network may scrub the tags of the response to the service call message. Digital network may route the response to service call message to the requestor in response to positive verification that the service provider may provide services to the requestor and based on the attributes of the response to the service call message.

Digital network may partially or fully secure the identity of the requestor from the marketplace of service providers and service consumers. According to various embodiments only digital network and the initial requestor have access to this information. A fee is assessed to the requestor and or to the recipient for routing the service call message. The fee for routing the service call message to the requestor may be based on a pro rated cost of hardware elements used to switch each message. The fee for routing the service call message to the requestor may be based on a defined cost of each hardware element used to switch each message. If a participant wishes for faster and or more efficient resources they may contract for these resources and the messages may be switched by servers and processors that meet the contract provisions. These may carry increased fees as compared with other resources available. The verifying may involve comparing the attributes of the request to a specific rule of an agreement. Digital network may tag information which identifies at least one of the rule the agreement and a version of the agreement. Digital network may dynamically switch service level agreements to verify against as changes to service level agreements are accessible to the digital network computer system . The marketplace of service providers and service consumers may include disparate and or similar third party service providers and service consumers. The frameworks of the APIs described herein may conform to a standard. Digital network may tag the message with at least one of the identification of the hardware elements and software processing used to deliver the service call message from the requestor to the service provider.

Digital network may append a token comprising proxy attributes to the service call message. This may be in place of any data such as metadata. This metadata token and or appended data may be encrypted using techniques described and referred to herein.

According to various embodiments the request may be received through a first API and the request may be routed to the service provider through the same first API. Such is the case where a merchant is requesting its own data via digital network . The on boarding of service providers and or service consumers to the electronic marketplace may include a certification process. Each service call message may be routed based on on call privileges of digital network . In this way the service consumer s message may be directed to any entity that performs a service so long as the proper permissions are in place. This functionality may open up competition for services where roadblocks existed previously.

According to various embodiments the requestor and or service provider may earn loyalty points for requesting to route the service call message via digital network . This may be based on fees paid for use of digital network on a per message switched basis exceeding benchmarks not violating a license or contract within a certain period user reviews based on batches of messages and or the like. A second service provider coupled digital network who was not the recipient of the routed message may use the information of the service call message to transmit a second service call message to the requestor. This may be to an anonymous recipient as the identity of the member may be secure.

In various embodiments digital network comprises a plurality of application programming interfaces APIs . The APIs enable digital network to interface with various systems e.g. a third party application . API specifications may be open or proprietary. Digital network may include a plurality of API s enabling third party and or external applications to access the services of the marketplace and to build their own integrated channels. According to various examples a participant may build custom applications a.k.a. apps that access the capabilities of digital network via APIs.

In various embodiments digital network framework enables a participant to configure and offer promotions via digital network . For example service providers that run social media based restaurant table reservation systems may wish to increase usage of their service. The service provider may configure a promotion on digital network such that the terms of the promotion are advertised to digital network users and or a subset of selected digital network users. Promotions may be configured via a promotions configuration interface and or via a promotion API. Digital network receives a promotion setup request and parses the request into promotion parameters. Promotion parameters may include for example criteria for whom the promotion is offered to criteria for the timing of the promotion a reward associated with a promotion criteria for qualifying for the reward etc. Digital network may associate promotion parameters with one or more channels and may save the promotion e.g. to a promotion database . In various embodiments digital network may determine system entities service providers and or service consumers that comply with first promotional criteria as identified in the promotion parameters and send a notice of the promotion to such entities. Sending the notice may include sending a promotion solicitation via an email message a link a uniform resource locator URL a customized web page a social networking web site an app a text message and a mobile application. In various embodiments users that are being offered a promotion receive notice of the promotion via the channel guide interface. For example the channel associated with the interface may be displayed with an indicator e.g. a color a graphic text etc to inform the user that the channel is offering a promotion.
