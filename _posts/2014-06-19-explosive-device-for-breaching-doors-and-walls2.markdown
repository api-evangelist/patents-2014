The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to breaching devices and in particular to breaching devices for doors and walls.

Door breaching devices are used by for example police and fire departments and military and paramilitary organizations. One example of a door breaching device is a battering ram. A battering ram may not be adequate for doors of sturdy construction. Another door breaching device is a cutting torch. A cutting torch may require too much time to breach a door. In some situations stealth and surprise is needed when breaching a door. Doors can be breached by placing small amounts of explosives on the door hinges and or the door locking mechanism. In some cases explosives can be difficult to control.

U.S. Pat. No. 4 681 171 issued on Jul. 21 1987 discloses a battering ram. U.S. Pat. No. 6 408 765 issued on Jun. 25 2002 discloses a door breaching device with a safety adapter. U.S. Patent Application Publication 20120216698 published on Aug. 30 2012 discloses a low shrapnel door breaching projectile.

The U.S. Army possesses a surplus of bomblets. If the surplus bomblets are destroyed the large original capital investment will be lost. A method of converting a surplus bomblet into a hand grenade is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8 272 328 issued on Sep. 25 2012. A need exists for a cost effective method of converting the surplus bomblets into other useful products such as door or wall breaching devices.

One aspect of the invention is an explosive breaching device with a central longitudinal axis. A generally cylindrical steel fragmentation case having an open end is centered on the central longitudinal axis. A conical shaped charge liner is disposed in the steel fragmentation case and defines a generally conical empty volume centered on the central longitudinal axis. Explosive material is disposed in the steel fragmentation case contiguous with a surface of the conical liner that is opposite the generally conical empty volume.

A shock attenuating case is disposed adjacent to and coaxial with the steel fragmentation case. The shock attenuating case may be made of a material having a speed of sound that differs from a speed of sound in the steel fragmentation case. The shock attenuating case has an open end at a same end as the steel fragmentation case. A mild steel housing surrounds is coaxial with and is generally contiguous with the shock attenuating case. The mild steel housing has an open end at a same end as the steel fragmentation case.

A bore is formed in base portions of the steel fragmentation case the shock attenuating case and the mild steel housing distal their respective open ends. The bore is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis. An explosive train is disposed in the bore for detonating the explosive in the steel fragmentation case.

The shock attenuating case may include a side portion in the shape of a sleeve. The side portion has a plurality of through holes formed therein. The central longitudinal axis of each through hole is parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the explosive breaching device. The base portion of the shock attenuating case may be in the shape of a disc. The base portion includes a plurality of through holes formed therein. The central longitudinal axis of each through hole in the base portion lies in a plane that is normal to the central longitudinal axis of the explosive breaching device.

A retaining sleeve may be concentrically fixed to the mild steel housing. The retaining sleeve may include a first pair of pins on one side of the retaining sleeve and a second pair of pins on an opposite side of the retaining sleeve.

The explosive breaching device may include an aiming device. The aiming device includes a pair of opposed planar sides with an arcuate pin slot and a pin opening formed in each opposed side. The first pair of pins of the retaining sleeve are disposed in the arcuate pin slot and the pin opening on one of the opposed sides of the aiming device and the second pair of pins are disposed in the arcuate pin slot and the pin opening on the other of the opposed sides of the aiming device.

Another aspect of the invention is a method of converting a bomblet into an explosive breaching device. The method includes providing a bomblet having a fuze a shaped charge liner a steel fragmentation case with an open end and explosive material disposed between the shaped charge liner and the steel fragmentation case. The fuze is removed from the bomblet. A shock attenuating case is attached adjacent to and coaxial with the steel fragmentation case. The shock attenuating case may be made of a material having a speed of sound that differs from a speed of sound in the steel fragmentation case. A mild steel housing is attached around the shock attenuating case. A second explosive material may be placed in a central bore formed in the mild steel housing.

The method may include concentrically fixing a retaining sleeve to the mild steel housing. The explosive breaching device may be mounted in an aiming device.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A known Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition DPICM bomblet may be converted into an explosive breaching device for breaching for example doors or walls. The process of converting the known DPICM bomblet into a breaching device may be about 30 to 40 cheaper than purchasing a new breaching device.

Bomblet may be converted to an explosive breaching device. A method of converting bomblet includes removing fuze from bomblet . Fuze may be removed from bomblet by for example milling staked material and lifting fuze from bomblet . The remainder of the bomblet that is the steel case liner and explosive material may be used to make an explosive breaching device.

In device a generally cylindrical shock attenuating case is disposed adjacent to and coaxial with the steel fragmentation case . Shock attenuating case is made of a structure that yields or deforms and therefore absorbs the shock energy from explosive . Shock attenuating case is preferably made of a material having a different speed of sound than steel fragmentation case . The purpose of shock attenuating case is to absorb energy from the reaction of explosive material thereby preventing the mild steel housing from spalling and directing the explosive energy towards opening . The material of shock attenuating case may be for example copper or aluminum. Case has an open end at the same end as end of steel fragmentation case .

In the embodiment shown the shock attenuating case includes a base portion and a side portion . Base portion has the general shape of a disc and side portion has the general shape of a cylindrical sleeve. Side portion has a plurality of through holes formed therein see also . The central longitudinal axis of each through hole preferably is parallel to axis A of the explosive breaching device . The base portion has a plurality of through holes formed therein. The central longitudinal axis of each through hole in the base portion preferably lies in a plane that is normal to the central longitudinal axis A of the explosive breaching device . The bottom of base portion may also include openings or cavities not shown for receiving the top portions of studs .

A mild steel housing surrounds is coaxial with and is generally contiguous with the shock attenuating housing . The mild steel housing has an open end at a same end as end of the steel fragmentation case . The combination of the shock attenuating housing and the mild steel housing contains fragments formed by fragmentation case and directs the energy of explosive material toward opening . To prevent for example collateral damage it may sometimes be desired to limit the distance traveled by the jet that is formed by the shape charge liner . One way to limit the range of the jet formed by the liner is to attach a plate of appropriate thickness not shown such as a metal plate over open end . Then when explosive material reacts the jet formed by the shaped charge liner will be forced to penetrate the plate fixed over end thereby lessening the kinetic energy of the jet.

Shock attenuating case and mild steel housing may be fixed in place by various known means such as threaded joints epoxy etc.

A central bore is formed in the base portion of the steel fragmentation case the base portion of the shock attenuating case and the base portion of the mild steel housing . Bore is distal the respective open ends of steel fragmentation case shock attenuating case and mild steel housing . Bore is coaxial with the central longitudinal axis A. An explosive train is disposed in bore for detonating the explosive in the steel fragmentation case . The explosive train may include lead in bore in fragmentation case and a blasting cap in bore in mild steel housing . A primer adapter may be fixed to a top of housing . Blasting cap may be detonated by a variety of known means including fuzes electric ignition timers or remote control.

For some uses of device it may be desirable to provide an aiming device to enable more accurate aiming of the shaped charge liner . A retaining sleeve may be concentrically fixed to the mild steel housing by for example set screws . Referring to retaining sleeve may include two pairs of pins disposed on opposite sides of sleeve . Pins extend outwardly from retaining sleeve and may be threaded to enable the use of threaded fasteners .

An aiming device such as an aiming quadrant includes a pair of opposed planar sides connected by a base . Each side may include an arcuate pin slot and a pin opening formed therein. One pair of pins are disposed in the arcuate pin slot and the pin opening on one side and the other pair of pins are disposed in the arcuate pin slot and the pin opening on the other side . When fasteners are loosened pins may be moved in arcuate slots to aim the explosive device in a desired direction. Then fasteners are tightened to secure the aiming position of the explosive device.

If desired base of aiming device may have a layer of double sided tape thereon. Tape may be used to fix aiming device to a surface such as a door hinge locking mechanism wall etc. Explosive device may also be used as for example a self destruct device to destroy equipment that stores or handles classified information.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
