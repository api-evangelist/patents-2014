The present invention relates to a method for extracting physical properties of a cylinder subject to expansion cause by an explosion so as to better understand the evolution of damage.

Understanding how a cylinder expands in response to an explosion is instrumental in modeling analysis and development of materials suitable for use in such cylinders. However current methods for examining the expansion of cylinders focus primarily on fragment size and distribution of the fragments. In current methods two data points are obtained from which mechanical and material properties may be extracted. The two data points are acquired from an undeformed state and the deformed state after fracture. However measurements are not taken between the undeformed state and the deformed state after fracture.

Accordingly the current methodology for studying materials undergoing explosive expansion does not take into consideration the evolution of damage during the expansion of a cylinder. Without considering the evolution of damage during the expansion it remains unknown how damage evolves from the undeformed state to the deformed state during the high strain and strain rate expansion of the cylinder. Understanding the evolution of damage during an explosively driven expansion can facilitate a greater understanding of how materials behave while subjected to explosive forces and may help create more accurate models of the expanding cylinder which may in turn assist with the development of materials suited for use in extreme dynamic environments such as those experienced during ballistic events. Accordingly it remains desirable to have a method for examining the evolution of damage of a cylinder.

A method of extracting material and mechanical properties of a cylinder subjected to expansion wherein the cylinder is expanded by explosion is provided. The method is directed towards examining a cylinder s mechanical and material properties to specific residual radial strains and strain rates after the expansion thereof by an explosion contained therein. The method utilizes a plurality of cylinders each dimensioned uniformly with respect to each other and each made of the same material. A plurality of charges are set within a respective cylinder wherein the exploded cylinder is examined. Each of the charges are of different explosive forces and the material and mechanical properties of the cylinders after each charge is recorded and processed so as to trace the evolution of damage done to the cylinder.

The method includes the step of providing a plurality of cylinders each of the plurality of cylinders have the same physical dimensions and made of the same material. The method includes the step of providing a plurality of charges each of the plurality of charges having a different explosive force. The method further includes the step of providing a fluid having a shock impedance less than a shock impedance of any of the plurality of charges. The method proceeds to the step of placing one of the charges within one of the cylinders and filling the cylinder with the fluid. The cylinder has a closed bottom and capped on its open top so as to form a sealed enclosure holding both the charge and the fluid. The charge is detonated and the material and mechanical properties of the cylinder is recorded with respect to the amount of explosive force exerted within the cylinder. The method continues with the step of placing another charge which is greater than the previous within a cylinder and filling the cylinder with the fluid. The cylinders are detonated with incrementally greater charges in a like manner until a charge creates such a fracture and fragmentation of the cylinder that the material and mechanical properties of said fractured fragmented cylinder do not provide useful data.

With reference now to a method for extracting material and mechanical properties of a cylinder subject to expansion cause by an explosion so as to better understand the evolution of damage is provided. The method is directed towards correlating mechanical and material properties to specific residual radial strains and strain rates after the expansion and release of the explosively driven cylinder . The correlation of mechanical and material properties to residual radial strains and strain rates may facilitate the understanding of failure processes and hence the design of and material selection for cylinders for use in extreme dynamic pressure.

The method includes step providing a plurality of cylinders each of the plurality of cylinders have the same physical dimensions and are made of the same material as the others. With reference now to an exemplary illustration of a cylinder for use herein is provided. Accordingly the cylinders provide a benchmark for the effect of an explosion. The cylinder is representative of the plurality of cylinders also referenced herein as a test set of cylinders . The test set of cylinders may be representative of a cylinder for use in an explosive device such as an artillery round a rocket propelled missile or a casing for which an explosive charge is held.

The cylinder includes a wall defining a generally elongated body with a central opening . The wall is formed of a metallic material such as copper aluminum tantalum or steel. Preferably the wall is of a uniform thickness. The cylinder includes an inner diameter di and an outer diameter do and a length measured along the L axis shown in . For illustrative purposes the cylinder is shown having a length of 400 mm with an inner diameter di and outer diameter do of 100 mm and 120 mm respectively thus the wall thickness is 10 mm. The bottom of the cylinder is closed by a bottom cap which may be formed as a separate piece or may be integrated thereto. The top opening of the cylinder may be closed by a top cap so as to define a sealed inner chamber wherein the contents of the cylinder are contained therein. It should be appreciated that the dimensions provided are for illustrative purposes and should not be limiting to the scope of the teachings and the claims. Further it should be appreciated the dimensions and physical composition of a cylinder used in the method described herein are the same as the other cylinders which comprise the test set of cylinders .

With reference again to the method includes the step providing a plurality of charges . Each charge is configured to emit an explosive force different than the other. Preferably the charge is positioned along the central axis of the cylinder . The charge is shown as having a generally cylindrical body extending between the top and bottom caps of the cylinder . The dimensions of the cylinder are kept constant while the explosive charge is varied. The charge includes a detonator configured to actuate the charge.

As shown in the detonator may be mounted to a top edge of the charge so as to detonate the charge within the inner chamber of the cylinder . The detonator is illustratively shown as a fuse. However it should be appreciated that other detonators may be used in the method described herein illustratively including an electrical charge or a mechanical detonating device employing a primer and a firing pin.

Though the charge is shown as having a fuse projecting outwardly from an exposed surface of the top cap it should be appreciated that the detonator may be actuated remotely and wirelessly. The charges for use with a cylinder having the dimensions described above and formed of a Comp B material. The charge is configured to generate a radial expansion of the wall of the cylinder with respect to the central axis. Charges configured to explode and generate a radial expansion of the wall of the cylinders are currently known and used and illustratively include a charge commonly referenced by those skilled in the art as Comp B TNT PBX RDX and PETN.

The charges are uniform in physical composition but may be varied in explosive force so as to provide the effect that an explosion has within the set of test cylinders . Thus the correlation between explosive forces is made by increasing the diameter de of the charge . It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the explosive energy produced by the larger diameter de of the explosive charge is greater than that produced by the smaller diameter de of the explosive charge . The charge is shown formed in a solid cylindrical dimension extending generally the axial length of the cylinder between the top and bottom caps . However it should be appreciated that the shape of the charge is provided for illustrative purposes and the charge may be shaped otherwise.

The method includes the step providing a fluid having a shock impedance less than a shock impedance of any of the plurality of charges . The charge may be enclosed in a tubular seal The tubular seal may be centered within the inner chamber . The tubular seal is configured to shield the charge from the fluid . The fluid is configured to lower the shock pressure through impedance U mismatch is density and Uis the shock velocity so as to help prevent the cylinder from being fractured. As the shock wave passes from the high impedance explosive charge across the interface to the relatively low impedance of the fluid the shock pressure drops.

The fluid is further configured to attenuate the shock wave as it travels through the fluid . The distance between the tubular seal fluid interface and wall fluid interface decreases as the diameter de of the charge increases. Therefore the attenuation of the shock wave decreases with decrease in distance traveled by the shock wave across the fluid . Consequently the radial expansion of the explosively driven cylinder is arrested earlier for an explosive charge having a smaller diameter de as compared with those of an explosive charge having a larger diameter de .

The method includes step wherein one of the plurality of charges is placed in a respective one of the plurality of cylinders . The cylinder is filled with the fluid and the cylinder is sealed off wherein the charge is detonated and the material and mechanical properties of the cylinder is measured. The cylinders are each filled with a charge and detonated such that the various charges replicate the different stages of radial expansion of the cylinder . Preferably the cylinders are detonated with charges in an incrementally increasing explosive force such that each of the successive charges has a greater explosive force than its predecessor.

The method may further include step wherein the cylinder is recovered for post mortem analysis. For use herein post mortem refers to the state of the cylinder after a charge is detonated therein.

The method may further include step wherein the cylinder may be sectioned for post mortem analysis wherein physical properties such as changes in electrical conductivity electromagnetism hardness yield strength etc. are measured at various stages of expansion or radial strain. Post mortem analysis may also be directed towards observing changes in material properties such as dislocation density dislocation substructure microstructure grains deformation twins adiabatic shear bands crystallographic texture the nucleation growth coalescence of voids and etc.

With reference again to the execution of the method is provided. A number of metallic cylinders are gathered each being of uniform dimension and material composition. Preferably a charge is placed in the center of one of the cylinders and the fluid is poured into the cylinder filling the cylinder . In a preferred embodiment the fluid is water. Water is employed for three reasons the first is to lower the shock pressure through impedance Us mismatch where is density and Us is the shock velocity. As the shock wave passes from the high impedance explosive charge across the interface to the low impedance water the shock pressure drops. The second reason is to attenuate the shock wave as it travels through the water. The distance between the tubular seal water interface and metal water interface decreases as the explosive charge diameter de increases. Therefore the attenuation of the shock wave decreases with decrease in distance traveled by the shock wave across the water. Lastly water is easily accessible and absolutely safe to handle.

The top end cap is mounted to the open top and the detonator is actuated. The explosive force of the charge is recorded in a log book or an electronic database. It should also be appreciated that the size shape and material of the cylinder are also recorded. The radial velocity of the cylinder may be examined during the explosion.

For instance the free surface velocity of the expanding cylinder wall can be acquired by Photon Doppler Velocimetry PDV or Velocity Interferometry System for Any Reflector VISAR see . After each experiment the metallic cylinder may be recovered and sectioned for post mortem analysis.

The method continues by utilizing another untested cylinder from test set of cylinders and a different charge is placed into the cylinder and the same fluid poured therein. Preferably the charges are increased in explosive forces. When using a Comp B charge the explosive force may be increased by simply increasing the diameter de of the Comp B charge also referenced herein as the diameter de . Increasing the diameter de of the explosive charge increases the residual radial diameter of the metallic cylinder consequently the residual radial strain increases.

The diameter de of the explosive charge is gradually increased until the early stages of fracture occur often referred to as first smoke . First smoke implies that the material has fractured but not totally separated to form fragments and it is the ultimate point at which useful data can be obtained using this experimental method .

Accordingly the free surface velocity can be obtained using PDV VISAR and the residual radial strain can be estimated from the recovered cylinder . Also the recovered cylinder can be sectioned and polished for post mortem analysis from which mechanical and material properties can be extracted. For instance post mortem analysis of the recovered cylinder may reveal changes in physical properties such as electrical conductivity electromagnetism hardness yield strength etc. at various stages of expansion or radial strain.

Further changes in material properties such as dislocation density dislocation substructure microstructure grains deformation twins adiabatic shear bands crystallographic texture etc may be observed. The nucleation growth and coalescence of voids can also be studied using post mortem analysis. Furthermore the formation of cracks and how they grow during the elastic plastic expansion of explosively driven cylinders can be studied.

Multiple simulations were conducted using the CTH hydrocode to demonstrate and validate the feasibility of the method described herein. Oxygen Free High Conductivity OFHC copper was used to simulate the free expansion of the explosively driven cylinders . The length of the cylinder was 400 mm. Comp B was the explosive used and water was the liquid medium. The simulations were conducted using 4 mm 8 mm 12 mm 16 mm 24 mm 32 mm and 100 mm fully filled explosive charge diameters respectively the results of which are shown in respectively.

Tracer particles were imbedded within the wall at the mid point 200 mm of the OFHC copper cylinder in order to track the radial expansion with respect to time. With reference again to of each figure represents the full view of the expanding cylinder and shows damage as a function of time. shows the undeformed configuration of the OFHC copper prior to detonation. From the contours in it is evident that the damage prior to detonation is zero. This implies that the material is pristine no damage at zero pressure or at time equals zero.

With reference now to the 4 mm diameter explosive charge results are provided. The OFHC copper cylinder reaches maximum radial expansion without exhibiting any damage. Similarly as shown in the 8 mm diameter explosive charge did not produce any damage at maximum radial expansion. However from the simulation results in the first evidence of damage although minimum was observed at maximum radial expansion for the 12 mm diameter explosive charge with no visible fracture. With further increase in the diameter of the explosive charge up to 16 mm more evidence of damage was observed with some visible fracture see . From extensive damage and fracture were observed for the 24 mm and 32 mm diameter explosive charges respectively. Finally shows the results for 100 mm diameter explosive charge wherein severe damage and fragmentation occurred of the cylinder . The hydrocode simulations results show that the 16 mm explosive charge diameter Comp B will produce the desired radial expansion in OFHC copper for post mortem analysis. Increasing the explosive charge diameter Comp B beyond 16 mm will produce severe fracture and fragmentation which may not be useful for extracting pertinent data.

Obviously many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.
