This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 796 462 filed on Mar. 12 2013 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 913 425 which is incorporated herein by reference.

Phase change memories use phase change materials i.e. materials that may be electrically switched between amorphous and crystalline states as an electronic memory. One type of memory element utilizes a phase change material that may be in one application electrically switched between generally amorphous and generally crystalline local orders or between detectable states of local order across the entire spectrum between completely amorphous and completely crystalline states.

Typical materials suitable for such an application include various chalcogenide elements. The state of the phase change materials is also non volatile. When the memory is set in either a crystalline semi crystalline amorphous or semi amorphous state representing a resistance value that value is retained until reprogrammed even if power is removed. This is because the program value represents a phase or physical state of the material e.g. crystalline or amorphous .

The state of the phase change materials is also non volatile in that when set in either a crystalline semi crystalline amorphous or semi amorphous state representing a resistance value that value is retained until changed by another programming event as that value represents a phase or physical state of the material e.g. crystalline or amorphous . The state is unaffected by removing electrical power.

Reference will now be made to the exemplary embodiments illustrated and specific language will be used herein to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope or to specific invention embodiments is thereby intended.

Before invention embodiments are disclosed and described it is to be understood that no limitation to the particular structures process steps or materials disclosed herein is intended but also includes equivalents thereof as would be recognized by those ordinarily skilled in the relevant arts. It should also be understood that terminology employed herein is used for the purpose of describing particular examples only and is not intended to be limiting. The same reference numerals in different drawings represent the same element. Numbers provided in flow charts and processes are provided for clarity in illustrating steps and operations and do not necessarily indicate a particular order or sequence.

An initial overview of technology embodiments is provided below and specific technology embodiments are then described in further detail. This initial summary is intended to aid readers in understanding the technology more quickly but is not intended to identify key or essential features of the technology nor is it intended to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Phase change memory is capable of relatively fast bit alterable writes such as compared to NAND memory. However phase change memory write speeds may be slower than DRAM Dynamic Random Access Memory write speeds. A goal of phase change memory designers is to provide for read and write speeds which may be comparable to DRAM while maintaining an area die size comparable to NAND while also keeping energy reasonably low. For example a cost of the relatively fast write speed of phase change memory as compared to NAND memory is higher per bit energy than is used in NAND technologies.

Certain embodiments of the present technology provide programmable write mask architecture for phase change memory that allows selective configuration of desired write behavior. For example write data mask behavior for each of the bits in an array may be configured from a central location. Different configurations can be used for different write algorithms and behavior can be reconfigured post silicon using fuses.

Referring to a table including bitwise mask logic is illustrated in accordance with an example of the present technology. According to the table in any combination of incoming desired data and previously sensed data may allow or inhibit a subsequent set or reset pulse. For example a sequence controller may send mask logic to cells in an array. The different settings in the logic such as the eight settings illustrated in the table of can be placed in fuses temporary registers or other storage for individual cells. It is noted that the logic in is exemplary and various different configurations may be implemented to allow different operations at the cells when incoming data is received depending on the current mask.

The table in illustrates different potential combinations of incoming and existing data shown as Data In and Old Data respectively . A 1 in data may indicate that a bit is set or is to be set while a 0 in data may indicate that a bit is reset or to be reset. Various operations may be performed based on a desired programming method or based on how the incoming data compares with the existing data. For example where incoming data and existing data are the same for a given bit such as both incoming data and existing data indicating a 1 or a 0 no programming may be performed on the bit. Where existing data is a 1 and incoming data is a 0 the bit may be reset. Where existing data is a 0 and incoming data is a 1 the bit may be set.

The mask may include a number of configurations for setting and or resetting a bit. A 1 in the mask may indicate to inhibit an action such as set or reset actions. A 0 in the mask may indicate to allow an action. Thus setmask settings may include for example 

The table of may be a programmable truth table for bitwise mask logic that may be reprogrammed to configurations different than the configuration illustrated in order to perform different options based on a desired programming method some examples of which are described later. Also while the table of illustrates the use of eight mask settings including four setmask settings and four resetmask settings a different number of settings may also be used to implement various embodiments of the present technology.

Referring to it can be seen that the settings defined by the mask may be routed to the bits or cells in an array. For example each of the settings r pass 00 through s pass 11 may be routed to each of the bits i.e. bit through bit . While illustrates four bits in an array any number of bits may be included in an individual array and an actual implementation may include many more bits than the simplified example illustrated.

Each of the bits in the array may include a sense amplifier or sense latch i.e. data sense that holds data read from the array i.e. existing data or old data as in . A separate data in signal data in through data in may be routed to each bit. Each bit can have any of the 4 combinations of data in and data sense i.e. 00 01 10 and 11 .

Referring to within each bit may be a receiver for receiving the mask configuration. The receiver may evaluate the combination of data in and data sense along with the eight global mask signals r pass 00 01 10 11 and s pass 00 01 10 11. The receiver may determine whether to inhibit or prevent i.e. mask out a set pulse or a reset pulse based on the combination of data in and data sense along with the eight global mask signals. The set and reset masks may be latched into the receiver with a global clk maskload signal. When a write operation begins the write operation may apply set and reset pulses to the bits that have clear or uninhibited masks for setting or resetting. In other words bits that allow a set operation will have a set write operation applied thereto and bits that allow a reset operation will have a reset write operation applied thereto. In the example illustrated the receiver includes one or more AND OR INVERT gates followed by an inverter for set and reset mask applications. However the receiver may also be implemented with different logic gates. In practice the receiver may receive a mask configuration from a sequence controller or other device configured to define or dictate the mask configuration. The receiver may receive the existing data i.e. data sense and the incoming data i.e. data in in parallel with receipt of the mask configuration. The receiver may then evaluate the existing and incoming data in light of the received mask configuration to determine whether to allow or inhibit a set action and whether to allow or inhibit a reset action.

Previous technologies have implemented write masking but the write masking has been hard wired into write circuits. For example some NOR gate memory designs may use a single write mask bit that either allows programming or not. However phase change memory technology is not as mature as NAND and DRAM technologies and thus may have to be more flexible with how the read and write methods are implemented as compared to read and write algorithms for NAND and DRAM. Embodiments of the present technology provide examples of flexibility where write masking is not hard wired into write circuits but is instead programmable and reconfigurable even at run time. It is noted that some memory devices utilizing certain embodiments of the present technology while having programmable write masks may be programmed to operate in a defined manner without enabling run time variations. For example a memory device may be manufactured and then tested to determine which of a plurality of programming methods performs best for the memory device and then such programming method may be implemented via the programmable mask. Some example programming methods will now be described.

To decrease overall write energy previous or existing data in an array may be read and compared to incoming data. If a bit state is changed from the existing data to the incoming data then such bits may be programmed but programming may be avoided when the existing data and the incoming data for a particular cell matches. For example if a cell in the array is set 1 and the incoming bit data indicates a 1 an operation may not be performed on this bit. The data may be left unchanged so that energy is not spent programming this bit. On average considering random previous data in the array and random incoming data 25 of the bits will be set and 25 reset. Thus such a programming strategy may reduce energy costs by as much as 50 on average. To see this energy reduction there may be circuits that store the set and reset rules for every bit programmed in parallel. This example may be implemented through the programmable mask using a truth table similar to the table of .

It is noted however that there may be situations where using an energy saving programming method is not desired. For example a user may desire to ignore the existing array data and write data to the array based on the incoming pattern regardless of what may be currently programmed. Such a strategy may be used for example to reset all the cells first and then set some of the cells based on an incoming data pattern. As another example such a strategy may be used alternatively to first set all the cells and then reset some of the cells based on an incoming data pattern. In another example no cells may be set and cells that are a 0 in the incoming data pattern may be reset.

As has been described previously the selection of programming methods for programming the cells may be performed post manufacture as desired. In some instances manufactured memory chips may exhibit unforeseen difficulties with programming cells as desired. However using various embodiments of the present technology a programming method may be changed post manufacture to a different programming method that may not exhibit the same unforeseen difficulties.

In one example programming profiles can be saved for different programming methods such as a standard low energy write a force write and so forth as example programming methods . These profiles can be reconfigured post manufacture to change the write behavior of the memory device. The profiles may be implemented or routed to the cells in an array to change the write behavior for different write operations e.g. a standard write versus a force write or to address a technology limitation post manufacture e.g. lowest energy for set bits but force write for reset bits .

In some examples a system may include circuitry software or firmware to periodically change a mask. In other words a sequence controller or other device may generate or route mask settings which change at predetermined intervals or when predetermined conditions are met such as for write operations when data integrity is considered more important than writing with low energy consumption or when a threshold level of read errors is exceeded and a force write is desired. In one example mask settings may be routed to the cells in parallel with each receipt of incoming data at the cells. In another example mask settings may be stored at the receiver until new mask settings are received such as when the settings are to be changed for a particular write operation.

Embodiments of the present technology allow the use of more than one write masking method. Embodiments of the present technology also allow the write masks to be reconfigured for different chip operations or to implement write procedures differently. In addition certain embodiments of the present technology may provide for one or more global configurations of the masking logic that can be changed dynamically or may be saved without changing. The mask configurations can facilitate set or reset pulsing based on any combination of individual bit data in and existing data. The mask configuration receiver in each bit s control circuit can change the behavior of the write masking based on the mask configuration received.

Referring to in one embodiment the present technology may further be utilized to improve phase change memory write time area and energy using a single thread controller to perform simultaneous reset and set pulses.

Conventional memory technologies perform write operations with serially executed reset and set pulses. However performing reset and set operations at the same time can improve write time for phase change memory. The simultaneous set and reset operations can be performed with a single thread controller because the set pulse is longer than the reset pulse. For example the set pulse may be started on some bits the reset pulse concurrently or subsequently started and then ended on some bits and afterward the set pulse may be ended on the bits that had the set pulse running. In accordance with embodiments of the present technology the per bit masks allow each bit to know whether to respond to the controller s signals to allow a set pulse to allow a reset pulse or to ignore the set and reset pulses i.e. to inhibit the bit .

In pre read and mask load operations may be run on bits in parallel. The pre read operation may load the existing data i.e. old data as well as the incoming data i.e. data in . Additionally the pre read operation may receive mask configuration data in parallel with the old data and data in. The mask load operation may load a mask by using the old and incoming data to determine whether to make the reset mask and set mask 0 i.e. allow a reset or set operation for that bit or 1 i.e. do not allow a reset or set operation for that bit . The logic for that may follow a truth table such as the table illustrated in .

A macro may be run in the controller that sends signals to begin a set pulse i.e. set start . These signals may be received on bits that have a mask with set mask 0. Bit in this example has a set mask equal to 0. Other bits with set mask 1 will ignore the set start signal. A reset macro may be run in the controller that sends signals to do the reset pulse . These signals may be received for bits with reset mask 0. Bit in this example has a reset mask equal to 0. Other bits with reset mask 1 will ignore the reset start signal. In the illustrated example bits and have set mask 1 and reset mask 1 and will thus ignore the set and reset signals.

A single operation such as set or reset may be performed on a given cell at a given time. The bit logic may be designed such that if a reset pulse is received while the set pulse is running the reset pulse will be inhibited. Thus bits which are to be set may optionally have both set mask 0 and reset mask 0 without detrimental effect since the reset cannot be performed on the bits being set while the bits are being set.

Because the set operation may be longer in time duration than the reset operation a delay may be provided for the bits running the set pulse to continue. After the delay the set pulse may be ended .

In some examples a set pulse may have a sufficient duration that multiple reset pulses may be sent to an individual bit during the duration of a single set pulse. For instance if a desired voltage threshold is not reached at the bit to be reset after an initial reset pulse a subsequent reset pulse may be sent in place of or during the delay while waiting for the set pulse to be completed in order to achieve the desired voltage threshold.

It is noted that NOR and NAND memory designs do not allow programming while erasing e.g. reset during set due to technology limitations. For example in NOR write masks are 1 bit per cell and can only store a program or do not program value. NAND designs store multiple data per bit for multi level cell programming but the Vth placement operations on the array are done serially.

Conventional phase change memory technologies may allow a bit alterable write but the set and reset pulses are controlled by global circuits and will perform the operations in series.

Rather than duplicate entire circuits and run each circuit in a different mode to implement simultaneous reset and set operations in at least one embodiment the present technology can use a single controller circuit and smaller repeated receivers. The receivers may store two bits of mask information to allow or block actions coming from the controller. The two bits of mask information may be determined based on received mask configuration signals existing data and incoming data.

The simultaneous set and reset operations initiated serially may be accomplished through the programmable masks implemented in various embodiments of the present technology or using fixed or non programmable masks.

In one embodiment the phase change material used in the storage device may be suitable for non volatile memory data storage. The phase change material may be a material having electrical properties e.g. resistance that may be changed through the application of energy such as for example heat light voltage potential or electrical current.

Examples of phase change materials may include a chalcogenide material. A chalcogenide material may be a material that includes at least one element from column VI of the periodic table or may be a material that includes one or more of the chalcogen elements e.g. any of the elements of tellurium sulfur or selenium. Chalcogenide materials may be non volatile memory materials that may be used to store information that is retained even after electrical power is removed.

In one embodiment the phase change material may be a chalcogenide element composition from the class of tellurium germanium antimony TeGeSb material or a GeSbTe alloy such as type 2 2 5 although other suitable chalcogenide materials may be used and should be considered within the scope of the disclosure.

In one embodiment if the memory material is a non volatile phase change material the memory material may be programmed into one of at least two memory states by applying an electrical signal to the memory material. An electrical signal may alter the phase of the memory material between a substantially crystalline state and a substantially amorphous state wherein the electrical resistance of the memory material in the substantially amorphous state is greater than the resistance of the memory material in the substantially crystalline state.

Programming of the memory material to alter the state or phase of the material may be accomplished by selecting the cell through applying a relatively low voltage such as zero volts to the selected line and a current into the selected column from one current source to reset a cell to a higher resistance or from another current source with a lower current or slower trailing edge to reset to a lower resistance thereby generating a voltage potential across the memory material. An electrical current may flow through a portion of the memory material in response to the applied voltage potentials and may result in heating of the memory material.

This controlled heating and subsequent controlled cooling may alter the memory state or phase of the memory material. Altering the phase or state of the memory material may alter an electrical characteristic of the memory material. For example resistance of the material may be altered by altering the phase of the memory material. Either all or a portion of the phase change memory material may be altered during the writing pulse. In one example a portion of memory material that undergoes phase change may be a region that is adjacent to an electrode contacting the storage device of the cell for storing the bit. The memory material may be a programmable resistive material or simply a programmable resistance material.

In one embodiment a voltage pulse with a potential difference of about 1.5 volts may be applied across a portion of the memory material by applying about 0 volts to a line and a current of about 2 mA from a write current source into a different selected line. For example the voltage on one selected line relative to another selected line may be positive or the cell or voltages may be reversed. A current flowing through the memory material in response to the applied voltage potentials may result in heating of the memory material. This heating and subsequent controlled cooling determined by the write current pulse trailing edge rate may alter the memory state or phase of the material after the memory material is cooled from higher to lower resistance from lower to higher resistance or to rewrite the existing state to reinforce the existing state.

In a reset state the memory material may be in an amorphous or semi amorphous state and in a set state the memory material may be in a crystalline or semi crystalline state. The resistance of the memory material in the amorphous or semi amorphous state may be greater than the resistance of the material in the crystalline or semi crystalline state. The association of reset and set with amorphous and crystalline states respectively is a convention. Other conventions may be adopted.

The information stored in memory material may be read by measuring the resistance of the memory material. As an example a read current may be provided to the memory material using the selected row and column and a resulting read voltage across the memory material may be compared against a reference voltage. The resulting read voltage on the column may be proportional to the resistance exhibited by the selected memory storage device when a read current is forced into the column.

With reference to Example 1 is a flow diagram of a method for writing data to a phase change memory array in accordance with an example of the present technology. The method may include identifying mask logic for masking cells in the phase change memory array and routing the mask logic to the cells. The method may further include routing input data to the cells. Existing data in the cells may be read . Set and reset pulses for the cells may be selectively prevented or inhibited based on the mask logic and further based on the input data and the existing data.

In one example of the method the mask logic may be defined by a profile for an identified operation selected for bit alterable writing to the phase change memory array. Any number of profiles with different mask logic may be available. In other words the profile may be one of a plurality of profiles each associated with different mask logic. At least one of the plurality of profiles may be an energy saving profile and another at least one of the plurality of profiles may be a force write profile. At least one of the plurality of profiles may be a reset or set pulse minimizing profile and another at least one of the plurality of profiles may be a forced set or reset pulse applied to all cells profile. Other profiles are also contemplated and are considered to be within the scope of this disclosure.

In one example the mask logic may be programmable. For example the method may include altering an existing mask logic to an altered mask logic. The existing mask logic may be altered to an altered mask logic. The method may also include reverting the altered mask logic to the existing mask logic after the altered mask logic is routed to the cells. In some examples the existing mask logic may be altered to the altered mask logic or the altered mask logic reverted to the existing mask logic at predetermined intervals. Logic for altering the mask logic or for alternating between mask logic may be based on time read cycles write cycles cell measurement or any of a variety of other factors.

In one example a combination of existing data and the input data may be compared to the mask logic to obtain a result. A determination may be made as to whether to prevent a set or reset pulse based on the result.

In one example the method may include sending a set pulse to set cells not inhibited by the mask logic and subsequently sending a reset pulse to reset cells not inhibited by the mask logic before the set pulse is complete. The method may also include delaying further operations until the set pulse is complete and or performing additional reset operations or rather sending additional reset pulses before the set pulse is complete.
