The invention described was made in the performance of official duties by one or more employees of the Department of the Navy and thus the invention herein may be manufactured used or licensed by or for the Government of the United States of America for governmental purposes without the payment of any royalties thereon or therefor.

The present invention generally relates to absorbent polymers. In particular the invention relates more specifically to reinforcing fiber of absorbent polymers to increase the shear and tensile mechanical strength of absorbent polymers without significantly decreasing their absorption capacity.

Absorbent polymers are known in various technologies. For example absorbent polymers can be used to absorb hydrocarbons from an aqueous medium such as the absorption of oil from water. In some configurations conventional absorbent polymers are contained within a permeable material. For example conventional spill socks and booms can hold an absorbent polymer within a fabric to enable the absorbent polymer to be applied directly to the site of interest. Moreover conventional absorbent booms can float on a water surface to help contain a spill from spreading beyond the boom. This application however requires the absorbent polymer to be contained within a permeable membrane or fabric.

In other configurations conventional absorbent polymers are applied as a powder to a water surface. The absorbent may absorb the hydrocarbon and even gel together. This process however requires the removal of the resulting gel formed from the swelled absorbent polymer. The resulting gel can lack adequate shear and tensile mechanical strength and may be difficult to remove.

Consequently a need exists for an absorbent polymer that has an enhanced shear and tensile mechanical strength to facilitate recovery of the polymer after absorbing the desired liquid. Conventional absorbent polymers yield disadvantages addressed by various exemplary embodiments of the present invention. In particular various exemplary embodiments provide a reinforced absorbent polymer includes an absorbent polymer and a reinforcing fiber disposed in the polymer such that the reinforcing fiber facilitates the absorbent polymer to expand while absorbing the liquid.

In the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments of the invention reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration specific exemplary embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and logical mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense and the scope of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.

This disclosure relates generally to fiber reinforced absorbent polymers and techniques for improving the mechanical properties of absorbent polymers without compromising their absorption performance. This process can be achieved through the incorporation of fibers of a material with a high mechanical strength relative to that of the absorbent polymer. There are numerous possible configurations for reinforcing fiber but the performance can be optimized upon satisfaction of the following criteria 

Exemplary arrangements of an absorbent polymer that satisfy the above described criteria are described by the following configurations as specific examples not intended to limit the scope of the invention. As used herein the term fiber or reinforcing fiber describes any fiber material suitable for operation in an absorbent polymer. Examples of these fibers include nylon rayon Kevlar polyethylene polypropylene glass metal and the like. As used herein the term absorbent polymer refers to a polymer that can absorb a target liquid. Exemplary absorbent polymers include polyacrylic acid polyamide and similar materials.

Prior to absorption the fibers have a length sufficient to accommodate the expansion of the polymer . The fibers can either extend beyond the polymer as shown in view or largely codirectional fiber segments of appropriate length can be offset within the material to provide fiber reinforcement throughout the fiber alignment direction.

While views and show the rod shape of the polymer being cylindrical other geometric and non geometric rod shapes may be contemplated within the scope of the present invention. For example the polymer could be formed as a rectangular or triangular shaped rod. The fiber reinforced absorbent polymers may be used for various purposes. For example the fiber reinforced absorbent polymers may be used for chemical spills oil spills and the like.

The fibers are embedded into the polymer by their disposition in the pre polymer mixture monomers solvent constituent polymers etc. and subsequently performing the polymerization. To ensure slippage at the interface between the fibers and the polymer the fiber surface should be as smooth as possible insoluble in the pre polymer mixture and chemically inert under the polymerization conditions.

The fibers can be of arbitrary length provided they are largely codirectional enable the desired level of expansion and permit slippage at the fiber to polymer interface within the desired time frame. Typical fiber lengths range from millimeters to meters. The fiber diameter can also be adjusted to attain the desired mechanical properties with a typical range of 10 nm to 1 mm. The reinforced polymer can be of arbitrary size and form factor. In addition the reinforcement can be implemented in either a batch or continuous process.

The reinforcing fiber and absorbent polymer form an interface having appropriate surface tension sliding past each other during volume expansion of said absorbent polymer caused by absorption of the liquid. For liquids surface tension force per unit length corresponds also to surface energy density effectively energy per unit area or flux . Water for example has a value of 0.072 newtons per meter or joules per square meter. Interfaces with low energy density possess more complete wetting spreading of the liquid along a surface and shallower contact angles than interfaces with high energy density. For purposes of this disclosure the surface tension should be sufficiently low to enable the fiber to slip past the polymer while avoiding being pulled through effectively being ejected and thereby unable to provide structural reinforcement to the polymer.

While certain features of the embodiments of the invention have been illustrated as described herein many modifications substitutions changes and equivalents will now occur to those skilled in the art. It is therefore to be understood that the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications and changes as fall within the true spirit of the embodiments.
