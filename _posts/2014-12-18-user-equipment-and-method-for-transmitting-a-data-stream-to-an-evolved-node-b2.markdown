title: User equipment and method for transmitting a data stream to an evolved node B
abstract: In a wireless network, a user equipment (UE) can communicate with an Evolved Node B (eNodeB). During at least some times, the UE transmits a data stream to the eNodeB, over one of several available antenna states on the UE. The antenna states can include one or more tuning states for each antenna port on the UE. At predetermined times, which can be periodic, the UE ceases transmission of the data stream, transmits a test signal sequentially over each of its antenna states, receives a signal back from the eNodeB indicating which of the antenna states provides the strongest signal, and switches to the indicated antenna state. After switching, the UE can resume transmission of the data stream over the indicated antenna state. In some examples, the UE can repeat the antenna tuning/retuning process periodically.

In some examples the UE can include circuitry which can include the antenna tuner elements A B the transceivers A B and or the MIMO modem .

At method can transmit to the eNodeB a first portion of the data stream over a first antenna state of the plurality of antenna states. At method can sequentially transmit to the eNodeB a test signal over each antenna state in the plurality. In some examples the test signal can be the same for each antenna state. In other examples the test signal can differ for at least two of the antenna states. In some examples the test signal can include one or more pulses at a specified frequency. At method can receive from the eNodeB an indication that the test signal transmitted on a second antenna state of the plurality of antenna states is stronger at the eNodeB than the test signal transmitted on the first antenna state. In some examples the indication from the eNodeB can specify which of the antenna states provides the strongest reception at the eNodeB. In some examples the indication from the eNodeB can specify that the second antenna state provides the strongest reception at the eNodeB. At method can transmit to the eNodeB a second portion of the data stream on the second antenna state.

In some examples the UE can further include at least one antenna port. In some of these examples the UE can further include at least one transceiver having a radio frequency front end RFFE that can apply a selectable tuning state to a respective antenna port. In these examples each antenna state can comprise a unique combination of antenna port and tuning state. In these examples the RFFE can select each tuning state by applying at least one of a selectable impedance or a selectable aperture to the respective antenna port. In some of these examples the number of antenna states in the plurality can exceed a number of antenna ports on the UE. In some examples the UE can further include at least one antenna electrically coupled to a respective antenna port.

In some examples the sequential transmission can begin and end at first and second predetermined times during the data stream transmission. In some of these examples between third and fourth predetermined times during the data stream transmission the UE can sequentially transmit to the eNodeB a test signal on each antenna state in the plurality. In some of these examples the UE can receive from the eNodeB an indication that a third antenna state of the plurality of antenna states provides the strongest of the received test signals at the eNodeB. In some of these examples the UE can transmit to the eNodeB a third portion of the data stream on the third antenna state.

In some examples elements can be repeated periodically for instance at predetermined times during the data stream transmission.

In a specific example in a wireless network a UE such as can communicate with an eNodeB such as . In this example during at least some times the UE transmits a data stream to the eNodeB over one of several available antenna states on the UE . In this example the antenna states can include one or more tuning states for each antenna port such as A B on the UE . In this example at predetermined times which can be periodic the UE ceases transmission of the data stream transmits a test signal sequentially on each of its antenna states receives a signal back from the eNodeB indicating which of the antenna states provides the strongest signal and switches to the indicated antenna state. After switching the UE can resume transmission of the data stream over the indicated antenna state. In some examples the UE can repeat the antenna tuning retuning process periodically.

Updating the UE to use the antenna state that produces the strongest signal at the eNodeB can improve the performance of the UE particularly if the UE moves with respect to the eNodeB . For example if the UE is a cellular telephone updating the cellular telephone to use the antenna state that produces the strongest signal at the eNodeB can improve the link quality between the eNodeB and the UE and in some cases can help reduce instances of dropped calls or improve the link data rate throughput . In some examples tuning the UE antenna s such as A B using feedback from the eNodeB can be applied to Long Term Evolution LTE Frequency Division Duplex FDD and Time Division Duplex TDD networks and can be implemented with changes to the existing LTE standard.

Using feedback from the eNodeB allows the UE to tune its antennas A B in a closed loop manner This represents a significant improvement over tuning protocols that operate in an open loop manner and do not use feedback from the eNodeB . Some examples of open loop antenna tuning protocols can use a number of passive antenna elements corresponding to a multiple input and multiple output MIMO order supported by a UE category. Some examples of open loop antenna tuning protocols can integrate switch diversity configurations. Some examples of open loop antenna tuning protocols can drive antenna selection by external sensor inputs or by an antenna selective precoding matrix feedback mechanism available in a technical specification such as the LTE Release specification. Some examples of open loop antenna tuning protocols can couple the number of UE antenna tuning states to the number of UE antenna ports such as A B thereby restricting the number of available UE antenna tuning states. By decoupling the UE antenna states from the number of UE antenna ports A B the closed loop tuning protocol discussed herein can increase the number of available antenna tuning states beyond a fixed number of MIMO modem transceiver elements such as A B which correspond to the number of antenna ports A B. The closed loop tuning protocol discussed herein differs from digital beamforming in that the closed loop tuning protocol discussed herein can use analog circuitry to modify the antenna response of the UE by searching over the analog RF states of the tunable antenna.

At the MIMO modem can transmit to the eNodeB a first portion of the data stream over a first antenna state of the plurality of antenna states. The first portion transmission can cease at a first predetermined time.

At the MIMO modem can sequentially transmit to the eNodeB a test signal over each antenna state in the plurality. The antenna states can include the combinations of antenna and tuning state and or combinations of antenna port and tuning state. The sequential transmission can begin at a second predetermined time.

At the MIMO modem can receive from the eNodeB an indication that the test signal transmitted over a second antenna state of the plurality of antenna states is stronger than the test signal transmitted over the first antenna state. In some examples the MIMO modem can receive from the eNodeB an indication that a second antenna state of the plurality of antenna states provides the strongest of the received test signals at the eNodeB. The receiving can begin at a third predetermined time.

At the MIMO modem can transmit to the eNodeB a second portion of the data stream over the second antenna state. The second portion transmission can begin at a fourth predetermined time. In some examples the first and second antenna states are different in other examples the first and second antenna states are the same.

In some examples the sequence of can repeat periodically. For instance the MIMO modem can cease transmitting to the eNodeB the second portion of the data stream over the second antenna state at a fifth predetermined time. At the MIMO modem can sequentially transmit to the eNodeB a test signal over each antenna state in the plurality beginning at a sixth predetermined time. At the MIMO modem can receive an indication that the test signal transmitted over a second antenna state of the plurality of antenna states is stronger than the test signal transmitted over the first antenna state. In some examples the MIMO modem can receive from the eNodeB an indication that a third antenna state of the plurality of antenna states provides the strongest of the received test signals at the eNodeB at a seventh predetermined time. At the MIMO modem can transmit to the eNodeB a third portion of the data stream over the third antenna state beginning at an eighth predetermined time. In some examples the second and third antenna states are different in other examples the second and third antenna states are the same. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily understand that is not drawn to scale.

In some examples each antenna state includes a combination of antenna and tuning state for the antenna. In some examples each antenna state is a unique combination of antenna and tuning state. In some examples two different antenna states include the same antenna and different tuning states. In some examples two different antenna states include different antennas and the same tuning state. In some examples two different antenna states include different antennas and different tuning states.

The following discussion and figures and describe specific examples of how a wireless network would implement the antenna retuning described above and shown in . For instance the communication protocols of can be incorporated into a wireless network standard that governs communication between UEs and eNodeBs in the network.

Prior to each dedicated SRS transmission that is part of the eNodeB controlled antenna tuning process the UE selects a new antenna state and transmits the dedicated SRS. Such a subframe is termed the Antenna Tuning Subframe ATSF . For example if the UE includes four antennas and three tuning states per antenna totaling 3 or 81 antenna states then the UE performs 81 SRS transmissions to the eNodeB with one SRS transmission in each antenna state. Upon completion of the SRS transmissions the eNodeB has a set of measurements of the uplink SRS transmissions across a number of UE antenna states and can signal back to the UE the preferred state. The eNodeB can also signal the Rank Indicator and Precoding Matrix RI PMI information associated with the preferred UE antenna state. In some examples the eNodeB can additionally signal other information about the tuning selection or measurements made at the eNodeB to enhance performance.

In some examples the antenna retuning process discussed herein is accomplished with changes only in the physical layer. This is referred to as the physical layer approach which is shown in and discussed below.

At the SRS channel and the dedicated SRS configuration for the UE via upper layer messaging are established. The establishing can be performed by the eNodeB by the UE or by an additional element connected to the wireless network.

At the eNodeB sends the modified DCI Format 4 message to the UE with the SRS Request field set to select one of the pre configured SRS parameter sets and with the SRS Report field set to to trigger the start of the antenna tuning process at the UE.

At upon receiving the message the UE tunes its antenna to a new antenna state the UE transmits the dedicated SRS and the UE tunes its antenna state back to its previous operating antenna state. The eNodeB scheduler implementation can help reduce errors in the downlink by not scheduling PDSCH transmissions to the UE during the subframes that contain dedicated SRS transmissions used in this antenna tuning procedure.

At the eNodeB sends a DCI Format 4 message to the UE to triggers the UE to advance to the next antenna state.

At and the eNodeB and UE repeat elements and until there are N antenna state transmissions from the UE to the eNodeB. N can be less than or equal to the maximum integer that can be represented by the number of bits of the SRS report field minus 1.

As the eNodeB collects the dedicated SRS transmissions over N UE antenna tuning states the eNodeB computes a figure of merit that allows it to select the optimal UE antenna tuning state. At the eNodeB transmits the modified DCI Format 4 message to the UE with the SRS Report field set to the ATSF index corresponding to the eNodeB s choice of the optimal UE antenna tuning state along with the RI PMI information corresponding to this UE antenna tuning state. The UE then tunes its antenna to the state indicated by the eNodeB re synchronizes to the channel and continues operation with the new antenna state.

In some examples the antenna retuning process discussed herein is accomplished with changes only in the MAC layer specification. The MAC layer specification approach would reuse the existing sounding procedure in the physical layer available in LTE Release . This is referred to as the upper layer approach which is shown in and discussed below.

At the SRS channel and the dedicated SRS configuration for the UE via upper layer messaging are established. The establishing can be performed by the eNodeB by the UE or by an additional element connected to the wireless network.

At the eNodeB sends an upper layer antenna tuning configuration message such as the message of to the UE. The message sets the field srs atsfCountReset to TRUE.

At the eNode B sends a DCI Format 4 message with an SRS request to the UE with the SRS Request field set to select one of the pre configured SRS parameter sets.

At upon receiving the message the UE tunes its antenna to a new antenna state UE transmits the dedicated SRS and tunes its antenna state back to its previous operating antenna state.

At and the eNodeB and UE repeat elements and and until there are N antenna state transmissions from the UE to the eNodeB. In this example N can be less than or equal .

At the eNodeB sends an upper layer antenna tuning configuration message such as the message of to the UE. The message sets the field srs atsfCountReset to FALSE.

As the eNodeB collects the dedicated SRS transmissions over N UE antenna tuning states the eNodeB computes a figure of merit that allows it to select the optimal UE antenna tuning state. At the eNodeB transmits the modified DCI Format 4 message to the UE communicating the eNodeB s choice of the optimal UE antenna tuning state along with the RI PMI information corresponding to this UE antenna tuning state. The UE then tunes its antenna to the state indicated by the eNodeB re synchronizes to the channel and continues operation with the new antenna state.

There can be instances when a network does not support eNodeB control for example in a legacy network. For these instances a legacy fallback mode for antenna tuning can allow a UE to tune its antennas using signals from the eNodeB while operating in a legacy network. To determine an optimal tuning state for each antenna the UE seeks intervals in the LTE downlink to select a new tuning state and to receive the known reference signal from the eNodeB. These intervals are termed antenna tuning zones ATZ .

Element shows an example of an ATZ over a full subframe. At the UE determines from prior PDCCH information that it does not expect any control data from the eNodeB in this subframe and it designates the entire subframe as ATZ.

At during the current LTE frame Frame0 the UE receives all data scheduled for UE utilizing the current antenna tuning state.

At during an ATZ the UE determines that a new antenna tuning state is preferred over the current antenna tuning state. During the ATZ the UE selects a new antenna tuning state receives the reference signal sequence from the eNodeB estimates the channel fading coefficients and calculates the antenna tuning optimization metric based on these coefficients. To improve the performance of the metric the UE can also receive and demodulate the PDCCH in the case of ATZ over a full subframe and or the UE can receive and demodulate other users data in the PDSCH providing the UE with a more robust estimate of the SINR . Upon completion of the ATZ the UE tunes the antenna back to its current state and completes the reception of the current LTE frame. Any tuning transition time can be included within the ATZ in order to enable the UE to receive all scheduled data for the UE.
