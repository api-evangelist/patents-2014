This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 791 805 filed Mar. 15 2013 the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to electrical stimulation and for example to a functional electrical stimulation device and system.

The general principles of functional electrical stimulation FES are rooted in the physiological process of nerve and muscle excitation. These excitations are a result of action potentials APs that occur in the body at the neuronal and muscular levels. APs are the messenger signals for the neuromuscular system. They occur in muscle and nervous system tissues in response to stimuli which can be natural or artificial. In the case of FES these stimuli are charge pulses. Depending on the amplitude duration and frequency of these stimuli they can cause excitation in different tissues. FES therapies use these excitation pulses to treat patients with impairments in different areas of the body. Owing to the complexity of generating APs the artificial electrical stimulation pulses which can generate these APs may require particular pulse types and stimulation schemes for FES applications.

All body cells display a membrane potential which is a separation of positive and negative charges across the membrane. This potential is related to the uneven distribution of potassium ions K ions sodium ions Na ions and large intracellular protein anions between the intracellular and extracellular fluid and to the differential permeability of the plasma membrane to these ions and to activate ion pump mechanisms.

Two types of cells muscle cells and nerve cells have developed specialized use for this membrane potential. Nerve and muscle are excitable tissues that produce action potentials when their resting potentials change through excitation or other biological processes. Action potentials allow nerve and muscle cells to communicate. FES uses artificial stimuli in the form of electrical pulses to elicit excitation in different tissues.

Neuromuscular electrical stimulation NMES is one of the useful therapeutic methods to improve motor function. Studies examining the use of NMES have demonstrated improvements in joint range of motion force and torque production magnitude of electromyographic EMG muscular activity and muscle tone. Functional electrical stimulation FES is a device mediated therapy that integrates electrical stimulation of sensory motor systems and repetitive functional movement of the paretic limb or a body part or a body function in patients with different forms of neuromuscular disorder such as stroke spinal cord injury multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy and traumatic brain injury to name a few.

Some known FES devices although useful have had limited success at reaching their full potential. For example some previous devices have not been able to ensure charge balance over time because of partial control over temporal characteristics and amplitude. They also provide a limited number of pulses and require complicated and costly adjustments for use in different FES applications.

Nonetheless various functional electrical stimulators have been used over time to improve the lives of patients with various neurological and musculoskeletal disorders and muscular atrophies as well as in therapy for sport injuries. Known FES devices provide electrical pulses activating a single or a group of muscles to create a movement neuroprosthetic applications and or build up the muscle mass neuromuscular stimulation applications . FES devices have also been used in treating bladder problems easing the symptoms of Parkinson s disease and numerous other applications. Generally for each application a specific FES system is used.

Some existing known stimulators typically produce either voltage or current regulated electrical pulses. Current regulated pulses generally deliver the same amount of charge to the tissue regardless of tissue resistance. However some existing systems which regulate current have very slow voltage rise times which can lead to high steady state current leading to discomfort.

It is recognized herein that stimulating with a very fast voltage rise time e.g. 10 to 20 ns results in significantly less steady state current required to achieve the same stimulation. It is recognized herein that a fast rise time may assist to reduce the stimulation intensity applied to the patient.

Other aims objects advantages and features of the example embodiments and or difficulties with existing conventional systems will become more apparent upon reading of the following non restrictive description of specific embodiments thereof given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings.

With reference to the disclosure herein and the appended figures a functional electrical stimulation FES device and system and use thereof will now be described in accordance with different example embodiments.

Reference is now made to which is an example schematic representation of an equivalent circuit model for impedance of an area or region of a patient such as the skin to which example embodiments can be applied. The area of the patient can be represented by at least an associated resistance element and an associated capacitance element. In the example shown the equivalent circuit model includes a series resistance Rs and in parallel a capacitor Cp and a resistor Rp . Other more complex models may be used in other example embodiments which may include further resistance elements and or further capacitance elements. For example the electrode interface skin spreading resistance and body resistance may further add resistance elements and capacitance elements as understood in the art which may be used depending on the desired model complexity. The resistance elements and the capacitance elements of the patient can change over time for example based on physiological changes or as a response to the present FES treatment which can be e.g. 5 seconds . For example note that skin characteristics of resistance and capacitance can be significantly affected by variable factors such as moisturizers. For the model the associated total resistance of the patient area can be represented by for example Rs Rp.

By measuring patient s skin resistance at different skin points where the stimulation is delivered example embodiments of the present FES systems can be used to create patients resistance signature . For example this means that if somebody tries to use the protocols assigned to subject A we can determine when somebody tried to apply it to subject B. The patient s skin resistance signature and the stimulation amplitudes e.g. change in the amplitudes coupled with different resistance signature can be used to determine fraud or an attempt to use protocols assigned for one person person A with another person person B .

An example controlled pulse is best illustrated in which shows a plot and associated schematic diagram of a signal pulse applied to the patient in accordance with an example embodiment. The patient may have a steady state resistance value of 600 Ohms for example. Generally in accordance with at least some example embodiments there is provided a functional electrical stimulation FES system for providing pulse stimulation to an area of the patient by way of one or more electrode leads applied to the area. The FES system includes a pulse generating circuit having a controllable output voltage to generate rectangular or near rectangular constant voltage pulses to the one or more electrodes. The rising edge of the voltage pulses have a high slew rate. Because the capacitance element of the patient area e.g. as illustrated can be relatively large the corresponding current signal profile of each constant voltage pulse includes an initial inrush of current having a high slew rate which then achieves a peak or spike . The spike is followed by an exponential decay to a steady state current value . This type of current response can also be referred to as a voltage step response for example. The system can receive instructions or input from a practitioner regarding the specified target steady state current value to be applied to the area which is the desired charge dosage to the patient . The voltage of the constant voltage pulse is a calculated voltage level which achieves the specified target steady state current value to the area. For example Ohms Law V R I can be used to calculate the required voltage level dependent on the present resistance element of the patient area and the specified target steady state current value. The present resistance element of the patient can be determined in a number of ways in accordance with example embodiments as described in detail herein.

For each subsequent pulse the calculated constant voltage level of the voltage pulse is adjusted to achieve the specified target steady state current due to possible changes in patient resistance element . This voltage adjustment is made by measuring the current that is actually delivered by the target voltage determining the present electrical resistance element and then adjusting the target voltage level. The practitioner or user specifies the stimulation in terms of steady state current so that the system delivers a consistent desired charge regardless of the resistance element of the patient.

Accordingly for each pulse the voltage is regulated to a voltage level defined by a specified target steady state current of the patient so that switch activation of each pulse provides an initial inrush of current at the voltage level and wherein the resultant current achieves the specified target steady state current value. It is recognized herein that stimulating with a very fast voltage rise time e.g. 10 to 20 ns results in significantly less steady state current required to achieve the same stimulation. Note that the example embodiments use constant voltage pulses which are in contrast to and not the same as a pulse generator which merely generates a rectangular constant current pulse.

In the example circuit shown in the pulse generating circuit can include at least a controllable constant voltage source and a switching circuit which includes for example switches in an H bridge configuration. An alternate path is also shown which allows selective drainage of charge which is alternate from the switching circuit .

Reference is now made to which illustrate a plot of an asymmetrical pulse sequence applied to the patient in accordance with an example embodiment. is the pulse sequence applied as a pulse train having a specified frequency. In an example embodiment the illustrated pulse sequences are a result of the one or more cathodes being places on the stimulation target site s on the body while the anode is placed at another suitable site to complete a nerve stimulation path. In the examples shown each pulse sequence can include a negative pulse followed by a positive pulse wherein the positive pulse is one quarter of the amplitude of the negative pulse and has a pulse width that is four times that of the negative pulse. This allows the charge across the patient area to be balanced. Other example asymmetric pulses may have different amplitude and pulse width ratios wherein net charge is balanced e.g. equal or close to zero .

Referring to the asymmetrical pulse sequence illustrates the current pulse sequence and the voltage pulse sequence as applied to the patient. At the negative pulse of the voltage pulse sequence the voltage applied is set to a constant negative voltage level e.g. V . The voltage level is calculated in dependence of the desired target steady state current value and the presently known value of the resistance element of the patient. At the positive pulse of the voltage pulse sequence the voltage is applied as a constant positive voltage level which is one quarter of the negative voltage level e.g. V and four times the pulse width of the negative pulse.

At the negative pulse of the current sequence the current pulse includes an initial inrush of current having a high slew rate which then achieves a peak or spike . The spike is followed by an exponential decay to a steady state current value . Typically the practitioner defines the parameters of the desired pulse sequence by specifying the target steady state current value and the voltage level is controlled to achieve that steady state current value .

At the positive pulse of the current sequence the current pulse includes an inrush of current having a high slew rate which then achieves a peak or spike . The spike is followed by an exponential decay to a steady state current .

Reference is now made to which illustrate a plot of a symmetrical pulse sequence applied to the patient in accordance with an example embodiment. is the pulse sequence applied as a pulse train having a specified frequency. For example the illustrated pulse sequences are a result of the one or more cathodes being places on the stimulation target site s on the body while the anode is placed at another suitable site to complete a nerve stimulation path. In the example shown each pulse sequence can include a negative pulse and a positive pulse which have equal and opposite amplitudes and which have equal pulse widths. This allows the charge across the patient area to be balanced.

Referring to the asymmetrical pulse sequence illustrates the current pulse sequence and the voltage pulse sequence as applied to the patient. At the negative pulse of the voltage pulse sequence the voltage applied is set to a constant negative voltage level e.g. V . The voltage level is calculated in dependence of the desired target steady state current value and the presently known value of the resistance element of the patient. At the positive pulse of the voltage pulse sequence the voltage is applied as a constant positive voltage level having the same amplitude as the negative voltage level e.g. V .

At the negative pulse of the current sequence referring still to the current pulse includes an initial inrush of current having a high slew rate which then achieves a peak or spike . The spike is followed by an exponential decay to a steady state current value . Typically the practitioner defines the parameters of the desired pulse sequence by specifying the target steady state current value and the voltage level is controlled by the processor to achieve that steady state current value .

At the positive pulse of the current sequence referring still to the current pulse includes an inrush of current having a high slew rate which then achieves a peak or spike . The spike is followed by an exponential decay to a steady state current .

Reference is now made to which provides a high level diagram of an FES system in accordance with one example embodiment. In this particular embodiment the FES system consists of an external system however in some example embodiments a similar system may be designed and implemented for internal implementation e.g. at least some of the elements as an implantable system . The system generally comprises an output stage comprising a power stage for creating electrical pulses and a controller that regulates operation of the power stage . The system may further include or be configured for operative coupling with one or more stimulation electrodes to deliver the pulses generated by the power stage to the targeted tissues for example through the skin e.g. surface transcutaneous electrodes directly by penetrating the body e.g. percutaneous electrodes the electrodes are directly implanted into the body at least some other parts such as a portable power source e.g. in is also implanted into the body and or at least some or all of the FES system is implanted into the body and the like. A controller for example a central processing platform or central logic is also illustratively provided to communicate intended pulse characteristics to the output stage for example external inputs from a practitioner or operator user interface e.g. via one or more activation switches dials footswitch es handswitch es and or other such user operable interfaces and or via one or more user selectable preprogrammed stimulation sequences stored or otherwise accessed by the system for implementation or from another device such as one or more physiological sensors configured to regulate or influence operation of the FES system based on one or more sensed physiological parameters. Example biological signals that that may be used to drive the FES system can include for example EMG signals brain signals EEG ECoG and others. Example embodiments can be applied to user interactions protocols which use such signals. For example 4 channels of EMG may be used to assist in controlling the pulse delivery. These sensed physiological parameters may be associated with or indicative as to an effectiveness of the FES treatment in question for example. Other control feedback sensors or detectors may also be considered by the central processing platform or central logic .

The structure of FES pulses for stimulation may be determined by several characteristics for example pulse type current or voltage amplitude duration rise time frequency polarity number of phases and symmetry which characteristics will be further described below.

Pulse type As noted above the provision of current regulated pulses allows the desired charge to be controlled. Inter variable and intra variable differences in tissue resistance that may affect such pulses may include but are not limited to perspiration skin movement and increased circulation that typically result from FES for example. In some exemplary embodiments of FES therapy current regulation may be preferred since a desired charge is delivered to the tissue regardless of the tissue resistance.

Pulse amplitude and duration In general an action potential is only generated if the membrane potential reaches a threshold membrane potential. From patient to patient there is a range of different tissue impedances. Also within each patient each type of tissue may have distinct impedance. Therefore different currents of FES generated pulses may be necessary to address these impedance variations. Also the type of tissue being stimulated may thus become a parameter for determining the amplitude level and the pulse duration of a given FES treatment. For example localized stimulation of small muscles generally requires shorter less intense pulses whereas deeper muscle stimulation requires higher amplitude and longer pulse duration.

Pulse rise time The rise time of current pulses may be relevant in providing enhanced FES treatments. For example if the pulse rise time is too slow the membrane potential may accommodate or adjust to the stimulus. Accordingly despite otherwise adequate stimulation pulses a threshold membrane potential may not be achieved and the desired neuro muscular excitation may not occur. Similarly an improved i.e. decreased pulse rise time may translate in lower requirements for pulse amplitude to achieve a similar stimulation. Such reductions in pulse amplitude may translate in a reduction in power consumption and a reduction in the total absolute charge being applied to the tissue which may be of particular interest in certain applications.

Pulse frequency The frequency of pulse delivery determines the rate of action potential generation in the tissue. If the stimulation frequency is at or greater than 40 Hz the generated action potentials create continuous muscle tetanic contractions. If the stimulation frequency is between 16 and 40 Hz many individuals may feel discontinuous muscle contraction non tetanic contraction however the muscles are still able to generate a functional task. For stimulation frequencies below 16 Hz continuous tetanic muscle contraction is very unlikely. The higher the stimulation frequency the faster the muscles fatigue and the lesser the discomfort experienced by the patient. Within pulse frequencies of about 0 to 100 Hz the stimulation frequency generally determines the rate of APs. Beyond 100 Hz the rate of APs in not necessarily proportional to the amount of stimulation frequency. Stimulation frequencies above 1 000 Hz may incapacitate excitable tissues and thus not generate APs.

Pulse polarity and symmetry Pulses may be monopolar positive or negative or bipolar positive and negative . Bipolar pulses can be symmetric or asymmetric. The different permutations of these characteristics are illustrated for example in .

The abovementioned characteristics define the type and shape of pulses used in FES applications. For external stimulation for example the charge balance on the tissue is preferably maintained as excess charge build up in the tissue over time can result in galvanic processes and cause significant tissue damage and pain. For this reason bipolar pulses that apply the same amount of charge in each direction are used most often in clinical practice. An asymmetric pulse with one negative phase at a given amplitude and duration and one second positive phase at one quarter the amplitude for 4 times the duration are believed to produce improved results for external FES applications however other pulse duration and amplitude ratios may also be considered in the present context without departing from the general context of the present disclosure. Depending on the application at hand improved accuracy and control on pulse stimulation parameters may allow for a more accurate and effective treatment not to mention improved patient safety and comfort levels. For example the provision of reduced pulse rise times which may effectively contribute to a reduction in pulse amplitudes energy utilized to generate desired muscle contractions tight control over pulse temporal characteristics and pulse amplitude may all contribute to a reduction in the likelihood of charge build up and thus represent a constant opportunity for FES system improvements.

With reference to and in accordance with one example embodiment an exemplary output stage is generally depicted. In this example the output stage generally comprises a first power stage operatively coupled to a power source such as a battery or the like to increase the voltage supply available to implement various FES pulse sequences parameters to a load via a switching circuit . A controller is also provided to control various operational aspects of the output stage such as voltage and or current regulation and control to regulate FES parameter values and or implement various safety procedures as well as control operation of the pulse generating circuit in accordance with one or more selectable FES treatment sequences parameters. A general FES microcontroller may also be provided in providing overall control features for example in the context of an overall FES system incorporating output stage . In one embodiment the first power stage includes a digitally controlled switch mode power supply SMPS . In order to achieve the desired pulse response time while changing the direction of the current e.g. from V to V in a short time frame in one example embodiment the first power stage can include for example four SMPS power supplies in series so that switching or relaying in of all of the power supplies can result in a total voltage V and switching or relaying in only one of the power supplies can allow the voltage supply to readily drop to V.

The switching circuit will now be described in greater detail. To produce bipolar asymmetric pulses for example stimulation must generally be switched from a positive negative current at a given amplitude followed by a current of the opposite polarity at a fraction of this amplitude e.g. from I to I in one example . The switching circuit can be used to change the voltage and current direction of the load quickly such as by way of switches in an H bridge configuration. Accordingly the output stage can quickly change the amplitude of the voltage V to V as well as the direction of the current flow to the load.

In an example embodiment the battery is selected for 12V to 16.8V 2000 mAH with a 2 A max charge discharge current. This lower power rating was found to provide greater stability and less prone to disruptions. In an example embodiment each generated constant voltage pulse can include a faster rise time resulting in a lower required specified target steady state current than when compared to a rectangular constant current pulse due to the capacitance of the patient or other elements or a constant voltage pulse having a slower rise time requiring a higher required specified target steady state current. The system can for example can save the amount of power consumed or total energy required to be provided by the power source e.g. less current required per pulse as well as overall lifetime of the battery than compared to other systems have a higher current draw .

A computer device such as the tablet computer includes at least a memory a device controller a display screen a communications subsystem e.g. wireless and or Ethernet to communicate over a local area network and or the Internet and a user input device such as a touchscreen. The tablet computer facilitates operator ease of use. Displayed on the tablet computer is a user interface. The tablet computer can connect to the Internet for transfer of prescriptions and patient data described in greater detail herein. The tablet computer is also used to control the processor board and effectively the stimulation boards . The controls are typically isolated so as not to damage the tablet computer and to isolate the patient from earth ground and line voltage. Example controls on the user interface can provide the user with an option to specify a treatment protocol for the particular patient such as the target steady state current value the pulse width the pulse frequency and any changes of these parameters over time. Through the user interface in some example embodiments the user can pre plan these and other parameters as a procedure by storing the plan in memory or other remotely accessible storage devices for implementation by the processor board .

The processor board runs a real time operating system in order to control the delivery of the stimulation pulses in accordance with some example embodiments. The processor board may include an ARM7 microprocessor for example. This connects to the eight stimulation boards which are individually operably connected to eight output channels for example. The processor board can also be activated using manual switches such as footswitch and or handswitch . Other inputs such as external sensors or control feedback sensors not shown here may also be coupled to the processor board or stimulation boards . In some example embodiments these switches may be dead man switches meaning the user must hold down the switch to start the treatment and releasing the switch automatically stops the treatment.

The communication protocol provides a method for transferring new treatment programs from the tablet computer to the processor board . Once the program is loaded it is stored in the non volatile eeprom memory for example. The treatment program defines the pulse characteristics such as frequency amplitude pulse duration pulse type and pulse train profile s . The program also specifies the duration of the treatment and how it is triggered for example through analog or digital user input . The commands allow the tablet computer to instruct the processor board to start a treatment pause a treatment resume treatment stop a treatment. The status information from the processor board includes data from the isolated digital analog patient inputs envelope information only and alarm information.

The user interface application of the tablet computer can be configured to handle the following tasks 

1. Treatment selection. This involves selection appropriate treatment for the patient. It also may involve creating editing existing treatments or loading new treatments through a service USB or download treatments from the Internet.

2. Sending configuration file to the stimulator. It is assumed that a new file is sent to the microcontroller board each time a treatment starts. The treatment file is a script of actions that the stimulator boards carry out. The tablet computer translates the script into a compressed binary script. The basic functions of the script file are as follows 

Start condition defines input state and perhaps phase of the treatment to execute the procedure. For example waiting for a button press.

Running parameters defines frequency pulse type and amplitude allowed current range for the output two sets of thresholds warning and error levels .

3. Reading and displaying serial number firmware version of the microcontroller. The tablet computer reads status information such as error flags battery level currently applied pulse type pulse frequency pulse duration target output current and actual average positive and negative current levels for each of the outputs.

5. Start stop treatment. Pressing a button on the touch screen starts and stops the treatment. The unit contains a power button that is used to stop the treatment in the event that the tablet computer becomes unresponsive. In some example embodiments starts and stops on the user interface can be implemented as dead man switches meaning the user must hold down the button to start the treatment and releasing the button automatically stops the treatment.

Referring to an enclosure can house the components of the system . The enclosure and connector cables may include plastic or other non conductive material. The enclosure can have an internal shield. At least some of the connector cables including cables can be treated with ferrites or other suitable materials in order to block or reduce electromagnetic interference.

Referring to status LEDS can include red green and yellow status LEDs which are mounted in the enclosure and connected to the processor board . The status LEDs are used in some example embodiments to indicate AC power status green LED on or off treatment running yellow LED flashing and error red LED on .

Referring still to the output stage may include a substantially constant voltage supply having a controllable output voltage a switching circuit a controller e.g. microprocessor a relay an alternate path and a signal detector . The substantially constant voltage supply can include four power supplies each or individually referred to as in series which can each be 45 V for example. In some example embodiments these four power supplies may be used because these parts are easier to supply and less expensive than one large power supply. Further this allows the voltage to be readily divided to provide asymmetric pulses. For example one power supply can be tapped for applying a negative voltage which is one quarter of the positive voltage. In other example embodiments more or less power supplies can be used such as one or two.

The power supplies each charge a respective large capacitor each or individually referred to as . This allows the capacitor to discharge to provide the large current spike at the start of the pulse. In another embodiment the substantially constant voltage supply can include a power supply that was able to deliver suitable amounts of current which may not need the capacitors . However using capacitors in this manner allows using of smaller power supplies saving cost heat generated and space. Additional large capacitors can be used to store charge to provide the required amounts of current. The large capacitors therefore provide charge to allow fast pulse rise times which are predominantly defined by the switching speed time of the switches in the switching circuit . The particular power supplies that are used can be adjusted to provide 2 to 45 volts each for a total of 8 to 180 volts for example.

Each power supply may each include an isolated DC DC module each or individually . Each of the outputs from these are regulated by a respective linear regulator each or individually . The voltage of each regulator is set by a respective digital potentiometer which can be for example a maximum of 100 k ohms. The output of each regulator is connected in series creating a variable output supply with a range of 8V to 192V. The effective range of the supply is adjusted to 2.5V to 160V. The achievement of the specific minimum value 2.5V is explained in greater detail herein with respect to the Zener diode .

The microcontroller uses a Serial Peripheral Interface SPI port to send data to the digital potentiometer to set the voltage of each of the 4 linear regulators . The data to each potentiometer can be sent independently to each other. The first regulator connected to the common can use an additional digital potentiometer such as 100 k ohm potentiometer to achieve greater resolution. The high regulator connected to high voltage output can use an additional 20 k ohm potentiometer to achieve greater resolution at 45V output the individual regulator has a maximum step size of 0.2V . Regulators and can use only the single 100 k digital potentiometer for example.

The most power intensive pulse type is expected to deliver 4 W. Each of the power supplies can be used to charge the large capacitor e.g. 470 uF or larger . The maximum ripple during normal operation is expected to be 

In order to provide a minimum voltage of about 2.4 volts a Zener diode is provided at the output of the voltage supply to the switching circuit . The output voltage is dropped by 5.6V as a result of the Zener diode . A 1.4V voltage drop applies for the negative supply as a result of Zener diode providing a minimum of 0.6V. The upper range is limited by regulation error and supply ripple. The required voltage level settings of the power supplies can take into account the voltage drop from the Zener diodes to the patient .

The switching circuit can include an H bridge configuration composed of several metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor MOSFET switches for example four n channel MOSFET switches . This circuit configuration allows the current to flow though the patient in either a positive or negative direction using switching control of the switches . For example a positive pulse can be activation of switches while a negative pulse can be activation of switches . The rise time of the voltage pulse is primarily determined by the switching speed of the MOSFET switches . The relay can be used to select all of the power supplies to apply a relatively high specified voltage level. The relay can be used to activate one of the power supplies to readily apply one quarter of the voltage level e.g. for asymmetric bipolar pulses .

The MOSFET switches are operated by high side low side drivers with bootstrap capacitors. Between pulses the low side MOSFET switches can be activated shorting patient electrodes together. The MOSFET signals are operated by the microcontroller .

The H bridge circuit is used to control patient pulses such the start and stop of each pulse using the signals from the voltage supply . For symmetric pulses positive and negative pulses are powered by the four power supplies in series. For asymmetric pulses the positive pulse is powered by the four power supplies in series. However the negative pulse of the asymmetric pulse can be powered by a single power supply which generates of the voltage from the high voltage supply. The voltage selection between symmetric and asymmetric pulses is done with the latching relay .

Referring to signal detector this can be used for current measurement for example the steady state current that is being applied to the patient . Typically this current value is measured near the end of the pulse. The current generated from the H bridge circuit is measured using shunt resistor . It was found that increased resistance of the shunt resistor greater than 10 Ohms provided more favourable and consistent measurements. The current reading is connected directly to the pins of the microcontroller and measured using the internal analog digital converter ADC . The measured value is processed by the microcontroller to calculate resistance between electrodes. The processor measures the current steady state for the positive pulse for the negative pulse steady state current through the test load and the off current. The readings envelope are stored as status to be sent back to the processor board .

Referring to another signal detector this can be used for voltage monitoring. The microcontroller reads the supply voltage connected to the positive pulse output voltage across the patient and the negative pulse output voltage across the patient. The processor measures the voltage of the positive pulse supply negative pulse supply and digital supply. The readings envelope are stored as status to be sent back to the processor board . Note that the signal detectors may be readily used to calculate the present patient capacitance if desired.

In some example embodiments the information detected by the detectors can be stored in a local memory and or sent to a remote server. In some example embodiments the system can be used for monitoring the patient s skin resistance and the skin resistance profile can be used to determine if a wrong person is being delivered the therapy instead of the person for whom the therapy was originally prescribed. This may include the native impedance parameters and or any responses to FES treatment parameters. The patient profile can be used as a signature for that patient. This can be used for example to prevent fraud and to monitor what the stimulator has been used for during previous treatments.

Referring to the alternate path the output circuit contains a p channel MOSFET switch and a 500 ohm test load . The load can be activated independent of the H bridge . The test load is used to test the current measurement and power supply circuits before the treatment. The test load is also used to discharge high voltage supply the output capacitance of the power supply is approx 3.3 uF if output voltage for the next pulse needs to be lower than the current pulse.

Generally as described above the stimulation pulse is a constant voltage pulse. However the stimulation dose is specified in terms of target steady state current for example as received or specified by the practitioner via the tablet computer and processor board . The steady state current is the current through the electrodes at the end of a positive pulse after an exponential decay . To achieve this the microprocessor measures the current actually delivered calculates the steady state resistance of the patient and adjusts the voltage to deliver the desired current. This is done by passing the current through the shunt resistor in series and then measuring that voltage with an analog to digital converter. The microprocessor does the calculation and sends out the control signals to adjust the voltage. The initial calibration is first performed using a few sub threshold pulses that do not actually stimulate the patient and cannot be felt . After the real stimulation starts the measurement is repeated during every pulse to ensure that the resistance is not changing. Constant voltage pulses are suitable for this application since the patient resistance typically does not materially change within any given pulsewidth.

Each stimulation channel is capable of generating asymmetrical symmetrical biphasic waveforms with following characteristics 

Target current range 0 to 125 mA. Adjustment in 0.05 mA steps for current setting below 5 mA 0.1 mA steps for current setting between 5 mA and 15 mA 0.5 mA steps for current setting above 15 mA. Steady state target output current error 0.5 mA for currents up to 15 mA. Steady state target output current error 1 mA for currents above 15 mA. The maximum current may be limited by the skin resistance and the maximum output voltage of the circuit. The minimum current may be limited by the skin resistance and the minimum output voltage of the circuit.

The actual amplitude levels may be limited by software depending on frequency. With a load resistance of 500 ohms the steady state output current can be set to not exceed 80 mA at DC 50 mA between DC and 400 Hz 80 mA between 400 and 1 500 Hz and 100 mA above 1 500 Hz.

When operating the stimulator with actual patient there will be an inrush current at the start of the pulse. The pulse width range can be from 0 to 16 000 us adjustment in 10 us range output error 10 us . Pulse width may be limited by the frequency setting. Minimum time between pulses is 200 us. The pulse frequency can be from 1 to 2 000 Hz adjustment in 1 Hz step output error 1 Hz .

The maximum average output power can be limited to 4 W for each channel the most power intensive asymmetric pulse is 125 mA 800 us positive pulse 31 mA 3.2 ms negative pulse frequency of 100 Hz . The most power intensive symmetric pulse is 125 mA 800 us positive pulse 125 mA 800 us negative pulse frequency of 100 Hz.

The maximum voltage generated by the output stage for the asymmetrical pulses can be 160 VDC for positive pulse and 40 VDC for negative pulse.

The maximum voltage generated by the output stage for the symmetrical pulses can be 160 VDC for positive pulse and 160 VDC for negative pulse.

The minimum voltage generated by the output stage for the asymmetrical pulses can be 2.5 VDC for positive pulse and 0.6 VDC for negative pulse.

The minimum voltage generated by the output stage for the symmetrical pulses can be 2.5 VDC for positive pulse and 2.5 VDC for negative pulse.

The rise time of the pulse is under 2 ns rise time measured from 10 value to 90 value measured at the output of the stimulator with standard skin model load. Slightly longer rise times 

The target skin resistance is in the range of 500 Ohm to 10 kOhm. At higher skin resistance values the output current will be limited by the skin resistance. 125 mA is supported on skin resistance up to 1 280 Ohm. 50 mA is supported on skin resistance up to 3 200 Ohm. At 10 kOhm the maximum current that can be supplied is 16 mA. Minimum current for 500 Ohm is 5 mA 2.5V minimum output . Adjustment step size increases with the output voltage. At the highest voltage the step size is 0.2V which produces the maximum 0.4 mA current step size at 500 Ohm load.

Low voltage short series calibration pulses with amplitude below 10V are applied before the start of the treatment to measure the resistance of the electrode skin. If the pulse duration as dictated by the protocol is less than 100 microseconds then the voltage for these pulses is delivered based on calibration pulses only. If the pulse duration is greater than 100 microseconds the skin resistance is re measured after each pulse and the voltage is adjusted.

For 0 5 mA 500 Ohm output voltage range 0 2.5V with 0.05 mA step size this requires 0.025V step size the minimum output of the circuit is 2.5V . For 0 5 mA 2 000 Ohm output voltage range 0 10V with 0.05 mA step size this requires 0.1V step size the minimum output of the circuit is 2.5V . For 0 5 mA 10 000 Ohm output voltage range 0 50V with 0.05 mA step size this requires 0.5V step size the minimum output of the circuit is 2.5V .

For 5 15 mA 500 Ohm output voltage range 2.5 7.5V with 0.1 mA step size this requires 0.05V step size. For 5 15 mA 2 000 Ohm output voltage range 10 30V with 0.1 mA step size this requires 0.2V step size. For 5 15 mA 10 000 Ohm output voltage range 50 150V with 0.1 mA step size this requires 1V step size.

For 15 125 mA 500 Ohm output voltage range 7.5 62.5V with 0.5 mA step size this requires 0.25V step size. For 15 125 mA 2 000 Ohm output voltage range 30 150V with 0.5 mA step size this requires 1V step size. For 15 125 mA 10 000 Ohm output voltage range 150 160V with 0.5 mA step size this requires 5V step size maximum current is limited due to voltage limitation .

In some example embodiments the system of can therefore be used to apply the signal pulses to the patient which are illustrated in any one of .

At event the method includes determining specified target parameters including at least a specified target steady state current value to be applied to the area. At event the method includes determining the present resistance of the patient. At event the method includes controlling the pulse generating circuit to generate a constant voltage pulse to the one or more electrode leads at a calculated voltage level which achieves the specified steady state current value to the area.

Referring to event the specified target steady state current value can be input by a practitioner or user for example through a user interface of a tablet computer or by accessing the specified target steady state current value from a pre programmed dosage schedule stored in a memory or remote server.

Referring to event a signal detector can be used for detecting signal parameters associated with the area of the living body such the actual steady state current that is being applied. The applied voltage to the patient is also known or can be detected using a voltage detector. This can be used to calculate the present resistance of the patient. In some example embodiments the present resistance can be estimated for each pulse or periodically e.g. one pulse in every specified number of pulses or time duration or can be calculated as an average resistance or moving average over a specified number of pulses or a period of time. The resistance of the patient can be initially estimated by applying one or more sub threshold pulses e.g. non AP stimulating to the area from the pulse generating circuit prior to the start of the actual procedure.

Referring to event the calculated voltage level is calculated from the associated resistance element of the patient and the specified target steady state current value using Ohms Law e.g. V R I . Note that in some example embodiments the calculated voltage level is calculated without consideration of a value of the associated capacitance element.

The method can be configured in a loop as shown. For example in the next iteration referring again to event the method may include determining the next specified target steady state current value to be applied to the area this step can be skipped if the value is the same . At event the method includes determining the present patient resistance e.g. based on the presently detected patient readings of the previous pulse . At event the method includes controlling the pulse generating circuit to generate the next constant voltage pulse to the one or more electrode leads at the next calculated voltage level which achieves the next specified steady state current value to the area.

The constant voltage pulses may provide sequential bipolar pulse stimulation which includes a pulse sequence including a positive constant voltage pulse and a negative constant voltage pulse.

At event low voltage short series calibration pulses with amplitude below 10V are applied before the start of the treatment to measure the initial resistance of the electrode skin. These can be for example non AP stimulating pulses.

At event the method determines specified target parameters for a given dosage. The target parameters may include steady state current value pulse width pulse frequency and duration at that steady state current value. As well the pulse type can be specified as symmetric or asymmetric for bipolar pulses. These parameters can be retrieved from a treatment file stored in memory or adjusted in real time by the practitioner for example.

At event in some example embodiments a bipolar pulse sequence is generated. It can be presumed that the bipolar pulse sequence can be a pulse pair comprising one positive pulse followed by one negative pulse. For most frequencies further processing e.g. events may be performed between adjacent pulse pairs. Event includes controlling the pulse generating circuit to generate a constant voltage pulse having the target parameters of steady state current value pulse width and pulse frequency. The constant voltage pulse has a calculated voltage level which achieves the specified steady state current value to the area.

Referring to event the method includes determining the present resistance of the patient. A signal detector can be used for detecting signal parameters associated with the area of the living body such the actual steady state current that is being applied. The applied voltage to the patient is also known or can be detected using a voltage detector. This can be used to calculate the present resistance of the patient. In some example embodiments the present resistance can be estimated for each pulse or periodically e.g. one pulse in every specified number of pulses or time duration or can be calculated as an average resistance or moving average over a specified number of pulses or a period of time.

At event after completion of one bipolar pulse sequence e.g. one positive pulse followed by one negative pulse it is determined whether the specified duration at the target steady state current has been completed. If not the method returns to event wherein the next voltage level is calculated for the next bipolar pulse sequence which accounts for any changes in patient resistance determined at event . This allows the same specified target charge to be consistently applied to the patient. If the duration has completed if yes at event the next target parameters are determined for the next dosage level target steady state current which is again determined at event .

It will be appreciated that alternative measures may be implemented in adapting control sequences and circuitry to the different embodiments and that without departing from the general scope and nature of the present disclosure.

Some example embodiments herein described may for example promote sustainable implementation and wider adoption of emerging FES applications that are presently only available as research tools given the deficiencies and drawbacks of known devices as described above. Also some embodiments may provide simultaneous pulses over multiple channels.

Another parameter of interest in these applications is the rise time i.e. the slew rate of the electrical pulses which in general should be as fast as possible. Namely the relevance of providing a fast rise time in these pulses stems from the physiology of excitable tissues namely nerve and muscle cells and the generation of action potentials. These tissues have ion pumps that work against the delivered charge of an electrical pulse to maintain the nominal potential difference on the cell membrane. Pulses with a higher slew rate may give less time to the ion pumps to compensate for the delivered charge allowing stimulation with lower amplitude signal. The advantages of stimulating with lower amplitude pulses may include more comfortable i.e. less painful therapy and a longer battery life of the device for example.

Another consideration is that voltage activated sodium and potassium gates that essentially generate action potentials are triggered by a local change in the nerve membrane potential. These voltage activated sodium and potassium gates behave in a statistical fashion i.e. each voltage gate has its own voltage level that triggers it which slightly deviates for the average trigger level. Therefore fast delivery of charge i.e. fast pulse slew rate to all voltage activated sodium and potassium gates will ensure that all gates are triggered ensuring higher success rate of generating action potentials. In the event that the charge is delivered more gradually it is possible that a number of voltage activate gates will not be triggered. Therefore in order to achieve more reliable response with pulses that have slower slew rate one may need to deliver more charge i.e. one would need to use the stimulation pulses with higher amplitude to activate critical number of voltage triggered gates. Therefore the fast pulse slew rate has a potential to generate more reliable action potential production in the excitable tissue using less charge.

Furthermore the device described herein in exemplary embodiments may provide improved pulse rise times and more accurate amplitude and duration control. These faster rise times may allow the potential to achieve the same tissue stimulation results with less steady state current. This may in turn reduce the stress on the individual i.e. perception of pain or discomfort as well as decreases the energy consumption of the stimulator. The rise time in combination with the accurate amplitude and duration control also may provide that over time no charge will be built up in stimulated tissues which can be an important aspect for FES applications especially for applications involving implanted FES systems.

In some embodiments the slew rate of the pulses produced by the herein described systems and designs are significantly faster than the 1 s slew rates common to some existing devices and systems. For example in one embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 500 ns is achieved. In accordance with another embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 100 ns is achieved. In accordance with yet another embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 8 ns is achieved. In accordance with yet another embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 5 ns is achieved. In accordance with yet another embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 2 ns is achieved. In accordance with yet another embodiment a pulse slew rate of no more than 10 ns is achieved. Accordingly the pulse slew rates may in some embodiments be as much as two orders of magnitude faster than conventional systems.

In one embodiment the provision of such improved pulse rise times may also or alternatively allow for a reduction or minimization of physical discomfort experienced by a patient as a result of the pulse stimulation. For example by applying a reduced charge to the stimulated tissue or again by achieving greater tissue responsiveness treatments implemented using the herein described device may reduce if not completely avoid patient discomfort.

As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan the highly flexible architecture of the above described embodiments and below provided examples may be particularly suitable for the implantation of battery powered external functional electrical stimulators FES and neuroprostheses and readily amenable to emerging sophisticated FES applications such as closed loop controlled and brain machine interfaced neuroprostheses for example as well as various other applications.

Reference is now made to which shows is an example high level diagram of a communication system for one or more FES systems in accordance with an example embodiment. The system design incorporates multiple subsystems that together create the required components for the administration and delivery of FES therapy to patients. As shown in there can be three main subsystems as part of the overall system Stimulator Local Interface and Backend Data Management System BDMS .

The Stimulator System is a system which is used to provide stimulation treatment protocol to a patient. The main components of the system are an ARM7 Microprocessor the software running on the ARM7 stimulator application as well as custom electronics and physical electrodes which interface between the ARM7 and the human body. The stimulator application calculates the appropriate stimulation level based upon the protocol type and transmits this analog output to the human body via the connected electrodes.

The Stimulator application is command based and event driven. Its main function is to listen for commands decode these commands and execute them accordingly. As a result the Stimulator device can be controlled by another application if it can establish a valid communication path and send the correct commands as defined by the Application Programming Interface API for the device.

The local interface is the primary interface used by the therapist to configure setup and administer the actual treatment including user interface to view data and control the system. This subsystem will interface to the stimulator to administer the actual treatment protocols as well as the Backend Data Management System to manage patients prescriptions therapists as well as synchronize treatment details between multiple devices in a practice.

The Backend Data Management System is used to manage the overall treatment process including Device ID s Therapist ID s Patient IDs PUID s prescriptions and primary report interface. This cloud based system can also allow for synchronization between multiple devices in the field. Access to patient data can be made over secure Internet connections and other communication mediums through the Backend Data Management System.

In accordance with some example embodiments the FES system can be used to assist with the bioinfomatics use of the device and the patient receiving treatment. For example the system can be used for capturing in memory information of the pulses applied during treatment sending to a central repository e.g. Backend Data Management System and providing this information from the central repository to one or more of patients clinicians clinics administrators third party payors and other information relating to the patient treatment or use of the system. The information can be used to determine automatically or manually best protocols or treatment options based on prior results such as successes and failures.

Many government and private insurance programs are under increasing pressure to limit healthcare expenditures and are adopting various measures to control costs. These measures include but are not limited to healthcare reform measures pay for performance Comparative Effectiveness Research and group purchasing. Increasingly third party payers are converging on a set of common criteria in the assessment of whether a technology improves health outcomes such as length of life quality of life and functional ability.

Insurers generally seek evidence that a new therapy represents an efficient use of healthcare resources. Ongoing clinical studies and the aggregated database of patients that have been prescribed patient keys will capture and provide the data to support reimbursement.

This assists with payment by health care systems. There is increasing pressure on hospitals to discharge patients more rapidly and preferably to discharge them to their homes. Patient discharge from in patient rehabilitation hospitals is determined by a number of factors including the attainment of certain functional independence goals.

In another aspect the system can be used to provide a method for prescribing a treatment to a patient. For example the system can be used for receiving a prescription purchase request and providing a patient dedicated electronic key in response to the purchase request. The electronic key can include access to protocol s for a prescribed therapy intervention a record of the pattern of use of the protocols including at least duration frequency and amplitude of pulses to be applied to the patient outcomes captured during treatment and reports on progress and treatment planning.

One example provides results an exemplary FES therapy process for improving brain and associated muscle function in individuals suffering from a neuromuscular deficit which process provides an example only of the various FES applications methods and treatments that may be facilitated by the above described FES devices and systems. In this example the individual was suffering from the neurological disorder following a stroke. It will be appreciated that this kind of neurological disorder of the central nervous system may have resulted from stroke spinal cord injury brain injury multiple sclerosis and any other injury both traumatic and non traumatic to the central nervous system for example.

Individual Description The individual was a 22 year old woman who suffered a hemorrhagic stroke in the right frontal parietal area two years prior to the participation in this study. The individual presented at an individual rehabilitation centre with motor recovery status scored by CMSMR Chedoke McMaster Stages of Motor Recovery as follows arm 1 hand 2 leg 2 and foot 2. After four months of rehabilitation the CMSMR scores were as follows arm 2 hand 2 leg 4 and foot 2. While left leg showed some recovery the left arm was not functional. At the beginning of the FES mediated protocol the individual was independent in activities of daily living with the help of cane and ankle foot orthosis but reported that she rarely if ever used her paretic upper limb. Movement of the upper extremity was characterized by a flexor synergy pattern. The individual had increased resistance to passive stretching in the distal flexor musculature. Tactile sensation was shown not to be severely impaired throughout the upper limb by the use of the two point discrimination test. Stroke patients such as the individual of the instant study are considered neurologically stable and do not show any signs of further improvement 24 months following stroke. Therefore the individual recruited to this study was in the chronic phase of injury 24 months post stroke was severely disable as measured by CMSMR and was not expected to improve regardless which therapy is provided to her.

Functional electrical stimulation therapy An FES mediated protocol was delivered by way of an electric stimulator electrical stimulator used was a prototype of the electrical stimulator discussed above with standard self adhesive surface stimulation electrodes. In the study the following muscles were stimulated with the surface stimulation electrodes the locations of the electrodes for each muscle are shown in the anterior aDel and posterior deltoid pDel biceps brachialis BB and triceps brachialis TB extensor carpi radialis extensor carpi ulnaris flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris. Stimulus parameters used to stimulate the nerves that are innervating the muscles of interest were asymmetric bipolar current pulses with the pulse duration of 250 sec and frequency 40 Hz. During the protocol the stimulus was delivered to the muscles of the paralyzed limb in such a way that these muscles produced movements that accurately mimicked the movements that the brain would produced if the patient were not paralyzed. When the stimulus was delivered to the muscles it was gradually increased or decreased instead of being delivered instantaneously using ramp up and ramp down functions lasting from 0.5 to 2 seconds. The therapist used a hand switch to trigger stimulation when he determined that the individual needed assistance with the task.

FES Mediated Protocol Briefly the FES mediated protocol consisted of pre programmed coordinate muscular stimulation and manual assisted externally generated passive motion to establish physiologically correct movement. During the movement the individual was asked to imagine the movements and to try to carry it out herself. At the beginning of the study the patient was unable to move the arm voluntarily and therefore was not able to physically execute voluntarily imagined movements. The FES was delivered to shoulder elbow wrist and finger extensor and flexor muscles while the individual assisted by the therapist performed the following types of motions 1 touch nose 2 touch shoulder 3 move arm forward 4 lift arm left side up 5 reach and grasp large objects 6 reach and grasp small objects 7 manipulate objects during grasp and 8 place the object at a designated location and release the object. The FES mediated protocol was carried out for an hour. The protocol at a minimum comprises 40 one hour sessions wherein at least 3 one hour sessions are delivered per week however the protocol may be repeated more frequently if desired. In case of the individual of the instant example the protocol was preformed twice daily. In individuals who have suffered a stroke the neuromuscular recovery typically starts proximally followed by the recovery of the distal neuromuscular compartments. Therefore the FES mediated protocol began by training shoulder and upper arm muscles first followed by wrist and fingers training.

During the FES mediated protocol a therapist controlled triggered the arm movements using a pushbutton. During the movements the physiotherapist guided the arm and assisted the individual with the neuroprosthesis in performing the desired task. This assistance provided that all movements were carried out in a correct physiological way i.e. neuroprosthesis induced movements did not oppose natural joint movements and respected the anatomy of bone and soft tissue composition. In the early stages of the treatment the arm tasks were performed by the combination of muscular stimulation and therapist s assistance. As the individual improved the assistance was reduced to the necessary minimum. Typically the stimulation protocols were adjusted weekly or biweekly. The individual was asked to repeat the same arm task 10 times for each motion during a single treatment session. The treatment sessions lasted up to 60 minutes.

Outcome Measures Clinical assessments CMSMR and Motricity Index tests for the upper limb were used to assess the arm and hand functions. The degree of spasticity in the affected upper limb was evaluated using the five grade Modified Ashworth Scale MAS .

H reflex and M max To assess the excitability of the spinal motoneuron pool in the flexor carpi radialis FCR muscle the Hoffman reflex H reflex was elicited. The H reflex was evoked by stimulation of the left median nerve with a monopolar electrode placed in the inside of cubital joint. A rectangular pulse 1 ms was generated by a constant voltage stimulator DPS 007 Dia Medical System Co. Japan that was triggered once every 5 s.

Maximal voluntary contraction MVC The electromyographic EMG signals in the following paralyzed upper arm muscles were detected by a bipolar differential amplifier Bortec AMT 8 Bortec Biomedical Canada aDel pDel BB TB flexor capiradialis FCR extensor digitrum longus EDL and first distal interosseous muscles FDI . A pair of surface electrodes BiPole Bortec Biomedical Canada was placed along the muscle fibers over the belly in each muscle with an inter electrode distance center to center of 10 mm. The recorded EMG signals were amplified 500 times and digitized at a sampling rate of 1 000 Hz over a period of 500 ms before and 500 ms after the onset of the movement.

Active range of motion test The individual was asked to move her arm toward following five directions as much as she could 1 forward 2 backward 3 upward 4 right side and 5 left side. During the movements we recorded the position of the shoulder elbow and wrist joints and the second joint of index finger. The individual did three trials for each of the five movements.

Circle drawing test This test was aimed to assess the ability to coordinate shoulder and elbow joints. During circle drawing the subject requires the ability to coordinate shoulder and elbow movements. Specifically for individuals whom have suffered a stroke who have spasm in their elbow joint it is not easy to draw a wide and a properly shaped circle. The position of the shoulder elbow and wrist joints and the second joint of index finger while the individual drew the circle on a table was recorded. During the assessment the movements were self paced and the task continued for 30 seconds.

Originally it was planned to assess the individual using tests Outcome Measures Clinical assessments H reflex and M max and MVC . However during the first 6 weeks of training the individual surprisingly showed remarkable improvement of her shoulder and elbow function thereby prompting the addition of tests Active range of motion test and Circle Drawing Test to further evaluate functional motion of the upper limb.

Results The individual successfully completed all training sessions and assessments. Following 12 weeks of FES mediated protocol the individual was able to pick a thin object touch her nose and draw circles for example tasks which could not be accomplished prior to the FES mediated protocol sessions. As the clinical measures selected namely the CMSMR and Motricity Index tests are coarse measures these tests did not show changes in the scores following the 12 week protocol. However the MAS of the hand and wrist showed reduction in spasticity over the course of the training wrist 3 to 2 hand 4 to 3 . H reflex which reflects the spinal motoneuron excitability also showed remarkable reduction with training . Namely the size of the H reflex was quite high at the beginning of the protocol 82.09 Mmax and as the time passed it decreased considerably 53.65 in 6week and 45.04 in 12week indicating that the high tone which is commonly associated with the damaged to the supra spinal compartments of the central nervous system is reverting and that the central nervous system function is returning back to its normal levels of tone and reflex responses. shows the changes in the MVC in the upper arm muscles obtained every two weeks. The MVC levels in all muscles measured were at zero during the baseline assessment. In other words the patient was unable to activate a single muscle in the affected arm voluntarily. As the protocol progressed the patient gained ability to voluntarily activate the muscles and further improved with continuation of the protocol. It is worth mentioning that the MVC levels in the affected arm were remarkably smaller than that of the unaffected arm. However even the low levels of MVCs were sufficient to allow the patient to effectively and voluntarily move the arm and fingers to reach and grasp objects. A good example of the muscles which showed considerable improvement following the FES mediated protocol are the FDI and TB muscles which did not show any EMG RMS V activity at the baseline and following the FES mediated protocol showed remarkable improvements in voluntary EMG and muscle contraction control. Table 2 shows the shoulder and elbow dynamic range of motion. It is clearly shown that the value of dynamic range of motion for the shoulder and elbow joint at week 12 showed remarkable improvement as compared to those measured at week 6. At week 0 the individual did not have any voluntary movement in the affected arm. Therefore transformation from no movement in week 0 to restricted movement in week 6 followed by much more expanded range of motion in week 12 is a remarkable change. Given that the individual of this study was in the chronic injury phase as noted above and therefore not expected to show improvement regardless whether any intervention was provided the changes observed and noted herein are remarkable. Furthermore such changes have not been previously observed in chronic severe stroke patients.

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 12 weeks intensive FES mediated protocol on a chronic severe stroke individual CMSMR score 2 or less . Although motor capacity score i.e. CMSMR and MVC tests did not show any significant changes due to the courses of the tests the MAS and the amplitude of H reflex were reduced as the result of the FES mediated protocol. Additionally the kinematic results showed a profound improvement in the ability to perform arm movements and to coordinate shoulder and elbow joints. These results suggest that the improvement of the upper arm functional motion can be attributed to retraining of the central nervous systems through means of neuroplasticity which is observed in improvement of the upper limb voluntary motor function as well as the reduction of muscle tone and or spasticity.

Traditionally neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been used to increase strength of the voluntary muscle contractions in various neurological patients and healthy individuals. But recent applications of electrical stimulation are shifting the focus from muscle strengthening towards re training the central nervous system and improving motor control of the stroke individuals. In this study FES mediated protocol was used to retrain a chronic stroke individual to voluntarily perform coordinated multi joint movements with the arm that was previously paralyzed as a result of stroke. Since the stimulus intensity we used was approximately two times larger than the motor threshold one could not expect that the FES mediated protocol generated changes in muscular function due to an associated increase in muscle strength. This assumption was confirmed by the results shown in the that is there were no consistent changes of the MVC in the upper limb muscles.

At the beginning of the FES mediated protocol the individual s upper limb had high muscle tone. However the muscle tone of wrist and elbow flexors was remarkably decreased as the result of the FES mediated protocol which was clearly reflected by the results of MAS Table 1 and H reflex . This result was in good agreement with the previous findings that describe the effects of the electrical stimulation on the reduction of the abnormally high muscle tone. It should be noted that the resting condition of the individual s arm specifically hand was drastically changed with the time course of training. Namely the individual was able to relax her hand and keep the hand relaxed during reaching motion. Therefore the improvement of the upper arm functional motion can be partly attributed to the reduction of muscle tone and or spasticity. This finding supports the classical concept that muscle tone reduction represents simplistic solutions to the deficit in motor control after stroke.

Pre programmed stimulus patterns were developed that are able to generate variety of upper limb movements functions. The temporal activations of the muscles induced by the FES were similar to those of intact neuromuscular system that is performing the same task i.e. the muscle activations were designed to clone actual natural movements. Thus during the movements the individual could feel when she was supposed to activate muscle contractions and how to sequence them to produce desired movements. The fact that marked changes in the H reflex were observed and that a number of muscles that the individual was unable to voluntarily contract prior to the FES mediated protocol were under her voluntary control at the end of the protocol suggests that the functional improvements induced by the FES mediated protocol are in part due to changes that occur in the central nervous system. In other words the intensive repetitive and yet diverse FES mediated protocol may be promoting plastic reorganization of the central nervous system. Therefore it is predicted that the following mechanism may cause the changes observed. If a hemiplegic individual who strains to execute a task is assisted with the FES to carry out that same task he she is effectively voluntarily generating the motor command desire to move the arm i.e. efferent motor command and the FES is providing the afferent feedbacks afferent sensory input indicating that the command was executed successfully. Therefore it is believed that by providing both the motor command and sensory input to the central nervous system repetitively for prolonged periods of time this type of FES mediated protocol facilitates functional reorganization and retraining of intact parts of the of central nervous system and allows them to take over the function of the damaged part of the central nervous system. As the individual continues to improve the voluntary function then the volitional related sensory feedback from the stimulated muscles and arm further contributes to this retraining process. This is possible due to the distributed nature of the central nervous system and the fact that various parts of the brain are responsible for processing similar tasks. For example motor tasks are typically associated with motor and pre motor cortex activity. However the motor tasks are also processed in the occipital lobe. Therefore FES mediated protocol is allowing the central nervous system to access such distributed networks and used them to help patient relearn new motor tasks lost due to injury or disease of the central nervous system.

The present exemplary FES mediated study may confirm that the FES mediated protocol can be used to improve the upper limb functions in chronic stroke individuals. Furthermore as this type of protocol may be effective in individuals with severe upper limb impairment it is very likely that it is effective in individuals with less severe upper limb disability. The exemplary study investigated on weekly basis how the H reflex and the EMGs of various muscles changed over time due to FES mediated protocol. The key finding is that the muscles that were paralyzed prior to the study became active and were under voluntary control of the individual after the FES mediated protocol. Furthermore the H reflex decreased almost 50 after the FES mediated protocol was completed suggesting a significant reduction in muscle tone and or spasticity as a result of this exemplary FES mediated protocol. It would be appreciated that example embodiments may be applied to a variety of pulse generating circuits. For example some pulse generating circuits are described in PCT application publication number WO2011 150502 entitled FUNCTIONAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION DEVICE AND SYSTEM AND USER THEREOF filed Jun. 2 2011 having a common co inventor as the present application the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Such circuits may be programmed in accordance with at least some of the presently described example embodiments.

Some example embodiments may be applied to a matrix type electrode as would be understood in the art. For example a single output channel can be used to stimulate more than one point of contact on the skin using a matrix of contact points. These points can be programmed or controlled in a number of ways as appropriate.

It would be appreciated that the described FES systems may differ from some traditional fixed voltage systems which do not consider any desired steady state current value. Further the described FES systems may differ from traditional current controlled systems which attempt to generate a rectangular current pulse or attempt to dampen the current spike or may merely measure the current until a total charge desired is reached.

Another example application of at least some example embodiments is for the rehabilitating treating retraining and or otherwise improving upper extremity mobility and control in persons having impaired or disabled upper extremities due to stroke or spinal cord injury including stimulation of the lumbricalis muscles. An example of such a system and method is described in PCT application publication number WO 2014 000107 filed Jun. 26 2013 having a common co inventor as the present application the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

At least one example embodiment recognizes that there can be biological cross talk between electrode leads in close proximity such as when stimulating a group of close muscles such as the lumbricalis muscles. For example if a spike in current of one electrode lead causes biological cross talk during the steady state current of another one of the electrode leads this can affect the measurement of the signal levels which are taken during the steady state current of the another one of the electrode leads.

In an example embodiment there is provided electrical stimulation system for providing pulse stimulation to a plurality of areas of a living body by way of a plurality of electrode leads each applied to one of the respective areas each of the areas including an associated resistance element and an associated capacitance element. The system includes a plurality of pulse generating circuits each having a controllable output voltage to generate constant voltage pulses to one or more of the electrode leads wherein the corresponding current signal of each constant voltage pulse includes an exponential decay to a steady state current value. At least one controller is configured to determine a specified target steady state current value to be applied to each area estimate the associated resistance element of each area control the pulse generating circuits to generate a constant voltage pulse to the electrode leads at a calculated voltage level which achieves the specified steady state current value to the area and control a spike of one of the current signals for one of the electrode leads so as to be outside the steady state current of another one of the electrode leads so as to allow accurate measurement of the steady state current of the another one of the electrode leads.

In another example embodiment there is provided electrical stimulation system for providing pulse stimulation to a plurality of areas of a living body by way of a plurality of electrode leads each applied to one of the respective areas each of the areas including an associated resistance element and an associated capacitance element. The system includes a plurality of pulse generating circuits each having a controllable output voltage to generate constant voltage pulses to one or more of the electrode leads wherein the corresponding current signal of each constant voltage pulse includes an exponential decay to a steady state current value. At least one controller is configured to estimate the associated resistance element of each area control the pulse generating circuits to generate a constant voltage pulse to the electrode leads at a specified voltage level based on the measured steady state current value and control a spike of one of the current signals for one of the electrode leads so as to be outside the steady state current of another one of the electrode leads so as to allow accurate measurement of the steady state current of the another one of the electrode leads.

In an example embodiment each constant voltage pulse from the respective pulse generating circuits for all of the electrode leads is controlled to pulse simultaneously e.g. rise time starting position is substantially the same . In another example embodiment the controller controls a spike of one of the current signals for one of the electrode leads so as to be within the exponential decay of another one of the electrode leads so long as the spike is within a buffered time before the steady state of the another one of the electrode leads. This type of system contrasts with having to fire each pulse one by one for example.

In an example embodiment at least some of the plurality of areas are relatively located at a distance there between so as to cause biological cross talk between two of the respective areas of the body where the respective electrode leads are located.

In an example embodiment to reduce or eliminate the effects of biological cross talk the current spike to at least one of the electrodes is controlled by applying a phase control a delay control or a compensating circuit to at least one of the current signals for the respective electrode lead. Adjustment and calibration of each of the pulse generators in this manner may be performed prior to starting the present treatment protocol.

At least some example embodiments can be applied to other electrical stimulation systems. For example a pacemaker or defibrillator may be configured to provide electrical stimulation to the heart in a controlled manner. Other example electrical stimulation system can be applied to neural stimulation for the brain to assist in facilitating neural pathways for example. Such a system when configured with the electrical stimulation systems described herein may include a controller configured to determine a specified target steady state current value to be applied to the area and control the pulse generating circuit to generate a constant voltage pulse to the one or more electrode leads at a calculated voltage level which achieves the specified target steady state current value to the area. Each generated constant voltage pulse can include a faster rise time resulting in a lower required specified target steady state current than when compared to a constant voltage pulse having a slower rise time requiring a higher required specified target steady state current. This for example can save the amount of power consumed or total energy required to be provided by the source e.g. limited lifetime battery . In another example embodiment at least one electrode lead and or a portable battery are implanted inside of the patient. Accordingly reduction of power consumption can lead to improved patient comfort longer use of the battery and less surgery time required for replacing of the battery.

The example embodiments use constant voltage pulses which are in contrast to and not the same as a pulse generator which generates a rectangular constant current pulse. In a constant current pulse system the current does eventually reach a desired steady state current value but such systems can suffer from slow rise times due to the capacitance of the skin and other elements for example. Also such conventional systems do not have an initial inrush of current and can require a higher steady state current value when compared to the systems as described in at least some example embodiments.
