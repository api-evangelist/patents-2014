In a touch sensing system a proximity image may be obtained from a touch sensing surface and the image may be segmented into a plurality of patches each corresponding to a contact on or near the touch sensing surface. An ellipse may be fit to each of the plurality of patches. The parameters of the ellipse may be used to identify the contact patches and generate input. However when a contact patch is on the edge of a proximity image a fitted ellipse may not accurately represent the sensed touch object some of which may be past the edge of the touch sensing surface.

This relates to a method of extrapolating proximity information to generate a border column or row of touch nodes also known as touch pixels and then fitting an ellipse to the contact patch including the extrapolated border touch nodes. Additionally a contact can be identified as a thumb based on both its major axis and its distance to an edge of the touch sensing surface.

In the following description of examples reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which it is shown by way of illustration specific examples that can be practiced. It is to be understood that other examples can be used and structural changes can be made without departing from the scope of the disclosed examples.

Although examples disclosed herein may be described and illustrated herein primarily in terms of capacitive touch sensing and proximity sensing it should be understood that the examples are not so limited but are additionally applicable to other touch sensing technologies including those that sense only force and or use resistive touch sensing. For example a proximity image as discussed herein may be an image of capacitance an image of resistance and or an image of force among other possibilities. Additionally although examples are primarily discussed in terms of columns the methods disclosed herein can be also used in terms of rows.

In a touch sensing system a proximity image may be obtained from a touch sensing surface and the image may be segmented into a plurality of patches each corresponding to a contact on or near the touch sensing surface. An ellipse may be fit to each of the plurality of patches. The parameters of the ellipse may be used to identify the contact patches and generate input. For example a contact patch may be identified as a thumb based on a length of a major axis of the fitted ellipse. However when a contact patch is on the edge of a proximity image a fitted ellipse may not accurately represent the sensed touch object some of which may be past the edge of the touch sensing surface.

In an outline of a thumb is shown and the touch nodes of the contact patch corresponding to the thumb are shown in edge column C1 and adjacent column C2. The centroids y1 and y2 of columns C1 and C2 respectively can be calculated and extrapolated to determine y0 an extrapolated centroid for a border column C0. The touch nodes in column C1 of the thumb patch can be copied into column C0 and shifted so that the centroid is at y0. Additionally the sums Sum1 and Sum 2 of the touch nodes in columns C1 and C2 respectively of the thumb patch can be calculated and extrapolated to determine Sum0 and the touch nodes copied to column C0 can be appropriately scaled based on the extrapolated Sum0. In some examples the touch nodes in column C0 can be further scaled down in this case to discount for uncertainty in the extrapolation.

In the algorithm is illustrated and described in terms of a proximity image of capacitance. That is each touch node is a capacitance value that represents proximity of a contact to that touch node. also illustrates at how a fingerprint that overlaps the edge of a touch sensing surface can create a misleading proximity image. At the outline of the actual fingerprint is shown as a dotted line. After extrapolating border pixels the solid line ellipse estimated at more accurately represents the actual fingerprint shown at .

An edge column centroid of the one or more touch nodes of the first patch in the edge column may be determined . A centroid calculation is similar to a center of mass calculation. For example a centroid can be calculated as a weighted average of the positions of the one or more touch nodes each position being weighted by the relative proximity value of the touch node at that position. An adjacent column centroid of the one or more touch nodes of the first patch in the adjacent column may be determined in a similar manner .

The one or more touch nodes of the first patch in the edge column may be copied into a border column and offset by an extrapolation of the edge column centroid and the adjacent column centroid . In some examples the centroids may be extrapolated by subtracting the adjacent column centroid from the edge column centroid to obtain a shift value. The touch nodes copied into the border column may then be shifted based on the shift value. In some examples the shift value may be an integer or may be rounded to an integer so that each of the touch nodes may be trivially shifted based on the shift value.

In some examples the shift value may not be an integer and shifting the copied touch nodes in the border column includes interpolating the touch nodes based on the shift value. For example if the shift value is 0.6 then for each touch node 60 of the proximity value of the touch node may be shifted up to the next touch node and 40 of the proximity value may remain in the touch node. The remaining 40 may be added to the 60 of the below touch node that is shifted up. In some examples other methods of interpolating the touch nodes based on a non integer shift value may be used.

The one or more touch nodes of the first patch in the edge column may be summed to obtain an edge sum. This can include summing the proximity values of the one or more touch nodes. In a similar fashion the one or more touch nodes of the first patch in the adjacent column may be summed to obtain an adjacent sum. The touch nodes in the border column may then be scaled based on an extrapolation of the edge sum and the adjacent sum . The touch nodes in the border column may be scaled such that the sum of the proximity values of the touch nodes in the border column is equal to the extrapolation of the edge sum and the adjacent sum. In some examples the extrapolation may be a linear extrapolation of the trajectory of the adjacent sum to the edge sum. In other examples the extrapolation may be a logistic extrapolation of the trajectory of the adjacent sum to the edge sum such as an extrapolation based on a sigmoid function.

An ellipse may be fit to the first patch including the touch nodes of the border column . In some examples fitting an ellipse may include determining parameters of the ellipse such as a major axis a minor axis and an angle of orientation of the ellipse.

As discussed above a contact may be identified as a thumb based on the length of the major axis of an ellipse fit to the contact. However a contact that overlaps the edge of the touch sensing surface may have a shorter major axis and thus it may not be able to be identified as a thumb until most of the contact moves onto the touch sensing surface.

The curve represents a reference thumb profile that can be used to identify a contact as a thumb. The major axis and the distance from the edge can be monitored for a contact over a series of time steps and the area between the curve for a contact and the reference thumb profile can be integrated and accumulated. If the integrated value remains positive as it would with curve then the associated contact can be identified as a thumb. If the integrated value becomes negative as it would with curve then it can be determined that the associated contact is not a thumb. This method can be fairly robust because even if a non thumb contact has an unusually large major axis when it is close to the edge as it moves away from the edge the major axis will grow slowly and enough negative area will accumulate such that the contact will not be identified as a thumb. In some examples the integrated value may be accumulated and the contact may not be identified until a time threshold is exceeded or a distance threshold from the edge is exceeded among other possibilities.

Based on a thumb profile a reference major axis of a thumb contact may be determined at the obtained distance . A thumb profile may simply be a mapping of distances to major axis values as illustrated in . Determining the reference major axis can include obtaining the reference major axis from the thumb profile based on the obtained distance of the contact from the edge of the touch sensing surface.

The contact may be identified as a thumb based on the reference major axis and the major axis of the contact . For example the reference major axis and the major axis of the contact may be used to integrate the area between a curve for the contact and a curve for the thumb profile as described with reference to . If the integrated value is positive the contact may be identified as a thumb.

In some examples the reference major axis may be subtracted from the major axis of the contact to obtain an axis difference. In one example the contact may be identified as a thumb if the axis difference is positive. In other examples the axis difference may be added to a sum of axis differences from previous time steps. The contact may be identified as a thumb if the sum of axis differences is positive.

The examples discussed above can be implemented in one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs . An API is an interface implemented by a program code component or hardware component hereinafter API implementing component that allows a different program code component or hardware component hereinafter API calling component to access and use one or more functions methods procedures data structures classes and or other services provided by the API implementing component. An API can define one or more parameters that are passed between the API calling component and the API implementing component.

The above described features can be implemented as part of an application program interface API that can allow it to be incorporated into different applications e.g. spreadsheet apps utilizing touch input as an input mechanism. An API can allow a developer of an API calling component which may be a third party developer to leverage specified features such as those described above provided by an API implementing component. There may be one API calling component or there may be more than one such component. An API can be a source code interface that a computer system or program library provides in order to support requests for services from an application. An operating system OS can have multiple APIs to allow applications running on the OS to call one or more of those APIs and a service such as a program library can have multiple APIs to allow an application that uses the service to call one or more of those APIs. An API can be specified in terms of a programming language that can be interpreted or compiled when an application is built.

In some examples the API implementing component may provide more than one API each providing a different view of the functionality implemented by the API implementing component or with different aspects that access different aspects of the functionality implemented by the API implementing component. For example one API of an API implementing component can provide a first set of functions and can be exposed to third party developers and another API of the API implementing component can be hidden not exposed and provide a subset of the first set of functions and also provide another set of functions such as testing or debugging functions which are not in the first set of functions. In other examples the API implementing component may itself call one or more other components via an underlying API and thus be both an API calling component and an API implementing component.

An API defines the language and parameters that API calling components use when accessing and using specified features of the API implementing component. For example an API calling component accesses the specified features of the API implementing component through one or more API calls or invocations embodied for example by function or method calls exposed by the API and passes data and control information using parameters via the API calls or invocations. The API implementing component may return a value through the API in response to an API call from an API calling component. While the API defines the syntax and result of an API call e.g. how to invoke the API call and what the API call does the API may not reveal how the API call accomplishes the function specified by the API call. Various API calls are transferred via the one or more application programming interfaces between the calling API calling component and an API implementing component. Transferring the API calls may include issuing initiating invoking calling receiving returning or responding to the function calls or messages in other words transferring can describe actions by either of the API calling component or the API implementing component. The function calls or other invocations of the API may send or receive one or more parameters through a parameter list or other structure. A parameter can be a constant key data structure object object class variable data type pointer array list or a pointer to a function or method or another way to reference a data or other item to be passed via the API.

Furthermore data types or classes may be provided by the API and implemented by the API implementing component. Thus the API calling component may declare variables use pointers to use or instantiate constant values of such types or classes by using definitions provided in the API.

Generally an API can be used to access a service or data provided by the API implementing component or to initiate performance of an operation or computation provided by the API implementing component. By way of example the API implementing component and the API calling component may each be any one of an operating system a library a device driver an API an application program or other module it should be understood that the API implementing component and the API calling component may be the same or different type of module from each other . API implementing components may in some cases be embodied at least in part in firmware microcode or other hardware logic. In some examples an API may allow a client program to use the services provided by a Software Development Kit SDK library. In other examples an application or other client program may use an API provided by an Application Framework. In these examples the application or client program may incorporate calls to functions or methods provided by the SDK and provided by the API or use data types or objects defined in the SDK and provided by the API. An Application Framework may in these examples provide a main event loop for a program that responds to various events defined by the Framework. The API allows the application to specify the events and the responses to the events using the Application Framework. In some implementations an API call can report to an application the capabilities or state of a hardware device including those related to aspects such as input capabilities and state output capabilities and state processing capability power state storage capacity and state communications capability etc. and the API may be implemented in part by firmware microcode or other low level logic that executes in part on the hardware component.

The API calling component may be a local component i.e. on the same data processing system as the API implementing component or a remote component i.e. on a different data processing system from the API implementing component that communicates with the API implementing component through the API over a network. It should be understood that an API implementing component may also act as an API calling component i.e. it may make API calls to an API exposed by a different API implementing component and an API calling component may also act as an API implementing component by implementing an API that is exposed to a different API calling component.

The API may allow multiple API calling components written in different programming languages to communicate with the API implementing component thus the API may include features for translating calls and returns between the API implementing component and the API calling component however the API may be implemented in terms of a specific programming language. An API calling component can in one example call APIs from different providers such as a set of APIs from an OS provider and another set of APIs from a plug in provider and another set of APIs from another provider e.g. the provider of a software library or creator of the another set of APIs.

It will be appreciated that the API implementing component may include additional functions methods classes data structures and or other features that are not specified through the API and are not available to the API calling component . It should be understood that the API calling component may be on the same system as the API implementing component or may be located remotely and accesses the API implementing component using the API over a network. While illustrates a single API calling component interacting with the API it should be understood that other API calling components which may be written in different languages or the same language than the API calling component may use the API .

The API implementing component the API and the API calling component may be stored in a non transitory machine readable storage medium which includes any mechanism for storing information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer or other data processing system . For example a machine readable medium includes magnetic disks optical disks random access memory read only memory flash memory devices etc.

In the exemplary software stack shown in applications can make calls to Services A or B using several Service APIs and to Operating System OS using several OS APIs. Services A and B can make calls to OS using several OS APIs.

Note that the Service 2 has two APIs one of which Service 2 API 1 receives calls from and returns values to Application 1 and the other Service 2 API 2 receives calls from and returns values to Application 2. Service 1 which can be for example a software library makes calls to and receives returned values from OS API 1 and Service 2 which can be for example a software library makes calls to and receives returned values from both OS API 1 and OS API 2. Application 2 makes calls to and receives returned values from OS API 2.

Touch I O device may include a touch sensing panel which is wholly or partially transparent semitransparent non transparent opaque or any combination thereof. Touch I O device may be embodied as a touch screen touch pad a touch screen functioning as a touch pad e.g. a touch screen replacing the touchpad of a laptop a touch screen or touchpad combined or incorporated with any other input device e.g. a touch screen or touchpad disposed on a keyboard or any multi dimensional object having a touch sensing surface for receiving touch input.

In one example touch I O device embodied as a touch screen may include a transparent and or semitransparent touch sensing panel partially or wholly positioned over at least a portion of a display. According to this example touch I O device functions to display graphical data transmitted from computing system and or another source and also functions to receive user input. In other examples touch I O device may be embodied as an integrated touch screen where touch sensing components devices are integral with display components devices. In still other examples a touch screen may be used as a supplemental or additional display screen for displaying supplemental or the same graphical data as a primary display and to receive touch input.

Touch I O device may be configured to detect the location of one or more touches or near touches on device based on capacitive resistive optical acoustic inductive mechanical chemical measurements or any phenomena that can be measured with respect to the occurrences of the one or more touches or near touches in proximity to device . Software hardware firmware or any combination thereof may be used to process the measurements of the detected touches to identify and track one or more gestures. A gesture may correspond to stationary or non stationary single or multiple touches or near touches on touch I O device . A gesture may be performed by moving one or more fingers or other objects in a particular manner on touch I O device such as tapping pressing rocking scrubbing twisting changing orientation pressing with varying pressure and the like at essentially the same time contiguously or consecutively. A gesture may be characterized by but is not limited to a pinching sliding swiping rotating flexing dragging or tapping motion between or with any other finger or fingers. A single gesture may be performed with one or more hands by one or more users or any combination thereof.

Embodied as a touch screen touch I O device may display the GUI. Alternatively the GUI may be displayed on a display separate from touch I O device . The GUI may include graphical elements displayed at particular locations within the interface. Graphical elements may include but are not limited to a variety of displayed virtual input devices including virtual scroll wheels a virtual keyboard virtual knobs virtual buttons any virtual UI and the like. A user may perform gestures at one or more particular locations on touch I O device which may be associated with the graphical elements of the GUI. In other examples the user may perform gestures at one or more locations that are independent of the locations of graphical elements of the GUI. Gestures performed on touch I O device may directly or indirectly manipulate control modify move actuate initiate or generally affect graphical elements such as cursors icons media files lists text all or portions of images or the like within the GUI. For instance in the case of a touch screen a user may directly interact with a graphical element by performing a gesture over the graphical element on the touch screen. Alternatively a touch pad generally provides indirect interaction. Gestures may also affect non displayed GUI elements e.g. causing user interfaces to appear or may affect other actions within computing system e.g. affect a state or mode of a GUI application or operating system . Gestures may or may not be performed on touch I O device in conjunction with a displayed cursor. For instance in the case in which gestures are performed on a touchpad a cursor or pointer may be displayed on a display screen or touch screen and the cursor may be controlled via touch input on the touchpad to interact with graphical objects on the display screen. In other examples in which gestures are performed directly on a touch screen a user may interact directly with objects on the touch screen with or without a cursor or pointer being displayed on the touch screen.
