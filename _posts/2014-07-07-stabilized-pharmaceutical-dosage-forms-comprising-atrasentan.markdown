Atrasentan is a potent and selective antagonist for the endothelin A ET receptor. It previously was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of prostate cancer at daily doses ranging from 2.5 mg to at least 95 mg. Lower daily doses of atrasentan currently are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with Type II diabetes. Although the proprietary atrasentan pharmaceutical dosage forms most recently employed in these clinical trials were suitable for such clinical trials they did not exhibit the longer term stability profile needed for a commercial drug product. Accordingly there is a need for atrasentan pharmaceutical dosage forms having improved stability profiles that comply with regulatory requirements and are suitable for commercial use.

Unless the context requires otherwise the terms comprise comprises and comprising are used on the basis and clear understanding that they are to be interpreted inclusively rather than exclusively and that Applicants intend each of those words to be so interpreted in construing this patent including the claims below.

The term pharmaceutically acceptable such as in the recitation of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent refers to a material that is compatible with administration to a subject e.g the material does not cause an undesirable biological effect. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are described in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts Properties Selection and Use by Stahl and Wermuth Wiley VCH Weinheim Germany 2002 . Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are described in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients Rowe et al. Ed. Pharmaceutical Press 7Ed. 2012 .

The term subject refers to an animal. In one aspect the animal is a mammal including a human or non human preferably a human subject.

The terms treating and treatment refer to ameliorating suppressing eradicating reducing the severity of decreasing the frequency of incidence of preventing reducing the risk of or delaying the onset of the condition.

The present disclosure relates to stable solid pharmaceutical dosage forms comprising atrasentan or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Among the challenges in developing such dosage forms are the low atrasentan dose required for the dosage form the narrow therapeutic window for treating patients the inherent chemical instability of atrasentan in the presence of moisture and many common excipients and the safe handling requirements due to the potency of atrasentan. The stabilized solid dosage forms of the present disclosure however overcome such challenges and allow for the use of a broader range of excipients e.g. metal ion containing excipients such as magnesium stearate packaging configurations e.g. blister packs and manufacturing conditions e.g. wet granulation .

The low dosing and the narrow therapeutic window for atrasentan have been confirmed through analysis of the data collected from recent Phase IIb clinical trials in subjects with diabetic nephropathy. These Phase IIb clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of atrasentan to identify an appropriate balance between the systemic effects of atrasentan which can lead to adverse side effects such as edema and the efficacy effects of atrasentan. Analysis of the clinical data resulted in a finding that for the subjects tested a daily dose of atrasentan less than about 0.25 mg generally was sub therapeutic while a daily dose greater than about 1.25 mg generally resulted in an increase in adverse effects particularly peripheral edema without any further improvement in efficacy relative to the 1.25 mg daily dose. Within this narrow therapeutic window about 0.25 mg to about 1.25 mg daily atrasentan was found to significantly reduce residual albuminuria and the urinary albumin to creatine ratio in the subjects studied. Reduction of residual albuminuria and the urinary albumin to creatine ratio are surrogate endpoints generally associated with delaying the progression of end stage renal disease and associated cardiovascular complications.

As noted above atrasentan will degrade in the presence of many common excipients. It is believed that hydrolysis particularly acid catalyzed hydrolysis and oxidation are the primary degradation pathways for atrasentan in low dose non stabilized solid dosage forms. It is further believed that the primary degradation products of atrasentan in low dose non stabilized solid dosage forms are the diol pyrrolidine acid and N oxide shown below 

The diol and pyrrolidine acid are believed to form through acid catalyzed hydrolysis while the N oxide is believed to form through an oxidative mechanism. Degradation of atrasentan generally is exacerbated as acidity moisture content and metal ion content such as Na Mg and Ca increase in the dosage form or in the specific components of the dosage form. The incompatibility of atrasentan with metal ions is believed to be due to the metal ions catalyzing an oxidation reaction and or forming a complex with atrasentan.

The low dosing potent nature and chemical instability of atrasentan further increase the difficulty of developing a suitable process for the preparation of the dosage form. A suitable process generally will ensure inter alia that atrasentan can be safely handled during the preparation of the dosage form and that dose to dose content uniformity can be maintained. One potential approach is to dissolve or disperse the atrasentan in a liquid vehicle such as water during processing to minimize the generation of airborne dust and the associated risk of operator exposure to the drug. Dissolving or dispersing the atrasentan in a liquid vehicle during processing also can assist with maintaining suitable dose to dose content uniformity for the dosage form. The chemical instability of atrasentan in the presence of water coupled with the decreased chemical stability normally associated with solution state chemistry however raises potential concerns that use of a process employing a liquid vehicle to prepare the atrasentan dosage form such as a process comprising a wet granulation step in which atrasentan is wet granulated with the other excipients during the preparation of the dosage form may not result in an acceptable final dosage form.

Atrasentan dosage forms having the compositions shown in Table 2 A 0.35 mg tablet Table 2 B 0.50 mg tablet and Table 2 C 0.75 mg tablet below were prepared and used in Phase IIb clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atrasentan in treating subjects with diabetic nephropathy. The tablets were prepared using a wet granulation process and were compressed into round tablets having a core weight of 120 mg and a diameter of 6.5 mm.

The 0.35 mg 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg Phase IIb tablets described above were tested for stability under one or more of the following storage conditions 

 a Storage at 40 C. and 75 relative humidity with tablet stability assessed at the end of 1 3 and 6 months accelerated stability testing protocol 

 b Storage at 30 C. and 65 relative humidity with tablet stability assessed at the end of 12 months intermediate term stability testing protocol and

 c Storage at 25 C. and 60 relative humidity with tablet stability assessed at the end of 1 3 6 9 12 18 and 24 months long term storage stability testing protocol .

In each stability test 20 tablets were placed in a high density polyethylene HDPE bottle containing a desiccant and the HDPE bottle was induction sealed with a polypropylene cap. Parameters measured for the tablets at each time interval included atrasentan content relative to labeled dose assay degradation product content water content and dissolution profile. The results are reported below in Tables 2 D through 2 K. The Assay data reported represent the weight percent of atrasentan measured relative to the labeled dose i.e. either 0.35 mg 0.50 mg or 0.75 mg . The Degradation Products data reported represent the weight percent of impurities measured relative to the labeled dose i.e. either 0.35 mg 0.50 mg or 0.75 mg . All data reported represent single values from single runs with the following exceptions a the initial atrasentan content value reported is a mean value where n 2 and b the dissolution values reported are mean values where n 6.

In general the stability data for the Phase IIb tablets indicate an increase in atrasentan degradation products over a six month period at the 40 C. and 75 relative humidity storage conditions for the 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg tablets.

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of an anti oxidant on preventing atrasentan degradation in a mixture of atrasentan a disintegrant and an anti oxidant. Binary or tertiary mixtures containing atrasentan monohydrochloride a crospovidone disintegrant POLYPLASDONE XL and for the tertiary mixtures an anti oxidant selected from ascorbic acid powder sodium metabisulfite and L cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate at five different molar ratios of atrasentan to anti oxidant were prepared. In each case the weight ratio of disintegrant to atrasentan was held constant at about 9 1. The compositions of the mixtures are shown below in Table 3 A ascorbic acid powder Table 3 B sodium metabisulfite and Table 3 C L cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate . The mixtures were not further formulated i.e. they were not processed into tablets or capsules and were maintained as loose blends of the components during storage. To ensure that content non uniformity for a single mixture did not impact the results several mixtures were prepared for each molar ratio tested and a different mixture was sampled and tested at each time point.

The mixtures were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which each sample was stored in a 20 mL glass scintillation vial at 80 C. and ambient relative humidity. Stability was assessed at initiation of testing the end of seven days and the end of three weeks. Stability testing results are reported below in Tables 3 A through 3 F. All data reported represent single values from single runs i.e. n 1 . The Impurities data reported below in Tables 3 A through 3 C represent the percent impurities by HPLC peak area percent. The Weight Atrasentan data reported below in Tables 3 D through 3 F represent the weight percent of atrasentan measured relative to the corresponding weight of atrasentan initially added to the mixture.

In general the stability data for the Phase IIb tablets indicate that L cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate provides the greatest stabilizing effect of the three anti oxidants an interesting result given the relative oxidation reduction potentials ORP of the three anti oxidants. Atrasentan has an ORP value greater than about 900 mV. Ascorbic acid sodium metabisulfite and L cysteine have ORP values of about 100 280 mV about 175 300 mV and about 815 965 mV respectively. Although L cysteine has an ORP value that is relatively close to the ORP value of atrasentan indicating the least oxidative reactivity of the anti oxidants tested with respect to atrasentan it still provided the greatest stabilizing effect.

A study was conducted to evaluate the effect of molar ratio of atrasentan to L cysteine on atrasentan degradation in uncoated tablets comprising L cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate but otherwise substantially the same as the tablet core composition described in Table 2 B of Example 2. The tablets tested had the compositions shown in Tables 4 A 2 1 molar ratio 4 B 1 1 molar ratio and 4 C 1 2 molar ratio below. The tablets were prepared using a wet granulation process and were compressed into round tablets having a core weight of 120 mg and a diameter of 6.5 mm.

The tablets described above were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol. The tablets were packaged in 3 ounce HDPE bottles with induction sealed caps and stored at 50 C. and ambient relative humidity. Each bottle contained 20 tablets and 1.1 g of a silica desiccant. Tablet stability was assessed at the end of 3 6 and 9 weeks. The stability testing results are reported below in Table 4 D. The Assay data reported represent the weight percent of atrasentan measured relative to the labeled dose i.e. 0.31 mg . All data reported represent single values from single runs n 1 .

A lab scale study i.e. each batch prepared was less than 500 mg was conducted to evaluate the effect of HPMC on atrasentan tablet stability. Uncoated tablets corresponding to the compositions shown in Table 5 A below were prepared at a drug loading of 0.45 based on the weight of atrasentan monohydrochloride using five different methods of preparation that differed in the manner atrasentan was treated with the HPMC.

Atrasentan was completely dissolved in a 9 HPMC solution. All other ingredients were added to a granulation bowl in dry form. The atrasentan HPMC solution was sprayed into the granulation bowl and the ingredients were wet granulated using a lab scale key granulator. The granulated mixture was tray dried in an oven without vacuum and then compressed into tablets that were left uncoated.

Atrasentan was added to a 9 HPMC solution to form a suspension. All other ingredients were added to a granulation bowl in dry form. The atrasentan HPMC suspension was sprayed into the granulation bowl and the ingredients were wet granulated using lab scale key granulator. The granulated mixture was tray dried in an oven without vacuum and then compressed into uncoated tablets.

Atrasentan was dry mixed with HPMC. The atrasentan HPMC mixture was then mixed with the remaining ingredients in dry form and without the addition of water or any other liquid. The mixed ingredients were directly compressed into tablets that were left uncoated.

Atrasentan was compressed with HPMC dry granulation and sieved to provide atrasentan HPMC dry granules. The atrasentan HPMC dry granules were then mixed with the remaining ingredients in dry form and without the addition of water or any other liquid. The mixed ingredients were directly compressed into tablets that were left uncoated.

Atrasentan HPMC and the other ingredients were mixed in dry form without any pre treatment of the atrasentan with HPMC and without the addition of water or any other liquid. The mixed ingredients were directly compressed into tablets that were left uncoated.

The tablets described above were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which the tablets were stored at 50 C. and 75 relative humidity in sealed 5 oz. HDPE bottles containing 2 g of a clay desiccant. Tablet stability was assessed at the initiation of testing and at the end of three six and eight weeks. Stability testing results are reported below in Table 6 B. The Impurities data reported represent the percent impurities by HPLC peak area percent. All data reported represent single values from single runs n 1 .

The data indicate that pre treatment of atrasentan with HPMC during the preparation of the direct blend tablets i.e. dry mixed tablets prepared in Method 3 or dry granulated tablets prepared as in Method 4 reduces total impurities relative to direct blend tablets prepared without any pre treatment of atrasentan with HPMC i.e. dry mixing as in Method 5 .

The data for the wet granulated tablets prepared as in Method 1 or Method 2 indicate a higher impurity content than is typically observed for wet granulated tablets prepared in larger scale operations see Example 6 below . It is believed that the higher impurities content is attributable to factors such as the use of lab scale equipment e.g. tray drying in an oven without vacuum rather than vacuum drying and the use of lower grade excipients than typically required for the preparation of clinical and commercial tablets.

A manufacturing scale study i.e. each batch prepared was at least about 15 kg was conducted to evaluate the effect of HPMC on atrasentan tablet stability. Uncoated tablets corresponding to the compositions shown in Table 6 A below were prepared at three different drug loadings 0.05 0.17 and 0.27 using three different methods of preparation as described below.

All ingredients were mixed in dry form without the addition of water or any other liquid. The mixed ingredients were directly compressed into tablets that remained uncoated for stability testing.

All ingredients except HPMC were added dry to a granulation bowl and were wet granulated using a 9 HPMC solution. The granulated mixture was dried under vacuum and then compressed into uncoated tablets.

Atrasentan was added to a 9 HPMC solution to form a suspension. All other ingredients were added to a granulation bowl in dry form. The suspension was sprayed into the granulation bowl and the ingredients were wet granulated. The granulated mixture was dried under vacuum and then compressed into tablets that remained uncoated for stability testing.

The tablets described above were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which 20 tablets were stored at 50 C. and 75 relative humidity in a sealed 3 oz. HDPE bottle containing 2 g of a clay desiccant. Tablet stability was assessed at the initiation of testing and at the end of two and four weeks. Stability testing results are reported below in Table 6 A Method 1 Table 6 B Method 2 and Table 6 C Method 3 . The Impurities data reported represent the percent impurities by HPLC peak area percent. All data reported represent single values from single runs i.e. n 1 .

Although there was no discernible difference in content uniformity between the tablets prepared by Method 2 atrasentan added dry to the granulation bowl prior to the addition of the HPMC solution and the tablets prepared by Method 3 atrasentan added to the granulation bowl as an HPMC atrasentan suspension the chemical degradation of atrasentan over time was higher for the tablets prepared by Method 2 than for the tablets prepared by Method 3. In addition the rate of chemical degradation of atrasentan for the tablets prepared by Method 1 atrasentan and HPMC added dry to the granulation bowl was higher than for the corresponding tablets prepared by Method 2 atrasentan added dry to the granulation bowl prior to the addition of the HPMC solution .

A study was conducted to compare the effect of HPMC and Kollicoat a copolymer of polyvinyl alcohol on atrasentan tablet stability. Atrasentan was dissolved or suspended depending upon drug loading in a polymer coating solution to form an atrasentan polymer coating solution. In each case a placebo core having the composition shown in Table 7 A was sprayed with a polymer base coating then the atrasentan polymer coating and finally a polymer seal coat. The atrasentan polymer coating polymer base coating and polymer seal coating had the compositions shown in Table 7 B HPMC 0.05 mg atrasentan Table 7 C HPMC 0.75 mg atrasentan Table 7 D Kollicoat 0.05 mg atrasentan and Table 7 E Kollicoat 0.55 mg atrasentan .

The tablets prepared as described above were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which 20 tablets were stored at 50 C. and 75 relative humidity in a sealed 5 oz. HDPE bottles containing 2 g of a clay desiccant. Tablet stability was assessed at the initiation of testing and at the end of two and four weeks. Stability testing results are reported below in Table 7 F. The Impurities data reported represent the percent impurities by HPLC peak area percent. All data reported represent single values from single runs i.e. n 1 .

Because degradation of atrasentan can be moisture activated the atrasentan coated tablet approach of this Example is considered to be a product presentation that is more susceptible to atrasentan degradation. The results show improved chemical stability for the HPMC coated tablets relative to the Kollicoat coated tablets.

The effect of HPMC on the solid state behavior of atrasentan was evaluated in a study in which slurry samples of atrasentan Form II polymorph suspended in a 9 HPMC solution stored at room temperature and 40 C. were compared with corresponding slurry samples obtained from atrasentan Form II polymorph suspended in water stored at room temperature and 40 C. The atrasentan concentration in all four suspensions was 4.4 by weight. Samples 1 mL were taken from each suspension at 30 minutes 6 hours and 30 hour from initiation and centrifuged to provide both a solid material and a filtrate for further analysis.

The solid material from each sample was analyzed by powder x ray diffraction PXRD and compared to the PXRD for the corresponding initial sample i.e. the PXRD pattern for the atrasentan Form II polymorph . Although the primary PXRD pattern for all suspensions after 30 minutes and 6 hours at either room temperature or 40 C. still corresponded to the PXRD pattern for the atrasentan Form II polymorph the PXRD pattern for the samples obtained from the suspensions without HPMC indicated partial conversion of the atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at both room temperature and 40 C. A higher level of conversion was seen for the suspensions without HPMC stored at 40 C. The PXRD pattern for the samples obtained from the suspensions with HPMC stored at room temperature showed no conversion of the atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at any timepoint. The PXRD pattern for the samples obtained from the suspensions with HPMC stored at 40 C. showed no conversion at the 6 hour timepoint and only minimal conversion at the 30 hour timepoint.

The filtrates collected from the slurry samples at each time point were freeze dried by a lab scale lyophilizer. Prior to lyophilization of the filtrate the pH of the suspension was measured. The average pH was 1.8 for filtrates from suspensions containing no HPMC and 2.2 for suspensions with HPMC. The pH for each sample remained consistent regardless of time or temperature. The freeze dried filtrates were submitted for solid state NMR analysis to determine if any chemical interaction between HPMC and atrasentan could be observed but the sample concentrations were too dilute for analysis.

The results indicate that the presence of HPMC in the suspension a slows and possibly prevents the conversion of atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at room temperature and b slows the conversion of atrasentan Form II polymorph to the more thermodynamically stable atrasentan Form I polymorph at 40 C.

Wet granulation blends prepared as described in Method 2 atrasentan added dry to granulation bowl and Method 3 atrasentan added as HPMC suspension to granulation bowl of Example 6 were analyzed prior to compression using inverse gas chromatography IGC to determine the surface energy of the blends. These measurements were compared to the measured values for pure atrasentan and pure HPMC. The results are shown in Table 9 below.

The results indicate that the blends lie closer in energy value to pure HPMC than to pure atrasentan likely due to a larger concentration of HPMC in the blend than atrasentan . The results further indicate that the wet granulation blend prepared as described in Method 2 atrasentan added dry to granulation bowl has a higher surface energy than the wet granulation blend prepared as described in Method 3 atrasentan added as HPMC suspension to granulation bowl which is consistent with the higher atrasentan degradation seen in the Method 2 blend compared to the Method 3 blend see Example 6 .

Overall the results of Examples 5 to 9 confirm that HPMC stabilizes atrasentan and reduces atrasentan degradation in the low dose dosage forms of the present disclosure. This stabilizing effect is observed when atrasentan is intimately mixed with HPMC during the preparation of the dosage form such as introducing atrasentan to the granulation bowl as an atrasentan HPMC suspension or as a dry mixture of atrasentan and HPMC.

Two atrasentan dosage forms having the compositions shown in Table 10 A 0.50 mg tablet and Table 10 B 0.75 mg tablet below were prepared for use in Phase III clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atrasentan in treating subjects with diabetic nephropathy. The tablets were prepared using a wet granulation process and were compressed into round tablets having a core weight of 120 mg and a diameter of 6.5 mm. A third atrasentan dosage form having the composition shown in Table 10 C 0.35 mg tablet can be prepared in a similar manner. The 0.35 mg tablet 0.50 mg tablet and 0.75 mg tablet have drug loads based on weight of atrasentan monohydrochloride of 0.31 0.45 and 0.67 respectively.

Table 10A B provides a comparison of the target composition for the 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg Phase III tablets prepared in large scale tableting operations.

The 0.50 mg and 0.75 mg Phase III tablets described above are tested for stability under each of the following storage conditions

In each stability test 20 tablets are stored in a 3 oz HDPE bottle containing 1.1 g of a silica desiccant and having induction sealed cap. Parameters measured for the tablets at each time interval include atrasentan content relative to the labeled dose degradation product content water content and dissolution rate. The 0.35 mg dosage form shown in Table 10 C can be tested in a similar manner.

Stability data for the 0.50 mg Phase III tablet and the 0.75 mg Phase III tablet under the long term storage protocols are reported in Tables 10 D 10 E 10 F and 10 G below.

Stability of the 0.50 mg Phase IIb tablet i.e. the tablet corresponding to Table 2 B of Example 2 and the 0.50 mg Phase III tablet i.e. the tablet corresponding to Table 10 A of Example 10 packaged in several different configurations was tested. The packaging configurations tested included 

 f tablets blistered in an ACLAR Rx160 blister sealed in a foil overwrap with 1.1 g of a silica desiccant.

The packaged tablets were tested for stability using an accelerated stability testing protocol under which the tablets were stored at 40 C. and 75 relative humidity and tablet stability was assessed at initiation of the testing and at the end of one three and six months. Accelerated stability testing results are reported below in Table 11. The Assay data reported represent the weight percent of atrasentan measured relative to the labeled dose i.e. 0.50 mg . All data reported represent single values from single runs i.e. n 1 .

With the exception of the more protective blister sealed in a foil overwrap with desiccant packaging the Phase III tablet containing L cysteine exhibited improved stability relative to the Phase IIb tablet in all packaging configurations tested and should be suitable for use in a variety of blister package configurations.

One batch of the 0.75 mg Phase III tablets i.e. the tablet corresponding to Table 10 B of Example 10 was prepared as described below.

Atrasentan monohydrochloride 0.67 kg and a first portion of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose Hypromellose E5 0.84 kg were added to a poly bag and manually blended for about five minutes. The mixture of atrasentan monohydrochloride hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was added slowly to water 9.4 kg with stirring to form a suspension. The suspension was cooled to 12 C. and the cooled suspension was mixed for three cycles under the following mixing conditions two minutes of high shear mixing using an agitator and homogenizer at 100 of the maximum speed followed by 120 minutes of mixing using the agitator only at 100 of the maximum speed. The suspension was mixed for an additional nine hours at 12 C. using the agitator at 100 of the maximum speed. L cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate 0.216 kg was added to the suspension with stirring. The suspension was mixed for an additional 20 minutes using an agitator at 100 of the maximum speed and then heated to 20 C.

The intragranular excipients lactose monohydrate 90.61 kg a second portion of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose Hypromellose E5 2.16 kg crospovidone POLYPLASDONE XL 3.5 kg and a first portion of silicon dioxide SYLOID 0.25 kg were added to a single pot processor and blended for 10 minutes at 10 RPM. The intragranular excipients were then blended for an additional five minutes at 102 RPM. The atrasentan suspension prepared as described above was then added to the single pot processor at an average rate of 3.8 kg minute while the contents of single pot processor were mixed at 102 RPM. Rinse water 7.6 kg was added to the suspension vessel and the rinse water was then transferred to the single pot processor at an average rate of 3.8 kg minutes while the contents of the single pot processor were mixed at 102 RPM.

The resulting granulation mixture was wet massed with high shear mixing for 30 seconds to one minute to an achieved target power end point 6.3 kW . The granulation mixture was dried under vacuum at less than 15 mbar with the single pot processor bowl and lid temperature maintained at 75 C. until a loss on drying moisture measurement of 0.7 to 1.8 was achieved. The granulation mixture was milled using a COMIL to achieve a target particle size distribution of 250 m d90 and 100 m d50 .

The extragranular excipients glycerol behenate COMPRITOL 1.5 kg and a second portion of silicon dioxide SYLOID 0.25 kg were added to the single pot processor and the extragranular excipients and milled granulation mixture were blended for 10 minutes at 10 RPM. The blend was compressed to prepare tablet cores having a weight of 120 mg and a hardness greater than or equal to 40 N. An aqueous solution containing 9.7 HPMC and 0.3 Polyethylene Glycol 1450 was prepared for use as a tablet coating solution.
