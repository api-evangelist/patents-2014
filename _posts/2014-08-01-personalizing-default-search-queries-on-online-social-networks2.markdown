This disclosure generally relates to social graphs and performing searches for objects within a social networking environment.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Social graph analysis views social relationships in terms of network theory consisting of nodes and edges. Nodes represent the individual actors within the networks and edges represent the relationships between the actors. The resulting graph based structures are often very complex. There can be many types of nodes and many types of edges for connecting nodes. In its simplest form a social graph is a map of all of the relevant edges between all the nodes being studied.

In particular embodiments a social networking system may generate structured queries that include references to particular social graph elements. These structured queries may be generated for example in response to a text query provided by a user or generated as default queries. By providing suggested structured queries to a user s text query the social networking system may provide a powerful way for users of an online social network to search for elements represented in a social graph based on their social graph attributes and their relation to various social graph elements.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate a set of personalized structured queries for a page of the online social network. These suggested structured queries for a user based on user engagement factors. It may be desirable for the social networking system to provide users with structured queries that are more interesting to the user and thus more likely to be engaged with e.g. selected or clicked thru . It may further be desirable to provide personalized suggestions for queries based on information associated with the querying user and the user s friend e.g. social graph information . Search results can be identified that can be of interest to the user. Queries can be suggested that will return a search results page comprising the identified results. A variety of factors may be used to increase user engagement such as for example business intelligence user preference history social graph affinity advertising sponsorship or other suitable factors may be used to determine which suggested queries to serve to the user. The social networking system may calculate which structured queries are more likely to be engaged with by a user and then send suggested queries to the user that the user is more likely to engage with.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate personalized search queries to the user. The social networking system may identify a first set of nodes and score those nodes based on engagement factors. The social networking system can then identify common nodes that connect multiple nodes from the first set of nodes. The social networking system can then generate structured queries that reference nodes and edges where at least one structured query is a personalized query. The social networking system can then send the personalized search query to the first user for display.

In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to a user of social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may be an individual human user an entity e.g. an enterprise business or third party application or a group e.g. of individuals or entities that interacts or communicates with or over social networking system . In particular embodiments when a user registers for an account with social networking system social networking system may create a user node corresponding to the user and store the user node in one or more data stores. Users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to registered users and user nodes associated with registered users. In addition or as an alternative users and user nodes described herein may where appropriate refer to users that have not registered with social networking system . In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with information provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation a user may provide his or her name profile picture contact information birth date sex marital status family status employment education background preferences interests or other demographic information. In particular embodiments a user node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with a user. In particular embodiments a user node may correspond to one or more pages.

In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to a concept. As an example and not by way of limitation a concept may correspond to a place such as for example a movie theater restaurant landmark or city a website such as for example a website associated with social networking system or a third party website associated with a web application server an entity such as for example a person business group sports team or celebrity a resource such as for example an audio file video file digital photo text file structured document or application which may be located within social networking system or on an external server such as a web application server real or intellectual property such as for example a sculpture painting movie game song idea photograph or written work a game an activity an idea or theory another suitable concept or two or more such concepts. A concept node may be associated with information of a concept provided by a user or information gathered by various systems including social networking system . As an example and not by way of limitation information of a concept may include a name or a title one or more images e.g. an image of the cover page of a book a location e.g. an address or a geographical location a website which may be associated with a URL contact information e.g. a phone number or an email address other suitable concept information or any suitable combination of such information. In particular embodiments a concept node may be associated with one or more data objects corresponding to information associated with concept node . In particular embodiments a concept node may correspond to one or more pages.

In particular embodiments a node in social graph may represent or be represented by a page which may be referred to as a profile page . Profile pages may be hosted by or accessible to social networking system . Profile pages may also be hosted on third party websites associated with a third party server . As an example and not by way of limitation a profile page corresponding to a particular external webpage may be the particular external webpage and the profile page may correspond to a particular concept node . Profile pages may be viewable by all or a selected subset of other users. As an example and not by way of limitation a user node may have a corresponding user profile page in which the corresponding user may add content make declarations or otherwise express himself or herself. As another example and not by way of limitation a concept node may have a corresponding concept profile page in which one or more users may add content make declarations or express themselves particularly in relation to the concept corresponding to concept node .

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Imagine using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts. Although this disclosure describes forming particular edges in particular manners this disclosure contemplates forming any suitable edges in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more client side and or backend server side processes may implement and utilize a typeahead feature that may automatically attempt to match social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges to information currently being entered by a user in an input form rendered in conjunction with a requested page such as for example a user profile page a concept profile page a search results page a user interface of a native application associated with the online social network or another suitable page of the online social network which may be hosted by or accessible in the social networking system . In particular embodiments as a user is entering text to make a declaration the typeahead feature may attempt to match the string of textual characters being entered in the declaration to strings of characters e.g. names descriptions corresponding to user concepts or edges and their corresponding elements in the social graph . In particular embodiments when a match is found the typeahead feature may automatically populate the form with a reference to the social graph element such as for example the node name type node ID edge name type edge ID or another suitable reference or identifier of the existing social graph element.

In particular embodiments as a user types or otherwise enters text into a form used to add content or make declarations in various sections of the user s profile page home page or other page the typeahead process may work in conjunction with one or more frontend client side and or backend server side typeahead processes hereinafter referred to simply as typeahead process executing at or within the social networking system e.g. within servers to interactively and virtually instantaneously as appearing to the user attempt to auto populate the form with a term or terms corresponding to names of existing social graph elements or terms associated with existing social graph elements determined to be the most relevant or best match to the characters of text entered by the user as the user enters the characters of text. Utilizing the social graph information in a social graph database or information extracted and indexed from the social graph database including information associated with nodes and edges the typeahead processes in conjunction with the information from the social graph database as well as potentially in conjunction with various others processes applications or databases located within or executing within social networking system may be able to predict a user s intended declaration with a high degree of precision. However the social networking system can also provides user s with the freedom to enter essentially any declaration they wish enabling users to express themselves freely.

In particular embodiments as a user enters text characters into a form box or other field the typeahead processes may attempt to identify existing social graph elements e.g. user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered in the user s declaration as the user is entering the characters. In particular embodiments as the user enters characters into a form box the typeahead process may read the string of entered textual characters. As each keystroke is made the frontend typeahead process may send the entered character string as a request or call to the backend typeahead process executing within social networking system . In particular embodiments the typeahead processes may communicate via AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript and XML or other suitable techniques and particularly asynchronous techniques. In particular embodiments the request may be or comprise an XMLHTTPRequest XHR enabling quick and dynamic sending and fetching of results. In particular embodiments the typeahead process may also send before after or with the request a section identifier section ID that identifies the particular section of the particular page in which the user is making the declaration. In particular embodiments a user ID parameter may also be sent but this may be unnecessary in some embodiments as the user may already be known based on the user having logged into or otherwise been authenticated by the social networking system .

In particular embodiments the typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching social graph elements. In particular embodiments when a match or matches are found the typeahead process may send a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings or descriptions of the matching social graph elements as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user entering the characters pok into a query field the typeahead process may display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes such as a profile page named or devoted to poker or pokemon which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to declare the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node. As another example and not by way of limitation upon clicking poker the typeahead process may auto populate or causes the web browser to auto populate the query field with the declaration poker . In particular embodiments the typeahead process may simply auto populate the field with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu. The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on his or her keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration.

More information on typeahead processes may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 763 162 filed 19 Apr. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the typeahead processes described herein may be applied to search queries entered by a user. As an example and not by way of limitation as a user enters text characters into a query field a typeahead process may attempt to identify one or more user nodes concept nodes or edges that match the string of characters entered into query field as the user is entering the characters. As the typeahead process receives requests or calls including a string or n gram from the text query the typeahead process may perform or causes to be performed a search to identify existing social graph elements i.e. user nodes concept nodes edges having respective names types categories or other identifiers matching the entered text. The typeahead process may use one or more matching algorithms to attempt to identify matching nodes or edges. When a match or matches are found the typeahead process may send a response to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the matching nodes as well as potentially other metadata associated with the matching nodes. The typeahead process may then display a drop down menu that displays names of matching existing profile pages and respective user nodes or concept nodes and displays names of matching edges that may connect to the matching user nodes or concept nodes which the user can then click on or otherwise select thereby confirming the desire to search for the matched user or concept name corresponding to the selected node or to search for users or concepts connected to the matched users or concepts by the matching edges. Alternatively the typeahead process may simply auto populate the form with the name or other identifier of the top ranked match rather than display a drop down menu . The user may then confirm the auto populated declaration simply by keying enter on a keyboard or by clicking on the auto populated declaration. Upon user confirmation of the matching nodes and edges the typeahead process may send a request that informs the social networking system of the user s confirmation of a query containing the matching social graph elements. In response to the request sent the social networking system may automatically or alternately based on an instruction in the request call or otherwise search a social graph database for the matching social graph elements or for social graph elements connected to the matching social graph elements as appropriate. Although this disclosure describes applying the typeahead processes to search queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates applying the typeahead processes to search queries in any suitable manner.

In connection with search queries and search results particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 which are incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may receive from a querying first user corresponding to a first user node an unstructured text query. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may want to search for other users who 1 are first degree friends of the first user and 2 are associated with Stanford University i.e. the user nodes are connected by an edge to the concept node corresponding to the school Stanford . The first user may then enter a text query friends stanford into query field as illustrated in . As the querying user enters this text query into query field the social networking system may provide various suggested structured queries as illustrated in drop down menus . As used herein an unstructured text query refers to a simple text string inputted by a user. The text query may of course be structured with respect to standard language grammar rules e.g. English language grammar . However the text query will ordinarily be unstructured with respect to social graph elements. In other words a simple text query will not ordinarily include embedded references to particular social graph elements. Thus as used herein a structured query refers to a query that contains references to particular social graph elements allowing the search engine to search based on the identified elements. Furthermore the text query may be unstructured with respect to formal query syntax. In other words a simple text query will not necessarily be in the format of a query command that is directly executable by a search engine e.g. the text query friends stanford could be parsed to form the query command intersect school Stanford University friends me or search me friends node ID for Stanford University students ever past intersect which could be executed as a query in a social graph database . Although this disclosure describes receiving particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may parse the unstructured text query also simply referred to as a search query received from the first user i.e. the querying user to identify one or more n grams. In general an n gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sequence of text or speech. The items may be characters phonemes syllables letters words base pairs prefixes or other identifiable items from the sequence of text or speech. The n gram may comprise one or more characters of text letters numbers punctuation etc. entered by the querying user. An n gram of size one can be referred to as a unigram of size two can be referred to as a bigram or digram of size three can be referred to as a trigram and so on. Each n gram may include one or more parts from the text query received from the querying user. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a character string e.g. one or more characters of text entered by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends stanford to identify the following n grams friends stanford friends stanford. As another example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may parse the text query friends in palo alto to identify the following n grams friends in palo alto friends in in palo palo alto friend in palo in palo alto friends in palo alto. In particular embodiments each n gram may comprise a contiguous sequence of n items from the text query. Although this disclosure describes parsing particular queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates parsing any suitable queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify a plurality of nodes or a plurality of edges corresponding to one or more of the n grams of a text query. Identifying social graph elements that correspond to an n gram may be done in a variety of manners such as for example by determining or calculating for each n gram identified in the text query a score that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the social networking system may determine a probability score also referred to simply as a probability that the n gram corresponds to a social graph element such as a user node a concept node or an edge of social graph . The probability score may indicate the level of similarity or relevance between the n gram and a particular social graph element. There may be many different ways to calculate the probability. The present disclosure contemplates any suitable method to calculate a probability score for an n gram identified in a search query. In particular embodiments the social networking system may determine a probability p that an n gram corresponds to a particular social graph element. The probability p may be calculated as the probability of corresponding to a particular social graph element k given a particular search query X. In other words the probability may be calculated as p k X . As an example and not by way of limitation a probability that an n gram corresponds to a social graph element may calculated as an probability score denoted as p. The input may be a text query X x x . . . x and a set of classes. For each i j and a class k the social networking system may compute p p class x k X . As an example and not by way of limitation the n gram stanford could be scored with respect to the following social graph elements as follows school Stanford University 0.7 location Stanford Calif. 0.2 user Allen Stanford 0.1. In this example because the n gram stanford corresponds to multiple social graph elements it may be considered an ambiguous n gram by the social networking system . In other words the n gram is not immediately resolvable to a single social graph element based on the parsing algorithm used by the social networking system . In particular embodiments after identifying an ambiguous n gram the social networking system may highlight that n gram in the text query to indicate that it may correspond to multiple social graph elements. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the term Stanford in query field has been highlighted with a dashed underline to indicate that it may correspond to multiple social graph elements as discussed previously. Although this disclosure describes determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining whether n grams correspond to social graph elements in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using a particular type of score this disclosure contemplates determining whether an n gram corresponds to a social graph element using any suitable type of score.

No. 13 731 866 filed 31 Dec. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 732 101 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may access a context free grammar model comprising a plurality of grammars. Each grammar of the grammar model may comprise one or more non terminal tokens or non terminal symbols and one or more terminal tokens or terminal symbols query tokens where particular non terminal tokens may be replaced by terminal tokens. A grammar model is a set of formation rules for strings in a formal language. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular grammars this disclosure contemplates any suitable grammars.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more strings using one or more grammars. To generate a string in the language one begins with a string consisting of only a single start symbol. The production rules are then applied in any order until a string that contains neither the start symbol nor designated non terminal symbols is produced. In a context free grammar the production of each non terminal symbol of the grammar is independent of what is produced by other non terminal symbols of the grammar. The non terminal symbols may be replaced with terminal symbols i.e. terminal tokens or query tokens . Some of the query tokens may correspond to identified nodes or identified edges as described previously. A string generated by the grammar may then be used as the basis for a structured query containing references to the identified nodes or identified edges. The string generated by the grammar may be rendered in a natural language syntax such that a structured query based on the string is also rendered in natural language. A context free grammar is a grammar in which the left hand side of each production rule consists of only a single non terminal symbol. A probabilistic context free grammar is a tuple N S P where the disjoint sets and N specify the terminal and non terminal symbols respectively with S N being the start symbol. P is the set of productions which take the form E p with E N N and p Pr E the probability that E will be expanded into the string . The sum of probabilities p over all expansions of a given non terminal E must be one. Although this disclosure describes generating strings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating strings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more structured queries. The structured queries may be based on the natural language strings generated by one or more grammars as described previously. Each structured query may include references to one or more of the identified nodes or one or more of the identified edges . This type of structured query may allow the social networking system to more efficiently search for resources and content related to the online social network such as for example profile pages by searching for content connected to or otherwise related to the identified user nodes and the identified edges . As an example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query show me friends of my girlfriend the social networking system may generate a structured query Friends of Stephanie where Friends and Stephanie in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements. The reference to Stephanie would correspond to a particular user node where the social networking system has parsed the n gram my girlfriend to correspond with a user node for the user Stephanie while the reference to Friends would correspond to friend type edges connecting that user node to other user nodes i.e. edges connecting to Stephanie s first degree friends . When executing this structured query the social networking system may identify one or more user nodes connected by friend type edges to the user node corresponding to Stephanie . As another example and not by way of limitation in response to the text query friends who work at facebook the social networking system may generate a structured query My friends who work at Facebook where my friends work at and Facebook in the structured query are references corresponding to particular social graph elements as described previously i.e. a friend type edge a work at type edge and concept node corresponding to the company Facebook . These structured queries may be pre generated and accessed from a cache or generated dynamically in response to input from the user. Although this disclosure describes generating particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the generated structured queries. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. The structured queries may be scored based on a variety of factors such as for example the page or type of page the user is accessing user engagement factors business intelligence data the click thru rate of particular queries the conversion rate of particular queries user preferences of the querying user the search history of the user advertising sponsorship of particular queries the querying user s social graph affinity for social graph elements referenced in particular queries the intent of the user the general or current popularity of particular queries the usefulness of particular queries the geographic location of the user other suitable factors or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes ranking structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates ranking structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send one or more of the structured queries to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation after the structured queries are generated the social networking system may send one or more of the structured queries as a response which may utilize AJAX or other suitable techniques to the user s client system that may include for example the names name strings of the referenced social graph elements other query limitations e.g. Boolean operators etc. as well as potentially other metadata associated with the referenced social graph elements. The web browser on the querying user s client system may display the sent structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in . In particular embodiments the sent queries may be presented to the querying user in a ranked order such as for example based on a rank previously determined as described above. Structured queries with better rankings may be presented in a more prominent position. Furthermore in particular embodiments only structured queries above a threshold rank may be sent or displayed to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the structured queries may be presented to the querying user in a drop down menu where higher ranked structured queries may be presented at the top of the menu with lower ranked structured queries presented in descending order down the menu. In the examples illustrated in only the seven highest ranked queries are sent and displayed to the user. In particular embodiments one or more references in a structured query may be highlighted e.g. outlined underlined circled bolded italicized colored lighted offset in caps in order to indicate its correspondence to a particular social graph element. As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in the references to Stanford University and Stanford Calif. are highlighted outlined in the structured queries to indicate that it corresponds to a particular concept node . Similarly the references to Friends like work at and go to in the structured queries presented in drop down menu could also be highlighted to indicate that they correspond to particular edges . Although this disclosure describes sending particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates sending any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may receive from the querying user a selection of one of the structured queries. The nodes and edges referenced in the received structured query may be referred to as the selected nodes and selected edges respectively. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser on the querying user s client system may display the sent structured queries in a drop down menu as illustrated in which the user may then click on or otherwise select e.g. by touching the query on a touchscreen or keying enter on his keyboard to indicate the particular structured query the user wants the social networking system to execute. Although this disclosure describes receiving selections of particular structured queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates receiving selections of any suitable structured queries in any suitable manner.

More information on structured search queries and grammar models may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 072 filed 23 Jul. 2012 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 674 695 filed 12 Nov. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 866 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more personalized default structured queries herein referred to as simply personalized queries for a particular user of the online social network. In particular embodiments the personalized queries may be queries that are of interest or relevant to the first user . In particular embodiments social networking system may generate suggested personalized queries for a user based on one or more user engagement factors. It may be desirable for social networking system to provide users with personalized queries that are more interesting to the user and thus more likely to be engaged with e.g. selected or clicked thru . A variety of factors may be used to increase user engagement such as for example business intelligence user preference history social graph affinity advertising sponsorship or other suitable factors may be used to determine which suggested queries to serve to the user. Social networking system may calculate which personalized queries are more likely to be engaged with by a user and then send suggested queries to the user that the user is more likely to engage with. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may generate a set of possible suggested queries and score sponsored queries more highly than other queries and these sponsored queries may then be sent to the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate the personalized queries based at least in part on information associated with the querying user who is querying or friends of the querying user. In particular embodiments the social networking system may identify content objects that may be of interest to the first user and then generate personalized queries based at least in part on which queries will generate search results corresponding to the content object of interest to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation if some of the first user s friends attend a particular concert the social networking system may suggest a query suggestion or a null state query of Photos taken at or Photos of your friends at . The personalized search query suggestions for a particular user may provide timely and or localized suggestions that are of interest to the user. Moreover the personalized search query suggestions may change frequently and provide interesting search result pages which may keep the querying user more interested and engaged. Although this disclosure describes generating particular personalized queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable personalized queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may score a first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on one or more user engagement factors. Each node in the first set of nodes corresponds to a content object e.g. a user node or a concept node of the online social network. In this way social networking may identify objects of interest to the querying user. A user engagement factor provides a metric for measuring the engagement of a user of the online social network such as for example by engaging with other users concepts content etc. The score may be for example a confidence score a probability a quality a ranking another suitable type of score or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation the score for each node may represent a probability that the first user will engage with the node. As another example and not by way of limitation the score may represent estimate of the degree and depth of user interaction with particular objects against a clearly defined set of goals. Scoring based on user engagement factors may be based on a variety of factors such as for example the page or type of page the user is accessing business intelligence data the search history of the user the intent of the user the geographic location of the user the general or current popularity of particular nodes other suitable factors or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes scoring particular nodes in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates scoring nodes in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on one or more user engagement factors comprises scoring based at least in part on a business intelligence data. In this context business intelligence data refers to data gathered by social networking system that helps predict or identify nodes that users are more likely to engage with or nodes that promote one or more business goals. The business intelligence data may be data related particular to the user or related to other users of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may use business intelligence data relating to the user to identify nodes or node types that the first user is more likely to engage with. As another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may use business intelligence data relating to one or more other users of the online social network e.g. users within a threshold degree of separation users within particular groups or networks or all users of the online social network to identify nodes or node types that those users have or are likely to engage with and infer the likelihood of the user to engage with such nodes.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on a user preference of the querying user. The user preferences could be specified by the querying user other users e.g. parents or employers of the querying user system administrators third party systems or otherwise determined by social networking system . The user preferences may specify for example nodes or node types the user is interested and not interested in receiving. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may identify nodes or node types preferred by the querying user as specified by the user preference of the user and calculate higher scores for nodes or node types that are specified as being preferred by the user similarly nodes or node types specified as being not preferred may be scored lower or completely excluded assigned null scores . In other words particular content objects e.g. photos pages etc. or object types preferred by the user e.g. as indicated in a user preferences by likes of the content etc. may be scored higher than non preferred content objects or object types.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on a user s search history of the online social network. Nodes that reference social graph elements or types of elements that the querying user has previously accessed or been accessed by other users that are relevant to the querying user such as his friends or are relevant to the social graph elements the querying user has previously accessed may be more likely to of interest to the querying user. Thus these nodes may be scored more highly. As an example and not by way of limitation if querying user has previously visited the Stanford University profile page but has never visited the Stanford Calif. profile page when determining the score for nodes connected to these concepts the social networking system may determine that the nodes connected to the concept node for Stanford University e.g. photos of Stanford University people who attended Stanford University etc. have a relatively high score because the querying user has previously accessed the concept node for the school. As another example and not by way of limitation if the querying user has previously visited or engaged nodes of particular node types and not visited or engaged other types of nodes then when scoring personalized nodes of particular types social networking system may score node types previously visited or engaged by the querying user higher than other node types.

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on a social graph affinity of the user node corresponding to the querying user with respect to one or more of the nodes referenced in the structured query. Nodes that are connected to nodes having relatively high social graph affinity e.g. a high affinity coefficient with respect to the querying user may be more likely to be of interest to the querying user. Thus these nodes may be scored more highly. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may score a node based on the degree of separation which may be one measure of affinity between the user node of the querying user and the particular node. Nodes that are connected to social graph elements that are closer in the social graph to the querying user i.e. fewer degrees of separation between the element and the querying user s user node may be scored more highly than nodes that are connected to social graph elements that are further from the user i.e. more degrees of separation .

In particular embodiments social networking system may score the first set of nodes from social graph based at least in part on an intent of the querying user. The intent of the user may first be determined and then suggested nodes related to that intent may be generated and sent to the user. The determined intent s may correspond to particular nodes queries or query types and nodes matching the determined intent of the user may be scored more highly. The social networking system may determine the intent of the user based on a variety of factors such as for example the time of day the proximity of the user to other users or objects social graph information social graph affinity the search history of the user feedback from the user the geographic location of the user other relevant information about the user or any combination thereof. More information on determining the intent of a querying user may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 776 469 filed 25 Feb. 2013 which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify one or more common nodes wherein each common node is connected by one or more edges of the plurality of edges to one or more nodes of the first set of nodes having a score greater than a threshold score. Social networking system may then use the identified common nodes to generate queries that may generate interesting search results corresponding to highly scoring nodes and discussed previously for the querying user and suggest those queries to the user. In other words the identified common nodes are social graph entities that are connected to the content objects of interested previously identified e.g. high scoring nodes as described above . As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may generate the personalized query Friends who live in San Francisco if the querying user is visiting San Francisco has friends who live in San Francisco and or the friends meet certain threshold conditions. This query may be generated if several of the querying user s friends are scored highly based on user engagement factors and these friends are then identified as being connected to concept node for the city of San Francisco e.g. because they have checked in in San Francisco or otherwise determined by social networking system to be connected to San Francisco which is then identified as a common node. The concept node for San Francisco is then referenced in the query Friends who live in San Francisco which is generated as a personalized query that will generate search results of interest to the user i.e. the high scoring friends . Social networking system may then generate one or more personalized query suggestions such as for example using a predefined grammar of the form Friends who live in and replacing with a specific city in which many of the user s friends live. To determine the specific city the social networking system may identify the first user s friends and the cities in which they live. As an example and not by way of limitation the number of friends who live in each city may be determined and used to select one or more cities. As another example and not by way of limitation cities in which more than ten of the first user s friends live may be used to generate query suggestions to be displayed in a null state query dropdown. If the first user has twelve friends in San Francisco and ten friends in Los Angeles then two suggestions may be generated. In another example the personalized query suggestions may be ranked according to the number of friends who live in the cities. Therefore social networking system may generate the personalized queries Friends who live in San Francisco and Friends who live in Los Angeles for this example.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate the personalized query Photos of my friends taken in by identifying one or more locations in which the querying user s friends have taken photos. If the user s friends have recently taken photos in Seattle then the suggestion Photos of my friends taken in Seattle may be generated. As another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may generate the personalized queries based on topics of posts that have recently been made by the querying user and or the user s friends. As an example and not by way of limitation the suggestions Posts by my friends about may be generated for a topic found in posts made by the user s friends. As another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may generate the personalized queries for globally trending topics. In another example and not by way of limitation suggested personalize queries may be generated based on where the user s friends worked where they studied and so on. In another example and not by way of limitation social networking system may use dates for example Photos of my friends taken before 2005 to generate personalized queries. As another example and not by way of limitation the search result pages generated by these personalized queries may be of interest to the querying user. It should be understood that an example of what constitutes an interest for the user may be based on high probable click thru rate on the search results high affinity for the results business intelligence data conversion rate or the like. In particular embodiments examples of grammar templates that social networking system may use may be but are not limited to Friends who live in Photos of friends who live in Photos of my friends taken in Photos of my friends taken before Posts by my friends about or the like. Although this disclosure describes generating particular personalized queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable personalized queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate the personalized queries dynamically when the user is providing input to the system. In one example social networking system may generate the personalized queries when the user presses enter into the search bar or starts typing into the search bar or provides another input to the social networking system . In particular embodiments social networking system may pre generate the personalized queries rather than in response to the user s input. As an example and not in the way of limitation system may pre generate the personalized search queries by evaluating all the information posted on social networking system . This information may comprise information about posts photos or the like such as information about the photos such as locations topics and the users who made the posts and identification of the friends of the user. Social networking system analyzes the information and identifies content and then identifies entities or locations related to the content. The content may be based on user engagement scores such as high probable click thru rate on the search results high affinity for the results business intelligence data conversion rate or the like. In one example the set of interesting content items may be selected from a database of content items based on a variety of factors such as engagement of users with the content or affinity of users for the content. For example content items having engagement scores greater than a threshold may be selected as the interesting content items. As an example and not by way of limitation social networking system may identify entities such as friends of a particular person who have taken photos at a particular location. Social networking system may identify entities that are connected to the interesting content items by edges in the social graph. As an example and not by way of limitation assuming that a number of photos are liked by users and the photos are connected to a node that represents the entity San Francisco for each such entity social networking system may generate one or more suggested personalized queries that include the entity e.g. Photos of friends who live in San Francisco. In this example the user may then select one of the suggestions to execute that suggestion as a query and social networking system may respond by generating a search results page corresponding to the selected query. As such in one example social networking system may identify the entities that are connected to the content evaluate the quality of those entities and the quality quantity of the content and use that info to score rank the possible personalized search queries that would generate search results pages including that content. In one example the content can be determined based on a user engagement score.

Social networking system may identify a page that a user is currently viewing or otherwise accessing and then identifying any social graph elements corresponding to that page. The social graph elements corresponding to a page may be for example the node corresponding to a user or concept profile page or the nodes edges referenced in a structured query used to generate a particular search results page. Social networking system may then generate a set of personalized queries for the page based on the identified social graph elements for that page. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing when accessing a user profile page for the user Mark which corresponds to the user node for Mark some of the personalized queries for that page may include Photos of Mark at World Cup or Photos by Mark in Brazil or Books Mark reads by R. R. Martin as illustrated in drop down menu where each of these personalized queries includes a reference to the user node of the user Mark . The generated personalized queries may then be sent to the user and displayed for example in a drop down menu . In particular embodiments the query field may also serve as the title bar for the page. In other words the title bar and query field may effectively be a unified field on a particular page. The title bar for a page of the online social network may include a reference to the social graph elements that correspond to that page. This title bar may also server as a query field for the page. As such a user accessing that page may then interact with the title of the page e.g. by mousing over the title clicking on it or otherwise interacting with it to input a query. In response to a user interacting with the title query field the social networking system may then generate a set of personalized queries for the page and automatically send and display these queries in a drop down menu on the page as illustrated in where the drop down menu is displayed in association with the query field . Although this disclosure describes generating personalized queries for a page in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating personalized queries for a page in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may identify a node of the social graph corresponding to a page currently accessed by a user. A user may access any suitable page such as for example a user profile page a concept profile page a search results page a homepage a newsfeed page a notifications page an email or messages page a user interface of a native application associated with the online social network or another suitable page of the online social network. Particular pages of the online social network may correspond to particular social graph elements. In particular embodiments the user may currently be accessing a profile page of the online social network corresponding to a particular user node or concept node . Each user of the online social network may have a user profile page that corresponds to a user node of the user. As an example and not by way of limitation referencing which illustrates a user profile page for the user Mark this page may correspond to a user node of the user Mark . Similarly each concept represented in the online social network may have a concept profile page that corresponds to a concept node representing that concept.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more personalized queries that each comprise a reference to the identified node s of the page currently accessed by a user. These generated personalized queries may be considered the personalized queries for the page. Each of these personalized queries may also comprise references to one or more edges that are connected to the identified node. These personalized queries are effectively based on information about the querying user and may be further based on the page currently being accessed by the user. Where the title bar and the query field field are unified fields as described previously social networking system may essentially use the title of the page which itself may be considered a reference to one or more social graph elements as a template query upon which query modifications are added to generate the personalized queries. In particular embodiments if the user is accessing a search results page then the personalized queries generated by social networking system may comprise references to the social graph elements referenced in the personalized query used to generate that search results page. In other words if a personalized query comprising references to one or more nodes and one or more edges is used to generate a particular search results page then the personalized queries generated for that page will also include at least references to the one or more nodes and one or more edges of the original personalized query. Thus the personalized query used to generate a particular search results page may be used as the base upon which expansions of that initial query may be suggested as personalized queries. Although this disclosure describes generating particular personalized queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates any suitable personalized queries in any suitable manner. Moreover although this disclosure describes generating personalized queries for particular types of pages this disclosure contemplates generating personalized queries for any suitable types of pages.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send one or more of the personalized queries to the querying user for display on the page currently accessed by the user. These structured queries may be sent and displayed as previously described. As an example and not by way of limitation the web browser on the querying user s client system may display the sent structured queries in a drop down menu in association with a query field of a page as illustrated in . The personalized queries generated for a particular page may not be displayed until the user interacts with the query field such as for example by mousing over or clicking on the query field which may cause the personalized queries to be sent and displayed in drop down menu . The personalized queries displayed in drop down menu may enable the user accessing the page to selected one of the personalized queries indicating that the selected personalized query should be executed by social networking system . Although this disclosure describes sending particular personalized queries in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates sending any suitable personalized queries in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate one or more personalized queries in response to a user accessing a page that does not correspond to a particular social graph element. A user may access a page of the online social network that does not necessarily correspond to any particular social graph element such as for example a newsfeed page which may not necessarily correspond to any particular nodes or edges of the social graph . In this case the page may be considered to be in a null state with respect to identifying social graph elements that correspond to the page. Similarly for a page that does correspond to one or more social graph elements the user accessing that page may place the query field of the page into a null state by for example clearing or deleting any title or query that that had previously occupied the field. For a null state page or a query field in a null state social networking system may generate a set of personalized queries for the page based on a variety of factors such as for example the page or type of page the user is accessing user engagement factors business intelligence data the click thru rate of particular queries the conversion rate of particular queries user preferences of the querying user the search history of the user advertising sponsorship of particular queries the querying user s social graph affinity for social graph elements referenced in particular queries the intent of the user the general or current popularity of particular queries the usefulness of particular queries the geographic location of the querying user other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments when the user is accessing a page that does not correspond to a particular social graph element the social networking system may access a set of personalized queries corresponding to the page. Each of these personalized queries may comprise references to one or more edges or edge types or one or more nodes or node types . As an example and not by way of limitation illustrates a newsfeed page being accessed by a user of the online social network. Some of the personalized queries for this page may include Movies my friends like or games my friends play as illustrated in drop down menu where these structured queries included references to friend type edges and like type or play type edges respectively. As another example and not by way of limitation for the same newsfeed page illustrated in the social networking system may generate personalized queries that include My friends Photos of my friends Photos I like or Apps my friends use where these queries include reference to both edges and nodes e.g. for the structured query My friends the term My is a reference to the user node of the querying user and the term friends is a reference to friend type edges connected to that node . Although this disclosure describes generating personalized queries for a page that does not correspond to particular social graph elements in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating personalized queries for a page that does not correspond to particular social graph elements in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may send one or more personalized queries to the querying user. The personalized queries may be displayed on a page currently accessed by the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation the page may be a profile page of the online social network e.g. a user profile page of the querying user or another user or a concept profile page of a concept associated with the online social network a newsfeed page of the online social network a search results page corresponding to a particular structured query or another suitable page of the online social network.

In particular embodiments social networking system may display a threshold number of personalized search queries to the user. In particular embodiments each sent personalized query may have a score greater than a threshold score to the querying user. After scoring the personalized queries the social networking system may then send only those personalized queries having a score greater than a threshold score. In some embodiments the social networking system can display a limited number of personalized queries for example social networking system may display the top seven personalized search queries to the user. In another example social networking system may display any number of personalized search queries to the user without an upper or lower limit to the number of personalized search queries to present to the user. The quality threshold may be based on for example user engagement factors. In another embodiment social networking system may use a quality threshold to determine which personalized search queries to present to the user. Furthermore social networking system may rank the personalized search queries. The ranking may be based for example on the score as described above or quality of the search results corresponding to the query. For example a photos query that brings up photos that have been liked viewed commented on a lot may be ranked higher than a query that brings up photos that have not been interacted with as much. In another example the rank may be based on the location of the friends of the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may generate the personalized query in a typeahead context by still using pre generated suggested queries. In one example when the user clicks on a query field and inputs a text string the social networking system may provide personalized queries. In this example pre generated suggested queries corresponding to particular typeahead inputs e.g. frien . . . phot . . . pag . . . may be cached so they may be retrieved from the cache when needed e.g. to generate the typeahead list when the user begins typing and displayed. As such once the first user begins typing the query social networking system has generated the personalized queries for display.

In particular embodiments social networking system may cache the results using a storage memory such as a memcache. In particular embodiments the social networking system may retrieve the personalized queries from the cache when for example the user clicks on a query field or provides another input to social networking system . Each search results page may be tied to a corresponding personalized query that may be suggested in for example a null state. Furthermore social networking system may generate a table of suggestions and index it by the identification of the user. As such in one example if the user clicks on a query field a request may be sent to social networking system which may load the null state queries into a storage memory. In one example the personalized queries may be presented to the user as a suggested null state query such as a drop down below the query field.

In particular embodiments in response to a structured query received from a querying user the social networking system may generate one or more search results where each search result matches or substantially matches the terms of the structured query which includes sponsored queries dynamic queries and other types of structured queries . The social networking system may receive a structured query from a querying user also referred to as the first user corresponding to a first user node . In response to the structured query the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to the structured query. Each search result may include link to a profile page and a description or summary of the profile page or the node corresponding to that page . The search results may be presented and sent to the querying user as a search results page. In the case of a personalized query the search results may contain references one or more objects identified as being of interest to the querying user e.g. based on user engagement factors etc. . The structured query used to generate a particular search results page may be shown in query field and the various search results generated in response to the structured query are illustrated in a results field for presented search results. In particular embodiments the query field may also serve as the title bar for the page. In other words the title bar and query field may effectively be a unified field on the search results page. The search results page may also include a field for modifying search results and a field for sharing structured queries and search results. When generating the search results the social networking system may generate one or more snippets for each search result where the snippets are contextual information about the target of the search result i.e. contextual information about the social graph entity profile page or other content corresponding to the particular search result . Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular search results pages this disclosure contemplates any suitable search results pages.

In particular embodiments the social networking system may generate one or more search results corresponding to a structured query. The search results may identify resources or content e.g. user profile pages content profile pages or external resources that match or are likely to be related to the search query. In particular embodiments each search result may correspond to a particular user node or concept node of the social graph . The search result may include a link to the profile page associated with the node as well as contextual information about the node i.e. contextual information about the user or concept that corresponds to the node . Each search result in results field shows a link to a profile page of a user illustrated as the user s name which contains an inline link to the profile page and contextual information about that user that corresponds to a user node of the social graph . Each search result may also show a thumbnail of a photograph that corresponds to a concept node of the social graph. In particular embodiments each search result may correspond to a node that is connected to one or more of the selected nodes by one or more of the selected edges of the structured query. In particular embodiments the social networking system may also transmit advertisements or other sponsored content to the client system in response to the structured query. The advertisements may be included in as part of the search results or separately. The advertisements may correspond to one or more of the objects referenced in the search results. In particular embodiments the social networking system may filter out one or more search results identifying particular resources or content based on the privacy settings associated with the users associated with those resources or content. Although this disclosure describes generating particular search results in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates generating any suitable search results in any suitable manner.

More information on generating search results may be found in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 556 017 filed 23 Jul. 2012 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 731 939 filed 31 Dec. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of a observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content tagging or being tagged in images joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.
