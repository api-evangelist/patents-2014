In some embodiments the MTC IWF may send the MTC device ID to the HLR HSS which may have the MTC Device ID as part of an MTC subscription. The HLR HSS may map the MTC Device ID to an IMSI of the UE and send the IMSI along with an address for the SGSN MME back to the MTC IWF . A trust relation may be established between the MTC IWF and the HLR HSS in some embodiments e.g. when the MTC IWF is outside of a domain of an operator of the core network . In response to receiving the query at from the MTC IWF the HLR HSS may send to the MTC IWF IMSI serving node identities and or other information such as operator policy authorization information failure indication with cause value and the like.

In accordance with the first technique T1 of sending the small data payload from the SGSN MME to the UE the SGSN MME may determine that the UE is in a connected state and at forward the small data payload to the UE using uplink downlink UL DL Non Access Stratum NAS signaling. For example the SGSN MME may determine that the UE is in a connected state by determining that a context e.g. locally stored already exists to indicate a location for the UE . The SGSN MME may send the small data payload to the UE using for example a downlink Non Access Stratum NAS transport message. An acknowledgement that the small data payload has been sent to the UE may be received by the SGSN MME during communications at

At the SGSN MME may forward to the MTC IWF the acknowledgement that the small data payload has been sent to the UE . At the MTC IWF may send a trigger to the MTC server to send an acknowledgement that the small data payload has been delivered to the UE . The MTC server may for example send the acknowledgement to the Application server in response to the trigger.

In accordance with the second technique T2 of sending the small data payload from the SGSN MME to the UE the SGSN MME may determine that the UE is in an idle state and at may send the small data payload to the RAN e.g. base station or of in a paging message. The RAN may send at the paging message including the small data payload to the UE . For example the small data payload may be included in a paging message that is broadcasted in a tracking area of a target UE that is in idle mode. The SGSN MME may be configured to send the paging message including the small data payload over a control plane in some embodiments. In some embodiments the RAN may inform the SGSN MME that the small data payload was successfully delivered by sending at a small data acknowledgement to the SGSN MME which may be forwarded to the MTC IWF at .

In accordance with the third technique T3 of sending the small data payload from the SGSN MME to the UE the SGSN MME may determine that the UE is in an idle state and at may send a paging message including the small data payload to the RAN e.g. base station or of . The paging message may further include an optional small data indicator to indicate that the small data payload is at the RAN e.g. at base station or of . In some embodiments the SGSN MME may send the small data payload over the S1 reference point to RAN .

In some embodiments the RAN may retrieve and or store the small data payload from the paging message and send at a paging message to the UE without the small data payload. The RAN may include the small data indicator with the paging message. In some embodiments where the small data payload is at the RAN prior to the UE being attached to the RAN e.g. by RRC connection the UE may receive the paging message sent at with the small data indicator indicating that the small data payload is at the RAN .

At the UE may begin an attachment process to the RAN by e.g. establishment of an RRC connection. For example the establishment of the RRC connection may be requested by the UE in an RRC connection request message to the RAN in response to the paging message at . The RAN may deliver the small data payload to the UE via signals associated with the RRC connection setup procedure. When the UE receives the small data payload the UE may terminate the RRC connection setup procedure and may return to an idle mode if no other data is to be sent or received by the UE . In some embodiments the RAN may inform the SGSN MME that the small data payload was successfully delivered by sending at a small data acknowledgement to the SGSN MME .

In accordance with the fourth technique T4 of sending the small data payload from the SGSN MME to the UE the SGSN MME may determine that the UE is in an idle state and at may send a paging message that may include a small data indicator that indicates a presence of the small data payload at the SGSN MME that needs to be delivered or forwarded to the UE . At the RAN may send the paging message which may include the small data indicator to the UE to indicate that the small data payload targeted for the UE is at the SGSN MME . In some embodiments where the small data payload is at the SGSN MME prior to the UE being attached to the RAN e.g. by RRC connection the UE may receive the paging message sent at with the small data indicator indicating that the small data payload is at the SGSN MME . In response to the paging message at the UE at may begin an attachment process to the RAN by e.g. establishment of an RRC connection and at begin an attachment process with the SGSN MME by sending a Non Access Stratum NAS message such as an attach service request message to the RAN . The RAN may forward the NAS message to the SGSN MME . During the attachment process at the SGSN MME may send the small data payload to the UE using Non Access Stratum NAS signaling e.g. attach response service request response DL NAS transport message etc.

The content of the NAS message sent by the UE to begin the attachment process at may depend on the content of the paging message received by the UE at . For example in a case where the paging message at contains only the small data indicator indicating that the small data payload is at the SGSN MME the UE may include an information element including a Key Set Identifier KSI which may be associated with cipher and integrity keys and a sequence number which may be a counter value for the UE in the NAS message. The MME of the SGSN MME may use the KSI the sequence number and a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity TMSI value such as an S TMSI where the S refers to System Architecture Evolution SAE to encrypt the small data payload for delivery to the UE . When the UE receives the small data payload the UE may terminate the attachment process and may be configured to return to an idle mode if no other data is to be sent or received by the UE .

In some embodiments where the paging message sent at includes the small data payload e.g. at of the UE may or may not be required by network operator policy to send a response message to the small data payload from the MTC server . In a case where network operator policy does not require sending of any response the UE may be configured to include an information element including an acknowledgement such as an MTC data acknowledgement in the NAS message that is sent to begin the attachment process at . In a case where network operator policy requires sending of a response the UE may include an information element including the KSI and sequence number and an encrypted response payload as a NAS Packet Data Unit PDU in a NAS container in the NAS message that is sent to begin the attachment process at .

After the attach service request message has been sent by the UE to begin the attachment process at the UE may include the additional data in a NAS PDU in an uplink information transfer message to the SGSN MME . In some embodiments if the UE has an uplink small data payload to send to the MTC server the UE may activate Packet Data Protocol PDP Context and or PDP bearers and send uplink data on a user plane e.g. via GGSN PGW of .

In embodiments where the NAS message e.g. of attachment process at sent by the UE to the SGSN MME includes only the KSI and the sequence number e.g. a case where the paging message at contains only the small data indicator indicating that the small data payload is at the SGSN MME the SGSN MME may send the small data payload in an encrypted information element in a NAS message such as for example an encrypted information element in a NAS PDU in an S1 downlink NAS transport message to the UE . The UE may send a response message or an acknowledgement in response to the NAS message with the small data payload. The acknowledgement may include for example an acknowledgement in an encrypted information element in a NAS PDU in an uplink information transfer message. The UE may further include in the response message or acknowledgement an information element in the uplink information transfer message to request the release of the RRC connection at if the UE does not have further data to send.

In some embodiments if the NAS message e.g. attach service request message that is sent to begin the attachment process at includes the information element including an acknowledgement such as an MTC data acknowledgement e.g. a case where network operator policy does not require sending of a response to reception by the UE of the small data payload the SGSN MME may send or forward the data acknowledgement to the MTC IWF at . If the NAS message e.g. attach service request message that is sent to begin the attachment process at includes an information element including the KSI and sequence number and an encrypted response payload as a NAS Packet Data Unit PDU in a NAS container e.g. a case where network operator policy requires sending of a response to indicate reception by the UE of the small data payload the SGSN MME may decrypt the NAS PDU and forward at the response payload to the MTC IWF . The SGSN MME may also send an acknowledgement in an encrypted information element in a NAS PDU in an S1 downlink NAS transport message to the UE .

In some embodiments the S1 downlink NAS transport message may include an information element that allows the MME of the SGSN MME to request the base station of the RAN to release the RRC connection at . The MME may not use this indication if the UE previously indicated that multiple response messages are to be transferred.

The UE may include a NAS module and an Access Stratum AS module. In some embodiments the NAS module may be configured to request the AS module to establish for example an RRC connection including a TMSI e.g. S TMSI of the UE in the connection request message resulting in the action at . The UE may include a value that indicates to a base station of RAN that a short lived signaling procedure is in progress. For example the UE may set a cause value in the connection request message to mo Signaling. Such action may reduce a likelihood that the MME of SGSN MME will download a security context to the base station. Without the security context handover may not be performed. Radio resources can be saved if the base station does not configure the UE to perform measurement reporting.

At the base station of the RAN may send an RRC connection setup message to indicate establishment of the RRC connection. At in response to receiving the RRC connection setup message the UE may send the small data payload to the base station as part of an RRC setup complete message.

At the base station of the RAN may send the acknowledgement message to the UE and release the RRC connection in an RRC connection release message. The base station may include an MTC data acknowledgement information element as a NAS PDU within the RRC connection release message.

In some embodiments the UE may perform NAS signaling instead of actions at such as for example a tracking area update service request attach request and the like and include the uplink small data payload to the SGSN MME using NAS signaling. In some embodiments the UE may perform RRC signaling to include the uplink small data payload to the RAN which may forward the small data payload to the SGSN MME using S1. S1 may be shared and not on a per UE basis.

In other embodiments the UE may send an uplink small data payload to the MTC server over a user plane e.g. over the MTCz reference point . For example the UE may establish a connection e.g. a User Path UP connection with the MTC server and send the small data payload on a user plane directly to the MTC server e.g. over reference point MTCi .

Referring to at the method includes receiving a request to send a small data payload to User Equipment UE . For example the MTC IWF may receive a trigger from the MTC server to request the sending of the small data payload.

At the method may further include determining a route for sending the small data payload to the UE . A module such as the MTC IWF in the core network may be configured to determine the route by determining whether the UE is in connected or idle mode. For example the MTC IWF may query the HLR HSS or the SGSN MME to determine whether a context is present for the UE to determine whether the UE is connected with the SGSN MME or idle. If the UE is in idle mode the MTC IWF may be routed over one of the MTCx or MTCy reference points. If the UE is in connected mode the MTC IWF may be routed over the MTCz reference point. In some embodiments the MTC IWF may query the HLR HSS or SGSN MME to determine a network operator policy and route the information over the MTCx MTCy or MTCz reference points according to the network operator policy.

In some embodiments the MTC IWF may determine the route by attempting to send the small data payload over the MTCz reference point. If the attempt to send over the MTCz reference point fails for any reason the MTC IWF may attempt to send the small data payload over the MTCx and or MTCy reference points. For example if sending by the MTC IWF over the MTCz reference point to a Packet Data Network Gateway PGW fails the MTC IWF may attempt to send the small data payload over the MTCx reference point. If sending by the MTC IWF over the MTCx reference point fails the MTC IWF may attempt to send the small data payload over the MTCy reference point.

In some embodiments the MTC IWF may determine a route by determining whether a data path is established between the UE and the PGW of GGSN PGW . If it is determined that the data path is established then the MTC IWF may route the small data payload over the MTCz reference point else the MTC IWF may route the small data payload over one of the MTCx or MTCy reference points. Combinations of these techniques may be used to determine a route for sending the small data payload to the UE .

At the method may further include sending the small data payload to the UE . The small data payload may be sent for example using the techniques described in connection with .

At the method may further include receiving an acknowledgement that the small data payload was received by the UE . The acknowledgement may comport with techniques described in connection with .
