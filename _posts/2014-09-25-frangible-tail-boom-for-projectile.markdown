The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to gun launched projectiles and in particular to stabilizing fins for gun launched projectiles.

Fins and tail booms are well known for stabilizing the flight of non spinning gun launched projectiles. In a large caliber gun high projectile velocities are obtained. The fins attached to the tail boom of a high velocity projectile do not interfere with target penetration by the projectile. The fin and tail boom are typically rigid robust structures designed to withstand gun launch.

The fins may be attached to the tail boom using for example pins screws rivets etc. In the gun tube the fins are folded down. Upon muzzle exit the fins unfold to their deployed position. The deployed fins stabilize the projectile during flight. In high velocity projectiles the projectile penetrates the target after impact. Projectiles with relatively low velocity such as those fired from multi target shoulder fired weapons have less kinetic energy than higher velocity projectiles. The consumption of kinetic energy caused by breaking the fins on a lower kinetic energy projectile can inhibit the complete penetration of a projectile in a target. That is the low velocity of the projectile is not sufficient to overcome the robust design of the fin and boom assembly. In some cases the warhead function is rendered useless if the projectile does not penetrate the target.

A need exists for a tail boom for a low velocity projectile that breaks apart from the projectile upon target impact to enable the low velocity projectile to penetrate the target with little resistance.

One aspect of the invention is a frangible tail boom for a gun launched projectile. The tail boom includes a tail boom housing having a central longitudinal axis a forward end configured to engage a projectile body and a through bore. The tail boom housing includes a forward portion and a rear portion. The forward portion has the general shape of a conical frustum. An outer diameter of the forward portion decreases from the forward end toward the rear portion. The through bore in the forward portion includes a large diameter segment and a small diameter segment located rearward of the large diameter segment. The forward portion includes a circumferential groove extending from an outer surface radially inward toward the small diameter segment of the through bore.

The circumferential groove may have a depth equal to at least one half a radius of the conical frustum at the groove.

The tail boom may include a cap fixed to a rear end of the boom housing. The cap may include an outer cylindrical portion that engages a surface of the through bore in the housing and an inner cylindrical portion having a bore therein.

A piston may be centered on the central longitudinal axis and translatable in the through bore in the boom housing. The piston has a forward curved surface and a stem that extends rearward. The stem is translatable in and engages a surface of the bore of the inner cylindrical portion of the cap.

A compression spring may be disposed around the inner cylindrical portion of the cap. One end of the compression spring bears on the piston and the other end of the compression spring bears on the cap to bias the piston in a forward direction.

A plurality of fins may be rotatably fixed to the boom housing. Each fin includes a protruding portion that extends into a forward translation path of the piston in a stowed position of the fins.

In a deployed position of the fins each fin may include a planar portion parallel to the central longitudinal axis of the boom housing.

In the deployed position of the fins the planar portion of each fin may abut the cylindrical surface of the piston.

The through bore of the tail boom housing may include a chamfer that reduces a diameter of the through bore to less than a diameter of the piston. The chamfer may be located at an end of the forward translation path of the piston.

The tail boom housing may include for each of the plurality of fins a stop surface that is angled with respect to the central longitudinal axis.

In another aspect of the invention a method includes providing a projectile having a novel tail boom and then launching the projectile. The projectile impacts a target. After impact the tail boom is fractured at a circumferential groove and the tail boom breaks away from the projectile.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A piston is centered on the central longitudinal axis A. The piston only is shown in detail in . Piston is translatable in the through bore in the boom housing . The piston has a forward curved surface . Surface may have a hemispherical shape. A stem extends rearward from surface . Stem is translatable in and engages a surface of the bore of the inner cylindrical portion of the cap . A compression spring not shown in see is disposed around the inner cylindrical portion of the cap . One end of the compression spring bears on the piston and the other end of the compression spring bears on the cap . Spring biases piston in a forward direction toward forward end of housing .

A plurality of fins are rotatably fixed to the boom housing . Fins may be fixed to housing with fin pins . Five fins are shown in the Figs. but the number of fins may vary. Each fin includes a protruding portion that extends into a forward translation path of the piston in the stowed position of the fins . In the disclosed embodiment the protruding portion of each fin that extends into the forward translation path of the piston is a curved portion. In the deployed position of the fins each fin includes a planar portion that is parallel to the central longitudinal axis A of the boom housing .

The piston includes a cylindrical surface that adjoins the forward curved surface . In the deployed position of the fins the planar portion of each fin abuts the cylindrical surface of the piston . At the forward end of the piston s translation path the through bore surface includes a chamfer . Chamfer reduces the diameter of through bore to a diameter less than the diameter of piston .

The tail boom housing includes for each of the plurality of fins a stop surface that forms an angle B with respect to the central longitudinal axis A. In the deployed position of the fins a trailing portion of each fin abuts its respective stop surface .

Prior to insertion in a launch tube the fins may be held in the stowed position folded forward as in by a cord strap or wire not shown of suitable material for handling purposes. After the projectile with tail boom is inserted in the launch tube the cord is cut and the launch tube maintains the fins in the stowed position. The fins remain in the stowed position until muzzle exit. For single use shoulder fired munitions the projectile may be loaded in the launch tube as part of the manufacturing process.

When projectile with tail boom exits the muzzle of the launch tube compression spring translates piston in the forward direction. Piston is guided by the surface of through bore and the stem that translates in bore of cap . Piston presses against protruding portions of fins thereby deploying all the fins simultaneously and with equally distributed force. The fins stop against the angled stop surfaces on the tail boom housing . Angled stop surfaces reduce the transmission of the impact forces to the fin base through the fin hinge pin.

The piston continues to translate forward in through bore until piston stops against chamfer . The combination of the geometry of chamfer and forward curved surface of piston creates a force fit between the piston and the boom housing thereby fixing the piston in place. In addition the continued force from the spring biases the piston into chamfer thereby maintaining the position of the piston . Thus the piston maintains the deployed position of the fins . The cylindrical surface of piston abuts the planar portion of the fins to prevent the fins from returning to the stowed position.

The use of a single spring for fin deployment enables the fins to deploy simultaneously with equal force. The contoured stop surface for the fins redirects the impact forces to preserve fin integrity. The chamfer maintains piston position and fin deployment with no added parts. The single spring provides a constant and well defined deployment event as compared to gas operated pistons. The through bore surface and the stem disposed in bore prevent piston from jamming or becoming cocked during fin deployment. The mating surfaces of the piston and chamfer are interference surfaces that render the piston stuck at the end of its travel.

Referring to the frangible tail boom housing has a forward portion and a rear portion . The forward portion has the general shape of a conical frustum. The outer diameter of the forward portion decreases from the forward end toward the rear portion . The through bore in the forward portion has a large diameter segment and a small diameter segment . The small diameter segment is located rearward of the large diameter segment . The forward portion includes a circumferential groove . Groove extends from an outer surface radially inward toward the small diameter segment of the through bore . In one embodiment the circumferential groove has a depth D equal to at least one half a radius R of the conical frustum at the groove . Groove is located forward of the fins .

The grooved section of the tail boom housing survives gun launch but fails when the projectile impacts a target. As the projectile impacts and penetrates the target the fins contact the target and break the grooved section of the boom housing so that the tail boom separates from the projectile . The low velocity projectile is free to continue penetrating the target. The frangible tail boom housing enables low velocity projectiles to be more effective against hard targets.

When the projectile impacts the target with no obliquity the fins impact the target surface and cause tensile failure at the section of groove of the boom housing . When the projectile impacts the target with higher obliquity the inertia of the fin hub causes the grooved section to break in bending as the projectile nose strikes the target.

During testing the novel tail boom housing withstood gun launch and projectile flight. The housing discarded upon impact of projectile with the target so that the projectile was able to fully penetrate the target.

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
