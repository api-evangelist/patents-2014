The method can further include providing an availability status of the portable electronic device to the client device. The network connection can be a wireless connection. The method can further include putting the output file in a print queue. The method can further include one or more of receiving a user inputted command at the output device to sort the output file among other files highlighting a portion of the output file forwarding the output file to another device and bookmarking a portion of the output file. The output file can be a portable document format PDF document. The method can be performed using a Samba browser. The method can further include informing the client device of the print service. The informing can be performed using a Bonjour browser. The method can further include providing a prompt at portable electronic device when establishing the network connection the prompt to accept or decline a print request and when the print request is declined transmitting an indication of the decline to the client device which prevents at least the transmitting receiving and displaying steps from occurring. The transmitting the output file from the client device to the portable electronic device can include pushing the output file from the client device to the portable electronic device. The transmitting the output file from the client device to the portable electronic device can include pulling the output file from the client device to the portable electronic device.

Referring to tablet computer includes a chassis that supports a display . Display can include one or more light emitters such as an array of light emitting diodes LED liquid crystals plasma cells or organic light emitting diodes OLED . Other types of light emitters can be used. A touch sensitive membrane is overlaid on display to thereby provide an input device for tablet computer . As a non limiting example tablet computer can be configured to selectively show or hide a virtual keyboard . Other types of input devices can be provided on chassis other than touch membrane or in addition to touch membrane can be used. For example a physical keyboard or touch pad or joystick or trackball or track wheel a microphone or optical camera or any one or more of them can be provided in addition to or in lieu of touch membrane . Such other components may if desired be slide out components. In example implementation tablet computer also includes a speaker for generating audio output. Speaker may be implemented as or augmented with a wired or wireless headset or both.

Input from touch membrane is received at a processor . In variations processor may be implemented as a plurality of processors or multi core processors or both. Processor can be configured to execute different programming instructions that can be responsive to the input received via the one or more input devices. To fulfill its programming functions processor is also configured to utilize electronic memory. Such electronic memory in an example embodiment includes at least one non volatile storage unit e.g. Erasable Electronic Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM Flash Memory and at least one volatile storage unit e.g. random access memory RAM . Other configurations of electronic memory can be used. Programming instructions that implement the functional teachings of tablet computer as described herein are typically maintained persistently in non volatile storage unit and used by processor which makes appropriate utilization of volatile storage during the execution of such programming instructions.

Processor in turn is also configured to control display and speaker and any other output devices that may be provided in tablet computer also in accordance with different programming instructions and responsive to different input received from the input devices.

Processor also connects to a network interface which can be implemented in example embodiment as a radio configured to communicate over a wireless link although in variants tablet computer can also include a network interface for communicating over a wired link. Network interface can thus be generalized as a further input output device that can be utilized by processor to fulfill various programming instructions. Interface is configured to correspond with the network architecture that defines such a link. Present commonly employed network architectures for such a link include but are not limited to Global System for Mobile communication GSM General Packet Relay Service GPRS Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution EDGE 3G High Speed Packet Access HSPA Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Evolution Data Optimized EVDO Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers IEEE standard 802.11 Bluetooth or any of their variants or successors. In an example embodiment each network interface can include multiple radios to accommodate the different protocols that may be used to simultaneously or individually communicate over different types of links.

As will become apparent further below tablet computer can be implemented with different configurations than described omitting certain input devices or including extra input devices and likewise omitting certain output devices or including extra output devices.

Tablet computer is configured to maintain within non volatile storage a printer service a document manager and optionally one or more additional applications . . . . Generically additional application and collectively additional applications . This nomenclature is used elsewhere herein. Printer service document manager and additional applications can be pre stored in non volatile storage upon manufacture of tablet computer or downloaded via network interface and saved on non volatile storage at any time subsequent to manufacture of tablet computer .

Processor is configured to execute printer service accessing non volatile storage and volatile storage as needed. As will be explained further below printer service is configured to emulate a traditional paper based printer such that tablet computer can appear on a network as a printer to other devices connected to that network so that documents can be virtually printed to tablet computer and stored on non volatile storage or volatile storage or both from other devices on the network.

Processor is also configured to execute document manager accessing non volatile storage and volatile storage as needed. The implementation of document manager is not particularly limited but is generally configured to receive input instructions to browse and access any documents or files stored on tablet computer . In particular virtually printed documents that are received via printer service can be browsed and opened via document manager . Document manager can be implemented as a file manager application or can be part of a document reader or document editor application or all of them.

Additional applications can be any application that can be stored and executed according to the processor and other resources of tablet computer . Such additional applications can also include their own document managers or can be document readers or can be any other type of application as well.

Tablet computer is also configured to maintain a unique identifier for identifying tablet computer from other network devices as will be discussed further below. Non limiting examples of possible types of unique identifiers include a serial number for processor or an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI . Other types of unique identifiers will now occur to those skilled in the art.

Furthermore tablet computer is also configured to maintain a portable account identifier for associating the tablet computer with a user as will be discussed further below. Non limiting examples of possible types of portable account identifiers include an email address or an International Mobile Subscriber Identity IMSI . Other types of portable account identifiers will now occur to those skilled in the art.

As will be discussed in greater detail below a relationship can be established between portable account identifier and unique identifier which can be used to address print requests to tablet computer . The term relationship is used herein to refer to in an example embodiment a unique number that represents the pairing of portable account identifier and unique identifier . Such a unique number may be a hash or a concatenation or can be generated using any desired computing operation.

In a document management system using printer emulation in accordance with another example embodiment is shown generally at . System generally contemplates an enterprise configuration that includes a plurality of tablet computers that are all associated with an enterprise configuration .

Enterprise configuration thus includes at least one computer Computer in example embodiments is a computer that is not intended to be moved often such as workstation computer desktop computer or a server. However in other example embodiments computer may be portable and can include without limitation a cellular telephone a portable email paging device a camera a portable music player a portable video player a personal digital assistant a portable book reader a portable video game player a netbook computer a laptop computer or combinations of these devices.

Computer is configured to execute a document application . The nature of document application is not particularly limited and can be for example a word processor a spreadsheet editor a web browser a presentation creation application or any other application where a print function is included that permits generation of a document from documentation application onto a printer not shown .

The at least one computer is also configured to maintain a virtual printer driver respective to one or more of tablet computers . While shows computer maintaining a printer driver respective to each tablet computer computer need not maintain a printer driver for all tablet computers . Thus document application can also be used to send a print request to any tablet computer that has its respective printer driver installed on computer .

Printer driver is generally configured to conform with specification for the operating system that is native to computer thereby obviating the need to materially modify computer . By the same token output files generated using printer driver are generally configured to conform with the computing environment of its respective tablet computer . Thus printer driver can be configured to include the ability to define on virtual printing of a document from document application various printing options such as which pages to print number of pages per sheet watermarking portrait vs. landscape mode paper size resolution colour vs. grayscale vs. black and white scaling margins and the like. In certain implementations the printer driver could be configured to utilize a standard script such as Postscript. The options provided can also consider the computing environment of the destination tablet computer such as screen size screen resolution available processing and memory resources such that output file that is sent is optimized or otherwise consistent with that computing environment. Printer drivers can also be configured to be processing intensive such that output files generated at computer are substantially completely rendered at computer for display on the destination tablet computer . Alternatively printer drivers can be configured to consume as little processing resources as possible at computer so that the majority of processing and rendering occurs at the destination tablet computer . Other aspects of printer drivers will be discussed further below.

Enterprise configuration also includes a private network to which computer can connect. Private network also connects to an enterprise wireless base station and an enterprise server both of which are also associated with enterprise configuration . Private network can also connect to various other computing devices not shown such as additional computers or printers or file servers or print servers that are associated with the enterprise. Private network also connects to a public network through an enterprise firewall .

Private network can be based on any known local area network architectures such as the Internet Protocol IP network running over Ethernet. Wireless base station is typically a wireless local area network WLAN base station utilizing IEEE standard 802.11 or one of its variants. Tablet computers can all connect to private network via wireless base station using their respective network interfaces . In only tablet computer and tablet computer are shown connected to wireless base station but tablet computer can also connect to wireless base station . Typically a given tablet computer will associate with wireless base station when in range of wireless base station .

As will be discussed further below enterprise server is configured to manage a network printer address for tablet computer that is used to route a print request from computer or another computer based on relationship between portable account identifier and unique identifier .

Public network typically includes the Internet as well as interconnections with other types of public networks such as cellular telecommunication networks or Wi Fi hotspots. Accordingly one or more base stations are connected to public network . Base station can thus be based on core mobile telecommunication network protocols E.g. 3G EDGE as discussed above or can be based on WLAN architectures such as public mobile hotspots. In an example embodiment a plurality of base stations can be typically provided any one or more of which can be associated with a given tablet computer . In only tablet computer is shown connected to wireless base station but tablet computer or tablet computer can also connect to wireless base station . Typically a given tablet computer will associate with wireless base station when in range of wireless base station and utilize that association when that tablet computer is not within range of wireless base station .

In a flowchart depicting a method for document management using printer emulation is indicated generally at . Method is one example in which printer service on the tablet computer can be implemented. It is also emphasized that the method can be varied and that the method need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown. To assist in discussion of method a specific example to its performance will be discussed in relation to tablet computer and system .

Block includes establishing a relationship in electronic memory between a portable account identifier and a unique identifier. In tablet computer block includes establishing relationship between unique device identifier and portable account identifier . Block can be performed once when tablet computer is originally provisioned with an account not shown such provisioning including associating the unique device identifier of tablet computer with the portable account identifier . Relationship can subsequently be terminated and that portable account identifier can be associated with other tablet computers .

Block includes receiving a print request over a network. In system the print request originates from computer . The print request includes an output file. The print request is created from document manager using the printer driver maintained on computer that is associated with its respective tablet computer . The network printer address for the tablet computer that is used to route the print request is managed by server based on the relationship between the portable account identifier and the unique identifier. The methods by which server manages the network printer address is not particularly limited and various non limiting examples of such management will be discussed below.

Block includes displaying the output file that was part of the print request at block . In tablet computer block can be effected by print service transferring the output file received at block to the document manager application within tablet computer . When the document manager application is executed on processor then the output file is generated on display under the control of processor . It will thus be apparent that block need not occur immediately and that the output file can be stored on tablet computer until such time as block is invoked.

The methods by which server manages the network printer address used to send print requests from computer to a given tablet computer is not particularly limited. shows one example of how block can be implemented. In system is shown with a print request being sent from document application directly to tablet computer via printer driver along a pathway . Pathway thus contemplates that print request is addressed directly to tablet computer . Thus in printer driver is equipped with the direct network printer address of tablet computer by server .

In a flowchart depicting a method for virtual printer driver installation is indicated generally at . Method thus contemplates one example in which driver that utilizes pathway of can be installed on computer . In example embodiments method can be varied and that the method need not be performed in the exact sequence as shown.

Block thus includes receiving a driver installation request. The driver installation request can be effected using printer driver installation wizards that are native to the operating system used on computer . For example in a Windows environment the Add Printer Wizard can be used can be used to browse for a network printer. This example implementation is useful because no third party software or application needs to be installed on computer in order to install the printer driver thereby providing an implementation for system without modifying computer except to provide computer with a printer driver that conforms with the operating system specifications for computer .

Server is configured to host virtual representations of the print service for each tablet computer that are browsable by computer over private network . However browsing is only one such example in which native printer driver installation wizards may be utilized. Such browsing may be either directly to server or via another server not shown that hosts a directory of printers available to computer .

For discussion purposes Table I provides an example initial relationship between the virtual printers as labeled in and tablet computers the contents of Table I being maintained by server .

As emphasized above Table I represents an initial relationship but it is contemplated that such relationships can change and be dynamically accommodated such that the risk of a document being virtually printed to an incorrect tablet computer is reduced or mitigated. Thus the Account Label column refers to the labels shown in and which in turn are associated in a fixed relationship with specific account identifiers which are listed in the Account identifier column and thus the Account Label column and the Account identifier column appear under the heading Account Layer .

The Tablet Computer column refers to three tablet computers shown in system in and and elsewhere which are in turn associated in a fixed relationship with the specific unique identifiers which are listed in the Unique Identifier column and thus the Tablet Computer column and the Unique Identifier column appear under the heading Device Layer .

The Relationship column refers to the specific relationship between various accounts and devices and it is this relationship that can change.

Returning now to the discussion of block of method assume that an instruction is received at computer selecting John s Tablet to thereby generate a printer driver installation request in that is finally received at server . Accordingly block includes determining a relationship between the account label within the driver installation request and a particular tablet computer. Continuing with the example based on an examination of Table I relationship applies in that John s Tablet is associated with tablet computer .

Block includes sending the driver installation file with a network printer address for the tablet computer as determined based on the relationship at block . Continuing with the example driver will be sent from server to computer and which will include a network address for virtually printing directly to device utilizing pathway of . Once received at computer printer driver can be installed locally on computer according to the printer driver installation methods native to the operating system of computer .

Having completed block method can be performed according to the specific example performance of block in as discussed above. As discussed above however the contents of Table I may change such that relationships may no longer apply. The result is that there is a possibility of a document being printed from document application to an incorrect tablet computer . This can be particularly of concern if the documents being generated are of a sensitive or confidential nature. For example assume that tablet computer is lost or stolen. Accordingly Table II shows an example of how Table I is updated in server to reflect that tablet computer is no longer associated with enterprise configuration .

Thus when method is performed when Table II is maintained in server it will not be possible to install a printer driver associated with John s Tablet and account identifier thereby blocking the ability to send a printer output file from computer .

In another scenario however Table I may be updated to Table II after printer driver has already been installed on tablet computer leading to the possibility that computer could still be used to send a confidential or sensitive document to tablet computer resulting in unauthorized access to that document. In example embodiments various controls can be used to mitigate or reduce the likelihood of such unauthorized access occurring.

One technique contemplates that printer service is configured to verify that its local relationship is valid before accepting or processing print request . Thus a copy of relationship can be included in print request and then upon receipt of print request printer service will verify that the relationship received in the print request matches the relationship stored locally on the tablet computer . Thus according to this technique tablet computer can be remotely wiped using existing techniques such that account identifier and relationship are deleted from tablet computer during the remote wipe so that printer service will fail to validate the relationship and printer service refuses to accept the print request. Another variation contemplates that the printer network address is itself managed by printer service and thus the remote wipe will automatically render the tablet computer unaddressable in the print request . A still further technique contemplates the use of an encryption methodology based on relationship such that the printer driver will utilize relationship as part of encryption key to generate print request . Relationship can be used as the encryption key itself thus the wiping of relationship from tablet computer will result in the wiping of the encryption key. Additional security can be provided by having relationship be an index to an decryption key that is generated elsewhere e.g. server and then stored on tablet computer with the corresponding encryption key being incorporated directly into printer driver again such that the decryption key is wiped upon a remote wipe of tablet computer .

In another system for document management is indicated generally at . System is a variation on system and thus like references bear like elements except followed by the suffix a . System can use another approach to implementing block whereby print requests are always carried through server . In this manner further security can be afforded without concern about the state of the printer driver as installed on computer since the validity of all print requests are centrally administered by server . Indeed when Table I changes to Table II server can be configured to simply refuse print requests from computer and return an error to computer . Furthermore when there is a change of one account to another tablet computer then an installed printer driver need not necessarily be updated but rather server will automatically route the print request associated with one account to the new tablet computer

In a further variation server can be configured to locally host a print service for each tablet computer and then to send the document to the document manager on the destination tablet computer thereby obviating the need for a print service on each tablet computer and facilitating the use of example embodiments disclosed herein on legacy tablet computers or other legacy computer devices. In this example the output file can be converted to an email attachment that is sent to the correct tablet computer as an email attachment e.g. as a PDF TIFF JPG or other standard image file to document manager or other application within the destination tablet computer

Usefully the functionality of server can be incorporated directly into existing enterprise servers such as an Microsoft Exchange Server or a BlackBerry Enterprise Server leveraging off of existing infrastructure in the existing enterprise server. Furthermore different layers of encryption can be provided between computer and server or between server and tablet computers

Certain other general features can be used in variations. For example in a less secure context tablet can be configured to advertise itself as an available printer on a network bypassing server altogether. As another example tablet can be configured with near field communication apparatuses which can be detected by computer and used to obtain and establish a printer driver .

As another example tablet can be configured to send an email or other electronic communication to computer . Such an electronic communication can be configured to include a dedicated printer driver or a link to such a dedicated printer driver . Upon receipt of the electronic communication computer can be configured to utilize the electronic communication to install the dedicated printer driver .

For added security temporary public encryption keys can be used to install the printer drivers . Alternatively such encryption keys can be configured to permit a single print from the computer and thereafter be unusable for sending printed files directly to tablet . E.g. the printer driver expires after one print . In the case of the temporary key printer driver can be configured to remove itself from the list of printer devices after expiry.

Alternatively tablet computer can be configured to require or automatically accept submitted files to include source signature authentication.

Tablet computer can also be configured to send a notification warning that print request is being sent. Alternatively or in addition tablet computer can be configured to automatically accept or deny the print request based on characteristics such as file size format etc. Such a notification can be sent by email text message or the like. Likewise a notification can also be sent to computer .

In another variation server can be configured to receive a print request from computer and then configured to in turn send that print request to a plurality of different tablet computers caching the print request until a particular tablet computer comes back on line. Most general case of this could be a print to email service

Computer can also be configured to via the printer driver or other methods to print the file with a hash of the file encoded with its private key so that tablet computer can confirm that it does come from a known source via the public key for that computer . Computer can also be configured to receive a fax on behalf of a given tablet computer and then to send that fax as a print requests to the tablet computer .

In a further example variation the Wi Fi Direct or similar technology enabling Wi Fi devices to connect directly for operations such as printing sharing synching and displaying.

In yet a further example variation Bluetooth or similar technology enabling Bluetooth enabled devices to connect directly can be used for operations such as printing sharing synching and displaying.

In yet further example variations any other suitable technology for connecting devices can be used for operations such as printing sharing synching and displaying including but not limited to wired and wireless connections. Wired USB Universal Serial Bus connections are within the scope of example implementations.

In example embodiments each of links include any suitable components of system i.e. network base station and the like and can include a combination of wireless and wired components as desired.

In example embodiments each of links can be implemented according to any suitable protocol. In specific non limiting example implementations link can be implemented according to REST REpresentational State Transfer protocol while link can be implemented according to TLS Transport Layer Security Protocol protocol and link can be implemented according to any suitable peer to peer protocol. In an example embodiment each of links can be implemented according to SIP Session Initiation protocol protocol. Link can be implemented according to any suitable protocol.

Notification application also referred to herein as notification includes an application for implementing the printing process of method . For example notification can be enabled to provide notification to for example print service that server and or computer is waiting for tablet device to perform an action and hence cause tablet computer to perform an action such as pull print request from computer as will presently be explained.

Similarly file transfer application also be referred to herein as file transfer includes an application for receiving print request such as a web server application and providing print request to print service

In some implementations print service includes one or more of notification and file transfer while in other implementations each of print service notification and file transfer can include separate modules at tablet computer each enabled to interact with one another. In any event print service notification and file transfer include platform and collaboration services at tablet computer in an example embodiment.

Print application user interface PAUI includes a user interface application for providing printing options at tablet computer . In example implementations PAUI enables a user interface to be provided at a display of tablet computer for presenting options to accept or decline a print request as will be explained hereafter.

In some example implementations print service notification and file transfer can use an underlying SIP infrastructure associated with other applications e.g. applications at tablet computer . For example one of other applications at tablet computer can include a communications application such as a voice applications a texting applications a video chat application or the like which uses SIP to communicate with other devices to establish communication sessions there between including but not limited to multimedia communication sessions. In an example embodiment print service notification and file transfer can use the same underlying communication infrastructure for notification and data i.e. file transfer as the communications application.

For example as will be presently be explained part of the notification process is providing to both computer and tablet computer private data associated with one or the other of each including but not limited to network addresses such as IP internet protocol addresses. Hence SIP can be used to confirm aspects of the communications as in SIP devices dialogue e.g. like a phone call the dialogue can include a user interaction for example with tablet computer via PAUI to confirm the communications.

At print service subscribes to events at notification . At print driver at computer determines that a file is ready to be printed i.e. printed to tablet computer for example print request . In specific non limiting implementations at computer causes a mini HTTP Hypertext Transfer or Transport Protocol server to be processed to assist in file transfer. At computer generates a suitable security key for example the encryption key described above.

At computer posts a URL uniform resource locator of the mini HTTP server to server e.g. via link as well as any suitable identifier of tablet computer BBID such as an identifier described above and information identifying the file to be printed. The post at can include the security key generated at . At server locates tablet computer via the identifier of tablet computer and at transmits an invite message to notification at tablet computer for example via link which can also include the security key. In these example implementations server is configured to manage a network printer address for tablet computer that is used to route print data from computer or another computer as described above.

Notification transmits a 200OK message back to server at which in turn transmits a 201OK message back to computer each of which indicate that the invite message at was received at tablet computer

At notification notifies print service of receipt of the invite message as well as an address i.e. the URL of the HTTP mini server at which print request can be retrieved. The notify event at is in response to the subscribe event at .

In any event at print service issues a get file command to file transfer which includes the address e.g. the URL of the HTTP mini server at computer . At print service further issues a notify message to notification indicating that a session for receiving print request has started.

At file transfer transmits a get message e.g. an HTTPS GET command to print driver at computer for example via link using the address of the HTTP mini server. The get message at can include the security key received at such that computer can verify that the get message is being received from the resource to which printing was intended. At computer transmits a 200OK message back to file transfer which includes print request . Hence when occurs print request is received at tablet computer such that the associated document can be viewed as described above.

At file transfer informs print service that print request has been received and at print service informs notification that the session has ended. At computer tears down the resources used for the print to tablet computer process for example the mini HTTP server.

In these example implementations server is enabled to negotiate the notification process and that tablet computer pulls print request from computer

At server locates tablet computer based on the identifier of the tablet computer BBID as described above and at transmits an invite message to discovery similar to the invite message of however the invite message of includes the identifier of a type of event that is to occur between computer and tablet computer e.g. a file transfer event denoted by event file xfer req and the identifier of a service associated with the event e.g. print service as denoted by app ptg . At discovery notifies print service that a print event has been requested and at print service causes PAUI to provide a prompt at a display of tablet computer as to whether or not to accept the incoming print request. For example print service and PAUI can communicate via link such that PAUI provides a prompt at the display of tablet computer such as Incoming print request with an option to Accept or Decline the request. The format and or wording of the prompt is not to be considered particularly limiting.

In any event while tablet computer is waiting for a response to the prompt at print service notifies discovery that a prompt is being provided and that tablet computer is waiting for a response to the prompt. In turn at discovery notifies server 18 in SIP notation that tablet is providing an alert to a print request. At server creates a session and at provides a session identifier to computer which responds at with a hanging GET request. In other words at least a portion of computer enters a waiting mode until a response to the prompt is received.

In present implementations it is assumed that a positive response to the prompt is received at for example PAUI received the positive response and communicates such to print service . In other implementations a negative response to the prompt can be received which point messages are exchanged between tablet device server and computer indicating that the print request has been rejected. However in present implementations when a positive response to the prompt is received at at print service communicates with file transfer to create a file transfer session. File transfer starts a mini HTTP server at tablet device similar to the mini HTTP server started by computer at . File transfer responds at by generating an address for receiving print request which in these implementations can include but is not limited to an IP address a file transfer URL and the like. The address for receiving print request is then provided to print service at and at print service notifies discovery that the prompt has received a positive response along with the address for receiving the print request

At discovery notifies 200OK server of the address for receiving print request and acknowledges the notification at . In turn at server notifies computer of the address for receiving print request . Computer interprets message received at as a response to the hanging GET at and responds at by posting print request to the address received at in other words computer transmits print request to the file URL generated by file transfer at for example via link . File transfer responds to receiving print request by at notifying computer that print request has been received and at notifying print service that print request has been received. At print service notifies discovery that the session is to be terminated and at discovery notifies server that the session is to be terminated e.g. using both a 200OK message and a BYE Message .

In these implementations server is enabled to negotiate the notification process and that computer pushes print request to tablet computer once tablet computer print request has been approved at tablet computer . In these example implementations a web service is first offered in a notification request from a first computing device e.g. computer to a second computing device e.g. tablet computer and the second computing device returns a network address e.g. an IP address and or a URL to the first computing device once the web service is approved e.g. by receiving a positive response to a prompt provided at a display device of the second computing device a file associated with the web service is then pushed to the provided network address. Hence a user associated with the second computer has an option to accept or decline a notification request.

However in other example implementations can be omitted and print request is pushed to tablet computer without providing a prompt.

In further example implementations print driver at computer invoke a RESTful interface on server e.g. over HTTPS to discover and communicate with its peer app component e.g. discovery at target table computer . This is essentially a print request from the computer to tablet computer

Server authenticates the request to verify the identity of the requestor. Server does this by verifying a token that server had issued to computer previously.

Server then locates tablet computer based on a device identifier and notify tablet computer about the event. If tablet computer is not found or not in coverage at server would return an error response back to print driver and an error message will be presented at work station

At tablet computer discovery receives the event e.g. over SIP infrastructure and notifies print service which has previously subscribed to this event type. A prompt to accept the request can be included or omitted. In any event once the request is accepted print service requests file transfer to setup and provide a file address e.g. the URL referred to above for file transfer. File transfer then sends back the file address to server which in turn responds back to computer . Print driver then transfers the file i.e. print request directly tablet computer using the file address.

In some implementations signaling and call flow can change to support session based poke and pull notifications e.g. using a SIP INVITE method when prompting is supported and or to support printing to multiple devices simultaneously canceling a print requests etc. In an example embodiment STUN Session Traversal Utilities for NAT network address translation RFC Request for Comments 5389 protocol can be used by tablet computer to obtain its external IP address and if a direct connection is not possible due to firewall and NAT traversal issues a globally accessible media midpoint can be used similar to TURN Traversal Using Relays around NAT RFC 5766 and ICE Interactive Connectivity Establishment RFC 5245 .

Attention is next directed to which depicts a diagram of communications between print driver at computer server and print service discovery and file transfer at tablet computer in implementation where a push process is implemented in which computer pushes print request to tablet computer . In example embodiments communications between computer server and tablet computer can occur according to any suitable protocol and or combination of protocols including but not limited to SIP protocols. Communication diagram of is similar to the communication diagram of however in the communication diagram of once notification occurs computer posts a hanging GET to tablet computer rather than server as will presently be explained.

At discovery registers with server which confirms with a confirmation message e.g. 200OK . While a similar step is not depicted in a similar step can occur in the communication diagrams of .

At computer posts to server the identifier of tablet computer and information regarding the document to be printed for example a file identifier and or file name. However any suitable information can be posted which indicates that a document is to be printed to tablet computer and that the information posted is not to be considered particularly limiting.

At server transmits an invite message to discovery similar to the invite message of . At discovery notifies print service that a print event has been requested. At print service communicates with file transfer to create a session which returns a session address sessionURL to print service . In some example implementations a file location identifier is also passed from computer to server to tablet computer which can be provided to file transfer

At print service acknowledges receipt of the notify message received at and further provides the session address to discovery which transmits the session address to server at which in turn transmits the session address to computer at as well as acknowledging receipt of session address at

In addition to implementing at print service causes a prompt to be provided similar to described above. In other words while the session addressed is being passed to computer tablet provides a prompt as to whether or not accept the print request.

In any event at computer transmits a GET request to the session addressed provided at . The get request at is a hanging GET request similar to that of however transmitted to tablet computer rather than server . Hence once server acknowledges receipt of the session address received at server is no longer involved in the file transfer.

At a positive response to the prompt is received similar to described above and at print service transmits an allow file message to file transfer similar to . However the allow file message at includes the session identifier and the file identifier previously received. At file transfer transmits a response to the hanging get received at which includes an address for posting print request . Computer responds by posting PUT print request to the address for posting print request . File transfer receives print request and causes the resulting file to be stored at for later access by an application for rendering the file. File transfer further acknowledges receipt of print request at and further notifies print service that print request has been received. At print service notifies discovery that the session is to be terminated and at discovery notifies server that the session is to be terminated e.g. using both a 200OK message and a BYE Message .

In these example implementations server is enabled to negotiate the notification process and that computer pushes print request to tablet computer once tablet computer print request has been approved at tablet computer . In these example implementations a web service is first offered in a notification request from a first computing device e.g. computer to a second computing device e.g. tablet computer and the second computing device returns a network address e.g. an IP address and or a URL to the first computing device once the web service is approved e.g. by receiving a positive response to a prompt provided at a display device of the second computing device a file associated with the web service is then pushed to the provided network address. Hence a user associated with the second computer has an option to accept or decline a notification request.

Communication diagrams of have been described with reference to systems . System can be enabled to implement one or more of the communication diagrams of though generally not simultaneously and can be further enabled to pull print request to tablet computer . Further tablet computer can be further enabled to obtain approval to accept and alternatively decline print request

In some example implementations systems can be enabled to only allow printing to one device only at a time even there are multiple devices associated with a user. Further print drivers can be enabled to support printing to a plurality of tablet computers e.g. each similar to tablet computer .

However in other implementations systems can be enabled for a plurality of print sessions with several file transfers taking place simultaneously. Such transfers can be implemented using a plurality of session identifiers a plurality of file addresses and the like.

In yet further implementations print drivers could be enabled to receive a PIN print identification number in the printer that they install such that specific printers can be targeted in a print request. If PIN is blank server will select the first online in coverage device to send the request to. If PIN is a given indicator such as server will target all online in coverage devices of associated with a given identifier of a user.

For each of the communication diagrams of computer is enabled to sign in using any suitable credentials such as an identifier of tablet device and obtain authentication credentials such as an authentication token in an example embodiment.

Communication between computer and server can be secure for signing in as well as print request signaling for example using HTTPS HTTP over SSL Secure Socket Layer or HTTP Secure in example embodiments. For this server is enabled to access a TLS server and will present its own certificate to computer . Such a certificate can be similar to certificates used to provide secure media communications such as with Video Chat applications.

Secure communications can also occur for the file transfer directly between computer and tablet computer which can also be over HTTPS.

Tablet computer can also authenticate computer in the HTTPS POST request for file transfer e.g. at and or . When tablet computer gets a print request it would setup and generate a URL to send back to computer for pushing the file. This URL goes all the way back to computer through secure TLS from tablet computer to server and HTTPS from server to computer . In the URL that tablet computer generates tablet computer can embeds a temporary token for a session. Tablet computer can verify this token in the HTTP request received later from computer during file transfer to ensure authenticity.

In further implementations server security token issued and stored at computer for printing to tablet computer can be revoked. Hence if computer e.g. a laptop is lost or transferred rights to print to tablet computer can be revoked.

For example a Token Revocation command could be generated at tablet computer which would timestamp of the event. Hence any token associated with a time before the revocation would be considered invalid or expired .

Servers could verify authenticity expiry etc. of tokens. For example in requests to tablet computer server could also pass along the time that the token was issued. Print service could check this timestamp against the timestamp of revocation. If the issued time was before the revoked time tablet computer would send the result back to server which inform print driver which would then delete the stored but invalid token permanently and optionally provide a prompt for obtaining a new token.

In yet further example variations systems and method described herein can be implemented in a consumer environment rather than an enterprise environment For example a household computer can be used to print to tablet computers associated with each member of the household computer via a household network and or a consumer network and or a household server and or a consumer server operated for example by a service provider.

While specific example embodiments of the invention have been described and illustrated such example embodiments should be considered illustrative of the invention only and not as limiting the invention as construed in accordance with the accompanying claims.
