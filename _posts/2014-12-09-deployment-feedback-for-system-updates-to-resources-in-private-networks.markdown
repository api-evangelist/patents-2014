title: Deployment feedback for system updates to resources in private networks
abstract: Deployment feedback for updates to resources implemented in a private network may be implemented. Feedback codes may be generated and included in deployments sent to a private network for deployment at resources implemented in the private network. One or more of the included feedback codes may be selected based on the performance of the deployment and provided via a feedback communication channel that is disconnected and distinct from the private network. Once received, a current status of the deployment may be determined based on the one or more feedback codes provided via the feedback communication channel.

Cloud based infrastructure offers many advantages for companies developers or other entities that may implement new systems and technologies leveraging the accessibility flexibility and reliability. Many different types of services systems or functions may be implemented using cloud based resources for client systems or devices. For example cloud based resources such as virtual compute instances may be used to implement a network based service for external customers such as an e commerce platform. Cloud based resources may also be used to implement a service or tool for internal customers such as information technology IT service implemented as part of an internal network for a corporation. Cloud based resources such as virtual networks may be used to direct or control network traffic in order to perform the various functions or tasks provided by the services or functions performed utilizing other cloud based resources in another example. Instead of investing resources in acquiring various hardware and software components cloud based resources may be procured to provide the infrastructure upon which these new systems and technologies may be built.

Cloud based resources are often provided by a provider network which may include many different types of network based services that can be used to implement cloud based infrastructure resources. Developers can request provision and configure various different cloud based resources from the network based services offered as part of the development of new systems and products. However as infrastructure requirements become more complex the costs and complexity to maintain cloud based resources may increase as the time and expertise needed to deploy updates may grow more cumbersome.

It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit embodiments to the particular form disclosed but on the contrary the intention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope as defined by the appended claims. The headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to be used to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used throughout this application the word may is used in a permissive sense i.e. meaning having the potential to rather than the mandatory sense i.e. meaning must . Similarly the words include including and includes mean including but not limited to.

The systems and methods described herein may implement deployment feedback for updates to resources in private networks according to some embodiments. Private networks often implement resources such as various network based resources that may perform sensitive operations and or maintain private information. Financial services merchants banks and other holders of private information may utilize resources in private networks to perform various tasks and operations while maintaining a level of privacy for certain aspects of the operations or data. The upkeep of these resources in a private network may reply upon various deployments such as updates patches upgrades or other changes or modifications made to resources in order to enhance or improve the operation of various functions within the private network. As the number and or configuration of private network resources may become complex it may be valuable to allow those entities with skill or expertise in the maintenance of those resources the capability to perform new deployments. However allowing outside entities to make such deployments may risk exposure of those private operations and or data which the private network maintains. Thus private networks may implement various levels of network privacy or isolation in order to protect sensitive information. Yet such protections may stymie the ability of outside entities to effectively make deployments to resources. For example if an error occurs with respect to a deployment to a particular resource e.g. a software update to certain type of database system it may be difficult to obtain the information about the failure without violating the privacy restrictions enforced for the provider network.

Deployment feedback may be provided in various embodiments in accordance with the level of privacy or isolation implemented for a provider network. A separate feedback communication channel may be implemented that allows deployment feedback to be communicated as a result of a deployment in a private network to an entity responsible for the performance of the deployment. is a logical data flow diagram illustrating deployment feedback for system updates to a private network with outbound isolation according to some embodiments. In various embodiments a private network may implement a variety of system resources at one or more data centers such as resources and to provide different systems services functions and or applications for clients internal to the private network . As illustrated in private network may be disconnected from outbound communication in order to isolate private network from external networks such as external network . However in at least some embodiments other levels of isolation or privacy may be implemented. For example a private network close certain communication ports to publicly available networks while maintaining open specific outbound connections that establish secure communications with particular networks systems resources or devices. A bank for instance may implement a private network with a privacy level restricting the communication of certain kinds of financial information except to other financial institutions with which the bank maintains a secure outbound communication link. Private network may implement one way inbound connection which may allow traffic from an external network but via which no network traffic may leave the private network or at least no traffic not allowed under the privacy isolation level implemented for the private network . As noted above as a resource configurations in private network grow more complicated it may be cost effective to rely upon an external provider of system updates system deployment manager .

In various embodiments system deployment manager may be a system or service that provides various updates and changes to the resources implemented in private network . System deployment manager and private network may be operated by different entities in various embodiments and thus system deployment manger may still not be privy to the sensitive information of private network and thus may perform updates to the resources without violating outbound communication isolation or other privacy isolation level implemented for private network . In some scenarios debugging troubleshooting and other configuration operations with regard to the system deployments may be helpful and or necessary to obtain more information about the performance of updates at private network .

In at least some embodiments system deployment manager may generate and include feedback code s when deploying system update s to resource s in private network . Deployment agent may receive the deployment and select appropriate feedback codes based on the performance of the system deployment. Deployment agent may provide notification of the feedback codes to a network agent e.g. an operator user or authorized individual for managing system deployments at private network . This notification may in some embodiments be provided through an input output I O interface that is local to private network . For example in at least some embodiments I O interface is a graphical display. Network agent may then provide the feedback code s via a feedback communication channel to system deployment manager or to an agent or support engineer thereof . The feedback communication channel may be isolated and disconnected from private network such that no access to information of private network may be obtained via feedback communication channel . In at least some embodiments feedback communication channel may be a telephonic channel or text based messaging channel. Other communication channels such as non electronic forms of communication may also be or alternatively be implemented for feedback communication channel e.g. agent to agent audible communication in a common location .

In some embodiments private network may provide multiple different network based services for internal clients based on resource s . Private network may be set up by an entity such as a company or a public sector organization to provide one or more network based services such as various types of cloud based computing or storage accessible to internal clients. Private network may include numerous data centers hosting various resource pools such as collections of physical and or virtualized computer servers storage devices networking equipment and the like needed to implement and distribute the infrastructure and services offered by the private network to internal clients. Internal clients may be configured to access private network through private network connections direct to the private network .

Private network may implement many different kinds of services and thus the following discussion of various services is not intended to be limiting. For example various network based services may be implemented such as deployment service s management service s application service s and analytic service s . In some embodiments private network may implement storage service s . Storage service s may be one or more different types of services that provide different types of storage. For example storage service s may be an object or key value data store that provides highly durable storage for large amounts of data organized as data objects. In some embodiments storage service s may include an archive long term storage solution that is highly durable yet not easily accessible in order to provide low cost storage. In some embodiments storage service s may provide virtual block storage for other computing devices such as compute instances implemented as part of a virtual computing service. For example a virtual block based storage service may provide block level storage for storing one or more data volumes mapped to particular clients providing virtual block based storage e.g. hard disk storage or other persistent storage as a contiguous set of logical blocks. Storage service s may replicate stored data across multiple different locations fault tolerant or availability zones or nodes in order to provide redundancy for durability and availability for access.

In some embodiments private network may implement database service s . Database services may include many different types of databases and or database schemes. Relational and non relational databases may be implemented to store data as well as row oriented or column oriented databases. For example a database service that stores data according to a data model in which each table maintained on behalf of a client contains one or more items and each item includes a collection of attributes such as a key value data store. In such a database the attributes of an item may be a collection of name value pairs in any order and each attribute in an item may have a name a type and a value. Some attributes may be single valued such that the attribute name is mapped to a single value while others may be multi value such that the attribute name is mapped to two or more values.

Private network may implement networking service s in some embodiments. Networking service s may configure or provide virtual networks such as virtual private networks VPNs among resources implemented in private network as well as control access with other systems or devices in private network . For example networking service s may be configured to implement security groups for compute instances in a virtual network. Security groups may enforce one or more network traffic policies for network traffic at members of the security group. Membership in a security group may not be related to physical location or implementation of a compute instance. The number of members or associations with a particular security group may vary and may be configured.

In some embodiments private network may implement virtual computing services to provide computing resources. These computing resources may in some embodiments be offered to clients in units called instances such as virtual or physical compute instances or storage instances. A virtual compute instance may for example comprise one or more servers with a specified computational capacity which may be specified by indicating the type and number of CPUs the main memory size and so on and a specified software stack e.g. a particular version of an operating system which may in turn run on top of a hypervisor or machine image. A number of different types of computing devices may be used singly or in combination to implement compute instances in different embodiments including general purpose or special purpose computer servers storage devices network devices and the like. In some embodiments internal clients or other any other user may be configured and or authorized to direct network traffic to a compute instance.

Please note that previous descriptions are not intended to be limiting but are merely provided as a logical example of a private network and system deployment manager. Various other components may interact with or assist in implementing a service platform specific language.

This specification next includes a general description of a system deployment manager which may implement deployment feedback for updates to resources in a private network. Various examples of system deployment manager as well as a deployment agent are discussed including different components modules or arrangements of components module that may be employed as part of a resource tag service. A number of different methods and techniques to implement deployment feedback for updates to resources in a private network are then discussed some of which are illustrated in accompanying flowcharts. Finally a description of an example computing system upon which the various components modules systems devices and or nodes may be implemented is provided. Various examples are provided throughout the specification.

In some embodiments mapping information and system deployment metadata may be updated in various embodiments such as discussed below with regard to . Feedback code lookup may be implemented to provide information related to a feedback code e.g. a status for the system deployment in response to submitted feedback codes . For example a feedback code may be received via a feedback communication channel which an agent for system deployment manager may use to generate a request to lookup the feedback code . A query analysis or other search of feedback code mapping system deployment metadata may be performed such as discussed below with regard to to retrieve a description of the deployment status e.g. success fail partial success etc. from feedback code mapping system deployment metadata .

As illustrated in system deployment agent may implement system deployment performance tracking to collect various information about the performance of update s . For example logs and or other tracking mechanisms may retain information describing the changes made to resources the amount of time errors encountered or triggered and or any other performance characteristics. Based on the performance of the update system deployment performance tracking may select feedback code s included with the system deployment as received at the private network may be selected as discussed below with regard to . Notification of the feedback code s may be provided via local input output I O interface to network agent e.g. an operator agent or other authorized individual that handles system deployments . For example an I O interface may be a graphical display and the notification on such a graphical display may be a posting to a web page internal to the provider network. Various other user interfaces may be provided. In some embodiments a message or notification may be sent to an internal account e.g. a message queue a local electronic mail address . Selected feedback codes may be printed or physical posted to physical medium or they may be communicated audibly for an operator to hear and possibly copy down .

The system deployment mangers and deployment agents that implement deployment feedback for system updates to outbound isolated private networks as discussed above with regard to have been given as examples. Various other types or configurations of system deployment mangers and deployment agents and other components may implement these techniques. Thus is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for implementing deployment feedback for system updates to outbound isolated private networks according to some embodiments.

As indicated at a system deployment to update system resources in a private network may be initiated. As discussed above a private network may have varying levels of privacy or isolation. From complete outbound isolation to limited outbound channels data types recipients or other isolation privacy limitations a private network may rely upon communication of feedback codes via a feedback communication in at least some embodiments. The update of the system deployment may be utilized to perform various operations at system resources implemented at the private network such as rebuilding machines servers or other systems downloading new machine images reconfiguring system BIOS configuring network devices modifying or changing operating systems or other application software and or any other change to the system resources.

As indicated at feedback code s may be generated for the system deployment that satisfy communication restriction s for a feedback communication channel for the private network that is isolated and disconnected from the private network in various embodiments. As noted earlier the feedback communication channel may be implemented in such a way as to provide no direct connection to or interaction with the private network. The feedback communication channel may be located in the same physical location e.g. within the same building or physical data center but may utilize different physical communication infrastructure e.g. separate dedicated phone lines or network connections . In some embodiments the feedback communication channel may be located operated in a different physical location than the private network.

The communication restrictions of the feedback communication channel may be infrastructure related isolation related and or operator related. Infrastructure communication restrictions may limit the bandwidth of the feedback communication channel. For example a messaging communication channel may be limited to information that may be manually entered e.g. an internet relay chat IRC channel or the like . Isolation related restrictions may limit the amount of data or information that may be communicated at a time in order to preserve outbound isolation of data maintained in the private network. For example text communication may be limited to a certain number of characters e.g. 10 character strings so that large portions of information may not be manually transferred via the feedback communication channel. Operator communication restrictions may practically limit the amount of data. For example a telephonic feedback communication channel may limit the amount of data passed requiring it be transmitted audibly. Moreover the operator related restrictions may also impose limits on length or complicated text combinations e.g. avoiding the introduction of operator error in relaying the feedback code . Thus in various embodiments the feedback codes may be generated such that the communication restrictions are satisfied. For example a short alphanumeric string may be utilized as the feedback code in some embodiments e.g. a 6 character string .

Multiple feedback codes may be generated in some embodiments to provide greater feedback increasing the amount of information that may be conveyed by the feedback code. For example in some embodiments a standard set of feedback codes corresponding to a set of deployment statuses may be generated for each system deployment e.g. successful failure partial success etc. . . . . In at least some embodiments the system deployment may be evaluated to determine or identify various statuses specific to the update being performed. For example statuses may be identified that corresponding to the success or failure of updates to specific resources operations error codes interrupts flags states or any other descriptive or useful information for determining the particular status of the system deployment. Identified status may create a very large number of feedback codes in some embodiments. For instance feedback codes may be generated for each possible failure status combination in a deployment which may affect multiple resources . In some embodiments the number of feedback codes may be limited based on size e.g. storage space for the feedback codes or cost to identify e.g. certain amount of computation time for identifying feedback codes . In some embodiments the relationships between various actions updates or operations of a deployment may be analyzed to determine dependencies hierarchies or other status scenarios that may be described using a feedback code. Once identified corresponding feedback codes may be generated for each identified status.

As part of generating feedback codes mapping information maintaining links between feedback codes and system deployments as well as their respective metadata may be maintained. For instance a database table storage object or structure list index or other collection of active or submitted feedback codes may have new entries added for each generated feedback code. The mapping information may identify a permanent identifier for the system deployment that includes the feedback such as globally unique identifier. The system deployment identifier may then be used to access a set of metadata describing the system deployment which may be used to translate or determine statuses as well as other information based on the feedback codes generated for the system deployment.

In at least some embodiments a history of previously submitted feedback codes may be maintained. The history of feedback codes may be evaluated when generating feedback codes to prevent the use of duplicate codes. For example candidate codes may be generated and then compared to the history of feedback codes. If no matching feedback codes are found then the candidate feedback codes may become the feedback codes to be included in the system deployment.

As indicated at the system deployment may be sent to the private network including the feedback code s in order to initiate the performance of the update to the system resources in various embodiments. A one way inbound connection may be utilized in some embodiments to send the deployment including feedback code s from a deployment manager via an external network to a private network. discussed below provides various examples of deploying updates at the private network. At some time an indication of a feedback code may be received as indicated at . The indication of the feedback code may come from a message communication directly via the feedback communication channel or may be provided by an intermediary system or operator e.g. a support engineer manually entering the feedback code provided over a telephonic channel in various embodiments.

Based at least in part on the received indication of the feedback code a current status of the system deployment may be determined in various embodiments as indicated at . For instance the mapping information for the feedback code may be accessed as discussed below with regard to which may lead to system deployment metadata which translates or provides information that describes the current status of the system deployment. In at least some embodiments further responsive actions may be performed based on the status. For example a feedback code that is determined to indicate a deployment success status may trigger the update of various metadata or other state information that is used to track updates applied to the private network in some embodiments. In another example a feedback code that is determined to indicate a complete or particular failure scenario may be utilized to access metadata describing the system deployment in order to identify the specific failure which may be useful for debugging .

Deployment agents or other systems components or devices that deploy updates to resources at a provider network may be configured to provide notification of feedback codes to agents operators or others participating in the deployment of the updates. As discussed above and below these feedback codes provide a rich set of information as to the performance of system deployments without violating the outbound isolation properties of the private network. is high level flowchart illustrating various methods and techniques for performing system deployments and providing notifications of feedback codes according to some embodiments.

As indicated at a system deployment to update system resources may be received at a deployment agent implemented at a provider network that includes feedback codes s in various embodiments. The system deployment may be formatted as package executable or other software container or format that allows the deployment agent to facilitate the performance of the update to the system resources as indicated at . Performance of the updates may be manually performed or manually approved in some embodiments. While in other embodiments the performance of the update to the system resources may be performed automatically although in some scenarios manual approval may be required before performing the automated update .

As some system deployments may involve performing updates to many different resources in various different ordering settings and or conditions the possibility of failure or partial completion may be great. Logs and or other tracking mechanisms may retain information describing the changes made to resources the amount of time errors encountered or triggered and or any other performance characteristics. However maintained or determined based on the performance of the update a feedback code of the feedback code s including with the system deployment as received at the private network may be selected as indicated at . In at least some embodiments various criteria policies or rules may be included with the feedback codes which are evaluated based on the performance of the update. If the performance satisfies a rule for a feedback code then the feedback code may be selected. Please note that in some embodiments multiple feedback codes may be selected. For example if various flags interrupts or completion messages are detected or logged during the performance of the update then multiple feedback codes which have rules satisfied by these flags interrupts or completions messages may be selected.

In various embodiments notification of the selected feedback code or codes may be provided via an I O interface local to the private network as indicated at . For example an I O interface may be a graphical display and the notification on such a graphical display may be a posting to a web page internal to the provider network. Various other graphical user interfaces may be provided. In some embodiments a message or notification may be sent to an internal account e.g. a message queue a local electronic mail address . Selected feedback codes may be printed or physical posted to physical medium or they may be communicated audibly for an operator to hear and possibly copy down .

Once notified as discussed above with regard to the agents operators or other individual may proceed to utilize the feedback communication channel for the provider network in some embodiments. For example a dedicated terminal implementing an isolated communication link to the system deployment manger may be provided which allows the operator to type or otherwise enter feedback codes. In some embodiments the operator may leave the physical location implementing the provider network to reach a different location to utilize the feedback communication channel. In at least some embodiments the feedback communication may be telephonic allow the operator to provide the feedback code to an agent operator and or support engineer for the deployment system manager over a telephone conversation.

When generating one or more feedback codes for a system deployment mapping information may be updated to link the feedback codes to metadata describing the update as discussed above with regard to . Thus as indicated at when an indication of a feedback code is received the mapping information that links feedback codes to system deployments may be evaluated to identify the system deployment associated with the feedback. For instance an index of live feedback codes for the mapping information may be maintained so that when the indication of the feedback code is receive the index may be efficiently searched to identify the mapping information for the feedback code. The mapping information may then provide an identifier for the system deployment which may not be subject to the same communication restrictions as the feedback codes. For example a permanent globally unique identifier may be assigned to the system deployment such that the probability of collision is effectively zero.

The identifier for the system deployment in the mapping information or other technique for identifying the system may be utilized to access metadata describing the identified system deployment to translate the feedback code into a current status for the identified system deployment as indicated at . For example as noted above multiple different feedback codes may be included in a system deployment each of which may correspond to a different status. For example various failure or completion scenarios may correspond to the different feedback codes for a system deployment. The metadata may provide the corresponding status as well as the various information indicated by that status for each of the different feedback codes.

When multiple system deployments are currently being performed this technique of identifying a particular system deployment based on a feedback code may allow a system deployment manager or other system or component implementing this technique to provide relevant information as maintained in metadata for a specific system deployment. For example if an operator or technician at the private network is attempting to troubleshoot or debug a system deployment failure at the private network providing the feedback code to a support engineer for the system deployment manager may allow the support engineer to identify specific debugging strategies operations or techniques to correct the problem e.g. the information may indicate which package patch code resource etc. failed to update thus localizing the problem for further debugging . In at least some embodiments access controls restricting the ability of feedback codes received via a feedback communication channel may be enforced. For example an agent of a system deployment manager may have to enter certain access credential before receiving back the meaning of a feedback code.
