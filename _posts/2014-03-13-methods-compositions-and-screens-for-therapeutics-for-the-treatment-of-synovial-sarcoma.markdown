title: Methods, compositions and screens for therapeutics for the treatment of synovial sarcoma
abstract: Methods and compositions are provided for treating human synovial sarcoma (SS). Also provided are screens to identify therapeutics for the treatment of synovial sarcoma. These methods, compositions, and screens are based on the discovery that promoting the assembly of wild type BAF (also called mSWI/SNF) complexes in SS cells by increasing levels of wild type SS18 and/or decreasing levels of SS18-SSX fusion protein leads to the cessation of proliferation of malignant cells in synovial sarcoma.
