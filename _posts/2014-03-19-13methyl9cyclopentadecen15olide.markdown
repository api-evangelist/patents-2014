The present invention relates to 13 methyl 9 cyclopentadecen 15 olide and a fragrance composition containing the same.

Fragrance is an important element that creates for example preference a sense of luxury a sense of ease and expectations for the effect for products and the like. Furthermore a distinctive fragrance provides a product differentiation effect and the capacity for attracting customers. On the other hand in order to control for example a long lasting property and balance of fragrance generally a fragrance is imparted to a product using a fragrance composition in which a plurality of fragrance materials are mixed together. It is required for the fragrance materials composing the fragrance composition to be highly harmonious with other fragrance materials.

Particularly natural musks have been used as expensive fragrances since ancient times. Among them some lactone compounds are synthesized as macrocyclic musks.

For example cyclopentadecanolide has an elegant sweet and musk like odor ambrettolide has an elegant musk like odor Habanolide exhibits a very elegant musk like odor and cyclohexadecanolide has a musk odor Non Patent Document 1 .

In addition Patent Document 1 describes that 11 methyl 13 cyclotridecanolide 12 methyl 14 cyclotetradecanolide and 13 methyl 15 cyclopentadecanolide each have a strong musk odor with an excellent long lasting property.

Patent Document 2 discloses a method of producing a macrocyclic lactone compound with a double bond wherein a specific ester compound is cyclized by a metathesis reaction for the purpose of obtaining a macrocyclic lactone compound that has an excellent odor quality a powdery feeling and a musk like odor.

Patent Document 3 describes that a macrocyclic lactone compound with a specific alkyl group has an excellent musk like odor and can be produced easily.

Patent Document 4 discloses an odorizing composition containing a specific compound having a strong musk odor such as oxacycloheptadec 12 en 2 one or a mixture thereof excluding a specific compound such as Z oxacyclopentadaca 6 en 2 one as the compound.

Very roughly speaking fragrance materials have similar fragrance notes when they have similar structures to each other but there are many exceptions.

Two experts who had an experience of blending odors and evaluating fragrances determined the fragrance note and the intensity by a smelling strip method. About 5 mm of the end of each smelling strip fragrance test paper with a width of 6 mm and a length of 150 mm was immersed in a sample and thereby evaluation was performed.

With respect to the odor fragrances that are sensed mainly main odors were listed from the strongest to the weakest and further fragrances that are sensed secondarily secondary odors were noted.

The odor intensity was indicated by the result of the evaluation with 0 denoting odorless and 5 denoting very strong a six grades odor intensity measurement method .

As in the case of the above mentioned smelling strip method a strip was immersed in a sample and then was left in a 5 mwindless room at 25 C. It was evaluated every 7 days and the number shown is the number of weeks that passed until the odor intensity of the main odor became zero. The larger the number of weeks the better the fragrance retention. Habanolide manufactured by Firmenich was evaluated by this method and the number of weeks was two.

Using 13 methyl 9 cyclopentadecen 15 olide obtained in Example 1 Habanolide and Pentalide cyclopentadecanolide fragrances of Example 4 Comparative Examples 2 and Comparative Example 3 were blended in such a manner as to have blended compositions indicated in Table 1 respectively. Thus blended fragrances fragrance compositions were prepared.

The evaluations were performed in the same manner as in the aforementioned odor evaluation. Compared to the fragrance compositions of Comparative Examples 2 and 3 the fragrance composition of Example 4 lifted the top note citrus green and fruitiness and enhanced the feeling of cleanliness and refreshingness.

To a non fragranced liquid cleanser for clothing having the composition indicated in Table 2 each of the fragrance compositions obtained in Example 4 and Comparative Examples 2 and 3 was added in such a manner as to be 0.6 mass . Thus cleanser compositions of Example 5 and Comparative Examples 4 and 5 were prepared respectively. With respect to these cleanser compositions the following odor evaluation was performed.

One expert who had an experience of seven years of blending odors and evaluating fragrances evaluated odors in the following manner. In a 100 ml glass bottle 50 ml of each of the cleanser compositions of the example and the comparative examples was placed which then was sealed and allowed to stand at 25 C. for 24 hours. Thereafter the expert evaluated the odor at the mouth of the bottle when it was opened.

Comparative Example 4 had a clean musk odor and Comparative Example 5 had an odor provided with mild sweetness. On the other hand the cleanser composition of Example 5 had emphasized green fruitiness and it was fresher and had enhanced feeling of cleanliness and refreshingness as compared to the cleanser compositions of the comparative examples.

Since 13 methyl 9 cyclopentadecen 15 olide of the present invention has an odor with a tone of musk and a side note of woody tone that are useful as fragrances and is excellent in fragrance retention it can be used as a fragrance material. Furthermore 13 methyl 9 cyclopentadecen 15 olide of the present invention can have an emphasized top note and enhanced feeling of cleanliness and refreshingness by being blended with another fragrance.

Thus fragrance compositions containing 13 methyl 9 cyclopentadecen 15 olide of the present invention can be used as fragrance components for cleanser compositions softener compositions etc.
