The present invention relates to smoke filters that reduce the concentration of components in a smoke stream including methods and smoking devices related thereto.

Increasingly governmental regulations require higher filtration efficacies in removing harmful components from tobacco smoke e.g. carbon monoxide and phenols. With present cellulose acetate higher filtration efficacies can be achieved by doping the filter with increasing concentrations of particles like activated carbon. However increasing particulate concentration changes draw characteristics for smokers.

One measure of draw characteristics is the encapsulated pressure drop. As used herein the term encapsulated pressure drop or EPD refers to the static pressure difference between the two ends of a specimen when it is traversed by an air flow under steady conditions when the volumetric flow is 17.5 ml sec at the output end and when the specimen is completely encapsulated in a measuring device so that no air can pass through the wrapping. EPD has been measured herein under the CORESTA Cooperation Centre for Scientific Research Relative to Tobacco Recommended Method No. 41 dated June 2007. Higher EPD values translate to the smoker having to draw on a smoking device with greater force.

Because increasing filter efficacy changes the EPD of the filters the public and consequently manufactures have been slow to adopt most technologies. Therefore despite continued research there remains an interest in developing improved and more effective compositions that minimally effect draw characteristics while removing higher levels of certain constituents in mainstream tobacco smoke like carbon monoxide and phenols.

The present invention relates to smoke filters that reduce the concentration of components in a smoke stream including methods and smoking devices related thereto.

Smoke filters described herein may include sections designed to reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide and or phenols in the smoke stream while allowing for tailorable draw characteristics that can be designed to a manufacturer s specifications. The smoke filters described herein include at least one porous mass section and at least one filter section.

The term porous mass as used herein refers to a mass comprising a plurality of binder particles and a plurality of active particles mechanically bound at a plurality of contact points. Said contact points may be active particle binder contact points binder binder contact points and or active particle active particle contact points. As used herein the terms mechanical bond mechanically bonded physical bond and the like refer to a physical connection that holds two particles together. Mechanical bonds may be rigid or flexible depending on the bonding material. Mechanical bonding may or may not involve chemical bonding. Generally the mechanical binding does not involve an adhesive though in some embodiments an adhesive may be used after mechanical binding to adhere other additives to portions of the organic porous mass.

As used herein the terms particle and particulate may be used interchangeably and include all known shapes of materials including spherical and or ovular substantially spherical and or ovular discus and or platelet flake ligamental acicular fibrous polygonal such as cubic randomly shaped such as the shape of crushed rocks faceted such as the shape of crystals or any hybrid thereof. Nonlimiting examples of porous masses are described in detail in co pending applications PCT US2011 043264 PCT US2011 043268 PCT US2011 043269 and PCT US2011 043271 the entire disclosures of which are included herein by reference.

It should be noted that when about is provided below in reference to a number the term about modifies each number of the numerical list. It should be noted that in some numerical listings of ranges some lower limits listed may be greater than some upper limits listed. One skilled in the art will recognize that the selected subset will require the selection of an upper limit in excess of the selected lower limit.

In some embodiments the porous mass sections described herein may comprise active particles and binder particles.

One example of an active particle is activated carbon or activated charcoal or active coal . The activated carbon may be low activity about 50 to about 75 CCladsorption or high activity about 75 to about 95 CCladsorption or a combination of both. In some embodiments the active carbon may be nano scaled carbon particle such as carbon nanotubes of any number of walls carbon nanohorns bamboo like carbon nanostructures fullerenes and fullerene aggregates and graphene including few layer graphene and oxidized graphene. Other examples of active particles may include but are not limited to ion exchange resins desiccants silicates molecular sieves silica gels activated alumina zeolites perlite sepiolite Fuller s Earth magnesium silicate metal oxides e.g. iron oxide iron oxide nanoparticles like about 12 nm FeO manganese oxide copper oxide and aluminum oxide gold platinum cellulose acetate iodine pentoxide phosphorus pentoxide nanoparticles e.g. metal nanoparticles like gold and silver metal oxide nanoparticles like alumina magnetic paramagnetic and superparamagnetic nanoparticles like gadolinium oxide various crystal structures of iron oxide like hematite and magnetite gado nanotubes and endofullerenes like Gd C and core shell and onionated nanoparticles like gold and silver nanoshells onionated iron oxide and others nanoparticles or microparticles with an outer shell of any of said materials and any combination of the foregoing including activated carbon . Ion exchange resins include for example a polymer with a backbone such as styrene divinyl benzene DVB copolymer acrylates methacrylates phenol formaldehyde condensates and epichlorohydrin amine condensates and a plurality of electrically charged functional groups attached to the polymer backbone. In some embodiments the active particles are a combination of various active particles. In some embodiments the porous mass may comprise multiple active particles. In some embodiments an active particle may comprise at least one element selected from the group of active particles disclosed herein. It should be noted that element is being used as a general term to describe items in a list. In some embodiments the active particles are combined with at least one flavorant.

In some embodiments the active particles may be chosen to reduce the concentration of carbon monoxide. Reduction of carbon monoxide by current cigarette filter designs primarily rely on tobacco blend tobacco burn rate and paper porosity that enhances ventilation to dilute the carbon monoxide. Commercially there is a lack of active avenues for reducing carbon monoxide in a smoke stream. Examples of suitable active particles for reducing carbon monoxide may include but are not limited to iodine pentoxide phosphorous pentoxide manganese oxide copper oxide iron oxide molecular sieves aluminum oxide gold platinum and the like and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the active particles may have an average diameter in least one dimension ranging from a lower limit of about less than one nanometer e.g. graphene about 0.1 nm 0.5 nm 1 nm 10 nm 100 nm 500 nm 1 micron 5 microns 10 microns 50 microns 100 microns 150 microns 200 microns and 250 microns to an upper limit of about 5000 microns 2000 microns 1000 microns 900 microns 700 microns 500 microns 400 microns 300 microns 250 microns 200 microns 150 microns 100 microns 50 microns 10 microns and 500 nm wherein the average diameter may range from any lower limit to an upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments the active particles may be a mixture of particle sizes.

Examples of binder particles may include but are not limited to polyolefins polyesters polyamides or nylons polyacrylics polystyrenes polyvinyls polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE polyether ether ketone PEEK any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof and any combination thereof. Examples of suitable polyolefins include but are not limited to polyethylene polypropylene polybutylene polymethylpentene any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable polyethylenes further include low density polyethylene linear low density polyethylene high density polyethylene any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable polyesters include polyethylene terephthalate polybutylene terephthalate polycyclohexylene dimethylene terephthalate polytrimethylene terephthalate any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable polyacrylics include but are not limited to polymethyl methacrylate any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable polystyrenes include but are not limited to polystyrene acrylonitrile butadiene styrene styrene acrylonitrile styrene butadiene styrene maleic anhydride any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable polyvinyls include but are not limited to ethylene vinyl acetate ethylene vinyl alcohol polyvinyl chloride any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. Examples of suitable cellulosics include but are not limited to cellulose acetate cellulose acetate butyrate plasticized cellulosics cellulose propionate ethyl cellulose any copolymer thereof any derivative thereof any combination thereof and the like. In some embodiments a binder particle may be any copolymer any derivative and any combination of the above listed binders.

In some embodiments the binder particles described herein may have a hydrophilic surface treatment. Hydrophilic surface treatments e.g. oxygenated functionalities like carboxy hydroxyl and epoxy may be achieved by exposure to at least one of chemical oxidizers flames ions plasma corona discharge ultraviolet radiation ozone and combinations thereof e.g. ozone and ultraviolet treatments . Because many of the active particles described herein are hydrophilic either as a function of their composition or adsorbed water a hydrophilic surface treatment to the binder particles may increase the attraction e.g. van der Waals electrostatic hydrogen bonding and the like between the binder particles and the active particles. This enhanced attraction may mitigate segregation of active and binder particles in the matrix material thereby minimizing variability in the EPD integrity circumference cross sectional shape and other properties of the resultant porous masses. Further it has been observed that the enhanced attraction provides for a more homogeneous matrix material which can increase flexibility for filter design e.g. lowering overall EPD reducing the concentration of the binder particles or both .

The binder particles may assume any shape. Such shapes include spherical hyperion asteroidal chrondular or interplanetary dust like granulated potato irregular and any combination thereof. In preferred embodiments the binder particles suitable for use in the present invention are non fibrous. In some embodiments the binder particles are in the form of a powder pellet or particulate.

In some embodiments the binder particles may exhibit virtually no flow at its melting temperature i.e. when heated to its melting temperature exhibits little to no polymer flow. Materials meeting these criteria may include but are not limited to ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene UHMWPE very high molecular weight polyethylene VHMWPE high molecular weight polyethylene HMWPE and any combination thereof.

As used herein the term VHMWPE refers to polyethylene compositions with a weight average molecular weight of less than about 3 10g mol and more than about 1 10g mol including any subset therebetween. As used herein the term HMWPE refers to polyethylene compositions with weight average molecular weight of at least about 3 10g mol to 1 10g mol. For purposes of the present specification the molecular weights referenced herein are determined in accordance with the Margolies equation Margolies molecular weight .

In some embodiments the binder particles may have a melt flow index MFI a measure of polymer flow as measured by ASTM D1238 at 190 C. and 15 kg load ranging form a lower limit of about 0 0.5 1.0 or 2.0 g 10 min to an upper limit of about 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 or 1.0 wherein the MFI may range from any lower limit to an upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments the porous mass sections may comprise a mixture of binder particles having different molecular weights and or different melt flow indexes.

In some embodiments the binder particles may have an intrinsic viscosity ranging from about 5 dl g to about 30 dl g including any subset therebetween and a degree of crystallinity of about 80 or more e.g. about 80 to about 100 including any subset therebetween as described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008 0090081.

Examples of commercially available polyethylene materials suitable for use as binder particles described herein may include GUR UHMWPE available from Ticona Polymers LLC DSM Braskem Beijing Factory No. 2 Shanghai Chemical Qilu Mitsui and Asahi including GUR 2000 series 2105 2122 2122 5 2126 GUR 4000 series 4120 4130 4150 4170 4012 4122 5 4022 6 4050 3 4150 3 GUR 8000 series 8110 8020 and GUR X series X143 X184 X168 X172 X192 . Another example of a suitable polyethylene material is that having a molecular weight in the range of about 300 000 g mol to about 2 000 000 g mol as determined by ASTM D 4020 an average particle size between about 300 microns and about 1500 microns and a bulk density between about 0.25 g ml and about 0.5 g ml.

In some embodiments the binder particles are a combination of various binder particles as distinguished by composition shape size bulk density MFI intrinsic viscosity and the like and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the porous mass section may comprise active particles in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 1 wt 5 wt 10 wt 25 wt 40 wt 50 wt 60 wt or 75 wt of the porous mass section to an upper limit of about 99 wt 95 wt 90 wt or 75 wt of the porous mass section and wherein the amount of active particles can range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments the porous mass section may comprise binder particles in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 1 wt 5 wt 10 wt or 25 wt of the porous mass section to an upper limit of about 99 wt 95 wt 90 wt 75 wt 60 wt 50 wt 40 wt or 25 wt of the porous mass section and wherein the amount of binder particles can range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.

In some embodiments the porous mass sections may further comprise an active coating disposed on at least a portion of the active particles and binder particles. As used herein the term coating and the like does not imply any particular degree of coating on a surface. In particular the terms coat or coating do not imply 100 coverage by the coating on a surface. One of ordinary skill in the art should understand that the active coating should be included in an amount and applied via a method that minimal affects the efficacy of active particles. For example activated carbon may be especially sensitive and the choice of an active coating amount of an active coating and method of applying the active coating should be carefully considered.

Active coatings may in some embodiments be useful in reducing the concentration of contaminants in a smoke stream. Examples of active coatings may include but are not limited to triacetin malic acid potassium carbonate citric acid tartaric acid lactic acid ascorbic acid polyethyleneimine cyclodextrin sodium hydroxide sulphamic acid sodium sulphamate polyvinyl acetate carboxylated acrylate liquid amines vitamin E triethyl citrate acetyl triethyl citrate tributyl citrate acetyl tributyl citrate acetyl tri 2 ethylhexyl non ionic surfactants e.g. polyoxyethylene POE compounds POE 4 lauryl ether POE 20 sorbitan monolaurate POE 4 sorbitan monolaurate POE 6 sorbitol POE 20 C C Cphosphates and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the active coatings may be chosen to reduce the concentration of phenols in a smoke stream. Phenols are known to be significant contributors to the harshness and irritation of cigarette smoke. Without being limited by theory it is believed that by replacing a portion of a traditional cellulose acetate filter with a porous mass the total amount of carbonyl groups associated with the triacetin and the cellulose acetate in the cigarette filter is reduced and consequently the filtration efficacy for phenols is also reduced. Additionally incorporation of active coatings suitable for reducing phenols into one or more segments of a filter may provide for smoking device filters with similar or greater efficacy to phenol reduction. Examples of active coatings suitable for the reduction of phenols in a smoke stream may include but are not limited to triacetin e.g. triacetin triethyl citrate acetyl triethyl citrate tributyl citrate acetyl tributyl citrate acetyl tri 2 ethylhexyl non ionic surfactants e.g. polyoxyethylene POE compounds POE 4 lauryl ether POE 20 sorbitan monolaurate POE 4 sorbitan monolaurate POE 6 sorbitol POE 20 C C Cphosphates and the like and any combination thereof. Additionally cellulose acetate flake or filaments may in some instances be included in the porous mass to reduce phenols in the smoke stream.

In some embodiments active coatings may be included in porous masses described herein in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 0.5 1 2 3 6 or 10 by weight of the porous mass to an upper limit of about 15 13 10 or 8 by weight of the porous mass and wherein the amount may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompasses any subset therebetween.

Addition of an active coating may be performed after formation of the porous mass i.e. after mechanically binding the active particles and the binder particles. Application of the active coating may be by liquid injection dipping spraying super critical fluid deposition or the like. In some embodiments the porous masses may be dried after application of the active coating.

As described above the smoke filters described herein comprise at least one porous mass section and at least one filter section. In some embodiments the filter sections may comprise at least one of cellulose cellulosic derivatives cellulose ester tow cellulose acetate tow cellulose acetate tow with less than about 10 denier per filament cellulose acetate tow with about 10 denier per filament or greater random oriented acetates papers corrugated papers polypropylene polyethylene polyolefin tow polypropylene tow polyethylene terephthalate polybutylene terephthalate coarse powders carbon particles carbon fibers fibers glass beads zeolites molecular sieves and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the filter sections may further comprise active dopants. Active dopants may in some embodiments be useful in reducing the concentration of contaminants in a smoke stream. In some embodiments the active dopants may form a coating on at least a portion of another surface in the filter section e.g. papers and or may absorb into another structure in the filter section e.g. cellulose ester tow .

Examples of active dopants may include but are not limited to triacetin malic acid potassium carbonate citric acid tartaric acid lactic acid ascorbic acid polyethyleneimine cyclodextrin sodium hydroxide sulphamic acid sodium sulphamate polyvinyl acetate carboxylated acrylate vitamin E triethyl citrate acetyl triethyl citrate tributyl citrate acetyl tributyl citrate acetyl tri 2 ethylhexyl non ionic surfactants e.g. polyoxyethylene POE compounds POE 4 lauryl ether POE 20 sorbitan monolaurate POE 4 sorbitan monolaurate POE 6 sorbitol POE 20 C C Cphosphates and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the active dopants may be chosen to reduce the concentration of phenols from a smoke stream. Examples of active dopants may include but are not limited to triacetin triethyl citrate acetyl triethyl citrate tributyl citrate acetyl tributyl citrate acetyl tri 2 ethylhexyl non ionic surfactants e.g. polyoxyethylene POE compounds POE 4 lauryl ether POE 20 sorbitan monolaurate POE 4 sorbitan monolaurate POE 6 sorbitol POE 20 C C Cphosphates and the like and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments active dopants may be included in filter sections described herein in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 3 6 or 10 by weight of the unwrapped filter section to an upper limit of about 15 13 or 10 by weight of the unwrapped filter section and wherein the amount may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompasses any subset therebetween.

In some embodiments filter sections may further comprise active particles described herein e.g. for further reducing the concentration of contaminants in a smoke stream.

In some instances the active particles active coatings and active dopants in porous masses and or filter sections may individually be suitable for reducing the concentration of at least one of the following contaminants of a smoke stream acetaldehyde acetamide acetone acrolein acrylamide acrylonitrile aflatoxin B 1 4 aminobiphenyl 1 anninonaphthalene 2 aminonaphthalene ammonia ammonium salts anabasine anatabine O anisidine arsenic A C benz a anthracene benz b fluoroanthene benz j aceanthrylene benz k fluoroanthene benzene benzo b furan benzo a pyrene benzo c phenanthrene beryllium 1 3 butadiene butyraldehyde cadmium caffeic acid carbon monoxide catechol chlorinated dioxins furans chromium chrysene cobalt coumarin a cresol crotonaldehyde cyclopenta c d pyrene dibenz a h acridine dibenz a j acridine dibenz a h anthracene dibenzo c g carbazole dibenzo a e pyrene dibenzo a h pyrene dibenzo a i pyrene dibenzo a l pyrene 2 6 dimethylaniline ethyl carbamate urethane ethylbenzene ethylene oxide eugenol formaldehyde furan glu P 1 glu P 2 hydrazine hydrogen cyanide hydroquinone indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene IQ isoprene lead MeA C mercury methyl ethyl ketone 5 methylchrysene 4 methylnitrosamino 1 3 pyridyl 1 butanone NNK 4 methylnitrosamino 1 3 pyridyl 1 butanol NNAL naphthalene nickel nicotine nitrate nitric oxide a nitrogen oxide nitrite nitrobenzene nitromethane 2 nitropropane N nitrosoanabasine NAB N nitrosodiethanolamine NDELA N nitrosodiethylamine N nitrosodimethylamine NDMA N nitrosoethylmethylamine N nitrosomorpholine NMOR N nitrosonornicotine NNN N nitrosopiperidine NPIP N nitrosopyrrolidine NPYR N nitrososarcosine NSAR phenol PhIP polonium 210 radio isotope propionaldehyde propylene oxide pyridine quinoline resorcinol selenium styrene tar 2 toluidine toluene Trp P 1 Trp P 2 uranium 235 radio isotope uranium 238 radio isotope vinyl acetate vinyl chloride and any combination thereof. In some instances within a single filter the active particles active coatings and active dopants in porous masses and or filter sections may be for reducing the same or different smoke stream contaminants. In some embodiments the reduction of carbon monoxide in a smoke stream may be achieved with porous mass sections and or filter sections comprising iodine pentoxide phosphorous pentoxide manganese oxide copper oxide iron oxide molecular sieves aluminum oxide gold platinum and the like and any combination thereof. In some embodiments the reduction of phenols in a smoke stream may be achieved with porous mass sections and or filter sections comprising triacetin triethyl citrate acetyl triethyl citrate tributyl citrate acetyl tributyl citrate acetyl tri 2 ethylhexyl non ionic surfactants e.g. polyoxyethylene POE compounds POE 4 lauryl ether POE 20 sorbitan monolaurate POE 4 sorbitan monolaurate POE 6 sorbitol POE 20 C C Cphosphates cellulose acetate and the like and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the porous mass sections and filter sections may independently have features like a concentric filter design a paper wrapping a cavity a void chamber a baffled void chamber capsules channels and the like and any combination thereof.

In some embodiments the porous masses may comprise active particles in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 1 wt 5 wt 10 wt 25 wt 40 wt 50 wt 60 wt or 75 wt of the porous mass to an upper limit of about 99 wt 95 wt 90 wt or 75 wt of the porous mass and wherein the amount of active particles can range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween. In some embodiments the porous masses may comprise binder particles in an amount ranging from a lower limit of about 1 wt 5 wt 10 wt or 25 wt of the porous mass to an upper limit of about 99 wt 95 wt 90 wt 75 wt 60 wt 50 wt 40 wt or 25 wt of the porous mass and wherein the amount of binder particles can range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.

While the ratio of binder particle size to active particle size can include any iteration as dictated by the size ranges for each described herein specific size ratios may be advantageous for specific applications and or products. By way of nonlimiting example in smoking device filters the sizes of the active particles and binder particles should be such that the EPD allows for drawing fluids through the porous mass. In some embodiments the ratio of binder particle size to active particle size may range from about 10 1 to about 1 10 or more preferably range from about 1 1.5 to about 1 4.

In some embodiments porous masses may have a void volume in the range of about 40 to about 90 . In some embodiments porous masses may have a void volume of about 60 to about 90 . In some embodiments porous masses may have a void volume of about 60 to about 85 . Void volume is the free space left after accounting for the space taken by the active particles.

To determine void volume although not wishing to be limited by any particular theory it is believed that testing indicates that the final density of the mixture was driven almost entirely by the active particle thus the space occupied by the binder particles was not considered for this calculation. Thus void volume in this context is calculated based on the space remaining after accounting for the active particles. To determine void volume first the upper and lower diameters based on the mesh size were averaged for the active particles and then the volume was calculated assuming a spherical shape based on that averaged diameter using the density of the active material. Then the percentage void volume is calculated as follows 

When the filter sections comprise active dopants active particles and some of the features the EPD i.e. draw characteristics of the smoke filter may be changed. Advantageously the EPD of the porous mass sections described herein may be tailored by changing inter alia the binder particle size the active particle size and the like to compensate for the EPD change in the filter section. In some embodiments porous masses may have an active particle loading of at least about 1 mg mm 2 mg mm 3 mg mm 4 mg mm 5 mg mm 6 mg mm 7 mg mm 8 mg mm 9 mg mm 10 mg mm 11 mg mm 12 mg mm 13 mg mm 14 mg mm 15 mg mm 16 mg mm 17 mg mm 18 mg mm 19 mg mm 20 mg mm 21 mg mm 22 mg mm 23 mg mm 24 mg mm or 25 mg mm in combination with an EPD of less than about 20 mm of water or less per mm of length 19 mm of water or less per mm of length 18 mm of water or less per mm of length 17 mm of water or less per mm of length 16 mm of water or less per mm of length 15 mm of water or less per mm of length 14 mm of water or less per mm of length 13 mm of water or less per mm of length 12 mm of water or less per mm of length 11 mm of water or less per mm of length 10 mm of water or less per mm of length 9 mm of water or less per mm of length 8 mm of water or less per mm of length 7 mm of water or less per mm of length 6 mm of water or less per mm of length 5 mm of water or less per mm of length 4 mm of water or less per mm of length 3 mm of water or less per mm of length 2 mm of water or less per mm of length or 1 mm of water or less per mm of length and wherein the active particle loading and the EPD may independently range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.

By way of example in some embodiments porous masses may have an active particle loading of at least about 1 mg mm and an EPD of about 20 mm of water or less per mm of length. In other embodiments the porous mass may have an active particle loading of at least about 1 mg mm and an EPD of about 20 mm of water or less per mm of length wherein the active particle is not carbon. In other embodiments the porous mass may have an active particle comprising carbon with a loading of at least 6 mg mm in combination with an EPD of 10 mm of water or less per mm of length.

Further within the filter the length of the porous mass sections and the filter sections to achieve a desired smoke filter length and EPD. In some embodiments smoke filters described herein may have an EPD in ranging from a lower limit of about 0.10 mm of water per mm of length 1 mm of water per mm of length 2 mm of water per mm of length 3 mm of water per mm of length 4 mm of water per mm of length 5 mm of water per mm of length 6 mm of water per mm of length 7 mm of water per mm of length 8 mm of water per mm of length 9 mm of water per mm of length or 10 mm of water per mm of length to an upper limit of about 20 mm of water per mm of length 19 mm of water per mm of length 18 mm of water per mm of length 17 mm of water per mm of length 16 mm of water per mm of length 15 mm of water per mm of length 14 mm of water per mm of length 13 mm of water per mm of length 12 mm of water per mm of length 11 mm of water per mm of length 10 mm of water per mm of length 9 mm of water per mm of length 8 mm of water per mm of length 7 mm of water per mm of length 6 mm of water per mm of length or 5 mm of water per mm of length wherein the EPD may range from any lower limit to any upper limit and encompass any subset therebetween.

In some embodiments the filter may have a structure with a first other filter segment proximal to the mouth end of the smoking device. In some embodiments the filter may comprise two or more sections in any desired order e.g. in order a first filter section e.g. cellulose acetate tow a porous mass and a second filter section e.g. cellulose acetate tow or in order a first filter section e.g. cellulose acetate tow a first porous mass e.g. comprising activated carbon a second porous mass e.g. comprising phenol and or carbon monoxide reducing active particles and or active coatings and a second filter section e.g. cellulose acetate tow comprising phenol and or carbon monoxide reducing active particles and or active dopants .
