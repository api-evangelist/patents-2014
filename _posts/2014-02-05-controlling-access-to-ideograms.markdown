title: Controlling access to ideograms
abstract: Particular embodiments of a method comprise providing one or more ideograms (e.g., written characters, symbols or images that represent an idea or thing) for insertion into a message. A request may be received from a user for a restricted one of the ideograms. A determination may be made as to whether the user is authorized to access the restricted ideogram. This determination may be based on whether the user is a member of a group of authorized users, whether an attribute of the user meets a restriction requirement, or whether the request comprises an authorization code or token. If the user is authorized to access the restricted ideogram, then the restricted ideogram may be displayed to the user in association with the message. Otherwise, a restricted-content response may be generated.

A social networking system which may include a social networking website may enable its users such as persons or organizations to interact with it and with each other through it. The social networking system may with input from a user create and store in the social networking system a user profile associated with the user. The user profile may include demographic information communication channel information and information on personal interests of the user. The social networking system may also with input from a user create and store a record of relationships of the user with other users of the social networking system as well as provide services e.g. wall posts photo sharing event organization messaging games or advertisements to facilitate social interaction between or among users.

The social networking system may send over one or more networks content or messages related to its services to a mobile or other computing device of a user. A user may also install software applications on a mobile or other computing device of the user for accessing a user profile of the user and other data within the social networking system. The social networking system may generate a personalized set of content objects to display to a user such as a newsfeed of aggregated stories of other users connected to the user.

Particular embodiments described in this disclosure relate to the use of ideograms in a text message input by an authoring user on a computing device. The author may input text on a mobile device to be sent to other users through a number of methods including for example a messaging platform or a social networking system. The ideograms will be sent to other users along with the message and the receiving users will be able to view the ideogram in conjunction with the text message in the same relative layout as the author s created message.

In one particular embodiment one or more of the ideograms that may be placed in a message may have restrictions on use or viewing. A user of the messaging platform or social networking system may need to be authorized in order to use the ideogram in a message sent by that user or to view the ideogram in messages sent by other users. User authorization may be set by any of multiple methods for example by membership in a particular group certain attributes of the user s profile or by purchasing access to a sticker pack containing the restricted ideogram. If an unauthorized user attempts to use or view the restricted ideogram the user may be presented instead with a warning message that he or she is unable to use or view the ideogram. The warning message may further inform the unauthorized user how he or she may gain authorization.

In another particular embodiment the author of a message may input text that can be analyzed by the computing device for the sentiment contained within the text. Sentiment analysis conducted on at least a portion of the input text may result in the identification of one or more sentiments. One or more ideograms may then be suggested to the author that can substitute or supplement the analyzed text. The suggestion of ideograms may be user specific by the use of that individual author s ideogram usage history or personal ideogram dictionary. The suggestion may also be based on the ideogram usage history of others connected to the user such as users sharing a common demographic attribute with the author or directed connected to the author in a social network.

In another particular embodiment expression analysis may be performed on the subject s of a captured image. The expression analysis may result in one or more expressions displayed by the subjects of the captured image. One or more ideograms that can be substituted for the captured image may be suggested. The suggestion of ideograms may be user specific by the use of that individual author s ideogram usage history or personal ideogram dictionary. The suggestion may also be based on the ideogram usage history of others connected to the user such as users sharing a common demographic attribute with the author or directed connected to the author in a social network.

Particular embodiments feature the use of ideograms within visual digital messages. Ideograms may be written characters symbols or images that represent an idea or thing without using letters or words examples may be the gender symbols and or images of a bunny with a smiling or angry expression. Ideograms may be inserted into text using digital images presented to an author of the text in a sticker pack where a group of ideograms sharing a common theme or style may be displayed in a user interface enabling the author to select ideograms to be inserted into the text. Alternatively ideograms may be inserted through standards like Unicode which convert specific text strings to ideograms. For example typing in the characters into an application that recognizes Unicode ideograms will convert those characters into the ideogram .

Messages may be sent between two computing devices using any of a number of messaging platforms including but not limited to e mail Short Messages Service SMS or instant message IM . Messages may also be broadcast by an author to one or more recipients e.g. through posting a message or status update on a social networking system or by posting a message on a platform such as Twitter. An ideogram may be inserted into a message and displayed within the image at any of a number of points in time they may be displayed when the author types in the ideogram into the message when the author chooses to send the finished message on the receiving device as the message is being received or when the recipient opens the message to read the message.

When the recipient selects a particular ideogram A from the category tab A the list of status updates in the news feed may be refreshed to contain only messages containing the particular ideogram selected. For example in the recipient has selected the tab A containing an ideogram of a smiling face. The list of status updates below has filtered out messages that do not contain the same ideogram and has listed only messages with the same ideogram.

The selection of a particular ideogram may be configured to show messages or status updates that contain only that particular ideogram or messages or status updates that can contain other status updates so long as the selected ideogram is also included. For example status updates A and B both display the selected ideogram of a smiling face but also contain other ideograms. A particular embodiment may filter those status updates out of the list as well and only list status update D which contains only the selected ideogram. In another embodiment the news feed may include status updates A and B in addition to D.

At step ideograms may be selected for insertion into a message or as a standalone message. Examples of messages are a text message using a messaging platform to be sent to one or more recipients or a posted status update of the author s profile on a social networking system. The example method of will embody a messaging platform.

At step the messaging platform determines whether the ideogram selected by the author is restricted. If the author selects an ideogram with no restrictions the ideogram may be inserted into the message as soon as the author selects it step . Upon selection of an ideogram with restricted access a request for authorization to access the restricted ideogram may be sent by the author s device.

At step the messaging platform compares the author s user profile to a database of authorized users. An example method of this step may be for a messaging platform on a social networking system to connect to a server of the social networking system to access a centralized database. Another example method may be for the authorization database to be stored locally on the author s computing device.

At step the messaging platform may determine whether the author is authorized to access the restricted ideogram. Determination of authorization may be based on whether the request for access comprises an authorization code or token e.g. a cookie or SSL certificate.

At step if the author is not authorized the messaging platform may prevent the ideogram from being inserted and may display a warning message informing the author that the ideogram is restricted. The author may then choose to abandon insertion of the ideogram or find a way to gain authorization e.g. by purchasing the sticker pack containing the restricted ideogram .

At step if the author is an authorized user of the ideogram the restricted ideogram may be displayed to the author. The messaging platform may additionally determine if the author has determined the recipients who will view this message. The author may choose as recipients one or several individuals a specific group of individuals or may be sending the message to a wider group e.g. a status update that is viewable by any direct connections in a social network.

At step if the author has selected one or more recipients the messaging platform may determine if the recipients also are authorized users of the restricted ideogram. Determination of authorization for the recipients may be conducted similarly to determination of authorization for the author as discussed in step .

At step if one or more of the selected recipients are not authorized the messaging platform may display a warning to the author that the ideogram is restricted and that certain recipients may not be able to view the ideogram. The author may then have the option of deleting the ideogram from the message or overriding the warning and proceeding with the message with the restricted ideogram.

At step if all of the selected recipients are authorized then the messaging platform may not display a warning and the ideogram will be inserted into the message. The ideogram may be placed at any number of locations within the body of the message for example at the beginning of the text the end or in the middle of the text. The text content of the message may wrap around the ideogram so that both the text and ideogram are easily viewable.

At step after the author has completed the message he or she may choose to send out the message to the intended one or more recipients. The messaging platform will send the message to the recipient devices and the recipients will be able to view the message using a compatible messaging system.

At step the messaging platforms on the recipient devices may determine again if the particular recipient is an authorized user of the ideogram. This additional authorization check is used in case the author overrode the restricted content response when the ideogram was inserted into the message. Determination of authorization may be conducted in the same fashion as described in steps and .

At step if the recipient is not authorized to view the ideogram then the recipient may be able to view the message without the restricted ideogram i.e. the ideogram will be deleted or redacted from the message. The messaging platform or social network interface may inform the unauthorized recipient of the presence of a restricted ideogram. The recipient may then be presented with potential options for gaining authorization to that ideogram e.g. by purchasing a sticker pack or by joining a certain group.

At step if the recipients are authorized users of the restricted ideogram they may view the message exactly as the author sent it i.e. with the restricted ideograms.

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

In the author has attempted to send a message containing a restricted ideogram to a device belonging to a recipient who is not an authorized user. While the author may be able to input the restricted ideogram into the message when the message is sent to the recipient the ideogram may have been deleted from the received message H. The recipient may see a message H containing the rest of the sent message without the restricted ideogram .

In particular embodiments restrictions may serve to block the author from sending particular ideograms or any ideograms at all to a designated recipient. Restrictions may be based on any factors including but not limited to attributes of the author and or the recipient e.g. age or gender the type of relationship between the author and the recipient e.g. manager employee or mother son time of day location. Such restrictions may be configured by the author by the recipient by an entity in control of licensing usage rights to the ideogram or by a site system moderator.

At step the author may input a text message into a messaging platform. Some text messages may be devoid of any particular attached sentiment for example a reply of yes. Many other text messages may contain one or more sentiments in the message.

At step the messaging platform may select at least a part of the input text message. As discussed in step above for some messages the messaging platform may determine that no part of the text can be selected for analysis. If the messaging platform does select at least a portion of the input message the messaging platform may proceed to the next step.

At step the messaging platform may conduct sentiment analysis on the selected text. Particular embodiments may incorporate any methodology of performing sentiment analysis upon a word phrase or other body of text which may or may not include ideograms including by way of example and not limitation polarity classification sentiment classification according to a pre defined set of emotional states subjectivity objectivity identification or feature aspect based sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis may be based upon not just words punctuation and ideogram usage but also other indicia such as by way of example and not limitation 1 analysis of audio including a voice to detect volume tone and or inflection 2 analysis of video to perform facial gesture recognition and emotion detection and or 3 analysis of biometric sensor data to detect pulse temperature skin conductance pressure and or speed while typing clicking on a touchscreen and or pupil constriction dilation. At step a messaging platform may identify one or more sentiments to be associated with the input text.

At step the messaging platform may then compare the available ideograms to the identified one or more sentiments to suggest at least one ideogram to the author of the input message. Factors incorporated into the sentiment analysis may include by way of example and not limitation social networking information associated with the author of the message information associated with the social networking connection between the author and one or more recipients of the message membership of the author or recipient in a group authorized to use a restricted ideogram an ideogram usage history for the author of the message or an ideogram usage history for other users of the social network system. In particular embodiments methods for performing sentiment analysis may also include not just such information associated with the author or recipient s of a message but also similar information associated with a target of a message a person or concept mentioned in the message. In one embodiment the messaging platform may have indexed records in a database associating certain ideograms to a sentiment. The indexed records may be user specific each author may have different indices for various sentiments and ideograms. Upon identification of at least one sentiment the messaging platform may display the ideograms that are contained in the indexed record for that sentiment and present them to the author for selection.

Ideogram usage history for the author may be determined by considering the results of previous suggestions to the author that is if the author accepted a suggested ideogram in a similar situation manually selected a different ideogram or rejected the suggestion to include an ideogram. Ideogram usage history may be further categorized based on additional factors. For example ideogram usage histories may be created for the author at different timeslots in the day e.g. a history for messages sent between 10 pm and 3 am for messages sent within a calendar range e.g. a history of ideograms sent in the past year for messages sent to particular recipients for the current location of the author or the current location of the identified recipient. These factors and others may be used in sentiment analysis to generate different suggestions for the author at different times locations or for different recipients.

The ideogram usage history for other users in a social networking system may be further categorized. Additional factors to create subsets of users may include users matching the author s demographic or location profile users within a certain degree of separation from the author in the social network graph users who have previously or recently communicated with the author users who have previously or recently communicated frequently with the author or users associated to a certain group which the author has designated or to which the author is also associated.

The indexed records of ideogram associations to a sentiment may be created by the messaging platform provider or a social network server. An ideogram may be associated with one or more sentiments and conversely a sentiment may be associated with one or more ideograms. The determination of associating an ideogram with a sentiment as described above may be quantified with a score of how well an ideogram is associated with a sentiment based on the factors discussed above. The scores may be defined as a division between two or more sentiments e.g. a particular ideogram may be scored as 30 angry 70 sad.

At step the messaging platform may generate a list of ideograms to suggest to the author at step sorted by the score of each ideogram or by only displaying ideograms that are above a certain score. If the scores are a percentage split between two or more sentiments the messaging platform may pick ideograms with the sentiment score within a certain tolerance threshold e.g. by picking an ideogram with a score within 10 of the desired score for that sentiment. Furthermore the messaging system may exclude ideograms that meet the predetermined score requirement but is also associated with a second sentiment that the messaging platform or author has determined undesirable to be mixed with the present sentiment.

At step the scores may be updated through usage statistics collected by the messaging platform. For example if a particular ideogram is selected a majority of the time for a particular sentiment by authors in a particular group or social network then the messaging platform may score that ideogram higher in its association with the sentiment and present it first in the list of suggestions to future authors with the same sentiment. If the authors are manually picking an ideogram not currently on the list of suggested ideograms the messaging platform may update the list to include the new ideogram. Conversely if an ideogram is not popular with authors for a particular sentiment that ideogram may be placed farther down the list of suggestions or dropped altogether from the suggestions.

At step ideograms may also be associated with metadata pertaining to that particular ideogram. Metadata to be associated with ideograms may include descriptive text for the ideogram text input by the author for which the ideogram was substituted or added or other data that is associated with the author s use of that particular ideogram. The messaging platform may create the indexed records for sentiments and ideograms by including the metadata associated with each ideogram when generating the scores for each sentiment ideogram association.

At step the author will select one or more of the ideograms to be inserted into the message at step substituting the analyzed text or being inserted into the text message without any deletions to the text.

Particular embodiments may repeat one or more steps of the method of where appropriate. Although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular steps of the method of as occurring in a particular order this disclosure contemplates any suitable steps of the method of occurring in any suitable order. Moreover although this disclosure describes and illustrates particular components devices or systems carrying out particular steps of the method of this disclosure contemplates any suitable combination of any suitable components devices or systems carrying out any suitable steps of the method of .

The recipient or another user may interact with the displayed ideogram further. For example the recipient may perform a double tap tap and hold or other interaction with the ideogram which may cause the messaging platform or social network interface to present options such as viewing the popularity of the ideogram in the social network refreshing a newsfeed to show status updates utilizing that ideogram or informing the recipient how he or she may gain authorization to use it.

At step a camera application on the computing device may capture an image using an associated camera wherein one or more people are included. The associated camera may be integrated into the computing device as shown in i.e. camera or it may be communicably connected to the computing device e.g. a local webcam connected by a USB cable or a remote security camera connected via a network connection . depicts an example embodiment of a mobile device with a front facing camera adjacent to a front display . In such a device the camera application may utilize the front facing camera to show the user a self portrait view where the user may easily see the image being captured on the front display of the mobile device. This captured image may be a single image a set of images e.g. taken using a high speed camera or a video clip or stream. The captured image may be stored on mobile device streamed from mobile device uploaded to a server or inserted into a message to be sent to one or more recipients. In other embodiments the image may be captured while the camera displays a live feed on the display of mobile device i.e. without taking a photo or shooting a video or immediately prior to taking a photo or shooting a video or utilized for data extraction and or further analysis e.g. calculating facial geometry in order to perform facial recognition or expression analysis .

At steps the computing device or messaging platform may analyze the captured image to classify one or more expressions displayed on the face of one or more people shown in the captured image. Analysis of the captured image may take place while the image is being captured or afterwards i.e. analysis of a previously captured image . The expression analysis of the captured image may be conducted by any application operable on the computing device such as the messaging platform the camera application a social networking system or another application. The application may additionally be associated with a database containing benchmark metrics for all available expressions as will be discussed below.

At step the analysis of the faces displayed in the captured image may be conducted by first detecting the presence of one or more faces in the captured image. Facial detection in captured images is a method previously described in the art.

At step the analysis application may then generate a characterization of features of the face. For example the application may extract certain features or structures of the face by taking the dimensions or relative positions of certain features or structures. The analysis could also factor in skin texture analysis or a three dimensional facial recognition analysis. The methods for facial recognition where the various dimensions and characteristics of facial features and structures are used to identify an individual are well known in the art. The analysis may be configured to only proceed with the next step if the identified face is that of the author or another person for whom the application has benchmark metrics for example another user on a social networking system .

The analysis of the face shown in the captured image may then generate quantified or qualified metrics or attributes of features such as for example shape dimensions texture luminance or color. For example the analysis may generate metrics representing that the depicted eyes are at a certain angle and relative width that the skin of the depicted face is pale or flushed or that the depicted mouth is upturned or downturned. 

At step the generated metrics may then be compared to benchmark metrics stored in the database within the analysis application. Benchmark metrics may be defined as the numerical or comparative metrics that correspond to a particular expression. The application may compare the generated metrics for the captured image with the benchmark metrics corresponding to all the expressions stored by the application. The application may then select one or more expressions that are associated with benchmark metrics that correspond closely to the generated metrics and characterize the face in the captured image as having those one or more expressions. Benchmark metrics may be associated with each individual user where each identified user is associated with a different set of benchmark metrics. This means that two different users could have very similar generated metrics but have different expressions associated with the generated metrics due to the differences in the benchmark metrics used.

The benchmark metrics may be generated by one of several methods. For example the benchmark metrics may be user specific. In an example embodiment the user may be asked at a prior time to display a particular expression or no expression and the device may capture images of the user for each displayed expression. The application may analyze these prior images to generate metrics for each image.

At step the application may then use the metrics generated for each image as the benchmark metrics for the expression corresponding to that image. Benchmarks may also be created based on a group of subjects for example by a sampling of images of a population of users associated with a particular demographic profile by a sampling of images of one or more users identified as family members of the user or by a sampling of images of users associated with the user with respect to a social network.

At step the ideograms that are usable by the messaging platform may be associated with match scores that gives each ideogram a score for a particular expression. An ideogram may be assigned match scores to one or more expressions and an expression may be associated with one or more match scores each corresponding to an ideogram. Once the messaging platform has identified a particular expression displayed by a subject in the analyzed photo the platform may select one or more ideograms that are matched within a certain tolerance level for example a match score above 60 of the maximum possible score.

The match scores associating an ideogram to a particular expression may be calculated using a variety of factors. A generalized match score could be assigned using an ideogram dictionary where the messaging platform provider or another third party has assigned match scores to each ideogram. The dictionary may have preset match scores for each ideogram that may be subsequently edited by the user. The messaging platform may also take into consideration the ideogram usage history of the author. For example if the author previously took an image of himself or herself that the expression analysis characterized as sad and the author selected a pouty ideogram then the pouty ideogram may have its match score increased for sad and the next time the author takes a self portrait that is characterized as sad the pouty ideogram will be presented higher on the presented list of ideograms. Both the ideogram dictionary and ideogram usage history may be associated only with the individual user and may be updated only based on the user s interactions with the ideogram match scores.

Alternatively the ideogram dictionary and usage history could be associated with one or more social networking connections of the user associated with one or more users sharing common attributes with the user e.g. demographics common interests etc. or based on general statistics regarding trending ideograms in a social networking system.

At step the messaging platform may then present the one or more selected ideograms to the author of the message for example in a list or a discrete sticker pack category alongside other sticker pack categories discussed above. depicts the mobile device with a front facing camera and captured image of the author. The messaging platform using captured image has conducted an expression analysis of the captured image characterized an expression for the author s face in the captured image and presented the author with a list of ideograms that have high match scores to that expression. The list or sticker pack of ideograms may be arranged with the ideograms having the highest match scores first down to the lowest scoring ideograms that still exceed the tolerance threshold. In some embodiments the above described steps e.g. image capture expression analysis and ideogram matching may be performed prior to taking a photo or video.

At step upon presentation of the one or more suggested ideograms the author may select one or more of the ideograms and at step insert the selected one or more ideograms into a message to be sent to one or more recipients. Alternatively the author may be presented with a user interface to post the selected ideograms for annotation of another content item on a messaging platform or social network. A content item may include text image video audio or other content posted by the user another user or a third party. For example if another user has posted a photograph on a social network instead of liking the photograph the author may annotate the photograph with a selected ideogram that is presented to the author using expression analysis. The author may take a self portrait of himself or herself reacting to the posted photograph and then select one or more ideograms that are presented to the author after expression analysis.

In particular embodiments a concept node may represent a third party webpage or resource hosted by a third party system . The third party webpage or resource may include among other elements content a selectable or other icon or other inter actable object which may be implemented for example in JavaScript AJAX or PHP codes representing an action or activity. As an example and not by way of limitation a third party webpage may include a selectable icon such as like check in eat recommend or another suitable action or activity. A user viewing the third party webpage may perform an action by selecting one of the icons e.g. eat causing a client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s action. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge e.g. an eat edge between a user node corresponding to the user and a concept node corresponding to the third party webpage or resource and store edge in one or more data stores.

In particular embodiments a pair of nodes in social graph may be connected to each other by one or more edges . An edge connecting a pair of nodes may represent a relationship between the pair of nodes. In particular embodiments an edge may include or represent one or more data objects or attributes corresponding to the relationship between a pair of nodes. As an example and not by way of limitation a first user may indicate that a second user is a friend of the first user. In response to this indication social networking system may send a friend request to the second user. If the second user confirms the friend request social networking system may create an edge connecting the first user s user node to the second user s user node in social graph and store edge as social graph information in one or more of data stores . In the example of social graph includes an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user A and user B and an edge indicating a friend relation between user nodes of user C and user B. Although this disclosure describes or illustrates particular edges with particular attributes connecting particular user nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes . As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent a friendship family relationship business or employment relationship fan relationship follower relationship visitor relationship subscriber relationship superior subordinate relationship reciprocal relationship non reciprocal relationship another suitable type of relationship or two or more such relationships. Moreover although this disclosure generally describes nodes as being connected this disclosure also describes users or concepts as being connected. Herein references to users or concepts being connected may where appropriate refer to the nodes corresponding to those users or concepts being connected in social graph by one or more edges .

In particular embodiments an edge between a user node and a concept node may represent a particular action or activity performed by a user associated with user node toward a concept associated with a concept node . As an example and not by way of limitation as illustrated in a user may like attended played listened cooked worked at or watched a concept each of which may correspond to a edge type or subtype. A concept profile page corresponding to a concept node may include for example a selectable check in icon such as for example a clickable check in icon or a selectable add to favorites icon. Similarly after a user clicks these icons social networking system may create a favorite edge or a check in edge in response to a user s action corresponding to a respective action. As another example and not by way of limitation a user user C may listen to a particular song Ramble On using a particular application SPOTIFY which is an online music application . In this case social networking system may create a listened edge and a used edge as illustrated in between user nodes corresponding to the user and concept nodes corresponding to the song and application to indicate that the user listened to the song and used the application. Moreover social networking system may create a played edge as illustrated in between concept nodes corresponding to the song and the application to indicate that the particular song was played by the particular application. In this case played edge corresponds to an action performed by an external application SPOTIFY on an external audio file the song Imagine . Although this disclosure describes particular edges with particular attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes this disclosure contemplates any suitable edges with any suitable attributes connecting user nodes and concept nodes . Moreover although this disclosure describes edges between a user node and a concept node representing a single relationship this disclosure contemplates edges between a user node and a concept node representing one or more relationships. As an example and not by way of limitation an edge may represent both that a user likes and has used at a particular concept. Alternatively another edge may represent each type of relationship or multiples of a single relationship between a user node and a concept node as illustrated in between user node for user E and concept node for SPOTIFY .

In particular embodiments social networking system may create an edge between a user node and a concept node in social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation a user viewing a concept profile page such as for example by using a web browser or a special purpose application hosted by the user s client system may indicate that he or she likes the concept represented by the concept node by clicking or selecting a Like icon which may cause the user s client system to send to social networking system a message indicating the user s liking of the concept associated with the concept profile page. In response to the message social networking system may create an edge between user node associated with the user and concept node as illustrated by like edge between the user and concept node . In particular embodiments social networking system may store an edge in one or more data stores. In particular embodiments an edge may be automatically formed by social networking system in response to a particular user action. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user uploads a picture watches a movie or listens to a song an edge may be formed between user node corresponding to the first user and concept nodes corresponding to those concepts.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be text which may be HTML linked one or more images which may be HTML linked one or more videos audio one or more ADOBE FLASH files a suitable combination of these or any other suitable advertisement in any suitable digital format presented on one or more webpages in one or more e mails or in connection with search results requested by a user. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be one or more sponsored stories e.g. a news feed or ticker item on social networking system . A sponsored story may be a social action by a user such as liking a page liking or commenting on a post on a page RSVPing to an event associated with a page voting on a question posted on a page checking in to a place using an application or playing a game or liking or sharing a website that an advertiser promotes for example by having the social action presented within a pre determined area of a profile page of a user or other page presented with additional information associated with the advertiser bumped up or otherwise highlighted within news feeds or tickers of other users or otherwise promoted. The advertiser may pay to have the social action promoted. As an example and not by way of limitation advertisements may be included among the search results of a search results page where sponsored content is promoted over non sponsored content.

In particular embodiments an advertisement may be requested for display within social networking system webpages third party webpages or other pages. An advertisement may be displayed in a dedicated portion of a page such as in a banner area at the top of the page in a column at the side of the page in a GUI of the page in a pop up window in a drop down menu in an input field of the page over the top of content of the page or elsewhere with respect to the page. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may be displayed within an application. An advertisement may be displayed within dedicated pages requiring the user to interact with or watch the advertisement before the user may access a page or utilize an application. The user may for example view the advertisement through a web browser.

A user may interact with an advertisement in any suitable manner. The user may click or otherwise select the advertisement. By selecting the advertisement the user may be directed to or a browser or other application being used by the user a page associated with the advertisement. At the page associated with the advertisement the user may take additional actions such as purchasing a product or service associated with the advertisement receiving information associated with the advertisement or subscribing to a newsletter associated with the advertisement. An advertisement with audio or video may be played by selecting a component of the advertisement like a play button . Alternatively by selecting the advertisement social networking system may execute or modify a particular action of the user.

An advertisement may also include social networking system functionality that a user may interact with. As an example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may enable a user to like or otherwise endorse the advertisement by selecting an icon or link associated with endorsement. As another example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may enable a user to search e.g. by executing a query for content related to the advertiser. Similarly a user may share the advertisement with another user e.g. through social networking system or RSVP e.g. through social networking system to an event associated with the advertisement. In addition or as an alternative an advertisement may include social networking system context directed to the user. As an example and not by way of limitation an advertisement may display information about a friend of the user within social networking system who has taken an action associated with the subject matter of the advertisement.

In particular embodiments social networking system may determine the social graph affinity which may be referred to herein as affinity of various social graph entities for each other. Affinity may represent the strength of a relationship or level of interest between particular objects associated with the online social network such as users concepts content actions advertisements other objects associated with the online social network or any suitable combination thereof. Affinity may also be determined with respect to objects associated with third party systems or other suitable systems. An overall affinity for a social graph entity for each user subject matter or type of content may be established. The overall affinity may change based on continued monitoring of the actions or relationships associated with the social graph entity. Although this disclosure describes determining particular affinities in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates determining any suitable affinities in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may measure or quantify social graph affinity using an affinity coefficient which may be referred to herein as coefficient . The coefficient may represent or quantify the strength of a relationship between particular objects associated with the online social network. The coefficient may also represent a probability or function that measures a predicted probability that a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. In this way a user s future actions may be predicted based on the user s prior actions where the coefficient may be calculated at least in part a the history of the user s actions. Coefficients may be used to predict any number of actions which may be within or outside of the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation these actions may include various types of communications such as sending messages posting content or commenting on content various types of a observation actions such as accessing or viewing profile pages media or other suitable content various types of coincidence information about two or more social graph entities such as being in the same group tagged in the same photograph checked in at the same location or attending the same event or other suitable actions. Although this disclosure describes measuring affinity in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates measuring affinity in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may use a variety of factors to calculate a coefficient. These factors may include for example user actions types of relationships between objects location information other suitable factors or any combination thereof. In particular embodiments different factors may be weighted differently when calculating the coefficient. The weights for each factor may be static or the weights may change according to for example the user the type of relationship the type of action the user s location and so forth. Ratings for the factors may be combined according to their weights to determine an overall coefficient for the user. As an example and not by way of limitation particular user actions may be assigned both a rating and a weight while a relationship associated with the particular user action is assigned a rating and a correlating weight e.g. so the weights total 100 . To calculate the coefficient of a user towards a particular object the rating assigned to the user s actions may comprise for example 60 of the overall coefficient while the relationship between the user and the object may comprise 40 of the overall coefficient. In particular embodiments the social networking system may consider a variety of variables when determining weights for various factors used to calculate a coefficient such as for example the time since information was accessed decay factors frequency of access relationship to information or relationship to the object about which information was accessed relationship to social graph entities connected to the object short or long term averages of user actions user feedback other suitable variables or any combination thereof. As an example and not by way of limitation a coefficient may include a decay factor that causes the strength of the signal provided by particular actions to decay with time such that more recent actions are more relevant when calculating the coefficient. The ratings and weights may be continuously updated based on continued tracking of the actions upon which the coefficient is based. Any type of process or algorithm may be employed for assigning combining averaging and so forth the ratings for each factor and the weights assigned to the factors. In particular embodiments social networking system may determine coefficients using machine learning algorithms trained on historical actions and past user responses or data farmed from users by exposing them to various options and measuring responses. Although this disclosure describes calculating coefficients in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates calculating coefficients in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on a user s actions. Social networking system may monitor such actions on the online social network on a third party system on other suitable systems or any combination thereof. Any suitable type of user actions may be tracked or monitored. Typical user actions include viewing profile pages creating or posting content interacting with content joining groups listing and confirming attendance at events checking in at locations liking particular pages creating pages and performing other tasks that facilitate social action. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the user s actions with particular types of content. The content may be associated with the online social network a third party system or another suitable system. The content may include users profile pages posts news stories headlines instant messages chat room conversations emails advertisements pictures video music other suitable objects or any combination thereof. Social networking system may analyze a user s actions to determine whether one or more of the actions indicate an affinity for subject matter content other users and so forth. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user may make frequently posts content related to coffee or variants thereof social networking system may determine the user has a high coefficient with respect to the concept coffee . Particular actions or types of actions may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than other actions which may affect the overall calculated coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user emails a second user the weight or the rating for the action may be higher than if the first user simply views the user profile page for the second user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on the type of relationship between particular objects. Referencing the social graph social networking system may analyze the number and or type of edges connecting particular user nodes and concept nodes when calculating a coefficient. As an example and not by way of limitation user nodes that are connected by a spouse type edge representing that the two users are married may be assigned a higher coefficient than a user nodes that are connected by a friend type edge. In other words depending upon the weights assigned to the actions and relationships for the particular user the overall affinity may be determined to be higher for content about the user s spouse than for content about the user s friend. In particular embodiments the relationships a user has with another object may affect the weights and or the ratings of the user s actions with respect to calculating the coefficient for that object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is tagged in first photo but merely likes a second photo social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient with respect to the first photo than the second photo because having a tagged in type relationship with content may be assigned a higher weight and or rating than having a like type relationship with content. In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient for a first user based on the relationship one or more second users have with a particular object. In other words the connections and coefficients other users have with an object may affect the first user s coefficient for the object. As an example and not by way of limitation if a first user is connected to or has a high coefficient for one or more second users and those second users are connected to or have a high coefficient for a particular object social networking system may determine that the first user should also have a relatively high coefficient for the particular object. In particular embodiments the coefficient may be based on the degree of separation between particular objects. The lower coefficient may represent the decreasing likelihood that the first user will share an interest in content objects of the user that is indirectly connected to the first user in the social graph . As an example and not by way of limitation social graph entities that are closer in the social graph i.e. fewer degrees of separation may have a higher coefficient than entities that are further apart in the social graph .

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient based on location information. Objects that are geographically closer to each other may be considered to be more related or of more interest to each other than more distant objects. In particular embodiments the coefficient of a user towards a particular object may be based on the proximity of the object s location to a current location associated with the user or the location of a client system of the user . A first user may be more interested in other users or concepts that are closer to the first user. As an example and not by way of limitation if a user is one mile from an airport and two miles from a gas station social networking system may determine that the user has a higher coefficient for the airport than the gas station based on the proximity of the airport to the user.

In particular embodiments social networking system may perform particular actions with respect to a user based on coefficient information. Coefficients may be used to predict whether a user will perform a particular action based on the user s interest in the action. A coefficient may be used when generating or presenting any type of objects to a user such as advertisements search results news stories media messages notifications or other suitable objects. The coefficient may also be utilized to rank and order such objects as appropriate. In this way social networking system may provide information that is relevant to user s interests and current circumstances increasing the likelihood that they will find such information of interest. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate content based on coefficient information. Content objects may be provided or selected based on coefficients specific to a user. As an example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate media for the user where the user may be presented with media for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the media object. As another example and not by way of limitation the coefficient may be used to generate advertisements for the user where the user may be presented with advertisements for which the user has a high overall coefficient with respect to the advertised object. In particular embodiments social networking system may generate search results based on coefficient information. Search results for a particular user may be scored or ranked based on the coefficient associated with the search results with respect to the querying user. As an example and not by way of limitation search results corresponding to objects with higher coefficients may be ranked higher on a search results page than results corresponding to objects having lower coefficients.

In particular embodiments social networking system may calculate a coefficient in response to a request for a coefficient from a particular system or process. To predict the likely actions a user may take or may be the subject of in a given situation any process may request a calculated coefficient for a user. The request may also include a set of weights to use for various factors used to calculate the coefficient. This request may come from a process running on the online social network from a third party system e.g. via an API or other communication channel or from another suitable system. In response to the request social networking system may calculate the coefficient or access the coefficient information if it has previously been calculated and stored . In particular embodiments social networking system may measure an affinity with respect to a particular process. Different processes both internal and external to the online social network may request a coefficient for a particular object or set of objects. Social networking system may provide a measure of affinity that is relevant to the particular process that requested the measure of affinity. In this way each process receives a measure of affinity that is tailored for the different context in which the process will use the measure of affinity.

In connection with social graph affinity and affinity coefficients particular embodiments may utilize one or more systems components elements functions methods operations or steps disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 503 093 filed 11 Aug. 2006 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 977 027 filed 22 Dec. 2010 U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 978 265 filed 23 Dec. 2010 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 632 869 field 1 Oct. 2012 each of which is incorporated by reference.

In particular embodiments one or more of the content objects of the online social network may be associated with a privacy setting. The privacy settings or access settings for an object may be stored in any suitable manner such as for example in association with the object in an index on an authorization server in another suitable manner or any combination thereof. A privacy setting of an object may specify how the object or particular information associated with an object can be accessed e.g. viewed or shared using the online social network. Where the privacy settings for an object allow a particular user to access that object the object may be described as being visible with respect to that user. As an example and not by way of limitation a user of the online social network may specify privacy settings for a user profile page identify a set of users that may access the work experience information on the user profile page thus excluding other users from accessing the information. In particular embodiments the privacy settings may specify a blocked list of users that should not be allowed to access certain information associated with the object. In other words the blocked list may specify one or more users or entities for which an object is not visible. As an example and not by way of limitation a user may specify a set of users that may not access photos albums associated with the user thus excluding those users from accessing the photo albums while also possibly allowing certain users not within the set of users to access the photo albums . In particular embodiments privacy settings may be associated with particular social graph elements. Privacy settings of a social graph element such as a node or an edge may specify how the social graph element information associated with the social graph element or content objects associated with the social graph element can be accessed using the online social network. As an example and not by way of limitation a particular concept node corresponding to a particular photo may have a privacy setting specifying that the photo may only be accessed by users tagged in the photo and their friends. In particular embodiments privacy settings may allow users to opt in or opt out of having their actions logged by social networking system or shared with other systems e.g. third party system . In particular embodiments the privacy settings associated with an object may specify any suitable granularity of permitted access or denial of access. As an example and not by way of limitation access or denial of access may be specified for particular users e.g. only me my roommates and my boss users within a particular degrees of separation e.g. friends or friends of friends user groups e.g. the gaming club my family user networks e.g. employees of particular employers students or alumni of particular university all users public no users private users of third party systems particular applications e.g. third party applications external websites other suitable users or entities or any combination thereof. Although this disclosure describes using particular privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates using any suitable privacy settings in any suitable manner.

In particular embodiments one or more servers may be authorization privacy servers for enforcing privacy settings. In response to a request from a user or other entity for a particular object stored in a data store social networking system may send a request to the data store for the object. The request may identify the user associated with the request and may only be sent to the user or a client system of the user if the authorization server determines that the user is authorized to access the object based on the privacy settings associated with the object. If the requesting user is not authorized to access the object the authorization server may prevent the requested object from being retrieved from the data store or may prevent the requested object from be sent to the user. In the search query context an object may only be generated as a search result if the querying user is authorized to access the object. In other words the object must have a visibility that is visible to the querying user. If the object has a visibility that is not visible to the user the object may be excluded from the search results. Although this disclosure describes enforcing privacy settings in a particular manner this disclosure contemplates enforcing privacy settings in any suitable manner.
