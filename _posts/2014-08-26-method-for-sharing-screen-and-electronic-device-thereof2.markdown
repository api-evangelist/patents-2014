For example when recognizing that the counterpart electronic device displays the screen data the display controller may request the data manager to display a blank image stored in the internal buffer.

The data manager executes the data management application stored in the memory to control data storing using the external buffer and the internal buffer. For example the data manager may store data to transmit to the counterpart electronic device in the external buffer and store data to display on the electronic device in the internal buffer. At this point the data manager may store a blank image in the internal buffer. For another example in the case where a screen share stop request occurs the data manager may stop storing data in the internal buffer and the external buffer.

For example as illustrated in the second electronic device may request the first electronic device to perform connection via Wi Fi direct as indicated by reference number .

When the first electronic device responds to a Wi Fi direct connection request at step the first electronic device and the second electronic device exchange information such as an IP address Port number and device name of a counterpart electronic device for forming a communication connection and form the communication connection based on information of each electronic device at step . For example as illustrated in a first electronic device and a second electronic device may exchange information of a counterpart electronic device to form the communication connection.

At this point although communication connection between the first electronic device and the second electronic device has been described using Wi Fi direct as an example in case of forming Wi Fi connection via an AP the communication connection may be formed without a process of a Wi Fi direct connection request and a response thereto as shown at reference number . For example as illustrated in the first electronic device and the second electronic device may form the communication connection using the AP without a process of requesting Wi Fi direct connection and responding thereto.

After the communication connection is formed in the case where a screen share event occurs in the second electronic device the function controller of the second electronic device transmits screen share connection start signals to the function controller of the first electronic device and the connection manager of the second electronic device respectively.

For example in the case where a request for stopping data transmission occurs in the counterpart electronic device the electronic device stops data transmission. For another example in the case where an input event occurs in the electronic device the electronic device stops data transmission to the counterpart electronic device. The electronic device stops encoding of data to transmit to the counterpart electronic device but the electronic device may maintain connection with the counterpart electronic device.

Additionally the electronic device may resume the stopped data transmission depending on the state information of the electronic device and the counterpart electronic device.

At this point the second electronic device stops displaying screen share data. Also the first electronic device that has been requested to stop screen sharing stops transmission of screen data to the second electronic device . At this point the first electronic device may stop storing data in both an external buffer and an internal buffer and stops encoding of data to transmit to the second electronic device . The first electronic device and the second electronic device share state information with each other to adjust synchronization of screen share data as indicated by reference number .

For another example as illustrated in while a screen is shared as indicated by reference number between the first electronic device and the second electronic device in the case where the screen share data display window is switched to a minimize state as indicated by reference number due to execution of an application in the second electronic device the second electronic device requests the first electronic device to stop screen sharing.

At this point when the user s input occurs the function controller recognizes the user intends to use the first electronic device . Accordingly the function controller requests a connection manager the display controller and a function controller of the second electronic device to stop screen sharing in step .

The function controller of the second electronic device that has been requested to stop screen sharing requests a display controller to stop screen sharing in step . At this point the display controller stops displaying of screen share data in step .

Meanwhile the connection manager of the first electronic device that has been requested to stop screen sharing stops transmission of screen data to the second electronic device in step .

The function controller of the second electronic device and the function controller of the first electronic device share state information with each other to adjust synchronization in step .

For example as illustrated in while a screen is shared as indicated by reference number between a first electronic device and a second electronic device in the case where a user s input occurs in the first electronic device as indicated by reference number the first electronic device requests the second electronic device to stop screen sharing. At this point as illustrated in the second electronic device stops displaying of screen share data as indicated by reference number .

Simultaneously the first electronic device displays screen data stored in the internal buffer as indicated by reference number . The first electronic device and the second electronic device may share state information with each other to adjust synchronization of screen share data as indicated by reference number .

Referring to in the case where screen sharing connection is formed between a first electronic device and a second electronic device in step a function controller of the first electronic device transmits a screen share start signal to a display controller and a connection manager in step . At this point the function controller requests the display controller to set a multi window in step .

The display controller that has received a screen share start signal transmits a screen share start signal to a data manager in step . At this point the data manager sets a buffer for storing screen data in step .

The display controller that has been requested to set the multi window determines a window state and sets a multi window function when needed in step . Also the display controller determines an electronic device which is to display screen data in step . At this point the display controller requests the data manager to store data in both an external buffer and an internal buffer in step . Accordingly the data manager stores first screen data to transmit to the second electronic device in the external buffer and stores second screen data to display on the first electronic device in the internal buffer.

The connection manager that has received the screen share start signal requests the data manager to transmit screen share data to transmit to the second electronic device in step .
