This application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 13 576 737 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 759 289 which is the U.S. National Stage of PCT US2011 023426 filed Feb. 2 2011 which claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 301 062 filed Feb. 3 2010 the entirety of which are incorporated herein by reference.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and has one of the highest fatality rates of all cancers affecting females. Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in women aged 20 59.

It is well established that prolactin and growth hormone play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer. For example higher serum level of lactogenic hormones have been found in some breast cancer patients and 40 70 of breast cancer biopsies were positive for the presence of the prolactin receptor. Indeed most human breast cancer cells in culture contain prolactin receptors and the majority of breast cancer cell lines overexpress the prolactin receptor 2 10 fold. For example T47D and MCF 7 both contain high levels of prolactin receptor and are often used as a model demonstrating the relationship between lactogenic hormones and breast cancer. Accordingly numerous approaches to breast cancer therapy are directed to prolactin antagonists and methods of blocking the prolactin receptor.

Similarly a high serum level of growth hormone was found to induce the formation of breast cancer while reduction of the circulating level of growth hormone correlated with the regression of breast cancer.

The cancer stem cell CSC theory states that tumors are organized in a cellular hierarchy in which CSCs are the only cells with unlimited proliferation potential and the capability of driving tumor growth and progression. Therefore efforts are also being made to develop cancer therapeutics which target cancer stem cells. However recent studies show that the use of conventional chemotherapy in neoadjuvant regimens could actually lead to enrichment in CSCs suggesting that CSCs may be generally resistant to chemotherapy. Indeed the lack of responsiveness of CSCs to chemotherapy explains why clinically tumor size is often initially reduced in response to chemotherapeutic drugs but then relapses.

Several lines of evidence have strongly linked PRL to breast cancer development and expression levels of prolactin receptors PRLR reportedly are higher in human breast cancer cells than in normal breast epithelial cells Reynolds et al. 138 5555 60 1997 or in surgically removed breast cancer tissues Touraine Martini P. et al. Abstract 79Annual Meeting of Endocrine Society p. 113 1997 . Prolactin has also been shown to act as an anti apoptotic agent and anti prolactin agents have been shown to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells Chen et al. 5 3583 93 1999 . The present invention however discloses the unexpected discovery that prolactin can be used in a method for treating breast cancer.

Disclosed herein are compositions and methods useful for the treatment of cancer such as breast cancer. The compositions and methods of the present invention comprise pre treating cancer cells with a lactogenic hormone and simultaneously or sequentially administering a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent. In one embodiment the lactogenic hormone is human prolactin growth hormone or placental lactogen. In another embodiment one or more of human prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is are administered simultaneously or sequentially with a cytotoxic agent such as a chemotherapeutic agent.

For example described herein is a method of reducing the number of cancer cells in a patient comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a lactogenic hormone to a patient and concurrently or sequentially administering a therapeutically effective amount of a cytotoxic agent. In one embodiment the lactogenic hormone is selected from the group consisting of prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen and a combination thereof.

Also described is method for treating a patient having cancer or reducing the risk of recurrence of a cancer in a patient diagnosed with the cancer comprising administering lactogenic hormone to a patient and concurrently or sequentially administering a therapeutically effective amount of a cytotoxic agent. Similarly described herein is a method of increasing the time to relapse of a cancer in a patient diagnosed with the cancer comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a lactogenic hormone.

In this invention prolactin is not being used to simply reduce the risk of occurrence of breast cancer in a patient that has not been diagnosed with breast cancer but to treat a patient that has already been diagnosed with breast cancer. The invention also describes methods for reducing recurrence of a cancer in a patient that has already been diagnosed with cancer.

Disclosed herein are methods and compositions useful for the treatment of cancer such as breast cancer. In some embodiments the methods and compositions include a lactogenic hormone such as prolactin. While prolactin is known to play a role in the development and progression of breast cancer the surprising and unexpected results disclosed herein demonstrate that prolactin treatment in conjunction with conventional chemotherapeutic agents decreases the number of both breast cancer stem cells and differentiated breast cancer cells. Without being bound by theory it is hypothesized that the lactogenic hormone sensitizes a cancer stem cell to chemotherapeutic agents by allowing these cells to differentiate. Once the cells are in an active non dormant state they are more susceptible to treatment with a chemotherapeutic agent.

As used herein the terms subject and patient are used interchangeably and refer to a mammal preferably a human.

As used herein the terms therapeutically effective dose or therapeutically effective amount means a dose that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact dose will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques and efficacy can be measured in conventional ways. For cancer therapy efficacy can for example be measured by assessing the time to disease progression determining response rates time to relapse tumor size etc.

The terms treating treatment and the like are used herein to refer to obtaining a desired therapeutic effect. The effect is therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure of a disease condition symptom or adverse effect attributed to the disease. The term treatment as used herein covers any treatment of a disease in a mammal particularly a human and includes a preventing the disease from recurring in a subject who has been diagnosed as having it b inhibiting the disease i.e. arresting or reducing the progression of the disease or its clinical symptoms in a patient diagnosed as having the disease or c relieving the disease i.e. causing regression of the disease and or its symptoms or conditions in a patient diagnoses as having the disease. The compositions and methods disclosed herein can be used for treatment and or for the prevention of cancer relapse or cancer reoccurrence. Thus in some embodiments treating cancer e.g. breast cancer would include decreasing the clinical indications associated with the cancer for example decreasing tumor size decreasing the number of cancer stem cells decreasing the number of differentiated cancer cells and or increasing time to relapse or recurrence of a treated cancer or tumor.

The term cytotoxic agent as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents the function of cells and or causes destruction of cells. The term is intended to include radioactive isotopes e.g. I I Yand Re chemotherapeutic agents and toxins such as enzymatically active toxins of bacterial fungal plant or animal origin or fragments thereof.

A chemotherapeutic agent is a chemical compound useful in the treatment of cancer. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents include alkylating agents such as thiotepa and cyclosphosphamide CYTOXAN alkyl sulfonates such as busulfan improsulfan and piposulfan aziridines such as benzodopa carboquone meturedopa and uredopa ethylenimines and methylamelamines including altretamine triethylenemelamine trietylenephosphoramide triethylenethiophosphaoramide and trimethylolomelamine nitrogen mustards such as chlorambucil chlornaphazine cholophosphamide estramustine ifosfamide mechlorethamine mechlorethamine oxide hydrochloride meiphalan novembichin phenesterine prednimustine trofosfamide uracil mustard nitrosureas such as carmustine chiorozotocin fotemustine lomustine nimustine ranimustine antibiotics such as aclacinomycins actinomycin authramycin azaserine bleomycins cactinomycin calicheamicin carabicin carminomycin carzinophilin chromomycins dactinomycin daunorubicin detorubicin 6 diazo 5 oxo L norleucine doxorubicin epirubicin esorubicin idarubicin marcellomycin mitomycins mycophenolic acid nogalamycin olivomycins peplomycin porfiromycins puromycin quelamycin rodorubicin streptonigrin streptozocin tubercidin ubenimex zinostatin zorubicin anti metabolites such as methotrexate and 5 fluorouracil 5 FU folic acid analogues such as denopterin methotrexate pteropterin trimetrexate purine analogs such as fludarabine 6 mercaptopurine thiamiprine thioguanine pyrimidine analogs such as ancitabine azacitidine 6 azauridine carmofur cytarabine dideoxyuridine doxifluridine enocitabine floxuridine androgens such as calusterone dromostanolone propionate epitiostanol mepitiostane testolactone anti adrenals such as aminoglutethimide mitotane trilostane folic acid replenisher such as frolinic acid aceglatone aldophosphamide glycoside aminolevulinic acid amsacrine bestrabucil bisantrene edatraxate defofamine demecolcine diaziquone elfornithine elliptinium acetate etoglucid gallium nitrate hydroxyurea lentinan lonidamine mitoguazone mitoxantrone mopidamol nitracri ne pentostatin phenamet pirarubicin podophyllinic acid 2 ethylhydrazide procarbazine PSK razoxane sizofiran spirogermanium tenuazonic acid triaziquone 2 2 2 trichlorotriethylamine urethan vindesine dacarbazine mannomustine mitobronitol mitolactol pipobroman gacytosine arabinoside Ara C cyclophosphamide thiotepa taxanes e.g. paclitaxel TAXOL Bristol Myers Squibb Oncology Princeton N.J. and docetaxel TOXOTERE Aventis Antony France chlorambucil gemcitabine 6 thioguanine mercaptopurine methotrexate platinum analogs such as cisplatin and carboplatin vinblastine platinum etoposide VP 16 ifosfamide mitomycin C mitoxantrone vincristine vinorelbine navelbine novantrone teniposide daunomycin aminopterin xeloda ibandronate CPT 11 topoisomerase inhibitor RFS 2000 difluoromethylornithine DMFO retinoic acid esperamicins capecitabine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above. Also included in this definition are anti hormonal agents that act to regulate or inhibit hormone action on tumors such as anti estrogens including for example tamoxifen raloxifene aromatase inhibiting 4 5 imidazoles 4 hydroxytamoxifen trioxifene keoxifene LY 117018 onapristone and toremifene FARESTON and anti androgens such as flutamide nilutamide bicalutamide leuprolide and goserelin and pharmaceutically acceptable salts acids or derivatives of any of the above.

In some embodiments one or more breast cancer chemotherapeutic agents are used and include but are not limited to the following anthracyclines such as doxorubicin Adriamycin Rubex epirubicin Ellence and liposomal doxorubicin Doxil taxanes such as docetaxel Taxotere paclitaxel Taxol and protein bound paclitaxel Abraxane cyclophosphamide Cytoxan capecitabine Xeloda and 5 fluorouracil 5 FU vinorelbine Navelbine gemcitabine Gemzar trastuzumab Herceptin .

The term pharmaceutically acceptable as used herein means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans.

The pharmaceutical compositions useful in the practice of the methods disclosed in the present invention include a therapeutically effective amount of an active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

As used herein the term active agent refers to a component of a composition such as a pharmaceutical composition that has a pharmaceutical effect on a patient. In some embodiments described herein active agents include polypeptides such as prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen and fragments or variants thereof which are capable of binding to the prolactin receptor.

According to the present invention a cancer patients is pre treated with prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen or a combination thereof and either concurrently treated with a chemotherapeutic agent or pre treated with the lactogenic hormone s prior to administering the chemotherapeutic agent.

The prolactin for use in the present invention includes wild type prolactin as well as conservative variants thereof. The overall structure and composition of the prolactin is important only insofar it confers the appropriate functional characteristics i.e. prolactin receptor binding. A skilled artisan would understand that typically the prolactin for use as described herein should be species matched with the mammal being treated. For example a human being treated with prolactin should typically be treated with a human prolactin.

A prolactin variant according to the present invention generally conserves the overall molecular structure of the protein. Given the properties of the individual amino acids in prolactin some rational substitutions will be apparent. Amino acid substitutions i.e. conservative substitutions may be made for instance on the basis of similarity in polarity charge solubility hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and or the amphipathic nature of the residues involved. Such conservative variants of prolactin retain two functional prolactin receptor binding sites and are able to initiate the prolactin signaling cascade.

For example a nonpolar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine leucine isoleucine valine proline phenylalanine tryptophan and methionine b polar neutral amino acids include glycine serine threonine cysteine tyrosine asparagine and glutamine c positively charged basic amino acids include arginine lysine and histidine and d negatively charged acidic amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Substitutions typically may be made within groups a d . In addition glycine and proline may be substituted for one another based on their ability to disrupt helices. Similarly certain amino acids such as alanine cysteine leucine methionine glutamic acid glutamine histidine and lysine are more commonly found in helices while valine isoleucine phenylalanine tyrosine tryptophan and threonine are more commonly found in pleated sheets. Glycine serine aspartic acid asparagine and proline are commonly found in turns. Some preferred substitutions may be made among the following groups i S and T ii P and G and iii A V L and I. Given the known genetic code and recombinant and synthetic DNA techniques the skilled scientist readily can construct DNAs encoding the conservative amino acid variants.

Conservative variants of the present invention specifically contemplate truncations of the presently described prolactin. Truncations may be made from the N or C terminus but generally do not entail deleting more than about 30 of the native molecule. In one embodiment less than about 20 less than about 10 less than about 5 or less than about 2 of the native molecule is deleted. The term about with regard to percentage of protein truncated connotes 2 . For example deleting about 10 of the native molecules refers to a 8 12 truncation of the native molecule. Again so long as the prolactin wild type and variant prolactin confers the appropriate functional characteristics i.e. prolactin receptor binding and receptor dimerization and signal transduction then it is suitable for use in the present invention.

Variants may also or alternatively contain other modifications including the deletion or addition of amino acids that have minimal influence on the functional properties secondary structure and hydropathic nature of the polypeptide. For example a polypeptide may be conjugated to a signal or leader sequence at the N terminal end of the protein which co translationally or post translationally directs transfer of the protein. The polypeptide may also be conjugated to a linker or other sequence for ease of synthesis purification or identification of the polypeptide e.g. poly His .

Other prolactin variants suitable for use in the present invention are prolactin multimers i.e. homo and heteromultimers of prolactin including wild type prolactin and prolactin variants that have at least two active receptor binding sites so as to still permit receptor dimerization and signal transduction to occur. For example a prolactin homodimer may comprise two prolactin antagonists such as G129 hPRL. Although each monomer individually is a prolactin antagonist the homodimer acts as a prolactin agonist. In another embodiment the prolactin multimer is a heterodimer which comprises a prolactin antagonist such as G129R hPRL and a prolactin agonist such as wild type prolactin . Thus the heterodimer would be a hPRL hPRL G129R heterodimer.

In general the prolactin of the present invention and DNA encoding the prolactin can be defined with reference to sequence identity. Some prolactin variants have at least about 50 at least about 55 or at least about 60 sequence identity to a wild type prolactin. Others have at least about 65 at least about 70 at least about 80 at least about 85 at least about 90 at least about 95 at least about 98 or at least about 99 sequence identity to a wild type prolactin. The term about with respect to a specific percentage sequence identity connotes 2 . For example the term about 95 sequence identity refers to a range of 93 97 sequence identity. As used herein two nucleic acid molecules or proteins are said to share significant sequence identity if the two contain regions possess greater than 85 sequence amino acid or nucleic acid identity.

 Sequence identity is defined herein with reference to the Blast 2 algorithm which is available at the NCBI http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov BLAST using default parameters. References pertaining to this algorithm include those found at http www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov BLAST blast references.html Altschul et al. 1990 Basic local alignment search tool. J. Mol. Biol. 215 403 410 Gish W. States D. J. 1993 Identification of protein coding regions by database similarity search. Nature Genet. 3 266 272 Madden et al. 1996 Applications of network BLAST server Meth. Enzymol. 266 131 141 Altschul et al. 1997 Gapped BLAST and PSI BLAST a new generation of protein database search programs. Nucleic Acids Res. 25 3389 3402 and Zhang J. Madden T. L. 1997 PowerBLAST A new network BLAST application for interactive or automated sequence analysis and annotation. Genome Res. 7 649 656. Accordingly the prolactin peptide sequences from different species can be aligned using standard computer programs like BLAST to inform further variation in prolactin derived receptor antagonizing domains that preserve their essential function.

Cell based assay systems can be used to compare the biological activities of a wild type prolactin and a prolactin variant. To this end competitive binding assays may be used to ensure that each prolactin variant binds to its normal receptor and competes with wild type prolactin for receptor binding. Competitive binding assays are routine and known in the art.

Prolactin variant activity can also be readily assessed by phosphorylation assays e.g. immunoprecipitation assays which are known in the art. Cell signaling via wild type prolactin is initiated by prolactin binding to the prolactin receptor. This binding induces dimerization of the prolactin receptor thereby triggering a signal transduction cascade in cells comprising a prolactin bound receptor. Signal transduction in the prolactin signaling pathway involves signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT phosphorylation and therefore STAT phosphorylation assays can be used to determine whether the prolactin variant is suitable for use in the present invention.

The compositions of the invention can also include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents.

Pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin.

In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition including one or more active agents e.g. one or more of prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous subcutaneous nasal or intramuscular administration to human beings. Where necessary the pharmaceutical composition may also include a solubilizing agent. In some embodiments a local anesthetic such as lidocaine may be used to ease pain at the site of the injection. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The active agents can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with free amino groups such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with free carboxyl groups such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition includes one or more active agents e.g. one or more of prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen and one or more cytotoxic and or chemotherapeutic active agents.

In some embodiments one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is administered concurrently with the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent chemotherapy regimen or other cytotoxic treatment. In other embodiments one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is administered prior to the administration of a chemotherapeutic agent chemotherapy regimen or other cytotoxic treatment. That is the patient is pre treated with the lactogenic hormone prior to chemotherapy or other cytotoxic treatment.

For example in some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is administered on or about 14 days prior to the start of chemotherapy in other embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is administered on or about 7 days prior on or about 5 days prior on or about 3 days prior on or about 2 days prior or on or about 1 day prior to the start of a chemotherapy treatment chemotherapy regimen or other cytotoxic treatment.

In still other embodiments one or more doses of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is administered prior to the start of chemotherapy and or then pharmaceutical composition is administered substantially concurrent with a chemotherapy treatment or regimen. For example in a particular embodiment a pharmaceutical composition comprising prolactin is administered to a patient at 7 days 5 days and 3 days prior to the start of a chemotherapy regimen and is also administered simultaneously with the chemotherapy regimen.

In yet other embodiments one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen is administered simultaneously with a chemotherapeutic agent. This co treatment approach may be for the entire course of the regimen for the chemotherapeutic agent or only the first half or first third of the regimen for the chemotherapeutic agent.

Those of skill in the art will understand that chemotherapy or other cytotoxic regimens for cancer treatment may be administered to a patient as a single treatment or over the course of many days weeks or months. Commonly chemotherapy treatments are given in a 2 4 week cycle. In adjuvant and neo adjuvant settings they are usually given in combinations of two or more drugs. Single agent chemotherapy treatments one drug at a time is also an option.

For breast cancer chemotherapy is given either by mouth or injected into a vein daily weekly or every 2 4 weeks and treatment plans which are designed for individual patient conditions can vary greatly from patient to patient.

A pharmaceutical composition including one or more active agents e.g. one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen may be administered locally i.e. directly into or onto the tumor or it can be administered for absorption into the blood stream. It can also be administered intramuscularly subcutaneously orally or topically.

The dosage of a pharmaceutical composition including one or more active agents e.g. prolactin growth hormone placental lactogen can readily be determined by the skilled artisan on a patient by patient basis. Factors such as patient age weight sex disease state health status other medical conditions other current medications or treatments prognosis quality of life mode of administration frequency of administration and long term treatment plans may all play a role in dosage determination and the skilled artisan is well versed in balancing these factors to determine a proper dosage for a specific patients. In many instances dosage may have to be determined empirically.

In some embodiments a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of prolactin growth hormone and placental lactogen includes a unit dose of prolactin growth hormone and or placental lactogen of from about 1000 mg to about 1 g from about 750 mg to about 50 g from about 500 mg to about 100 g from about 250 mg to about 1 mg or from about 100 mg to about 50 mg. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition includes prolactin in a unit dose of about 1000 mg 900 mg 800 mg 700 mg 600 mg 500 mg 400 mg 300 mg 200 mg 100 mg 50 mg 40 mg 30 mg 20 mg 10 mg 1 mg 100 g 10 g 1 g 500 ng 400 ng 300 ng 200 ng 100 ng or about 50 ng. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition includes growth hormone in a unit dose of about 1000 mg 900 mg 800 mg 700 mg 600 mg 500 mg 400 mg 300 mg 200 mg 100 mg 50 mg 40 mg 30 mg 20 mg 10 mg 1 mg 100 g 10 g 1 g 500 ng 400 ng 300 ng 200 ng 100 ng or about 50 ng. In some embodiments the pharmaceutical composition includes placental lactogen in a unit dose of about 1000 mg 900 mg 800 mg 700 mg 600 mg 500 mg 400 mg 300 mg 200 mg 100 mg 50 mg 40 mg 30 mg 20 mg 10 mg 1 mg 100 g 10 g 1 g 500 ng 400 ng 300 ng 200 ng 100 ng or about 50 ng.

The following examples are intended to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the methods and compositions described herein and are not intended to be limiting.

MCF 7 human breast cancer cells and primary mouse breast cancer cells isolated from MMTV neu transgenic mice were used in this study. Tumor sphere formation assay and aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH activity measured by flow cytometry were used to measure the functional response of the CSCs after 11 days of co treatment with human prolactin hPRL and doxorubicin Dox .

MCF 7 and MMTV neu cells were cultured by standard methods known in the art. Briefly unsorted MCF 7 cells were plated in ultra low attachment plate Corning Inc Corning N.Y. at a density of 5000 cells ml in serum free Dulbecco s Modified Eagle Medium F12 DMEM F12 supplemented with 0.4 bovine serum albumin BSA 10 ng mL of basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF 20 ng ml of epidermal growth factor EGF 5 g ml of insulin all from Sigma Aldrich Co. St. Louis Mo. . Tumorspheres were allowed to form in 37 C. with 5 COfor 10 days. Culture medium were replaced two times in the course of treatment. Similar culturing method was applied to MMTV neu cells in the exception of MMTV neu cells were plated at a density of 200 000 cells ml.

Cells were treated with 0.5 g ml of hPRL 25 ng ml of doxorubicin or a combination of 0.5 g ml hRPL and 25 ng ml doxorubicin. After 11 days of treatment the cells were analyzed for tumorsphere formation and ALDH activity levels.

Tumorsphere formation was determined by spheres formed in the culture medium. Spheres number were counted manually under four random fields of the 24 well at 40 magnification.

Cancer stem cells CSCs exhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH activity while differentiated tumor cells do not. Accordingly to determine the number of CSCs in a tumor sample ALDH activity levels were determined by the ALDEFLUOR kit StemCell Technologies Vancouver BC Canada . Briefly tumorspheres were dissociated by trypsin Invitrogen Carlsbad Calif. at 37 C. for 5 minutes and resuspended in ALDEFLUOR assay buffer containing ALDH substrate BODIPY aminoacetaldehyde 1 M per 1 10cells . An aliquot of the cells were treated with 7.5 M of diethylaminobenzaldehyde DEAB an inhibitor of ALDH as the negative control. Samples were incubated in 37 C. with 5 COfor 45 minutes and analyzed by FACSCalibur Becton Dickinson Co. Franklin Lakes N.J. . The ALDH positive gate was established using the negative control treated with DEAB.

Results are shown in . shows the results of the tumorsphere analysis after 11 days of treatment in MCF 7 cells data from the primary mouse breast cancer cells is not shown . As shown in hPRL treatment slightly increased tumorspheres formation in MCF 7 cells. hPRL treatment also increased tumorspheres formation in primary mouse breast cancer cells 2.3 fold 0.34 p

Three breast cancer cell lines are used in this assay two human breast cancer cell lines MCF 7 ER HER2 and SKBR3 ER HER2 and one mouse breast cancer cell line that was established from HER2 neu transgenic mice McNeuA . After establishing the dose response curves all three cell lines will be used for two in vitro studies. The cells will be treated with a standard chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin Dox alone Max or IC or in combination with hPRL Max or IC .

First the functional response of CSCs is measured by standard colony formation and tumorsphere formation assays after 7 and 14 days of treatment using methods described above in Example 2.

Next the CSC population is measured by two sets of the stem cell markers aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH and CD44 CD24after a 12 24 and 48 hours of treatment using flow cytometry methods as described in Example 2.

Finally the efficacy of the treatment is examined in vivo by implanting McNeuA cell into FVB mice. Two weeks after tumor cell inoculation a four week treatment regimen is applied weekly Dox with or without daily hPRL injection . Tumor growth and the time to relapse is monitored and compared among groups.

Tumorsphere evaluation and ALDH CD44 CD24testing produces results similar to that obtained in Example 2. In other words hPRL or Dox treatment alone has a negligible affect on tumorsphere formation in all cell lines tested but the combination therapy hPRL Dox reduces both the number and size of tumorspheres in all cell lines. The number of ALDH negative cells is reduced with Dox treatment alone but that ALDH positive cell numbers are unaffected. hPRL treatment alone has a negligible affect on ALDH positive and ALDH negative cells and the number of ALDH positive and ALDH negative cells are reduced in the combination therapy.

Expected results are summarized below in Table 1 below. With respect to the tumorsphere data samples in which tumorspheres are comparable in size and number to the no treatment control group are shown as . Samples including tumorpheres that are smaller or fewer in number are shown as . With respect to the ALDH results ALDH positive cells are represented by the o r on the left side of the slash while ALDH negative cells are represented by the o r on the right side of the slash. ALDH results that are comparable to the no treatment control are represented by a . So for example in the Dox treated cells the ALDH positive cell number is comparable to the no treatment control on the left side . In the hPRL Dox treated samples both ALDH positive and ALDH negative cell numbers are lower than the no treatment controls .

Tumor growth and time to relapse in the test mice i.e. mice receiving the prolactin therapy shows improvement when compared to the control mice as shown in Table 2 below.
