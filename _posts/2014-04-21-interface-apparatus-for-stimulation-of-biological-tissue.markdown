The present disclosure relates generally to the field of altering and or generating currents in biological tissue for the purpose of stimulation. More particularly the present disclosure relates to an apparatus that serves as an interface mechanism between tissue being stimulated and or an electrical field and or electric field source and or a means for altering the tissue electromagnetic parameters fields agents and or sources .

Electric stimulation of living tissue in humans and other animals is used in a number of clinical applications as well as in general biological research. In particular electric stimulation of neural tissue has been used in the treatment of various diseases including Parkinson s disease depression and intractable pain. Focused and or deep stimulation of the brain usually involves performing surgery to remove a portion of the skull and implanting electrodes in a specific location within the brain tissue. The invasive nature of these procedures makes them difficult and costly and is responsible for a great deal of morbidity. Alternately noninvasive stimulation methodologies such as transcranial direct current stimulation tDCS and transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS are easy to implement and are not associated with significant morbidity however the areas stimulated are large typically not well characterized and can be significantly perturbed by natural or pathological features of the brain tissue. Recently ultrasound stimulation of brain tissue has been explored with limited success as it alone does not generate currents that are the backbone of clinically effective stimulation methods.

Numerous methods exist for generating currents for biological tissue stimulation. These methods range from implanting electric sources in the tissue to inductively generating currents in tissue via time varying magnetic fields. A new method for generating currents in biological tissue was recently described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 764 468 Apparatus and Method for Stimulation of Biological Tissue which discloses an apparatus and method of generating currents in biological tissues. The disclosure describes a means to stimulate biological tissue via an electric source capable of generating an electric field across a region of tissue and a means for altering the electromagnetic properties of tissue relative to the electric field whereby the alteration of the tissue electromagnetic properties relative to the electric field generates an altered current in the tissue. These alterations in the current in turn lead to the stimulation of biological tissue. The means for altering these electromagnetic parameters of the tissue could include a chemical optical mechanical thermal and or secondary electromagnetic source s field s and or agents.

Presently no apparatus exists which can improve on the interface between the primary electric source and or field and or means to alter tissue electromagnetic properties source s field s and or agents and or the tissue s to be stimulated for this type of tissue stimulation method. No interface exists which can regulate the number of and or duration of stimulation sessions. No interface exists which can control move and or fix the location and or sizes of the source of the primary electric field and or means for altering the electromagnetic properties of the tissue s to be stimulated for this type of tissue stimulation method. No interface exists Which specifically bridges couples and or matches the properties of the materials between the primary electrical field source and or its field and or the source of the means for altering these electromagnetic parameters of the tissue and or the fields and or agents and or the tissue in such a way to improve stimulation for this type of tissue stimulation method. No interface has been proposed which can be worn integrated with wearable items house any of the sources of stimulation and or serve as a bridge between tissue s to be stimulated and any of the sources of stimulation.

It would be desirable to provide an interface mechanism between the stimulated tissue and or the source electrical field s and or the means for altering the tissue s electromagnetic characteristics that makes such improvements. The present disclosure addresses these deficiencies.

Accordingly an interface apparatus is presented. The interface apparatus could be used to regulate the number of stimulation sessions and or duration of stimulation house the electrical field source and or the source of the means for altering the tissue s electromagnetic characteristics and or act as a bridging medium between the tissue and or the electric field and or source and or the means for altering the tissues electromagnetic properties source s field s and or agents . The interface apparatus according to the present disclosure can include an electric source capable of generating an applied electric field across a region of tissue a means for altering at least one electromagnetic characteristic of the region of tissue relative to the applied electric field and an interface component such interface component creating an interface between the region of tissue and applied electric field and or the means for altering at least one electromagnetic characteristic of the region of tissue. It is envisioned that according to the present disclosure the characteristics of tissue can be altered using a variety of sources including but not limited to a chemical source optical source mechanical source thermal source and or a secondary electromagnetic source and or the source generated field s and or agents .

According to the current disclosure the tissue permittivity can be altered relative to an applied electric field. The alteration then generates a displacement current in the region of tissue. Further conductivity can be altered relative to an applied electric field thereby generating an altered ohmic current. The alteration of an electromagnetic characteristic of a region of tissue can also be used to generate a new electric field that has the ability to drive additional ohmic and displacement currents.

The interface apparatus can include either a separate piece that is a wearable component such as for example a helmet that could be worn by the person being stimulated in the brain an external wrap s of various shapes tailored for any part of the body or wearable items bridging blocks electrode like components transducer like components materials that can be worn and or integrated into other wearable items a physical boundary component of the headpiece of a transducer mechanism for the field s and or electromagnetic tissue parameter s modifier s any physical boundary component which directs or couples at least one of the sources fields agents or means for altering tissue electromagnetic properties with the tissue and or any combination of the above.

The interface apparatus may have its number of uses regulated and or the duration of stimulation through multiple methods including use of an integrated electrical circuit which can control the number of uses or time through which the interface component may be used which may be controlled for example through electrical or mechanical interfaces memory devices card readers telecommunication devices etc use of interface creams pastes fluids materials and or gels which can be fashioned to be only functional for a single use or a controlled number of uses and or duration of stimulation use of mechanical safety latches which deactivates the item after a single use or a controlled number of uses and or duration of stimulation and or use of a composite material which makes up part of the apparatus according to the present disclosure and can regulate the number of applications and or duration of stimulation and or other standard mechanisms all used individually or in any combination .

The interface apparatus according to the present disclosure could be used to match and or appropriately couple the physical characteristics between the tissue s and or the electrical field or electric field source and or means for altering the tissue electromagnetic parameters to augment focus modify and or improve the current alteration. The interface could also be used to adjust the position shape and or size of the components of the stimulation method that can be housed in the interface and or in contact with the interface relative to the tissue to be stimulated.

It is envisioned that the present disclosure may be used as a method to augment or use in connection with the stimulation of biological tissue through the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 764 468 Apparatus and Method for Stimulation of Biological Tissue where an electric source that is placed on the body to generate an electric field is combined with a means for altering the electromagnetic properties of the tissue relative to the electric field whereby the alteration of the tissue electromagnetic properties relative to the electric field generates an altered current in the tissues.

As provided by the present disclosure an interface apparatus is introduced. The interface apparatus according to the present disclosure can be used between stimulated tissue and or the primary electric field or electric field source and or the means for altering the electromagnetic tissue parameters i.e. the ultrasound mechanical field and or source s chemical agent and or source s thermal field and or source s optical field beam and or source s and or secondary electromagnetic field and or source s . The exemplary embodiments of the apparatus disclosed can be employed in the area of neural stimulation and muscular stimulation including cardiac stimulation . It is also envisioned that the present disclosure may also be employed in the area of cellular metabolism physical therapy drug delivery and gene therapy.

A detailed embodiment of the present disclosure is presented herein however it is to be understood that the described embodiments are merely exemplary of the disclosure which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore specific functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present disclosure in virtually any appropriately detailed embodiment.

The components of the tissue stimulation interface apparatus according to the present disclosure are fabricated from materials suitable for a variety of medical applications such as for example polymerics gels films fabrics and or metals depending on the particular application and or preference. Semi rigid and rigid polymerics are contemplated for fabrication as well as resilient materials such as molded medical grade polyurethane as well as flexible or malleable materials such as fabrics flexible polymerics or materials for wearable items. The motors gearing electronics power components electrodes and transducers of the apparatus may be fabricated from those suitable for a variety of medical applications The interface apparatus according to the present disclosure may also be used in connection with or include circuit boards circuitry processor components etc. for computerized control. One skilled in the art however will realize that other materials and fabrication methods suitable for assembly and manufacture in accordance with the present disclosure also would be appropriate.

The following discussion includes a description of the components and exemplary methods for creating an interface between tissue and or an electric field and or electric field source and or means for altering the electromagnetic tissue parameters source s field s and or agents . Reference will now be made in detail to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure illustrated in the accompanying figure wherein like reference numerals indicate the similar parts throughout the figure.

Turning now to which illustrates an exemplary embodiment of an interface apparatus . An interface component can be used to provide an interface between the tissue and the electric field and source and means for altering the electromagnetic tissue properties. For example the interface apparatus illustrated in according to the present disclosure may be applied to the area of neural stimulation and in particular brain stimulation .

Electrodes as an electric source are applied to the scalp through interface component . As depicted in interface component can be a cap helmet or other item that can be worn by an individual. Further it is envisioned that electrodes can be separate or attached to embedded in placed on top of placed on the surface of or fastened within or any combination to the interface component . The cap interface component can serve as an interface between regions of tissue of an individual and electrodes or as a holder for the electrodes directly affixed to the skin with an area opened on the interface mechanism . While electrodes are used and applied to the scalp through the interface mechanism in this exemplary embodiment it is envisioned that the electrodes may be applied to a number of different areas on within or near the body including areas around the scalp through a single interface component multiple interface components and or a combination of an interface component s . The electrodes used may or may not be housed in an interface component of the interface apparatus according to the present disclosure. By way of example the main electrode s used could be housed within an interface component affixed to the scalp and a free electrode could be placed in the subject s mouth. It is also envisioned that one electrode may be placed proximal to the tissue being stimulated and the other distant such as one electrode on the scalp and one on the thorax through a single interface component containing at least one of the electrode elements where the other electrodes may be housed in an interface component and or as separate non interface component contained electrodes and or through multiple interface components .

It is further envisioned that the electric source could be mono polar with a single electrode where a cap interface component could serve as the entire or part of the electrode or multi polar with multiple electrodes where at least one of the electrodes is contained or part of in at least one interface component. Similarly the electric source of the interface apparatus and or the interface component may be applied to tissue via any medically acceptable medium i.e. gels creams pastes fluids dry application electrodes etc . By using dry electrodes and or a dry interface component one could potentially eliminate the debris left on the subject following stimulation. It is also envisioned that the electric source could generate its field via inductive means whereby a magnetic source is embedded in the cap interface component. The interface component can itself be comprised of inert and or active materials that serve as a bridging medium and appropriately couple and or match the electromagnetic characteristics between an electrical source and a region or regions of tissue for example by actively or passively altering and or matching the electrical impedances between the tissues and the electric source s . Finally the interface component s themselves s may serve as an electric source s itself in whole or part.

The electrodes generate a source electric field which results in a current in the tissue. As described in further detail below the electromagnetic properties of the tissue are altered relative to the electric field for example by a mechanical field thereby generating a new and altered current component relative to the initial field and or an additional new electrical field component including ohmic and or displacement current components.

As further depicted in a mechanical source the mechanical source may be any acoustic source such as an ultrasound device is applied on the scalp via interface mechanism and provides concentrated acoustic energy i.e. mechanical field to a focused region of neural tissue in the brain of a subject. This mechanical field affects a smaller number of neurons than is affected by the electric field and thereby generates the altered current . A block of tissue is depicted in a magnified view with neurons to be stimulated in .

The mechanical source and subsequent field can be applied to the scalp through the interface mechanism which can be a cap helmet or wearable item as depicted in . It is envisioned that the mechanical source can be attached to embedded in placed on top of placed on the surface of or fastened within or any combination to the interface component of interface apparatus . Thus the interface component can serve as an interface between the region of tissue or tissues and mechanical source or as a holder for the mechanical source in direct contact with the tissue . Multiple mechanical sources could be applied through either one interface mechanism with multiple mechanical sources multiple interface mechanisms containing or interfacing with at least one mechanical source or through any such combination and or with separate non interface component contained mechanical sources .

While a mechanical source can be used and applied to the scalp through interface component as depicted in this exemplary embodiment it is envisioned that mechanical source s may be applied to a number of different areas on within or near the body including areas around the scalp through a single interface component multiple interface components and or a combination of an interface component s and or mechanical sources that are not housed in an interface component. Similarly the mechanical source component of the interface apparatus and or the interface component may be applied to tissue via any medically acceptable medium i.e. gels creams fluids pastes etc . The interface component itself can be comprised of materials active and or inert that serve as a bridging medium thus creating the interface and thereby appropriately coupling and or matching the mechanical properties between the mechanical source and the targeted tissues for example by actively and or passively matching and or altering the acoustic impedances between the tissues and the electric source s . The interface component itself may serve as a mechanical source s itself in whole or part.

As the electric field is to be coupled to the mechanical field the interface component itself can be comprised of materials active and or inert that serve as a bridging medium thus creating an interface and thereby appropriately couple and or match the acoustic characteristics and or electromagnetic properties between the mechanical source and or fields or other means for altering electromagnetic characteristics and or the electric source and or fields and or the tissues to augment the stimulation. This can be done for example by having the interface component at least in part capable of actively and or passively matching and or altering the electrical and acoustic impedances of the interface to the electrical and mechanical field frequencies that are tuned to initiate stimulation of neural cells and or actively and or passively matching and or altering the electrical and acoustic impedances of the interface to the sources such that the sources themselves are matched and more efficient in use and or altering its interface materials such that the speed of sound and or light is changed in them so that the fields that impinge on the tissue to be stimulated are tuned to the nerve cells targeted and or altering the dispersive properties of its interface materials so the mechanical and or electrical fields have a controllable frequency dependent behavior in the materials such as to tune the field frequencies to neural effect and or making its interface materials capable of filtering the fields as to tune the fields to neural effect and or altering the densities of the interface materials altering the transmission of fields through the interface to maximize neural effect and or allowing its interface materials to shift the phase of individual fields thereby restructuring the waveforms that impinge on the neural tissue and or altering the focus or targeting of the fields to stimulate different neural targets and or altering the orientation of the vector field components thereby potentially altering the neural response of the stimulated cell for example inhibiting or facilitating the cells based on the final stimulating current density orientation relative to the neural body axon axis and or altering the magnitude of the fields to maximize neural effect and or altering the field waveform dynamics shapes to tune neural response etc.

While a mechanical source can be used and applied to the scalp through the interface mechanism in this exemplary embodiment many other means could be applied to alter the electromagnetic properties of the underlying tissue and similar property matching and or coupling could be enacted across all of the different mechanisms for altering the electromagnetic properties of the tissue including thermal chemical optical electromagnetic and or mechanical properties to generate the desired current for stimulation based on matching and or coupling the source s field s and or agent s and or tissue properties through the interface.

It is further envisioned that the interface component may be comprised of one or separate pieces and serve only to couple the mechanical field with the underlying tissue or the electrical field with the underlying tissue separately or they may be designed so that they are separate but integrateable or just used with separate non housed electrical and or mechanical sources . The interface component s could also be designed to couple the electromagnetic and mechanical fields before being focused on the tissues such as for example in an appropriate housing paradigm potentially including the proper placement of the primary electric field source and the means for altering the electromagnetic tissue properties whereby the fields are coupled appropriately before being focused on the tissues or to facilitate the subsequent focusing on or into the tissues . The interface component s itself can be adjustable in shape size and or position and or allow for the movement and or reshaping and or resizing of the parts that are embedded within it or attached on it such that either of the sources electrical and or means for altering tissue characteristics can be adjusted relative to the tissue to be stimulated such as for example allowing movement of the electric field source or mechanical field source relative to the tissue as might be used for adjustable targeting of locations to be stimulated .

The interface apparatus s may have its number of uses controlled and or control the duration of a stimulation session s . This control could be used to increase the efficiency of its application or to avoid overuse. Examples in which uses could be controlled include incorporating an integrated electrical circuit which can control the number of uses and or stimulation session durations through which the component may be used using interface creams fluids materials pastes and or gels which can be fashioned to be only functional for a single use or a controlled number of uses and or stimulation session duration incorporating mechanical safety latches which deactivate the item after a single use or a controlled number of uses and or stimulation session duration using a composite material which makes up part of the interface apparatus and can regulate the number of applications and or stimulation session duration and or other standard mechanisms all used individually or in any combination . Additionally the interface component s may be reusable where the electrodes i.e. electrical source components and or means for altering the tissue electromagnetic properties i.e. ultrasound mechanical chemical thermal optical and or secondary electromagnetic source s are removable and or replaceable within the interface component and or made of materials such that they are multi use.

Other embodiments can incorporate item such as a separate piece s that are wearable component s for any Other body part including and beyond the head scalp as mentioned above such as a back brace like wearable items for spinal cord stimulation a knee brace like component etc an external wrap s of various shapes tailored for any part of the body materials that can be worn separately and integrated into other wearable items bridging blocks electrode like components a physical boundary component of the headpiece of a transducer mechanism for the primary electromagnetic field source and or the means to modify the electromagnetic tissues parameters that may serve as a medical device interface where the type of mechanism that facilitates the coupling of the fields could be used for a headpiece of a transducer of a medical device for applying the appropriate fields and or additional means for altering the tissue electromagnetic parameters this headpiece could for instance be integrated into chair type device that one might sit in for stimulation and or any combination of the above. Also the different components could be made from multiple separate pieces that may be integrateable or separately functioning such as for a cap like mechanism there could be one cap mechanism that serves to hold the electrical field source electrodes and a separate cap holding the ultrasound source or sources of mechanical fields chemical agents thermal fields optical fields beams and or secondary electromagnetic fields both made of materials to facilitate the transmission of the given fields and or agents.

It is also envisioned that the interface component may be housing for materials such as fluid s and or gel s through which the mechanical energy and or electrical energy transmits and or materials at the transducer and or electrode interface through which either or both fields transmit with underlying subject to be stimulated for example an ultrasonic gel which also allows the conduction of electrical fields currents . Thus the interface component does not have to directly house either the electrical source or a means for altering the electromagnetic properties of tissue but it can serve as an interface between tissues and an external electrical source and or an external means for altering electromagnetic tissue properties which are adjacent to the interface which could be matched and or coupled in some way to the tissue to be stimulated and or to each other through the interface apparatus . Thus the interface apparatus could have neither the primary electric source nor the means to alter the electromagnetic properties of the tissue directly embedded within or attached to it but could just serve to match and or couple the properties of at least one of the components together or individually and separately and or the tissue s to be stimulated through the proper matching and or coupling of its material properties inert and or active as exemplified above.

The interface component could also be implemented to augment stimulation in other ways. For example the interface could be used to cool the tissue in the regions of the interface for example if placed on the scalp the interface itself could maintain fluid which couples an ultrasound source to the scalp but could be cooled at the same time such that the scalp and underlying skull itself do not heat due to ultrasound applications. Further the nearby neural tissue can be cooled such that its metabolism is slowed at the surface allowing potentially more focal stimulation below or to enact controlled stimulation at different regions of depth for example where deeper tissues might not be cooled as much as the tissues proximal to the fluids but in a way to help control the effects of neural stimulation . Additionally such cooling could be used to further alter the electromagnetic properties of the tissues.

For all of the different combinations of means for altering the electromagnetic properties of the tissue and the primary electromagnetic source the different source components i.e. primary electrical source and or mechanical chemical thermal optical and or secondary electromagnetic source can also be designed to allow the transmission of the fields or agents etc. through each component if placed in such a way to be in one or another s transmission paths an example of one such permutation is provided in the bridging block example of where an externally applied ultrasound field can transmit through the primary electrical field source. On such example could be an apparatus where the electric field source could be designed of the appropriate acoustic properties such that it does not interfere with the transmission of the ultrasound field to the underlying tissues or the electric field and mechanical field source are the same element s . It is envisioned that any permutation of placements is possible.

As previously mentioned the means for altering the electromagnetic characteristics of tissue may be substituted or combined with any combination of mechanical fields chemical agents thermal fields optical fields beams and or secondary electromagnetic fields. The materials or properties of the interface component can be matched and or coupled with the different sources and or the primary electric field and or the means to alter the tissue electromagnetic properties source s field s and or agent s and or the tissue to facilitate the current alteration process with interface materials that are active and or inert .

Thus the interface apparatus according to the present disclosure could include a chemical source to alter at least one electromagnetic characteristic of the tissue s to be stimulated. In such a situation it is envisioned that the interface component would comprise materials having appropriate properties such that a chemical reaction and or a transmission of chemical agents between tissue and the chemical source is facilitated thereby creating an interface in part between tissue and the chemical source. It is also contemplated that an optical source can be used to alter at least one electromagnetic characteristics of tissue to be stimulated. The interface component could include materials having appropriate optical parameters such that the optical properties of the tissue s source s field s and or the interface are matched and or coupled thereby creating an interface in part between tissue and the optical source. Similarly the means for altering at least one electromagnetic tissue characteristic of tissue s to be stimulated could be a thermal source. The interface component could include materials having appropriate thermodynamic parameters such that the thermodynamic properties of the tissue s source s field s and or the interface are matched and or coupled thereby creating an interface in part between tissue and the thermal source. Further a secondary electromagnetic source could be used and the interface component could incorporate materials having appropriate electromagnetic parameters such that the electromagnetic characteristics betweens the tissue s source s field s and or the interface are matched and or coupled thereby creating an interface in part between said region of tissue and the electromagnetic source. And the interface apparatus according to the present disclosure could include a mechanical acoustic source to alter at least one electromagnetic characteristic of the tissue s to be stimulated. In such a situation it is envisioned that the interface component would comprise materials having appropriate mechanical acoustic properties such that the mechanical acoustic characteristics betweens the tissue s source s field s and or the interface are matched and or coupled thereby creating an interface in part between said region of tissue and the mechanical acoustic source. This concept of matching the properties may be applied in any permutation via the interface and or the tissues and or with any potential sources including the primary electrical source s and or field and or any means for altering the tissue electromagnetic properties i.e. the ultrasound mechanical field and or source s chemical agent and or source s thermal field and or source s optical field beam and or source s and or secondary electromagnetic field and or source s .

As depicted in a second free electrode is attached on the individual to be stimulated at any location such as within the mouth also as an electric source . An electric field is generated between the electrodes. A free standing mechanical source the mechanical source may be for example any acoustic source such as an ultrasound device is applied to the scalp via the interface component and provides concentrated acoustic energy i.e. mechanical field to a focused region of neural tissue affecting a smaller number of neurons than affected by the electric field by the mechanical field altering the tissue electromagnetic characteristics relative to the applied electric field and thereby generating the altered current . Both the electrode and the material inert and or active of the interface component can be designed such that they are acoustically matched and or coupled with the mechanical field that transmits through them for example one could use the matching and or coupling to limit the attenuation and or modification i.e. dispersion effects phase shifting beam focus etc of the mechanical field and or to alter the mechanical fields properties such as to be ideal for stimulation for example through matching the acoustic impedances of the sources with the material of the bridging interface and or the tissues. The interface could also have its electromagnetic properties matched and or altered relative to the electrical source and or the tissues and or the material of the interface bridging block to facilitate the current alteration such as by matching all of the electric impedances of the relevant parts through the appropriately designed interface . One could envision the interface component could be filled with a fluid through which the mechanical field can travel unimpeded where the electrode is an electrically conducting thin latex like membrane connected to a voltage or current source that is coated in a conducting ultrasound gel at the tissue interface boundary through which the ultrasound energy can transmit. The fluid above the membrane could be non conducting such as to prevent the spread of the electric field into the fluid such that electrical energy focused towards the underlying tissue does not spread to the fluid above contained within the interface component . This concept of matching the properties may be applied in any permutation via the interface and or the tissues and or with any potential sources including the primary electrical source s and or any means for altering the tissue electromagnetic properties i.e. the ultrasound mechanical field and or source s chemical agent and or source s thermal field and or source s optical field beam and or source s and or secondary electromagnetic field and or source s .

Additionally neither the electrode nor the mechanical source need to be contained within the interface component but for example in a situation where both are free standing the interface component could be designed to couple the field s transmitted through it to the tissue below through the appropriate acoustic and electric matching and or coupling of the interface component and the tissues below i.e. the mechanical and electrical source make contact with the interface mechanism at its boundary . For example the interface component could be filled and or coated with fluid s such as degassed water and or gel s such as ultrasound coupling gel which in part serves to couple the mechanical ultrasound source with the tissue and or be fabricated of electrically conducting material which focuses an applied electrical field.

Additionally the order in which the primary electrode and mechanical source are applied relative to the tissue and interface component need not be fixed the sources can be designed such that one field could transmit through the other source or placed such that they do not interfere with each others transmission i.e. just through relative positioning or even with a region of one removed so that the transmission path of the other is not crossed in part or full and or such the mechanical and electrical field are generated from the same component . Additionally the interlace component can have ports that can be used to bring materials fluids in and or out and or on and or off of the interface apparatus such as for example with a cooling fluid to circulate degassed water through the apparatus an electrical conducting gel fluid etc .

Another embodiment disclosed herein based on this principles elaborated on throughout could be a tDCS electrode cap which is similar to the above interface apparatus with the means for altering the electromagnetic properties of the tissues to be stimulated removed. The electrodes could be placed for functional targeting based on a subject s specific condition or anatomy. It could also be based on dry electrodes which would not leave debris from stimulation on the subject or based on whatever means was acceptable for medically fixing the electrodes or bridging the electrical fields to the individual s scalp and underlying tissues .

And furthermore the interface component s in conjunction with the altered current generation could similarly be applied in the areas of altering cellular metabolism physical therapy drug delivery and gene therapy as explained in the referenced patent application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 764 468 Apparatus and Method for Stimulation of Biological Tissue and above. These examples are provided not to be exhaustive but as an example of potential applications.

As should be noted by one skilled in the art throughout this entire disclosure the reference to tissue can serve to mean tissue overlying the final stimulated tissue and all or some of the subsequent underlying or proximal tissue to be targeted for stimulation i.e. where fields might be transmitted through multiple tissues before being focused on their final tissue focus such as for example through the skin skull CSF gray matter and white matter to be focused on underlying gray matter nuclei during stimulation of deep gray matter nuclei in the brain i.e. tissue would refer to all of the tissues in the path of the stimulation field s and or agents . Further the different sources i.e. primary electrical source and means for altering the tissue electromagnetic properties can be combined as single units. Additionally the term material is not meant to be exclusive but to refer to both active and or inert materials throughout the document.

In accordance with the present disclosure the embodiments disclosed herein may be used with a process that stimulates tissues through the combined application of electrical and mechanical fields and or chemical agents thermal fields optical fields beams and or secondary electromagnetic fields for the perturbation and or modification of tissue permittivity and or tissue conductivity for the generation of a new and or altered displacement currents and or ohmic currents the generation of a new electric field with corresponding new ohmic and displacement current components generated due to the tissue perturbation relative to the applied electric field and any currents that result due to continuity conditions with altered currents from the tissue electromagnetic property perturbation and or any combination thereof for stimulation.

While the inventions within this disclosure have been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and or foregoing description the same is to be considered as illustrative and not restrictive in character it being understood that embodiments have been shown and described and that all changes and modifications that come within the spirit of these inventions are desired to be protected.
