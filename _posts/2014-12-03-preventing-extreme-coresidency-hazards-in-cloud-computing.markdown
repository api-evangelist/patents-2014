abstract: Various exemplary embodiments relate to a method of preventing extreme coresidency hazards among application instances in a cloud network. The method includes determining a first failure group of a first instance of an application; establishing a connection with a second instance of a peer application; determining a second failure group of the second instance; comparing the first failure group to the second failure group; and establishing a second connection with a third instance of the peer application if the first failure group and the second failure group share a failure point.
