The third party system connector can facilitate publishing data within a third party system and or retrieving data regarding users from the third party system provided appropriate authentication credentials such as a username password pair an authentication token etc. are available. For example a third party system can provide an application programming interface API with which users or other entities can develop applications. The API can subject to authorization of a user expose various functionality of a social networking system to applications using the API such as access to information about users their friends interests images videos etc. In this way the media player application can via the third party system connector and the API publish content and or retrieve content from the third party system and subsequently display the content in a media player user interface as will be described herein.

Also the computing device can include at least one data store which may comprise data and applications operable to provide access to the data stored therein. It should be appreciated that the data store may or may not reside within a computing device but may be accessible via a network to the computing device . The data store can include media which can include various information about media associated with a user that can be consumed in a media player user interface. In the context of the present disclosure media can include audio video images or any other type of media that can be viewed and or streamed to a client . Various media stored in the data store can be associated with one or more users. Accordingly each media entry can be associated with one or more user identifiers . In one embodiment users can purchase and or upload media to be stored in the data store . Therefore the user identifiers associated with media entries can be employed to manage access restrictions and or digital rights management issues as should be appreciated. In one example the user identifiers associated with a media entry can identify users of the system that own or have the authority to download play and or stream the media .

Each media entry can also include a media file . A media file can include a digital media file representing the media entry in one or more of various media formats. For example the media file associated with a media entry can include but is not limited to an MPEG 1 Audio Layer III MP3 file representing an audio track an MPEG 4 audio file flash video fly file or any audio video or image format in which media can be stored and or streamed to a client . Each media entry can also be associated with various meta data which can include artist information a title author album association genre or any other data by which a media entry can be categorized.

The data store can also include user data which can store information about users of a media player application as described herein. User data can include for example a user profile which can include demographic information about a user shipping addresses telephone numbers payment information e mail addresses purchasing history product browsing history affinity groups with which the user is affiliated and other data related to users. User data can also include one or more third party systems with which the user is associated. In one embodiment a user of the media player application can link one or more third party sites with an account of the user which can allow the media player application to access content associated with the user from the third party site as well as potentially publish information about the user s media consumption and or interests in the third party site.

User data can also include identifiers associated with one or more linked users with which the user is linked in a site facilitated by the media player application . Linked users can include friends or other acquaintances of the user that the user has authorized to receive information about the user s media consumption and or interests. Additionally the linked users represent other users for which a user desires to receive information about media consumption and or interests. User data can also include a consumption history associated with a user account. In one embodiment a consumption history can include a browse history of various media available via the media player application media that the user has played and or indicated an interest. Information from the consumption history of the user can be shared with other users of the media player application and or published in third party systems.

The third party system can include any type of user community a microblogging service etc. A user of a social networking system can have an identity and interact with other users of the social networking system publish content and take advantage of other functionality generally found within a social networking system. Users can have a direct connection to other users. In one embodiment a user can establish a direct connection within a third party system with another user who is considered a friend. Users of the social networking system can also have an affiliation with a location interest groups topics or other non user entities. As one example a user in a third party system can establish an association with a university or any other topic that interests the user and be connected with other users establishing the same association. Other variations should be appreciated as should the general functionality of this and other examples of a third party system .

A user of a third party system can publish content that can be viewable to other users linked to the user. In some third party systems for example the content can be available to friends followers and or users in the publisher s network. As some examples the user can publish text images video and other media. In other words a user can publish a feed which can be available to other users in the third party system . Users can also be associated with a timeline and or a news feed which can among other things include information regarding other users with which they are associated in the third party system . As some examples a timeline of a user can include information such as birthdays anniversaries and or other events associated with other users with which the user has a connection. Accordingly the third party system can also maintain a user data store which can house information about the various users the third party system . In the depicted example the user data store can store profile data as well as user associations or linkages within the third party system .

The client is representative of a plurality of devices that may be coupled to the network . The client may comprise for example a processor based system such as a computer system. Such a computer system may be embodied in the form of a desktop computer a laptop computer a personal digital assistant a cellular telephone set top box music players web pads tablet computer systems or other devices with like capability.

The client may be configured to execute various applications such as a browser and or other applications. The browser may be executed in a client for example to access and render network pages such as web pages or other content served up by the computing device and or other servers in which a media player user interface generated by the media player application can be rendered. The client may be configured to execute applications beyond a browser such as for example email applications instant message applications and or other applications. Accordingly in some embodiments a user can manipulate a user interface presented in the form of network pages shown on a display device via the browser or other application that causes interaction with the third party system and or computing device .

Another example of a client that can interact with the third party system and or computing device includes a mobile device which can execute an application such as a browser and or client media player application which can allow the user to download upload and or stream media to or from the media player application as well as transmit and or receive information that can be displayed in the user interface rendered on the client . In some embodiments such a client may also include a desktop computer tablet computing system smartphone or any other device in which a special purpose client media player application can be executed.

Next a general description of the operation of the various components of the networked environment is provided. To begin the media player application can allow users to consume media stored in the data store and or on a client in a media player user interface generated by the media player application and rendered in a browser . The media player application can also provide data that can be displayed in a media player user interface generated by a client media player application executed on a client . In embodiments of the disclosure the media player application can facilitate a social network module in a media player user interface that displays data regarding media consumption of other users to which a user is linked as well as information about media in which the user may have an interest. The social network module populated by the media player application can provide this data in real time as a user is interacting with a media player user interface.

The media player application can capture activity of a user in a media player user interface and generate an update that can be displayed in a social network module in a media player user interface of other users to which the user is linked. In one embodiment a user can authorize various actions to be captured and displayed in a social network module for other users to whom the user is linked in a social networking system or any other system. In other words a user can authorize updates regarding his or her media consumption media interests likes dislikes etc. to friends and or followers. Accordingly the media player application can capture certain actions in a media player user interface related to for example the playing of media e.g. a song album movie video etc. and generate a corresponding update in a social network module of other users whether the media player user interface exists in a client media player application or a browser rendered media player user interface. Similarly the client media player application can also capture various action of a user and transmit data about these actions to the media player application which can update a social network module in a media player user interface of another user.

As another example a media player user interface can include one or more user interface elements that allow a user to indicate that he or she likes a particular media item and a corresponding action can be captured by the media player application . Accordingly the media player application can identify other users to which the user is linked in a social networking system or other system and generate an update in the media player user interface corresponding to these users in real time if these users are associated with a presently executed media player user interface. In another example the media player application can capture actions of a user in a media player user interface and identify other users to which the user is linked generate updates corresponding to these actions and store these updates in a consumption history of the user. Accordingly if another user to which this user is linked later initiates a media player user interface the media player application can populate a social network module with updates from the consumption history . In another embodiment media updates associated with another user to which a user is linked can be stored in an activity feed in a user profile of the user which can be displayed when a user initiates a media player user interface.

Media updates displayed in a social network module can also include information from artists and or publishers of media to which the user has subscribed and or in which the user has expressed an interest. In one embodiment the media player application can identify content related to artists and or publishers in which the user has expressed an interest and update the social network module with the content. For example the media player application can populate the social network module with information about media from an artist available to purchase rental and or download announcements from the artist itself or any other information related to the artist that can be identified by the media player application .

A media player user interface can also allow a user to generate comments that are linked to items presented in a social network module. These comments can be thought of as activity that can in turn be associated with an update that can be presented in the social network modules of other users to which the user generating the comment is linked.

A user can designate various third party systems in which updates corresponding to actions taken by the user in a media player user interface can be published. Accordingly as noted above the media player application can publish updates corresponding to actions in a media player user interface that are captured in various third party systems. Therefore the third party system connector can communicate with an API provided by a third party system to publish an update via an account corresponding to the user corresponding to an action in a media player user interface. In one example the media player application can via the third party system connector generate a post in a microblogging network and or a social networking system in an account corresponding to a user that identifies a track played by the user in a media player user interface. As another example the media player application can generate a post in a social networking system that identifies a song artist album or other aspects of media accessible via the media player application that a user likes. 

The media player application can also retrieve information from third party systems and populate the social network module with information related to a user s media collection the user s interests and or a track currently being played by the user in a media player user interface. As one example the media player application can retrieve content published by or about an artist song and or album in a third party system and populate the social network module with the retrieved content.

The media player application can also allow users to share music with other users to whom they are linked whether they are linked to the user in a social networking system or any other type of system. In this way the media player application can facilitate a communal media experience among linked users. In one embodiment the media player application can populate the social network module with information about a song that a linked user is currently playing. Accordingly the user can join the listening experience with the linked user. In one implementation the media player application can determine a current track position of a track that the linked user is currently playing and initiate a new music stream to the user via a media player user interface that is synchronized with the track position of the linked user. In another embodiment the media player application can simply provide access to the user to an audio stream being transmitted to the linked user.

Additionally the music player application can throttle information that is published in the social network module by publishing information related to media consumption of linked users only when the information is relevant to the user in some way. Accordingly the music player application can calculate a relevance measure that expresses a relevance to the user and only publish media updates associated with linked users when the relevance measure of the media update exceeds a threshold. In one embodiment a high relevance measure can be associated with a media update that is associated with a song artist author title genre and or any other meta data that also exists within a media library of the user. In another embodiment a high relevance measure can be associated with a media update that is associated with a song artist author title genre and or any other meta data that is related to a currently playing track in the media player user interface. In this way media updates that are relevant to media owned by the user can be published while those that are unrelated to media owned by the user are not. Similarly media updates that are relevant to media currently and or recently played by the user in the media player user interface can be published in the social network module while media that is unrelated to media currently and or recently played are not.

In one embodiment the music player application can determine whether a media update is associated with a particular song. Accordingly the music player application can determine whether the user is currently playing and or owns the song in his or her media library. If one or both of the conditions are met the media player application can publish the media update in the social network module . If neither condition is met the media player application can suppress the media update from publication in the social network module .

As another example the music player application can generate media recommendations that may not be present in the media library of the user. Accordingly if a media update is related to a media recommendation associated with the user it can be published in the social network module while media updates that are not related to a music recommendation associated with the user can be suppressed. In one embodiment the music player application can determine whether the media update is associated with an artist genre or other category that is in turn associated with such a media recommendation and suppress media updates that are not. In another embodiment the music player application can determine whether the media update is associated with a specific song that corresponds to a media recommendation and suppress media updates that are not associated with the specific song corresponding to the media recommendation.

Additionally the media player application can also generate updates that express media in which the user has recently expressed a higher degree of interest relative to other media. In other words the media player application can identify certain media in which the user is passionate and generate a corresponding media update that is published in the social network modules of linked users. As an example the media player application can identify media in the consumption history of the user over a predefined period of time e.g. the previous week days amount of usage time etc. that the user has consumed viewed or listened to more often than others. Accordingly the media player application can generate a media update that can be published in the social network module of linked users that expresses that the user has expressed a recent interest or passion in the most often consumed media during the predefined period of time. As another example the media player application can identify other aspects of media in the consumption history of a user and generate corresponding updates for publication to linked users. For example the media player application can identify certain artists genres or other categories of media that are most often consumed by the user over the predefined period of time and generate an update that the user has expressed a recent interest of passion in the most often consumed media. The media player application can also publish data corresponding to media in which the user consumes more often that other media in a profile page associated with the user.

In the depicted example the information feed can include content related to users to whom the user is linked as well as artists in the user s media library and or in which the user has expressed an interest. In this sense the depicted view of the social network module can represent a consolidated information feed that can provide a comprehensive feed. Therefore reference is now made to which represents an alternative example of a social network module in a media player user interface . The example of illustrates one way that an information feed presented in a social network module can be filtered by the user via the media player user interface . In the depicted example the media player application can retrieve information related to and or published by artists in which the user has expressed an interest and or has in a media library.

The example of illustrates examples of content that the media player application can retrieve from various third party systems and with which it can populate the social network module . In the depicted example the content can be retrieved from a social networking system a microblogging network or any other third party system identified by the media player application or the user.

Reference is now made to which illustrates an example of an information feed that contains updates that correspond to activity captured in a media player user interface of users to whom the illustrated user is linked. As noted above the user can be linked to these users via a social networking system microblogging network or any other third party system . In the depicted example the social network module can contain updates that correspond to the playing of a song by a linked user and or other certain actions of the user s interactions with the media player user interface such as the user expressing that he or she likes a certain media item ratings of media entered by the user via the media player application or other information that can be extracted from third party systems that is related to linked users.
