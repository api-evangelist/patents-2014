The invention relates to controlling a plurality of energy loads and or energy supplies to execute a mission. In particular the performance of the energy loads and or energy supplies may be enhanced with respect to one or more mission criteria.

Systems that provide for coordinated control over a plurality of system loads to execute a predetermined plan are known. While such systems may manage the provision of power from energy supplies to the system loads these systems tend to be relatively static. The reconfiguration of the number and or types of system loads and or energy supplies that can be added and or removed from the system may be limited if not impossible. Similarly the coordinated control may be relatively static and may not account for changing conditions within the system loads and energy supplies and or the environment surrounding these components. In conventional systems the system loads and or energy supplies may not be implemented with enhanced efficiency because the control over these components may not be determined based on component capabilities and or operating conditions.

One aspect of the invention relates to controlling the operation and or power of a plurality of energy loads and or energy supplies configured to supply power to the energy loads. The coordinated control over the energy loads and or energy supplies may enable the execution of missions including a one or more objectives by energy loads with an enhanced efficiency autonomy and or effectiveness. Aspects of the planning and or management of execution of the missions may be automated according to predetermined rules and or criteria.

The energy loads and or energy supplies may be associated with a discrete physical vehicle vehicle building permanent or temporary building complex and or other physical system. The operation and or power of the set of system energy loads associated with its associated physical system may be managed so as to enhance the effectiveness efficiency ease of control and or other aspects of the associated physical system as the physical system performs pre defined missions. A mission as used herein may refer at least to a set of one or more tasks and or objectives to be accomplished by the physical system and or its system energy loads . A mission may include a schedule an order and or other temporal parameters for the performance of the tasks and or objectives of the mission.

As an example the physical system may include an unmanned underwater vehicle and the energy loads and or energy supplies may be carried by the unmanned underwater vehicle. The operation and or power of the energy loads and energy supplies associated with the unmanned underwater vehicle may be managed as the unmanned underwater vehicle executes a mission with one or more predefined tasks objectives and or parameters. As another example the physical system may include a temporary building or shelter e.g. a tent configured to serve a predefined purpose e.g. command surveillance and or other purposes . Other examples of the physical systems that may be associated with the managed energy loads and or energy supplies are contemplated.

The energy loads may include system components that are payloads in that they require power to perform their associated functionality. The functionality associated with the different energy loads may be varied. For example the energy loads may include one or more of a sensor configured to detect an environment parameter a communications device a propulsion mechanism a steering and or directional mechanism a processing device an electromagnetic radiation and or sound source navigation system a motor and or other components.

The energy supplies include system components capable of providing power to the energy loads. These components may include power generators energy harvesters and energy storage units e.g. a battery and or other components.

A control system configured to control and or manage the energy loads and or energy sources may include one or more of a plurality of load interfaces a plurality of supply interfaces a communication interface electronic storage a processor and or other components.

The load interfaces may be configured to removably couple the energy loads to the control system so that energy loads can be swapped in and or out of the overall system. Via the load interfaces information may be communicated between the control system and the energy loads. Similarly the supply interfaces may be configured to removably couple the energy supplies to the control system such that information may be communicated between the control system and the energy loads. The load interfaces and or the supply interfaces may be configured to enable any of a plurality of different types of energy loads and or supplies to be releasably coupled to the control system in a uniform manner. As such the load interfaces and or the supply interfaces may be configured to interface energy loads and or supplies of a variety of different types with different power and communication requirements and or specification to be coupled with the control system. This along with other features of the control system may create a plug and play aspect of the control system in which individual energy loads and or energy supplies can be selectively connected and or disconnected with the control system to provide the external system associated with the control system with selected capabilities and or attributes without reconfiguring the rest of the external system or the control system.

The load interfaces and or the supply interfaces may form part of a power distribution sub system within the control system that couples the energy supplies with the energy loads and or with each other for the transmission of power therebetween. For example the power distribution sub system may include a bus that enables power and or information to be exchanged between the load interfaces and the supply interfaces. The power distribution system may include a controller. The controller may serve as an interface for the power distribution sub system with the rest of the control system.

The processor may be configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The one or more computer program modules may include one or more of a load module a supply module a mission interface module a plan module an execution module and or other modules.

The load module may be configured to obtain information related to the energy loads coupled with the control system. The load module may obtain such information via the communication interface from an external entity e.g. a user an external database and or other external entities from the energy loads themselves e.g. over the load interfaces and or other information sources. In some implementations the load module may obtain information related to the energy loads automatically. The information related to the energy loads may be obtained by the load module at start up of the control system and or the energy loads upon installation of an energy load at a load interface in an ongoing manner during operation of the energy loads and or at other times.

The information related to the energy loads obtained by the load module may include one or more of a parameter of required power a functional capability an operating status a control mode a load type an output signal indicating an environmental parameter an operating condition and or other information. A parameter of required power may include for example one or more of a polarity alternating current direct current voltage amount current amount frequency phase and or other parameters. A functional capability may include for example one or more of a sensitivity e.g. for sensor detector loads a thrust parameter e.g. for propulsion loads a transmission capability e.g. for communications loads and or other information identifying and or quantifying the functional capabilities of one or more of the energy loads. An operating status may include for example one or more of a powered off status a powered on status an offline status an online status a limited operational status a full operational status a malfunction status and or other statuses of the energy loads. A control mode may include for example an automated mode a manual control mode e.g. by an external entity and or other control modes. An operating condition may include for example an output an operating temperature an operating efficiency an operating speed an operating rate and or other operating conditions.

The supply module may be configured to obtain information related to the energy supplies coupled with the control system. The supply module may obtain such information from an external entity e.g. a user an external database and or other external entities from the energy supplies themselves e.g. over the supply interfaces and or other information sources. In some implementations the supply module may obtain information related to the energy supplies from one or more external entities automatically. For example one of the energy supplies may transmit a load identifier to the supply module and the supply module may request information related to the load associated with the load identifier from an external entity. The information related to the energy supplies may be obtained by the supply module at start up of the control system and or the energy supplies upon installation of an energy supply at a supply interface in an ongoing manner during operation of the energy supplies and or at other times.

The information related to the energy supplies obtained by the supply module may include one or more of a parameter of supplied power a maximum capacity a current capacity a harvesting parameter an operating status a control mode an energy supply type a resource availability an operating condition a discharge rate and or other information. A parameter of supplied power may include for example a polarity alternating current direct current voltage amount current amount frequency phase and or other parameters. A harvesting parameter may include for example a parameter of power that can be generated through a harvesting generator a parameter that impacts power generated by and or the generation process of a harvesting generator and or other parameters related to the harvesting of energy. An operating status may include for example one or more of a powered off status a powered on status an offline status an online status a limited operational status a full operational status a malfunction status and or other statuses of the energy loads. A control mode may include for example an automated mode a manual control mode e.g. by an external entity and or other control modes. A resource availability may refer to and or quantify an availability of a resource used by one of the energy supplies to generate energy. An operating condition may include for example an output an operating temperature an operating efficiency an operating speed an operating rate and or other operating conditions.

The mission interface module may be configured to obtain information related to a mission to be performed by the energy loads and or the energy supplies coupled to the control system. This information may include objectives and or tasks specific ones of the energy loads that are to perform the objectives and or tasks temporal parameters mission criteria and or other information related to a mission. The information may be obtained over the communication interface from an external entity. By way of non limiting example a user may input information defining a mission to the control system via the communication interface.

The plan module may be configured to generate a mission plan for executing a mission defined by information obtained by the mission interface module. A mission plan may identify specific functions to be performed by individual ones of the energy loads in order to fulfill the tasks and or objectives of the mission. The mission plan may include temporal parameters such as timing duration and or other parameters for performance of the specific functions by the individual ones of the energy loads that enable the energy loads to satisfy any temporal parameters of the mission. The mission plan may identify specific functions to be performed by individual ones of the energy supplies to provide power sufficient to enable the energy loads to perform the objectives and or tasks of the mission. The mission plan may include temporal parameters such as timing duration and or other parameters for performance of the specific functions to be performed by the individual energy supplies to ensure that the power provided to the energy loads will be provided at the appropriate times.

In some instances functions to be performed by individual ones of the energy supplies may be conditional on performance of one or more of the energy supply. For example the mission plan may indicate that one or more of the energy supplies are to remain on providing power until a specified one or more of the energy loads have completed an assigned function e.g. arrived at a predetermined location and or other functions .

Upon receiving information defining a mission plan from the mission interface module and information related to the energy loads and energy supplies from the load module and the supply module the plan module may analyze the information to ensure that all of the tasks and or objectives can be performed by the current configuration of the energy loads and the energy supplies being managed by the system. This may involve running the information defining the mission through a rules based analysis that identifies tasks objectives and or combinations of tasks and or objectives that are not within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies. For example a task or objective may not be within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies if the energy loads do not include energy load s capable of performing a function necessary for completing a task or objective. As another example if the energy supplies are not capable of providing power that enables the energy loads to perform a function necessary for completing a task or objective then that task or objective may not be within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies. As another example temporal restraints associated with one or more tasks and or objectives may be beyond the capabilities of the energy loads and or the ability of the energy supplies to power the energy loads.

The rules used to determine whether all of the tasks and or objectives can be performed by the current configuration of energy loads and energy supplies being managed by the control system may be somewhat dynamic e.g. changing automatically over time in that they may be based on the current configuration of the energy loads and energy supplies. As the information obtained by the load module and or the supply module indicates that one or more of the energy loads and or energy supplies has been added and or removed then the rules may adapt automatically to accommodate such changes.

If the plan module determines that one or more of the objectives and or tasks associated with a mission cannot be completed the plan module may generate a notification to the external entity that input the mission to the control system. If the plan module determines that two or more of the objectives and or tasks associated with a mission conflict less than all of them can be completed with existing capabilities resources the plan module may determine which of the conflicting objectives and or tasks should be performed. This determination may be based on user selection on a predetermined prioritization of objectives and or tasks and or to minimize the number of objectives and or tasks that are omitted from the mission plan.

In some cases certain tasks and or objectives within a given plan may be accomplished by the energy loads and or the energy supplies in a variety of different combinations. The plan module may designate a possible combination of energy loads and or energy supplies and or temporal parameters such that the cumulative performance of the energy loads and or the energy supplies over the course of the mission will be enhanced with respect to one or more predetermined criteria. By way of non limiting example such criteria may include energy efficiency temporal speed mission endurance and or other criteria. The criteria for a given mission may be established by the information obtained by the mission interface module related to the mission by a system setting and or otherwise established.

In some implementations the load module and or the supply module may be configured to obtain information related to the energy loads and or the energy supplies during the execution of a mission. In such implementations the plan module may be configured to adjust the mission plan to accommodate changing and or unforeseen circumstances. For example one or more of the energy loads and or energy supplies may not operate at its typical capacity efficiency and or effectiveness which may require adjustment of the mission plan. As another example environmental conditions may inhibit and or aid performance of the tasks and or objectives in the mission thereby requiring the adjustment of the mission plan. For instance under certain ambient temperature conditions some types of batteries may deliver less efficiently than other attached energy supplies e.g. a fuel cell . As another example an amount of stored energy within one or more of the energy supplies may fall below an anticipated and or threshold amount which may require adjustment of the mission plan to account for the unexpectedly low amount of stored energy. Other examples of circumstances that may result in adjustment of the mission plan by the plan module are contemplated.

Adjustments to the mission plan made by the plan module as the mission is ongoing may be determined to maintain enhanced cumulative performance of the energy loads and or the energy supplies with respect to the mission criteria. However in some implementations information obtained by the load module and or the supply module related to current circumstances during execution of the mission may result in changes being made by the plan module to the criteria used to determine the mission plan.

The execution module may be configured to generate machine readable instructions for the energy loads and or the energy supplies and to communicate the instructions to the energy loads and or the energy supply with appropriate timing to cause the energy loads and or the energy supplies to execute the mission plan. The instructions may be communicated to the energy loads and or energy supplies through the power distribution sub system e.g. the load interfaces and or supply interfaces . In some implementations instructions generated by the execution module may be translated formatted and or otherwise altered by the controller of the power distribution sub system controller to be usable by the specific energy load and or energy supply for which the instructions are intended. In some implementation this functionality may be provided by the execution module rather than the power distribution sub system controller.

This information may include objectives and or tasks specific ones of energy loads that are to perform the objectives and or tasks temporal parameters mission criteria and or other information related to a mission. The information may be obtained over communication interface from an external entity. By way of non limiting example a user may input information defining a mission to system via communication interface e.g. over a network connection at a user interface connected with system at communication interface etc. .

Mission interface module may enable one or more users to access mission information. This may include information obtained by mission interface module that defines a mission information generated by energy loads and or energy supplies during a mission e.g. output data etc. and or other information. To safeguard such information and to limit the ability of unauthorized users to input mission information to system mission interface module may be configured to require users to authenticate themselves before receiving access to system and or information associated therewith. Authentication may include receiving and verifying authentication information associated with users. The authentication information may include for example a username a password an ID biometric information and or other information.

Information defining a mission may be obtained in it entirety by mission interface module over communication interface and or one or more missions may be at least partially pre stored e.g. in electronic storage . To define a mission a user may specify a pre stored mission and or may make changes or refinements thereto to fully define the mission.

The plan module may be configured to generate a mission plan for executing a mission defined by information obtained by mission interface module . A mission plan may identify specific functions to be performed by individual ones of energy loads in order to fulfill the tasks and or objectives of the mission. The mission plan may include temporal parameters such as timing duration and or other parameters for performance of the specific functions by the individual ones of energy loads that enable energy loads to satisfy any temporal parameters of the mission. The mission plan may identify specific functions to be performed by individual ones of energy supplies to provide power sufficient to enable energy loads to perform the objectives and or tasks of the mission. The mission plan may include temporal parameters such as timing duration and or other parameters for performance of the specific functions to be performed by the individual energy supplies to ensure that the power provided to energy loads will be provided at the appropriate times.

In some instances functions to be performed by individual ones of energy supplies may be conditional on performance of one or more of energy supply . For example the mission plan may indicate that one or more of energy supplies are to remain on providing power until a specified one or more of energy loads have completed an assigned function e.g. arrived at a predetermined location and or other functions .

Upon receiving information defining a mission plan from mission interface module plan module may analyze the information to ensure that all of the tasks and or objectives can be performed by the current configuration of energy loads and energy supplies being managed by system . This may involve running the information defining the mission through a rules based analysis that identifies tasks objectives and or combinations of tasks and or objectives that are not within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies . For example a task or objective may not be within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies if the energy loads do not include energy load s capable of performing a function necessary for completing a task or objective. As another example if the energy supplies are not capable of providing power that enables energy loads to perform a function necessary for completing a task or objective then that task or objective may not be within the capabilities of the current energy loads and or energy supplies . As another example temporal restraints associated with one or more tasks and or objectives may be beyond the capabilities of energy loads and or the ability of energy supplies to power the energy loads .

The rules used to determine whether all of the tasks and or objectives can be performed by the current configuration of energy loads and energy supplies being managed by system may be somewhat dynamic e.g. changing automatically over time in that they may be based on the current configuration of energy loads and energy supplies . As the information obtained by load module and or supply module indicates that one or more energy loads and or energy supplies has been added and or removed then the rules may adapt automatically to accommodate such changes.

If plan module determines that one or more of the objectives and or tasks associated with a mission cannot be completed plan module may generate a notification to the external entity that input the mission to system . If plan module determines that two or more of the objectives and or tasks associated with a mission conflict less than all of them can be completed with existing capabilities resources plan module may determine which of the conflicting objectives and or tasks should be performed. This determination may be based on user selection on a predetermined prioritization of objectives and or tasks and or to minimize the number of objectives and or tasks that are omitted from the mission plan.

In some cases certain tasks and or objectives within a given plan may be accomplished by energy loads and or energy supplies in a variety of different combinations. Plan module may designate a possible combination of energy loads and or energy supplies and or temporal parameters such that the cumulative performance of energy loads and or energy supplies over the course of the mission will be enhanced with respect to one or more predetermined criteria. By way of non limiting example such criteria may include energy efficiency temporal speed mission endurance and or other criteria. The criteria for a given mission may be established by the information obtained by mission interface module related to the mission by a system setting and or otherwise established.

In some implementations load module and or supply module may be configured to obtain information related to energy loads and or energy supplies during the execution of a mission. In such implementations plan module may be configured to adjust the mission plan to accommodate changing and or unforeseen circumstances. For example one or more of energy loads and or energy supplies may not operate at its typical capacity efficiency and or effectiveness which may require adjustment of the mission plan. As another example environmental conditions may inhibit and or aid performance of the tasks and or objectives in the mission thereby requiring the adjustment of the mission plan. For instance under certain ambient temperature conditions some types of batteries may deliver less efficiently than other attached energy producers e.g. a fuel cell . As another example an amount of stored energy within one or more of energy supplies may fall below an anticipated and or threshold amount which may require adjustment of the mission plan to account for the unexpectedly low amount of stored energy. Other examples of circumstances that may result in adjustment of the mission plan by plan module are contemplated.

Adjustments to the mission plan made by plan module as the mission is ongoing may be determined to maintain enhanced cumulative performance of energy loads and or energy supplies with respect to the mission criteria. However in some implementations information obtained by load module and or supply module related to current circumstances during execution of the mission may result in changes being made by plan module to the criteria used to determine the mission plan.

The execution module may be configured to generate machine readable instructions for energy loads and or energy supplies and to communicate the instructions to energy loads and or energy supply with appropriate timing to cause energy loads and or energy supplies to execute the mission plan. The instructions may be communicated to energy loads and or energy supplies through power distribution system e.g. load interfaces and or supply interfaces . In some implementations instructions generated by execution module may be translated formatted and or otherwise altered by controller to be usable by the specific energy load and or energy supply for which the instructions are intended. In some implementation this functionality may be provided by execution module .

In some implementations method may be implemented in one or more processing devices e.g. a digital processor an analog processor a digital circuit designed to process information an analog circuit designed to process information a state machine and or other mechanisms for electronically processing information . The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices executing some or all of the operations of method in response to instructions stored electronically on an electronic storage medium. The one or more processing devices may include one or more devices configured through hardware firmware and or software to be specifically designed for execution of one or more of the operations of method .

At an operation a determination is made as to whether the mission is complete. If the mission is complete then method is ended.
