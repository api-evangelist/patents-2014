This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 299 938 entitled System and Method for Hand Offs in Cloud Environments filed Nov. 18 2011 the contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.

The invention relates generally to the field of application service hosting cloud computing systems and more particularly to handling of hand offs of application service hosting between cloud environments.

Cloud computing environments have turned around the manner in which business organizations examine the requirements and capacity to implement their data processing needs. A cloud computing environment includes capabilities where the cloud provider hosts the hardware and related items and provides systems and computational power as a service to a customer e.g. a business organization . When implementing data processing needs via a cloud vendor a customer does not need to bear the cost of space energy and maintenance in order to acquire the required computational resources at a reasonable cost in a fast and efficient manner.

In a typical scenario it is substantially cumbersome for organizations to take care of their governance needs when operating in a cloud environment. In cloud environments there is a need to move items e.g. infrastructure application s or storage out of the premises to a different physical and or logical location. In such a scenario conventionally organizations do not have a mechanism to ensure compliance to policies and security issues. This is true even though the customers are dealing with just one cloud vendor or cloud computing service provider that the organization utilizes for various items.

The current trends and analysis by different market study groups indicate that the scenario and the landscape in the cloud computing environment will continue to change and there will be more vendors in the market in the near future. Over a period of time customers may be dealing directly or indirectly with multiple cloud vendors and therefore there is a need for an automated tool that will help customers with their governance policies assets and resource profiles. These and other drawbacks exist in conventional systems.

In some implementations these and other drawbacks of existing systems are addressed where provided is a system method and computer readable storage medium having one or more computer readable instructions thereon for handling hand offs in a cloud computing environment. The method includes identifying at a cloud governance module of a computing or server device a plurality of applications executing on a plurality of servers belonging to a plurality of cloud computing service providers. The method includes determining at the cloud governance module a plurality of governance policies associated with the identified plurality of applications determining at the cloud governance module based upon information in a policy module to hand off an execution of at least one identified application executing on a first cloud computing service provider platform to a second cloud computing service provider determining at the cloud governance module whether the second cloud computing service provider satisfies one or more governance policies associated with the at least one identified application and handing off using the cloud governance module the execution of the at least one identified application to a second cloud computing provider platform based upon the second cloud computing provider being compliant with the one or more governance policies associated with the at least one identified application wherein the hand off includes a transfer of a current state associated with the execution of the at least one identified application to the second cloud computing service platform.

Various other objects features and advantages of the invention will be apparent through the detailed description and the drawings attached hereto. It is also to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and not restrictive of the scope of the invention.

In some implementations server device may include at least one hardware computing device having an operating system disk drives interfaces ports memory buses cooling sub systems and various software stored therein on tangible computer readable media. Specifically in some implementations server device may include a cloud governance module or cloud governance system as described below for handling hand offs of applications service hosting between cloud vendors C1 Cn in a cloud computing environment such as environment . In some implementations server device although shown separate from cloud vendors C1 Cn in environment may be a part of one of cloud vendors C1 Cn. In some implementations server device may be a server supporting a plurality of applications for one or more client devices for example a product . In some implementations server device can include a security device that monitors various security aspects for an organization in environment . In some implementations server device may include or interface with one or more tangible computer readable storage media configured to store one or more software modules wherein the software modules include computer readable instructions that when executed by one or more processors in server device may cause the processors to perform the functions related to handling handoffs of applications service hosting between cloud vendors C1 Cn as described herein. In some implementations server device may include computer hardware programmed with a computer application having one or more software modules that enable the various features and functions related to handling hand offs of applications service hosting between cloud vendors in a cloud computing environment as described herein. It will be appreciated that in some implementations server device may be located remote from a physical location of the organization e.g. on a home computer of a user within the organization s network and various implementations of the present invention are not limited by the location of server device . Further although one server device is shown in some implementations cloud vendors C1 Cn may communicate in parallel or in series with a plurality of different types of server devices including but not limited to mobile and desktop client computing devices.

In some implementations cloud governance module may be implemented using one or more programming languages such as C Java or other programming languages known to one of ordinary skill in the art. In some implementations cloud governance module may include instructions causing the processors of server device to perform the features and functions described herein for enforcing governance and policy compliance of applications e.g. product . For example such features and functions may include identifying at cloud governance module a plurality of applications executing on a plurality of servers S1 S17 belonging to a plurality of cloud computing service providers C1 Cn determining a plurality of governance policies associated with the identified plurality of applications determining at the cloud governance module to hand off an execution of at least one identified application executing on a first cloud computing service provider platform e.g. a WINDOWS operating system platform of cloud vendor C1 provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond Wash. customized in one implementation to a second cloud computing service provider platform e.g. a differently customized WINDOWS operating system platform of cloud vendor C2 . In some implementations such determination to switch or hand off may be triggered by information received from a policy module interchangeably referred to as a policy data store or a policy database . The features and functions may include determining whether the second cloud computing service provider satisfies one or more governance policies associated with the at least one identified application. If the second cloud computing provider is compliant with the one or more governance policies associated with the at least one identified application handing off the execution of the at least one identified application to a second cloud computing provider platform is carried out. The hand off may include a transfer of a current state associated with the execution of the at least one identified application to the second cloud computing service platform.

In some implementations a product is used by a user of an organization at one of client devices and partially supported by server device or other server e.g. one or more of servers S1 S17 . Product may be one of a plurality of products that are partially supported by server device or other servers e.g. one or more of servers S1 S17 . In some implementations product may be an application executing on server device but presented to a user at one of client devices and supported by one of cloud vendors C1 Cn. In some implementations product may be a dormant application that can be executed based upon either user actions electronic communication received from cloud vendors C1 Cn or upon receipt of controlling electronic communications from an external device e.g. a system administrator server not shown . In some implementations product may be a software product e.g. a software application or software module managed by cloud governance module . In some implementations product may be a hardware product e.g. a printing device managed by cloud governance module . Generally product may be any resource or asset used by an organization utilizing cloud governance module for implementing computing or workflow needs. Further it will be appreciated that product may be located remote from a physical location of the organization e.g. on a home computer of a user within the organization s network and various implementations of the present invention are not limited by the location of product .

In some implementations as noted earlier server device may include policy module . In some implementations policy module may be a database storing policies in a memory device e.g. one or the one or more memory devices in server device . Policies stored in and or implemented by policy module may facilitate an organization s needs related to compliance e.g. security compliance compliance to a service level agreement or the like . The policies stored in and or enforced by policy module may include various policies that an organization would use to define the aspects that organization wants to be compliant for. By way of example only and not by way of limitation in some implementations such policies include policies for evaluating cloud vendors C1 Cn. For example cloud governance module may search for services across different cloud vendors C1 Cn and understand their respective services costs and other parameters e.g. availability through their published information. That is cloud governance module may know what it is looking for e.g. operating system information network interface cards NICs or applications and based on what is available with different cloud vendors C1 Cn may narrow on the most suitable or compliant or best vendor that may satisfy the criteria from the policies in policy module . In some implementations system administrators may create profiles and resources that match these profiles from a particular cloud in cloud vendors C1 Cn that is searched. In some implementations governance risk and compliance GRC profiles described below for the cloud resources can be searched. Such searched GRC profiles may be compared with stored governance policies e.g. hand off policies in policy module or with policies stored elsewhere in server device .

By way of example only the policies can be implemented in policy module cloud governance module or both using Extensible Markup Language XML and be stored as an XML format file e.g. in policy module of server device or any other device with storage that is capable of communicating with server device internally and or externally. When in XML format appropriate tags may be included in the policy files making the policies easy to extend as well as bring in the benefits of using a language like XML. In XML a tag is what is written between angled brackets i.e. XML tags open with a symbol. The tags are indicated in matched pairs with defined elements rules or policies between the open and close tag. For example is an example for an opening tag and the corresponding closing tag would be . Tags identify and include various parameters variables and attributes that universally define the policies. Since XML tags are known to those of ordinary skill in the art they will not be further described. An advantage of using XML format is that XML has a more universal acceptance among different cloud vendors although other customized implementations of policies in other computer languages may be used.

In some implementations policies may include operational control requisites of applications and hosts e.g. servers S1 S17 of respective cloud vendors C1 Cn in environment . For example policies may specify requirements for a need to have Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP enabled have standards on a specific update of the Operating System that is to be used in software production environments or other hardware or software rules such as capabilities to specify GRC profiles for assets to be classified and protected based on the security levels and applications used. In some implementations there are the policies that are needed for trusted hand offs across multiple cloud vendors C1 Cn. In some implementations the policies include rules methods for facilitating hand offs of execution of product between cloud vendors C1 Cn in trusted ways.

In some implementations server device or other server of environment may include an application module not shown . Application module supports various software applications e.g. product used by a user of server device at one of client devices . Such applications include but are not restricted to network applications word processing and spreadsheet applications and the like. In some implementations application module includes a plurality of products that are supported by server device such as product or applications executing on server device or other server and supported by one of cloud vendors C1 Cn. In some implementations the applications are dormant applications that can be executed based upon either user actions electronic communication received from cloud vendors C1 Cn or upon receipt of controlling electronic communications from an external device e.g. a system administrator server not shown . Generally application module supports resources or assets used by an organization in environment for implementing computing or workflow needs.

In some implementations client devices interact directly or indirectly through server device with a plurality of cloud computing service providers C1 Cn via wired wireless optical or other types of communication links over network known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Client devices are computing devices known to those of ordinary skill in the art e.g. mobile or desktop computing devices . In some implementations one or more client devices may access resources provided by cloud vendors C1 Cn directly without routing the requests through server device as shown in . In some implementations one or more client devices may access resources provided by cloud vendors C1 Cn through server device e.g. when executing an application such as product provided by one of cloud vendors C1 Cn .

In some implementations network may be the Internet or the World Wide Web www . In some implementations network may be a switching fabric that is part of a Wide Area Network WAN Local Area Network LAN or other types of networks known to those of ordinary skill in the art e.g. a TCP IP network . In some implementations network routes requests from server device and or client devices for accessing various resources provided by cloud vendors C1 Cn.

In some implementations a plurality of cloud vendors C1 Cn in environment each include one or more servers e.g. servers S1 S6 in cloud vendor C1 servers S7 S10 in cloud vendor C2 and servers S12 S17 in cloud vendor Cn that provide various services to server device or otherwise provide access services to product that are associated with applications services. Further any number of servers communicably connected in known ways may be used as appropriate for cloud vendors C1 Cn and the number and types of connections shown for the servers S1 S17 in is by way of example only and not by way of limitation. In some implementations cloud vendors C1 Cn are internal to the customer business organization using environment . In some implementations cloud vendors C1 Cn are external to the customer business organization. An example of cloud vendors C1 Cn can include cloud computing services provided by Amazon.com Inc. of Seattle Wash. although other vendors may be used.

Referring to in an operation cloud governance module may identify an application e.g. product executing on one or more servers e.g. servers S1 S6 S7 S11 or S12 S17 belonging to a respective plurality of cloud computing service providers C1 Cn. In some implementations cloud governance module carries out such identification using stored lists or data associated with product and other applications services. In some implementations the stored lists or data may be stored in one or more memory devices of server device . Stored list or data include specific details related to an application e.g. product . These specific details may include for example a type of the application a platform on which the application runs a time when the application typically runs input and output for the application and the like. New applications can be added for example to a dynamic list maintained or stored in one or more memory devices of server device .

In an operation cloud governance module identifies one or more governance policies associated with the identified applications e.g. product and servers supporting those applications. Such policies may be stored for example at policy module of server device . By way of example only and not by way of limitation policies include governance policies associated with network security hand off management network protocols application support network hardware support user authentication operating system requirements audit compliance user and cloud computing provider profile management types of applications supported by cloud vendors C1 Cn storage parameters network operability energy efficiency green vendors application version user security profiles support for helpdesk applications and the like. For example a set of policies may be in the form of XML tagged file stored in policy module and or one or more memory devices of server device having instructions such as search only 64 bit operating system hosts with 2 NIC cards and turn on network protocol management Telnet and File Transfer Protocol. In some implementations the policies could be related to GRC profiles including for example documenting user log on and log off with time stamps only.

In some implementations if no policies are found or are identifiable for one or more identified applications cloud governance module may create one or more policies. The policies may be created using for example a graphical user interface GUI or an XML file directly by manipulating the XML file without going through a user interface. In some implementations cloud governance module may search GRC policies for the resources to be searched on cloud vendors C1 Cn. For example such searching may include determining what to search for across cloud vendors C1 Cn. The GRC policies are profiles for hosts servers that indicate what kind of systems are being searched for by cloud governance module from a compliance perspective. In some implementations cloud governance module may create policies using GUI or XML file directly for trusted hand offs of active and or dormant applications across cloud vendors C1 Cn whenever issues related to operational efficiency for example with respect to cost time saved executing the applications and the like are detected by cloud governance module . In such an implementation the GUI or XML files may be stored in one or more memory devices of server device linked to or within policy module . By way of example only a trusted hand off policy can indicate that a cloud vendor among cloud vendors C1 Cn never be scheduled to run finance applications and another cloud vendor always run storage applications but no finance applications. Generally the trusted hand off policy may be applied to any kind of application including e.g. product . For example if there is a low cost vendor whose security is not assured but is of interest from a cost perspective nonetheless a policy to exclude that vendor from participating in searches for any sensitive applications can be set. In some implementations if there is a vendor that is known to consistently be the least cost vendor all non sensitive non critical applications may be scheduled on that vendor s devices by default.

In some implementations creation of new policies may include updating already existing policies in policy module . Such creation of new policies may be triggered for example by one or more new applications being added to a list of applications maintained by server device and executing on one or more of servers S1 S17 of cloud vendors C1 Cn.

In an operation cloud governance module makes a determination to switch between or hand off an execution of at least one identified application e.g. product executing on a first cloud computing service provider platform e.g. C1 s server platform to a second cloud computing service provider e.g. C2 s server platform . In some implementations such determination may be made based upon information stored in policy module . In some implementations such determination may be triggered by cloud governance module receiving a notification from the first cloud computing service provider e.g. C1 of an inability to support executing at least one identified application at a future instance of time. In some implementations such determination may be triggered by cloud governance module receiving another notification from a system administrator of environment regarding an availability of a better application support capability and or cost effectiveness of the second cloud computing service provider e.g. C2 . In some implementations such determination may be triggered by cloud governance module receiving yet another notification from a security device in the computing device regarding a security breach detected at the first cloud computing service provider e.g. C1 . In some implementations a change in policies may prompt cloud governance module to initiate hand off of product .

In response to such determination to switch in an operation cloud governance module searches for cloud vendors having resources that are acceptable according to the policies associated with applications services e.g. product at issue. In some implementations such resources may be continuously searched they may be searched at periodic time intervals or at random instances of time on an as needed basis. In some implementations cloud governance module may utilize policy module for searching for such resources. Examples of such resources include but are not limited to hardware storage space operating system connection bandwidth processing capability and the like. For example cloud governance module may search for better resources in terms of cost of operation security strength support platform type resource utilization and or other parameters useful for executing product in the best or optimum manner as can be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. In some implementations cloud vendors C1 Cn may bid for such resources upon receiving an indication from cloud governance module that a search for such vendors and or resources for a new or existing application has been initiated. In some implementations each of cloud vendors C1 Cn publishes information about services it offers cost capacity size etc for example through web services. In some implementation the search uses the published information to determine a cloud vendor among cloud vendors C1 Cn that is acceptable according to the policy of the application at issue.

In an operation using one or more processors in server device cloud governance module determines whether or not resources compliant with policies in policy module and cost effective to run one or more applications e.g. product were found. In some implementations cloud governance module may rely upon published web services application programming interfaces APIs or the like to perform such determination of availability of compliant resources.

If a new vendor is not found in an operation cloud governance module may maintain status quo and continue execution of the applications on the cloud vendor in the plurality of cloud vendors C1 Cn on which the applications were currently or previously being supported. In this scenario cloud governance module may ignore the indication to switch the execution of identified application e.g. product to a different cloud vendor e.g. since there may be a compromise on policy enforcement if the switching of execution of the identified application is carried out . In some implementations if there is an unconditional request or indication to switch cloud governance module may switch to a different cloud vendor but with limited functionalities of the executing application being offered to a user of server device since the new cloud vendor on which the application is executed may not be the best cloud vendor among cloud vendors C1 Cn in terms of policy enforcement.

However when in operation cloud governance module detects or determines that better policy compliant resources exist in cloud vendors C1 Cn the flow proceeds to were in an operation cloud governance module then determines whether the resources found are for a new or a dormant application or for an already existing application e.g. product on server device . For example independent of whether an application is running on server device or other server cloud governance module may by itself proactively perform search for cloud vendors that are best suited e.g. as part of optimizing cloud vendor costs for the customer for various applications services. In such situations cloud governance module may obtain resources that may be for applications that are not currently active but are frequently active on server device or applications that cloud governance module may support in the future i.e. new applications . In some implementations cloud governance module may obtain resources for an already executing application or service e.g. product . In some implementations such detection of whether resources obtained are for new or already existing applications is carried out by cloud governance module using parameters from the published services and information about existing applications. For example a storage application may require 100 TB of space and the current cloud vendor charges 100 for 100 TB of space. Using published service information from another vendor in cloud vendors C1 Cn cloud governance module finds that the other vendor is providing same space for 70. In such a scenario there is optimization of costs possible and cloud governance module will initiate the move to the other vendor that offers the same storage space at a lower cost albeit under same compliance with policies as the prior cloud vendor or upon satisfying optimum performance metrics related to compliance with policies. In some implementations such cost analysis may be tied to policies stored in policy module . For example such cost analysis may itself be a policy stored in policy module .

If the resources are determined to be for a new application in an operation cloud governance module books reserves those resources and schedules the new application for continuing execution on one of the cloud vendors C1 Cn on which the resources were found and the flow returns to operation . In some implementations booking may be performed through any Web Services APIs known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example Elastic Compute Cloud EC2 provided by Amazon.com Inc. of Seattle Wash. publishes a well defined set of Web Services carry out various actions including booking of resources which may be used to carry out the booking.

However if the resources found are determined to be for an existing executing application e.g. product cloud governance module determines in an operation whether or not the cloud vendor in the plurality of cloud vendors C1 Cn that has the found resources is the same cloud vendor e.g. C1 that is currently executing the existing application e.g. product . If yes cloud governance module carries out operation again if needed or else simply continues the execution of the existing application e.g. product and the flow of process then returns to operation in via connector Z.

If the better resources are found at a cloud vendor different from the cloud vendor that is executing the existing application e.g. product in an operation cloud governance module then checks hand off policies in policy module such that the existing executing application e.g. product can be transferred to the new cloud vendor in the plurality of cloud vendors C1 Cn without disruption in the execution of the existing application. In some implementations to ensure no disruption of the executing application s e.g. product the server system on a second cloud vendor is readied while the application is still executing on the first server of the first cloud vendor by allocating hardware and or software resources on the second cloud vendor for continuing execution of the application. Once the second server is ready the application from the first server will be moved by cloud governance module to the second and will start executing from the point where it left off on the first server. In some implementations hand off policies are defined as those governance policies that facilitate hand off of the executing application e.g. product to a new cloud vendor in cloud vendors C1 Cn. The hand off policies may have additional information like how much of the executing application e.g. product has been completed what are the current parameters associated with the application that are being processed what is the intermediate output of such processing what are the other systems servers that are participating in the execution of the application. In some implementations cloud governance module may retrieve the hand off policies from policy module . By way of example only such hand off policies include but are not limited to determining at what stage of completion a current executing application is at. For example product may be at an 80 completion level with cloud vendor C1 and cloud governance module may determine not to switch to a different cloud vendor e.g. C2 at such an advanced state of completion and may by pass such a determination to switch.

In some implementations checking carried out in operation includes determining at cloud governance module whether the second cloud computing service provider satisfies one or more governance policies e.g. hand off policies associated with the at least one identified application. This determination can include one or more of determining an existence of the one or more policies at cloud governance module or policy module or both updating the one or more existing policies at cloud governance module or policy module or both as discussed with respect to operation and creating a new set of policies when the one or more policies are determined to be non existent as also discussed with respect to operation . The newly created policies may then be stored in policy module . Since the executing application is being moved in real time from one vendor servers to other vendor s servers this could give rise to a situation where the executing application is mid way in its execution. Such a situation may entail transfer of context information described below associated with the execution of the application to the other vendor so that the executing application continues where it was left at the first vendor and not start all the way from beginning.

In an operation cloud governance module determines whether or not the retrieved policies match with respect to the selected cloud vendor to which the existing executing application is to be handed off to. Such matching involves comparing various hand off parameters such as how much of the executing application e.g. product has been completed what are the current parameters associated with the application that are being processed what is the intermediate output of such processing what are the other systems servers that are participating in the execution of the application with corresponding parameters of the new cloud vendor. If the policies do not match cloud governance module does not transfer the existing executing application e.g. product to the new cloud vendor and the flow returns to operation .

However if the policies match then flow of process proceeds to an operation via connector Z cloud governance module uses the hand off parameters and moves or transfers the existing executing application e.g. product in real time without any disruption in execution to the new cloud vendor. For example a current state or current snapshot of the executing application may be captured using for example information related to how much of the executing application e.g. product has been completed what are the current parameters associated with the application that are being processed what is the intermediate output of such processing what are the other systems servers that are participating in the execution of the application and the like. In some implementations automation tools known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be used to transfer these operating system and application images with their current snapshot from one vendor system to other may be transferred after hand off policies associated with the executing application have been complied with. The new selected cloud vendor among cloud vendors C1 Cn is determined by cloud governance module to be most acceptable cloud computing service provider in the plurality of cloud computing service providers C1 Cn with respect to policy enforcement and compliance. For example the new selected cloud vendor may meet threshold performance metrics of being the most optimum cost effective cloud vendor with respect to the identified executing application e.g. product . Such identification of the new cloud vendor may include searching for one or more resources e.g. hardware device s on one or more of servers S7 S11 for use by the at least one identified application e.g. product .

The handing off of the existing executing application e.g. product to the new cloud vendor occurs with a transfer of an appropriate context associated with the application. The term context refers to a current state of execution of the application e.g. product the current state being stored in buffer or memory devices in server device . For example if a backup application is being run and is 60 complete the 60 completion becomes part of context information that should be passed to another cloud vendor among cloud vendors C1 Cn so that backup restarts from where it was left instead of from the beginning. The context of the application e.g. product for the hand off determines the success of the application to be completed successfully. For example in case of the context as part of the hand off some exemplary parameters that would form the part of the environment of the existing executing application e.g. product that needs to be carried to the next vendor include but are not limited to an operating system and version update application specifics e.g. version of application current state of the application does application have failover options or combinations thereof application in progress a current state of the application stored for example as a state machine in one or more memory devices of server device pre requisites for the application percentage of application completed current inputs current output parameters whether application running is invoked by user or as part of scheduled batch and the like. During the transfer of the execution the context may be stored or buffered in one or more of the remaining servers too to facilitate smooth uninterrupted real time transition without any disruption. These parameters will enable the hand off to be transparent to the end customer and make it happen dynamically based on the policies set forth by the customer on one or more of client devices . In some implementations the handing off is carried out by cloud governance module in real time such that the current state of the execution of the at least one identified application e.g. product is used by the second cloud computing service provider platform to continue the execution of the at least one identified application after the handing off is completed. In some implementations the term real time refers to handling hand off when a triggering event occurs and not later after the triggering event has expired or the application product has completed execution and becomes dormant. For example such real time transfer is triggered if operational efficiencies become an issue or if an application runs into problem s during execution. In some implementations when the at least one identified application is detected to be dormant the handing off is carried out using a set of parameters associated with the at least one identified application stored at server device e.g. in one or more memory device such that the dormant application becomes active and is executed on a policy compliant cloud computing vendor s server.
