title: Apparatus and method for asynchronous tile-based rendering control
abstract: An apparatus and method are described for asynchronous tile-based rendering control. In one embodiment of the invention, there is a delay between when the graphics driver queues the GPU commands for rendering and when the GPU begins executing. During this delay, the graphics driver receives additional information or data about whether cache evictions may be inhibited. As such, it allows the graphics driver to defer the cache eviction control of its render cache until it has this extra information. By doing so, it reduces the memory bandwidth required for rendering 3D graphics applications and in turn reduces the power consumption of the GPU.

This invention relates generally to the field of computer processors. More particularly the invention relates to an apparatus and method for asynchronous tile based rendering control.

Tile based rendering can significantly optimize bandwidth by disabling specific cache entries from be evicted to memory. However graphics drivers do not always know whether these cache evictions can be inhibited when it submits the Graphics Processor Unit GPU instructions. For example some solutions require the graphics driver to specify whether the cache evictions should occur before it queues the GPU commands. When the driver does not have enough information it must assume the worst case and always evict the cache to memory. This increases the memory bandwidth and power consumption of the GPU.

In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a block image transfer BLIT engine to perform two dimensional 2D rasterizer operations including for example bit boundary block transfers. However in one embodiment 2D graphics operations are performed using one or more components of the graphics processing engine GPE . The graphics processing engine is a compute engine for performing graphics operations including three dimensional 3D graphics operations and media operations.

The GPE includes a 3D pipeline for performing 3D operations such as rendering three dimensional images and scenes using processing functions that act upon 3D primitive shapes e.g. rectangle triangle etc. . The 3D pipeline includes programmable and fixed function elements that perform various tasks within the element and or spawn execution threads to a 3D Media sub system . While the 3D pipeline can be used to perform media operations an embodiment of the GPE also includes a media pipeline that is specifically used to perform media operations such as video post processing and image enhancement.

In one embodiment the media pipeline includes fixed function or programmable logic units to perform one or more specialized media operations such as video decode acceleration video de interlacing and video encode acceleration in place of or on behalf of the video codec engine . In on embodiment the media pipeline additionally includes a thread spawning unit to spawn threads for execution on the 3D Media sub system . The spawned threads perform computations for the media operations on one or more graphics execution units included in the 3D Media sub system.

The 3D Media subsystem includes logic for executing threads spawned by the 3D pipeline and media pipeline . In one embodiment the pipelines send thread execution requests to the 3D Media subsystem which includes thread dispatch logic for arbitrating and dispatching the various requests to available thread execution resources. The execution resources include an array of graphics execution units to process the 3D and media threads. In one embodiment the 3D Media subsystem includes one or more internal caches for thread instructions and data. In one embodiment the subsystem also includes shared memory including registers and addressable memory to share data between threads and to store output data.

In one embodiment the GPE couples with a command streamer which provides a command stream to the GPE 3D and media pipelines . The command streamer is coupled to memory which can be system memory or one or more of internal cache memory and shared cache memory. The command streamer receives commands from the memory and sends the commands to the 3D pipeline and or media pipeline . The 3D and media pipelines process the commands by performing operations via logic within the respective pipelines or by dispatching one or more execution threads to the execution unit array . In one embodiment the execution unit array is scalable such that the array includes a variable number of execution units based on the target power and performance level of the GPE .

A sampling engine couples with memory e.g. cache memory or system memory and the execution unit array . In one embodiment the sampling engine provides a memory access mechanism for the scalable execution unit array that allows the execution array to read graphics and media data from memory. In one embodiment the sampling engine includes logic to perform specialized image sampling operations for media.

The specialized media sampling logic in the sampling engine includes a de noise de interlace module a motion estimation module and an image scaling and filtering module . The de noise de interlace module includes logic to perform one or more of a de noise or a de interlace algorithm on decoded video data. The de interlace logic combines alternating fields of interlaced video content into a single fame of video. The de noise logic reduces or remove data noise from video and image data. In one embodiment the de noise logic and de interlace logic are motion adaptive and use spatial or temporal filtering based on the amount of motion detected in the video data. In one embodiment the de noise de interlace module includes dedicated motion detection logic e.g. within the motion estimation engine .

The motion estimation engine provides hardware acceleration for video operations by performing video acceleration functions such as motion vector estimation and prediction on video data. The motion estimation engine determines motion vectors that describe the transformation of image data between successive video frames. In one embodiment a graphics processor media codec uses the video motion estimation engine to perform operations on video at the macro block level that may otherwise be computationally intensive to perform using a general purpose processor. In one embodiment the motion estimation engine is generally available to graphics processor components to assist with video decode and processing functions that are sensitive or adaptive to the direction or magnitude of the motion within video data.

The image scaling and filtering module performs image processing operations to enhance the visual quality of generated images and video. In one embodiment the scaling and filtering module processes image and video data during the sampling operation before providing the data to the execution unit array .

In one embodiment the graphics processing engine includes a data port which provides an additional mechanism for graphics subsystems to access memory. The data port facilitates memory access for operations including render target writes constant buffer reads scratch memory space reads writes and media surface accesses. In one embodiment the data port includes cache memory space to cache accesses to memory. The cache memory can be a single data cache or separated into multiple caches for the multiple subsystems that access memory via the data port e.g. a render buffer cache a constant buffer cache etc. . In one embodiment threads executing on an execution unit in the execution unit array communicate with the data port by exchanging messages via a data distribution interconnect that couples each of the sub systems of the graphics processing engine .

The graphics processor receives batches of commands via the ring interconnect . The incoming commands are interpreted by a command streamer in the pipeline front end . The graphics processor includes scalable execution logic to perform 3D geometry processing and media processing via the graphics core s A N. For 3D geometry processing commands the command streamer supplies the commands to the geometry pipeline . For at least some media processing commands the command streamer supplies the commands to a video front end which couples with a media engine . The media engine includes a video quality engine VQE for video and image post processing and a multi format encode decode MFX engine to provide hardware accelerated media data encode and decode. The geometry pipeline and media engine each generate execution threads for the thread execution resources provided by at least one graphics core A.

The graphics processor includes scalable thread execution resources featuring modular cores A N sometime referred to as core slices each having multiple sub cores A N A N sometimes referred to as core sub slices . The graphics processor can have any number of graphics cores A through N. In one embodiment the graphics processor includes a graphics core A having at least a first sub core A and a second sub core A. In another embodiment the graphics processor is a low power processor with a single sub core e.g. A . In one embodiment the graphics processor includes multiple graphics cores A N each including a set of first sub cores A N and a set of second sub cores A N. Each sub core in the set of first sub cores A N includes at least a first set of execution units A N and media texture samplers A N. Each sub core in the set of second sub cores A N includes at least a second set of execution units A N and samplers A N. In one embodiment each sub core A N A N shares a set of shared resources A N. In one embodiment the shared resources include shared cache memory and pixel operation logic. Other shared resources may also be included in the various embodiments of the graphics processor.

In one embodiment the execution unit array A N is primarily used to execute shader programs. In one embodiment the execution units in the array A N execute an instruction set that includes native support for many standard 3D graphics shader instructions such that shader programs from graphics libraries e.g. Direct 3D and OpenGL are executed with a minimal translation. The execution units support vertex and geometry processing e.g. vertex programs geometry programs vertex shaders pixel processing e.g. pixel shaders fragment shaders and general purpose processing e.g. compute and media shaders .

Each execution unit in the execution unit array A N operates on arrays of data elements. The number of data elements is the execution size or the number of channels for the instruction. An execution channel is a logical unit of execution for data element access masking and flow control within instructions. The number of channels may be independent of the number of physical ALUs or FPUs for a particular graphics processor. The execution units A N support integer and floating point data types.

The execution unit instruction set includes single instruction multiple data SIMD instructions. The various data elements can be stored as a packed data type in a register and the execution unit will process the various elements based on the data size of the elements. For example when operating on a 256 bit wide vector the 256 bits of the vector are stored in a register and the execution unit operates on the vector as four separate 64 bit packed data elements quad word QW size data elements eight separate 32 bit packed data elements double word DW size data elements sixteen separate 16 bit packed data elements word W size data elements or thirty two separate 8 bit data elements byte B size data elements . However different vector widths and register sizes are possible.

One or more internal instruction caches e.g. are included in the thread execution logic to cache thread instructions for the execution units. In one embodiment one or more data caches e.g. are included to cache thread data during thread execution. A sampler is included to provide texture sampling for 3D operations and media sampling for media operations. In one embodiment the sampler includes specialized texture or media sampling functionality to process texture or media data during the sampling process before providing the sampled data to an execution unit.

During execution the graphics and media pipelines send thread initiation requests to the thread execution logic via thread spawning and dispatch logic. The thread execution logic includes a local thread dispatcher that arbitrates thread initiation requests from the graphics and media pipelines and instantiates the requested threads on one or more execution units A N. For example the geometry pipeline e.g. of dispatches vertex processing tessellation or geometry processing threads to the thread execution logic . The thread dispatcher can also process runtime thread spawning requests from the executing shader programs.

Once a group of geometric objects have been processed and rasterized into pixel data the pixel shader is invoked to further compute output information and cause results to be written to output surfaces e.g. color buffers depth buffers stencil buffers etc. . In one embodiment the pixel shader calculates the values of the various vertex attributes that are to be interpolated across the rasterized object. The pixel shader then executes an API supplied pixel shader program. To execute the pixel shader program the pixel shader dispatches threads to an execution unit e.g. A via the thread dispatcher . The pixel shader uses texture sampling logic in the sampler to access texture data in texture maps stored in memory. Arithmetic operations on the texture data and the input geometry data compute pixel color data for each geometric fragment or discards one or more pixels from further processing.

In one embodiment the data port provides a memory access mechanism for the thread execution logic output processed data to memory for processing on a graphics processor output pipeline. In one embodiment the data port includes or couples to one or more cache memories e.g. data cache to cache data for memory access via the data port.

In one embodiment the graphics processor execution units natively support instructions in a 128 bit format . A 64 bit compacted instruction format is available for some instructions based on the selected instruction instruction options and number of operands. The native 128 bit format provides access to all instruction options while some options and operations are restricted in the 64 bit format . The native instructions available in the 64 bit format varies by embodiment. In one embodiment the instruction is compacted in part using a set of index values in an index field . The execution unit hardware references a set of compaction tables based on the index values and uses the compaction table outputs to reconstruct a native instruction in the 128 bit format .

For each format an instruction opcode defines the operation that the execution unit is to perform. The execution units execute each instruction in parallel across the multiple data elements of each operand. For example in response to an add instruction the execution unit performs a simultaneous add operation across each color channel representing a texture element or picture element. By default the execution unit performs each instruction across all data channels of the operands. An instruction control field enables control over certain execution options such as channels selection e.g. predication and data channel order e.g. swizzle . For 128 bit instructions an exec size field limits the number of data channels that will be executed in parallel. The exec size field is not available for use in the 64 bit compact instruction format .

Some execution unit instructions have up to three operands including two source operands src src and one destination . In one embodiment the execution units support dual destination instructions where one of the destinations is implied. Data manipulation instructions can have a third source operand e.g. SRC where the instruction opcode determines the number of source operands. An instruction s last source operand can be an immediate e.g. hard coded value passed with the instruction.

In one embodiment instructions are grouped based on opcode bit fields to simplify Opcode decode . For an 8 bit opcode bits and allow the execution unit to determine the type of opcode. The precise opcode grouping shown is exemplary. In one embodiment a move and logic opcode group includes data movement and logic instructions e.g. mov cmp . The move and logic group shares the five most significant bits MSB where move instructions are in the form of 0000xxxxb e.g. 0x0x and logic instructions are in the form of 0001xxxxb e.g. 0x01 . A flow control instruction group e.g. call jmp includes instructions in the form of 0010xxxxb e.g. 0x20 . A miscellaneous instruction group includes a mix of instructions including synchronization instructions e.g. wait send in the form of 0011xxxxb e.g. 0x30 . A parallel math instruction group includes component wise arithmetic instructions e.g. add mul in the form of 0100xxxxb e.g. 0x40 . The parallel math group performs the arithmetic operations in parallel across data channels. The vector math group includes arithmetic instructions e.g. dp4 in the form of 0101xxxxb e.g. 0x50 . The vector math group performs arithmetic such as dot product calculations on vector operands.

The command streamer directs the operation of a vertex fetcher component that reads vertex data from memory and executes vertex processing commands provided by the command streamer . The vertex fetcher provides vertex data to a vertex shader which performs coordinate space transformation and lighting operations to each vertex. The vertex fetcher and vertex shader execute vertex processing instructions by dispatching execution threads to the execution units A B via a thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the execution units A B are an array of vector processors having an instruction set for performing graphics and media operations. The execution units A B have an attached L1 cache that is specific for each array or shared between the arrays. The cache can be configured as a data cache an instruction cache or a single cache that is partitioned to contain data and instructions in different partitions.

In one embodiment the graphics pipeline includes tessellation components to perform hardware accelerated tessellation of 3D objects. A programmable hull shader configures the tessellation operations. A programmable domain shader provides back end evaluation of tessellation output. A tessellator operates at the direction of the hull shader and contains special purpose logic to generate a set of detailed geometric objects based on a coarse geometric model that is provided as input to the graphics pipeline . If tessellation is not used the tessellation components can be bypassed.

The complete geometric objects can be processed by a geometry shader via one or more threads dispatched to the execution units A B or can proceed directly to the clipper . The geometry shader operates on entire geometric objects rather than vertices or patches of vertices as in previous stages of the graphics pipeline. If the tessellation is disabled the geometry shader receives input from the vertex shader . The geometry shader is programmable by a geometry shader program to perform geometry tessellation if the tessellation units are disabled.

Prior to rasterization vertex data is processed by a clipper which is either a fixed function clipper or a programmable clipper having clipping and geometry shader functions. In one embodiment a rasterizer in the render output pipeline dispatches pixel shaders to convert the geometric objects into their per pixel representations. In one embodiment pixel shader logic is included in the thread execution logic .

The graphics engine has an interconnect bus interconnect fabric or some other interconnect mechanism that allows data and message passing amongst the major components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the execution units A B and associated cache s texture and media sampler and texture sampler cache interconnect via a data port to perform memory access and communicate with render output pipeline components of the graphics engine. In one embodiment the sampler caches and execution units A B each have separate memory access paths.

In one embodiment the render output pipeline contains a rasterizer and depth test component that converts vertex based objects into their associated pixel based representation. In one embodiment the rasterizer logic includes a windower masker unit to perform fixed function triangle and line rasterization. An associated render and depth buffer caches are also available in one embodiment. A pixel operations component performs pixel based operations on the data though in some instances pixel operations associated with 2D operations e.g. bit block image transfers with blending are performed by the 2D engine or substituted at display time by the display controller using overlay display planes. In one embodiment a shared L3 cache is available to all graphics components allowing the sharing of data without the use of main system memory.

The graphics processor media pipeline includes a media engine and a video front end . In one embodiment the video front end receives pipeline commands from the command streamer . However in one embodiment the media pipeline includes a separate command streamer. The video front end processes media commands before sending the command to the media engine . In one embodiment the media engine includes thread spawning functionality to spawn threads for dispatch to the thread execution logic via the thread dispatcher .

In one embodiment the graphics engine includes a display engine . In one embodiment the display engine is external to the graphics processor and couples with the graphics processor via the ring interconnect or some other interconnect bus or fabric. The display engine includes a 2D engine and a display controller . The display engine contains special purpose logic capable of operating independently of the 3D pipeline. The display controller couples with a display device not shown which may be a system integrated display device as in a laptop computer or an external display device attached via an display device connector.

The graphics pipeline and media pipeline are configurable to perform operations based on multiple graphics and media programming interfaces and are not specific to any one application programming interface API . In one embodiment driver software for the graphics processor translates API calls that are specific to a particular graphics or media library into commands that can be processed by the graphics processor. In various embodiments support is provided for the Open Graphics Library OpenGL and Open Computing Language OpenCL supported by the Khronos Group the Direct3D library from the Microsoft Corporation or in one embodiment both OpenGL and D3D. Support may also be provided for the Open Source Computer Vision Library OpenCV . A future API with a compatible 3D pipeline would also be supported if a mapping can be made from the pipeline of the future API to the pipeline of the graphics processor.

The client specifies the client unit of the graphics device that processes the command data. In one embodiment a graphics processor command parser examines the client field of each command to condition the further processing of the command and route the command data to the appropriate client unit. In one embodiment the graphics processor client units include a memory interface unit a render unit a 2D unit a 3D unit and a media unit. Each client unit has a corresponding processing pipeline that processes the commands. Once the command is received by the client unit the client unit reads the opcode and if present sub opcode to determine the operation to perform. The client unit performs the command using information in the data field of the command. For some commands an explicit command size is expected to specify the size of the command. In one embodiment the command parser automatically determines the size of at least some of the commands based on the command opcode. In one embodiment commands are aligned via multiples of a double word.

The flow chart in shows a sample command sequence . In one embodiment software or firmware of a data processing system that features an embodiment of the graphics processor uses a version of the command sequence shown to set up execute and terminate a set of graphics operations. A sample command sequence is shown and described for exemplary purposes however embodiments are not limited to these commands or to this command sequence. Moreover the commands may be issued as batch of commands in a command sequence such that the graphics processor will process the sequence of commands in an at least partially concurrent manner.

The sample command sequence may begin with a pipeline flush command to cause any active graphics pipeline to complete the currently pending commands for the pipeline. In one embodiment the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline do not operate concurrently. The pipeline flush is performed to cause the active graphics pipeline to complete any pending commands. In response to a pipeline flush the command parser for the graphics processor will pause command processing until the active drawing engines complete pending operations and the relevant read caches are invalidated. Optionally any data in the render cache that is marked dirty can be flushed to memory. A pipeline flush command can be used for pipeline synchronization or before placing the graphics processor into a low power state.

A pipeline select command is used when a command sequence requires the graphics processor to explicitly switch between pipelines. A pipeline select command is required only once within an execution context before issuing pipeline commands unless the context is to issue commands for both pipelines. In one embodiment a pipeline flush command is is required immediately before a pipeline switch via the pipeline select command .

A pipeline control command configures a graphics pipeline for operation and is used to program the 3D pipeline and the media pipeline . The pipeline control command configures the pipeline state for the active pipeline. In one embodiment the pipeline control command is used for pipeline synchronization and to clear data from one or more cache memories within the active pipeline before processing a batch of commands.

Return buffer state commands are used to configure a set of return buffers for the respective pipelines to write data. Some pipeline operations require the allocation selection or configuration of one or more return buffers into which the operations write intermediate data during processing. The graphics processor also uses one or more return buffers to store output data and to perform cross thread communication. The return buffer state includes selecting the size and number of return buffers to use for a set of pipeline operations.

The remaining commands in the command sequence differ based on the active pipeline for operations. Based on a pipeline determination the command sequence is tailored to the 3D pipeline beginning with the 3D pipeline state or the media pipeline beginning at the media pipeline state .

The commands for the 3D pipeline state include 3D state setting commands for vertex buffer state vertex element state constant color state depth buffer state and other state variables that are to be configured before 3D primitive commands are processed. The values of these commands are determined at least in part based the particular 3D API in use. 3D pipeline state commands are also able to selectively disable or bypass certain pipeline elements if those elements will not be used.

The 3D primitive command is used to submit 3D primitives to be processed by the 3D pipeline. Commands and associated parameters that are passed to the graphics processor via the 3D primitive command are forwarded to the vertex fetch function in the graphics pipeline. The vertex fetch function uses the 3D primitive command data to generate vertex data structures. The vertex data structures are stored in one or more return buffers. The 3D primitive command is used to perform vertex operations on 3D primitives via vertex shaders. To process vertex shaders the 3D pipeline dispatches shader execution threads to graphics processor execution units.

The 3D pipeline is triggered via an execute command or event. In one embodiment a register write triggers command execution. In one embodiment execution is triggered via a go or kick command in the command sequence. In one embodiment command execution is triggered using a pipeline synchronization command to flush the command sequence through the graphics pipeline. The 3D pipeline will perform geometry processing for the 3D primitives. Once operations are complete the resulting geometric objects are rasterized and the pixel engine colors the resulting pixels. Additional commands to control pixel shading and pixel back end operations may also be included for those operations.

The sample command sequence follows the media pipeline path when performing media operations. In general the specific use and manner of programming for the media pipeline depends on the media or compute operations to be performed. Specific media decode operations may be offloaded to the media pipeline during media decode. The media pipeline can also be bypassed and media decode can be performed in whole or in part using resources provided by one or more general purpose processing cores. In one embodiment the media pipeline also includes elements for general purpose graphics processor unit GPGPU operations where the graphics processor is used to perform SIMD vector operations using computational shader programs that are not explicitly related to the rendering of graphics primitives.

The media pipeline is configured in a similar manner as the 3D pipeline . A set of media pipeline state commands are dispatched or placed into in a command queue before the media object commands . The media pipeline state commands include data to configure the media pipeline elements that will be used to process the media objects. This includes data to configure the video decode and video encode logic within the media pipeline such as encode or decode format. The media pipeline state commands also support the use one or more pointers to indirect state elements that contain a batch of state settings.

Media object commands supply pointers to media objects for processing by the media pipeline. The media objects include memory buffers containing video data to be processed. In one embodiment all media pipeline state must be valid before issuing a media object command . Once the pipeline state is configured and media object commands are queued the media pipeline is triggered via an execute command or an equivalent execute event e.g. register write . Output from the media pipeline may then be post processed by operations provided by the 3D pipeline or the media pipeline . In one embodiment GPGPU operations are configured and executed in a similar manner as media operations.

In one embodiment the 3D graphics application contains one or more shader programs including shader instructions . The shader language instructions may be in a high level shader language such as the High Level Shader Language HLSL or the OpenGL Shader Language GLSL . The application also includes executable instructions in a machine language suitable for execution by the general purpose processor core . The application also includes graphics objects defined by vertex data.

The operating system may be a Microsoft Windows operating system from the Microsoft Corporation a proprietary UNIX like operating system or an open source UNIX like operating system using a variant of the Linux kernel. When the Direct3D API is in use the operating system uses a front end shader compiler to compile any shader instructions in HLSL into a lower level shader language. The compilation may be a just in time compilation or the application can perform share pre compilation. In one embodiment high level shaders are compiled into low level shaders during the compilation of the 3D graphics application .

The user mode graphics driver may contain a back end shader compiler to convert the shader instructions into a hardware specific representation. When the OpenGL API is in use shader instructions in the GLSL high level language are passed to a user mode graphics driver for compilation. The user mode graphics driver uses operating system kernel mode functions to communicate with a kernel mode graphics driver . The kernel mode graphics driver communicates with the graphics processor to dispatch commands and instructions.

Therefore the illustrations and examples herein should be construed in an illustrative and not a restrictive sense. The scope of the invention should be measured solely by reference to the claims that follow.

In one embodiment of the invention there is a delay between when the graphics driver queues the GPU commands for rendering and when the GPU begins executing. During this delay the graphics driver receives additional information or data about whether cache evictions may be inhibited. As such it allows the graphics driver to defer the cache eviction control of its render cache until it has this extra information. By doing so it reduces the memory bandwidth required for rendering 3D graphics applications and in turn reduces the power consumption of the GPU.

In one embodiment of the invention the queue is a communications medium between the processors and . For example in one embodiment of the invention the queue stores command buffers that are used to exchange instructions or commands between the processors and . In other embodiments of the invention the queue can be an array of pointers where the processors and can see or use the same pointers to access a particular memory location in the shared memory . One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will readily appreciate that other communication mediums can be used without affecting the workings of the invention and shall not be described herein.

In one embodiment of the invention the shared memory refers to a shared virtual memory that is accessible to both the processors and . For example in one embodiment of the invention one of the processors and maps a shared physical memory address range to a shared virtual memory address range which is accessible to both the processors and . In other embodiments of the invention the shared memory refers to a shared physical memory that is accessible to both the processors and .

The process flow in begins with the processor . In one embodiment of the invention a graphics driver is used to send commands from the CPU to the GPU. In other embodiments of the invention other forms of software or hardware logic are used to send commands from the CPU to the GPU and vice versa. For clarity of illustration the processor is assumed to be a CPU the processor is assumed to be a GPU and a graphics driver is assumed to be responsible for the interactions between the CPU and the GPU. One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will readily appreciate how to modify the process flow for other variations of the processors and and the interaction medium and shall not be described herein.

In one embodiment of the invention the graphics driver executed by the processor sends an eviction request to the shared memory . This eviction request is sent prior to the submission of a command buffer for rendering to the queue in one embodiment of the invention. In other embodiments of the invention the eviction request is sent after the submission of the command buffer to the queue .

The eviction request is an indication or marking of the memory location in the shared memory that is associated with the render cache of the GPU in one embodiment of the invention. For example the render cache line has an eviction status bit that can be marked or set to indicate that the render cache line is to be evicted. At this stage of the process flow the graphics driver does not know whether the render cache should be evicted and assumes that the cache eviction should be performed. Therefore the eviction request is sent.

The graphics driver submits a command buffer to the queue . After a period of time the GPU receives or reads the command buffer from the queue and begins to execute the command buffer in step . The GPU reads the memory location associated with the command buffer from the shared memory to determine whether to evict its render cache to memory in one embodiment of the invention in step . In the example of the eviction status of the memory location is marked as true i.e. the GPU is to evict its render cache. After the GPU has completed the execution of the command buffer the GPU evicts its render cache in step .

The steps and illustrate another instance where the GPU driver has submitted another command buffer to the queue and the GPU has executed the command buffer and evicted its render cache. One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will readily appreciate the workings of the steps and and shall not be described herein.

The process flow in illustrates the delay between the submission of the command buffer and the execution of the command buffer by the GPU . In one embodiment of the invention the graphics driver receives or obtains additional information during the delay that indicates whether the eviction of the cache should be performed. If the information indicates that the cache eviction should not be performed the GPU driver sends an eviction request to unmark the memory location associated with the earlier command buffer for eviction from the shared memory .

For example the GPU driver submits a command buffer for rendering to the queue . Before the GPU has started executing the command buffer in step the GPU driver has received information that the cache eviction of the GPU should not be performed. Therefore the GPU driver sends an eviction request to unmark the memory location associated with the command buffer for eviction from the shared memory . In one embodiment of the invention the GPU driver receives information from the user application that indicates that the cache eviction of the GPU should not be performed. In another embodiment of the invention the GPU driver examines the application programming interface API calls associated with the command buffer to determine if it comprises a clear method or operation. One of ordinary skill in the relevant art will readily appreciate other ways of obtaining the information that the cache eviction of the GPU should not be performed can also be used and shall not be described herein.

At step the GPU starts to execute the command buffer and it reads the eviction status of the memory location associated with the command buffer from the shared memory . The GPU determines that the eviction status is not set and therefore discards the cache eviction operation in step .

In step the graphics driver marks the cache of the GPU for eviction to memory. The cache of the GPU includes but is not limited to the render cache and other types of cache memories in the GPU. The memory includes but is not limited to shared virtual memory shared physical memory and other types of memories accessible by the GPU and other processors.

In step the graphics driver submits a command buffer for rendering to a queue. In step the GPU reads and executes the command buffer submitted in step . In step the GPU reads the memory location associated with the command buffer to determine the eviction status. In step the graphics driver checks if it has received additional information about whether cache eviction of the GPU should be performed.

If yes the graphics driver unmarks the cache for eviction to memory in step and the flow goes back to step . If no the GPU checks if the eviction status is true in step . If yes the GPU evicts its cache to the memory in step . If no the flow ends.

Embodiments of the invention may include various steps which have been described above. The steps may be embodied in machine executable instructions which may be used to cause a general purpose or special purpose processor to perform the steps. Alternatively these steps may be performed by specific hardware components that contain hardwired logic for performing the steps or by any combination of programmed computer components and custom hardware components.

As described herein instructions may refer to specific configurations of hardware such as application specific integrated circuits ASICs configured to perform certain operations or having a predetermined functionality or software instructions stored in memory embodied in a non transitory computer readable medium. Thus the techniques shown in the figures can be implemented using code and data stored and executed on one or more electronic devices e.g. an end station a network element etc. . Such electronic devices store and communicate internally and or with other electronic devices over a network code and data using computer machine readable media such as non transitory computer machine readable storage media e.g. magnetic disks optical disks random access memory read only memory flash memory devices phase change memory and transitory computer machine readable communication media e.g. electrical optical acoustical or other form of propagated signals such as carrier waves infrared signals digital signals etc. .

In addition such electronic devices typically include a set of one or more processors coupled to one or more other components such as one or more storage devices non transitory machine readable storage media user input output devices e.g. a keyboard a touchscreen and or a display and network connections. The coupling of the set of processors and other components is typically through one or more busses and bridges also termed as bus controllers . The storage device and signals carrying the network traffic respectively represent one or more machine readable storage media and machine readable communication media. Thus the storage device of a given electronic device typically stores code and or data for execution on the set of one or more processors of that electronic device. Of course one or more parts of an embodiment of the invention may be implemented using different combinations of software firmware and or hardware.
