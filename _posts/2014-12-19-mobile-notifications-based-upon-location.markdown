This application is a continuation of and claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 596 119 entitled MOBILE NOTIFICATIONS BASED UPON LOCATION and filed Aug. 28 2012 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Current mobile devices provide for an ability to display notifications that are related to received email short message service SMS messages mobile application notifications and other types of content that is pushed to the mobile device and or pulled by the mobile device and subsequently displayed via some type of notification capability provided by the mobile device operating system. Current mobile device applications and or operating systems may allow for the ability to filter categorize and or prioritize notifications based upon a sender or a message and or an identity of an application through which a notification originates.

With reference to shown is a networked environment that facilitates the use of a mobile device allowing for altering mobile notifications based upon a location of the mobile device as well as input from one or more device sensors and or data accessible to the mobile device. Specifically the networked environment includes at least one mobile device in which notifications can be displayed to a user. First a general description of the physical makeup of the networked environment and its components is described followed by a discussion of the operation of the same.

To begin the networked environment includes one or more mobile devices that are coupled to a network . The network may comprise for example the Internet intranets extranets wide area networks WANs local area networks LANs wired networks wireless networks such as cellular networks or other suitable networks etc. or any combination of two or more such networks.

Each of the mobile devices may comprise for example a smartphone tablet computing device a portable computing system such as for example a laptop or any other device that generally is portable such that an individual may carry such device from place to place as can be appreciated. To this end according to one embodiment a mobile device includes a processor circuit having a processor and a memory as can be appreciated.

According to one embodiment the mobile device includes a display device such as for example liquid crystal display LCD screens gas plasma based flat panel displays or other types of display devices etc. The display device included within the mobile device facilitates the display of one or more user interfaces based upon the operation of various applications in the mobile device as will be described. In addition a mobile device includes various input and output devices such as for example a capacitive touchscreen integrated into the display device externally visible lights light emitting diodes vibration motors or other types of visual indicators an integrated camera speakers microphones and other devices as can be appreciated.

In addition the mobile device includes various applications and or systems such as for example a notification library an operating system one or more user applications and other applications and or systems. The notification library is a portion of the operating system and or an operating system plug in application programming interface API library or other type of software component that can facilitate manipulation of device notifications via a user interface speakers vibration motors and or externally visible indicators such as an externally mounted LED. The operating system is a device operating system that facilitates communication between software components and applications and the mobile device hardware components such as a processor circuit input output bus input devices output devices etc.

User applications represent one or more applications that can be executed by the mobile device and which can obtain various types of data and display notifications in a user interface rendered on the display device or generate other content in the mobile device . A user application can comprise an email application a calendar application an SMS application a browser or any other type of mobile application that can obtain push notifications or generate notifications based upon data obtained via the network or data stored in the mobile device . For example an email or SMS application may generate notifications in the form of an audible ringtone activation of a vibration motor a visible notification in a notification bar or other part of an operating system user interface a flashing or blinking LED or other types of notifications as can be appreciated. In some embodiments a user application can represent an operating system resource service or any type of application that can request to display or activate any type of device notification in the mobile device .

As another example a calendar application may generate notifications associated with appointments or reminders associated with a calendar that are rendered in a user interface shown on the display based upon calendar data stored within the mobile device . Additionally the calendar application may also generate a notification in the form of a ringtone played via a speaker associated with the mobile device or cause an integrated LED to light or blink periodically in one or more different colors. In these and other scenarios where a user application attempts to generate a notification in a mobile device the user applications can do so via an API provided by the notification library by passing a notification data item that contains notification content meta data e.g. content type image capture device type data location etc. .

The mobile device in one embodiment further includes various devices sensors and hardware capabilities. For example the mobile device can include one or more light emitting diodes LEDs that can be activated as a part of a notification. The mobile device can also include one or more speakers through which the notification library can play one or more tones or sounds as a part of a notification. Additionally the mobile device can also include one or more vibration motors which can also be activated by the notification library at various frequencies as a part of a notification.

The mobile device can also include in some embodiments a global navigation satellite system that is configured to determine a location of the mobile device by communication with a satellite navigation system such as the global positioning system GPS Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema GLONASS or any other satellite navigation system or location detection mechanism. The mobile device can also be configured with one or more wireless radios or wireless network interfaces. For example the mobile device can include a Bluetooth communication subsystem a wireless networking subsystem such as a wireless local area networking system e.g. Wi Fi facilitating communication with a wireless local area network and or a wireless wide area networking system facilitating communication with a wireless wide area network.

Location data associated with the mobile device can be requested by the notification library from an operating system executed by the mobile device which can provide location data that is derived from data obtained from the GNSS system the wireless radios or any other systems as can be appreciated.

Accordingly the notification library can determine based upon the location of the mobile device whether a notification rule specifying a particular notification level is associated with the location of the mobile device and potentially other device sensor data. The notification library can also determine absent an applicable notification rule whether the notification level corresponding to a particular notification should be modified based upon the location of the mobile device and or device sensor data.

The notification level can comprise one of many various levels of notification depending upon the location associated with the mobile device . For example the notification levels associated with the notification library can be ranked according to a degree or amount of device notifications associated with the notification level. In this sense an escalated notification level can comprise any combination of user interface elements displayed by the notification library in an operating system user interface audible or tactile notification and or LED notifications. Conversely lower priority notifications can be associated with a de escalated notification level which can comprise for example a less intrusive form of notification generated by the notification library . For example a de escalated notification level may be characterized by fewer visual notification elements less intrusive audible notifications etc. In some embodiments a de escalated notification level can comprise delaying certain device notifications until a later point in time. For example if the mobile device is detected to be in a certain location the notification library can delay activation of device notifications until the mobile device is a certain distance away from the location. The notification levels can also include a default notification level with which a location cannot be associated with an escalated or de escalated notification level can be associated.

As another example the notification library can determine whether the mobile device is entering and or approaching a location that is associated with an escalated or de escalated notification level and escalate and or de escalate previous notifications already processed by the notification library based upon the new location. For example if the mobile device is approaching a location that is associated with an escalated notification level the notification library can apply an escalated notification level to previous notification items. As an additional example the notification library can apply a de escalated notification level to previous notification items if the location is associated with a de escalated notification level. As one example the notification library may suppress and or deactivate or suppress certain notifications already activated in the mobile device consistent with a de escalated notification level when the mobile device approaches a location associated with a de escalated notification level.

Other solutions generate varying notification levels depending upon a notification type a sender and or originating application of a notification. In contrast the notification library can maintain one or more notification rules that relate a location of the mobile device to a notification level. In other words the notification library can analyze the location in which the mobile device is positioned to determine a corresponding notification level. In one scenario a user application can submit a request to generate a device notification in the form of a notification user interface element that is a popup element and or one that is placed in a notification bar in an operating system or launcher user interface by submitting a notification data item containing the notification content to the notification library . In response the notification library can analyze the location of the mobile device as reported by the GNSS system for example and determine whether a notification rule corresponds to the location and specifies a notification level that varies from the notification requested by the user application . The notification library can then generate a notification according to the notification level corresponding to the notification rule.

As noted above the notification level can specify various types of notifications that are displayed by the operating system in a user interface on the display via visible indicators integrated within the mobile device and or audible alerts via a speaker integrated within the mobile device . For example a user application that is an email application may request a notification in the form of a ringtone activation of a vibration motor activation of a certain LED color and repeat pattern and or frequency as well as a notification displayed in a notification bar and or in a notification popup shown in the operating system user interface .

However the notification library may determine that based upon the location of the mobile device potentially in combination with other data about ambient conditions as well as a corresponding notification rule that a different notification level should be employed. Accordingly if a de escalated notification level is specified by the notification rule for the location the notification library can generate a device notification that can vary from the type of notification requested by the user application . For example in the case of an email notification the notification rule can specify that an audible tone should not be generated nor should the vibration motor be vibrated while the visible notifications in the user interface and LED should be generated.

The notification rule can specify a notification level that varies from the requested notification in various ways and in various permutations such as in the form of various volumes or selections of ringtones a repeat frequency or repeat pattern of a ringtone vibration motor activation and or LED activation the intensity of the LED activation and in other combination and permutations as can be appreciated. For example the notification rule can specify a particular volume of a ringtone that varies from a default volume level. As another example the notification rule can specify a pattern with which the vibration motor is activated that varies relative to the default pattern. As yet another example the notification rule can specify a frequency with which the LED is activated that varies from the default frequency. Additionally the notification rule can specify varying levels of display brightness that can be employed in response to certain ambient conditions.

In some embodiments a notification rule maintained by the notification library can specify one or more device notifications associated with some characteristic of the location of the mobile device and or other device sensor data that vary from the default notifications that correspond to those requested by the user application . For example an email application may ordinarily request from the notification library a particular combination of default device notifications. Accordingly a notification rule can specify certain device notifications that are employed in addition to the default notifications. For example an email application may request to generate device notifications that include the playing of a ringtone activation of an LED and vibration motor and or the display of a user interface element. Accordingly a notification rule can specify that the volume of a default ringtone should be elevated the frequency with which the LED and or vibration motor are repeated to be modified or specify other changes to a default device notifications.

In one embodiment a user of a mobile device may set up various notification rules via a user interface provided by the notification library on the mobile device and or via a web based user interface. The notification rules can specify a notification level that includes a combination of device notifications that are associated with a particular location type of location or device sensor data. In one embodiment a notification rule can specify that when the location of the mobile device is within a predetermined radius of a specific location address and or point of interest that notifications received while the device is within the predetermined radius should be escalated or de escalated. For example if the mobile device is located within a predetermined radius of an office address of a user notifications can be de escalated with the mobile device is in such a location. In contrast if the mobile device is located within a predetermined radius of for example a concert venue a stadium an arena or any other location that can be associated with high ambient volume levels notifications can be escalated.

As another example the notification library can determine a location type associated with a particular location to determine whether notification levels should be escalated or de escalated. For example the notification library can cross reference a location of the mobile device with mapping data to determine the type of location that the mobile device is in or near. The notification library can escalate or de escalate notification levels based upon the type of location. For example the notification library can determine that the mobile device is located in an office environment a library book store or other environment that is likely to be a quiet environment and de escalate incoming notifications. As another example the notification library can determine that the mobile device is in a retail establishment venue or other environment associated with high volume levels and escalate notifications in such a scenario. To identify a location type the notification library can query location listings from mapping data that identifies the types and or identities of residences places of business or other types of venues.

Additionally upon identifying a particular point of interest associated with the location or a location type e.g. residence business retail office movie theater etc. the notification library can alter notification levels depending upon the time of day. For example if the mobile device is located within a movie theater the notification library can examine movie times associated with the movie theater and identify that the user associated with the mobile device is in the movie theater during a movie showing. Accordingly a de escalated notification level can be selected in such a scenario. As another example the notification library can determine from a listing of events whether an event associated with high volume levels e.g. concert sporting events etc. is occurring in a venue in which a mobile device is located. In such a scenario escalated notification levels can be employed. Such a listing of events can be obtained from a source that is accessible to the mobile device via the network .

Additionally the notification library can obtain operating hours associated with a particular location from a listing associated with the location to determine whether the location is likely to comprise a loud or quiet environment during the time in which the mobile device is at the location. If for example an incoming notification is received during operating hours of a place of business and the mobile device is located within or near the place of business the notification library can identify the location type to make a determination as to whether the location is likely to be a quiet environment or a loud environment. The notification library can then escalate or de escalate notifications if the environment is likely to be loud or quiet respectively. In some embodiments a user may specify the operating hours of a place of business or other type of location if the operating hours obtained from the listing are incorrect or cannot be obtained for any other reason and the notification library can associate the operating hours with the location in order to escalate or de escalate notifications when the mobile device is located in or near the location.

For example if the mobile device is located within a library during the operating hours of the library the notification library can employ de escalated notification levels. As another example if the mobile device is located within an amusement park during operating hours the notification library can employ escalated notification levels. As another example the notification library can determine based upon a device calendar associated with the mobile device indicates that the user is presently busy or engaged in a meeting. In such a scenario the notification library can adopt de escalated notification levels until the user is not busy or engaged in a meeting.

As another example a notification rule established by a user can specify that when the mobile device is within a certain radius of an address associated with another user to which the user is linked that an escalated or de escalated notification level is then applied to an incoming notification. As another example the notification library can determine whether the mobile device is in a location associated with another user to which the user is linked by examining a contact data store on the mobile device . If so then the notification library can escalate or de escalate incoming notifications while the mobile device is in such a location. As a variation of this example the notification library can determine whether the mobile device is in a location associated with another user to whom the user is linked in a social networking system and escalate or de escalate notifications while the mobile device is in such a location.

As another example the notification library can also determine whether the location of the mobile device is within the proximity of or a specified radius of another device associated with a user to whom the user is linked in some way. For example the notification library can determine from a social networking system in which users can provide their locations or check in to various locations whether another user to whom a user of the mobile device is linked is in a location within a specified radius of the mobile device . If so then the notification library can examine the content of a notification determine whether the notification originates from or is related to the other user and escalate notifications that are related to the other user. In some embodiments rather that detecting proximity of a device associated with another user to whom the user of the mobile device is linked in some way a device associated with the other user that is within a specified distance of the location of the mobile device can broadcast a signal via a wireless radio e.g. Bluetooth which can be received by the mobile device .

Additionally the notification library can also determine a relationship between the user and another user associated with the location to which the user is linked. Notifications can then be escalated or de escalated based upon the location and the relationship. For example the notification library can escalate or de escalate notifications when the mobile device is in a location associated with another user to whom the user is related. As another example the notification library can modify notification levels when the mobile device is in a location associated with another user who is a friend or co worker of the user. The notification library can determine a relationship between another user and the user associated with the mobile device by examining a published relationship in a social networking system and or a contact store accessible to the mobile device . A contact store can correspond to an address book that is stored on or accessible to the mobile device .

As another example the notification library can also determine an importance of a relationship to a user related to content of a particular notification relative another user to which the mobile device is near. In other words the notification library can determine whether the mobile device is near another user and subsequently determine whether a notification related to yet another user to which the user of the mobile device is linked is received by the notification library . Accordingly a user can define the relative importance of users with respect to notifications and escalate a notification level when a notification is received that is related to a user that is associated with a higher importance level relative to a user to which the mobile device is near. Conversely a de escalated notification level can be applied when a notification is received that is related to a user that is associated with a lower importance level relative to a user to which the mobile device is near.

The notification library can also determine a velocity of the mobile device from data obtained from the GNSS system . Accordingly the notification library can alter notification levels based upon the velocity of the mobile device at any given point in time. If the velocity of the mobile device exceeds a predefined threshold the notification library can employ escalated notification levels as an elevated velocity may be consistent with elevated ambient noise levels. Similarly if the velocity is beneath a threshold or indicates that the mobile device is stationary the notification library can employ de escalated notification levels as such a velocity may be consistent with decreased ambient noise levels. Additionally a user may specify via a user configured notification rule one or more velocity thresholds and various notification levels with each of the velocity thresholds. Additionally the notification library can also select escalated notification levels when location data obtained from the GNSS system indicates that the mobile device is located within or near a roadway airport or any other similar type of environment that can be associated with elevated noise levels.

The notification library can also generate notification rules by learning what types of notifications are of importance to the user of the mobile device . To accomplish this the notification library can identify a user input in response to a notification that is generated by the notification library and determine whether the user input represents a user interaction or a lack of a user interaction with the notification. If a user interaction with the notification is detected such as when a user opens a notification or a user application related to the notification the notification library can generate a notification rule that assigns an escalated notification level to the current location of the mobile device . If a lack of a user interaction with the notification is detected such as when a user dismisses or cancels a notification generated by the notification library then the notification library can generate a notification rule that assigns a de escalated notification level to the current location of the mobile device .

As another example the notification library can generate notification rules by determining based upon actions within a user application that the user may take. For example user interaction with the notification is detected such as when a user opens a notification related to an email message SMS message or any other type of message and the user subsequently deletes the associated message the notification library can assign a de escalated notification level to the location of the mobile device . Additionally in this scenario the notification library can also detect whether the user reads replies to or otherwise interacts with the message and assign an escalated notification level to the location of the mobile device .

Referring next to shown is an example of a mobile device displaying a user interface in which various types of notifications can be generated by the notification library . In the example of also shown is an example of an externally visible LED that can be activated by the notification library in response to a request to generate a notification from a user application . In the depicted example a user application such as an email application has requested to generate a notification in the mobile device . Accordingly in the scenario shown in the user application has requested that the notification include periodic activation of the LED as well as display of a notification badge in a notification area of the user interface and potentially playing of a ringtone associated with the email application. Therefore in this scenario the notification library can generate the requested notifications. For example in this scenario there may be no predefined notification rules corresponding to the location of the device. Therefore if there are no predefined notification rules corresponding to the location the notification library can generate notification according to a default behavior which can include generating the notifications requested by the user application .

Referring next to shown is an alternative example of a mobile device and user interface in which the notification library has generated a device notification corresponding to a notification rule. In the depicted example a notification rule specifying a de escalated notification level is identified that applies to the current location of the mobile device . Accordingly the notification rule can specify that the notification library generates device notifications that vary from those requested by the user application . In this example the notification library can display the notification badge but can also suppress activation of the LED as well as potentially suppress playing of a ringtone.

Referring next to shown is an alternative example of a mobile device and user interface in which the notification library has generated a device notification corresponding to a notification rule. In the depicted example a notification rule specifying an escalated notification level is identified that applies to the location of the mobile device . Accordingly the notification rule can specify that the notification library generates device notifications associated with an escalated notification level. In one embodiment the escalated notification level includes additional or alternative device notifications that can signal importance of the notification to the user of the mobile device . The escalated notification level can include device notifications that vary from those requested by the user application .

In this example the notification library can display the notification badge and activate the LED which may be the device notifications requested by the user application . The notification library in order to effectuate an escalated notification level can also display a popup notification in the user interface that includes user interface elements with which the user may interact. In this example the popup notification allows the user to dismiss the notification or view additional information related to the notification e.g. the email message . The notification library can also periodically activate a vibration motor associated with the mobile device until the user interacts with popup notification even though such a notification may not have been requested by the user application .

Additionally the notification library can also refine and or define notification rules that are related to the location of the mobile device based upon user interaction with the popup notification . In the depicted example the notification library can detect user input that corresponds to user interaction with the notification such as activation of the View button. The notification library can also detect user input that corresponds to a lack of user interaction with the notification such as activation of the Cancel button. In the case of detection of user interaction with the notification the notification library can confirm a notification rule associated with the location as well as other device sensor data associated with ambient conditions. The notification library can also adjust the notification rule applying to the location to an even more escalated notification level. In the case of detection of a lack of user interaction with the notification the notification library can adjust the notification rule associated with the location so that a de escalated notification level is applied.

Referring next to shown is a flowchart that provides one example of the operation of at least a portion of the notification library according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. Alternatively the flowchart of may be viewed as depicting steps of an example of a method implemented in a mobile device .

Beginning with box the notification library obtains a request from a user application executed by the mobile device to generate one or more device notifications. The request can include a notification data item that includes notification content that is related to the notification or that the user application is attempting to place in a visual notification user interface element. The notification data item also includes the requested types of notification such as whether to place a notification badge in a user interface a popup element LED activation vibration motor activation and or playing of audible alerts or ringtones. As noted above a user application can include any application executed by the mobile device that initiates notifications in the mobile device that are related to communications e.g. email SMS mobile application push notifications etc. obtain on behalf of a user as well as applications that generate notifications related to any other type of content e.g. calendar applications games electronic commerce applications etc. .

The notification library can then determine a location of the mobile device in box . As noted above the notification library can request the location of the mobile device from an operating system executed by the mobile device which can obtain location data of the mobile device from the GNSS system and or the wireless radios . Additionally in box the notification library can determine whether a location type and or point of interest can be associated with the location. In other words the notification library can identify a location listing associated with the location of the mobile device . In some embodiments the notification library can determine a location type associated with the location and or a point of interest associated with the location.

The notification library can also determine whether an event is occurring at the location that can be associated with elevated volume levels such as a concert or sporting event. The notification library can also determine whether an event is occurring at the location that can be associated with lowered volume levels. The notification library can also determine whether the location is associated with another user to which the user of the mobile device is linked. For example the notification library can examine an address book on the mobile device to determine whether the location is associated with a user in the address book. As another example the notification library can determine whether the location is associated with another user in a social networking system to which the user is linked. Additionally the notification library can also attempt to determine a published relationship between the other user and the user of the mobile device .

In box the notification library determines whether a notification rule is defined that applies to the location and or properties associated with the location. As noted above in one embodiment the notification library can determine based upon a location type whether the location is associated with elevated volume levels. In such a scenario the notification library can employ an escalated notification level. Alternatively the notification library may also determine based upon the location type whether the location is associated with lowered volume levels relative to a baseline volume level. In such a scenario the notification library can employ de escalated notification levels.

In box the notification library can apply a default notification level if a notification rule is not defined that applies to the location and or location properties. In one embodiment the default notification level can include generating the notifications requested by the user application taking into account whether the mobile device is in a quiet mode silent mode loud mode or other type of operating system setting that affects the type and or degree of device notifications desired by the user. In box if a notification rule is identified that corresponds to the location and or location properties the notification library can then identify a notification level that corresponds to the notification rule. The notification level specified by the notification rule can define various types of device notifications that should be applied. Finally in box the notification library can cause the device notification specified by the notification level applied to be generated in the mobile device .
