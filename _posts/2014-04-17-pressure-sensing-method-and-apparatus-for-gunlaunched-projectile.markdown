title: Pressure sensing method and apparatus for gun-launched projectile
abstract: A method of determining fluid pressure on a gun-launched projectile relies on deformation of a thin layer of a metallic material that comprises the outer layer of a segment of the projectile body. The axial segment of the projectile body that is selected for pressure measurement is altered or replaced with another axial segment. The altered segment has a thin-walled, structural, metallic sleeve that is concentric with an underlying hollow, metallic cylindrical body. The radially outermost surface of the body underlying the sleeve has a plurality of indentations formed thereon. Measurements of the deformations of the thin-walled sleeve into the indentations in the underlying body are correlated with known deformation and pressure data to determine pressure that was applied to the projectile during its ballistic cycle.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to pressure measurement and in particular to the measurement of fluid pressure on projectiles launched from gun tubes.

Projectiles launched from tubes such as barrels rifles cannons etc. require a gas seal. The gas seal enables pressure to build up behind the projectile. The pressure applies a force on the base of the projectile thereby accelerating the projectile down the barrel and achieving a desired muzzle velocity. The desired muzzle velocity enables the projectile to fly far enough or fast enough to impact a point downrange.

Gas seals have evolved over the years from gas checks paper plastic metal wadding or a combination thereof to obturators. Obturators can be highly efficient pressure seals but in most launch tubes some amount of propellant gas or pressure escapes past the obturator. The escaped gas or pressure is known as blow by.

The obturator can be located almost anywhere on the projectile for example behind the projectile on the projectile base or toward the front of the projectile. Regardless of the location of the obturator some pressure will leak past the obturator and act on the projectile. The amount of leakage or blow by is often not well characterized.

Pressure leakage past the obturator can be detrimental to the round or projectile. Blow by may prevent the round from exiting the tube by imposing a buckling force on the projectile. Blow by may mechanically deform the round and or damage it so that the round interferes with the barrel wall. Interference of the projectile with the barrel wall may ruin the barrel and or the projectile. In the case of high explosive rounds a deformed projectile may explode and injure or kill nearby personnel.

Measurements of for example the pressure on the base of a gun launched projectile the amount of blow by gas and the pressure of blow by gas are needed for many reasons. These measurements are needed for example to determine the interior ballistics of a weapon system the margin of safety for the pressure seal or obturator the characteristics of a new projectile and or the interoperability of munitions across standardized weapons.

Past methods of determining acceptable performance of gun launched projectiles include statistical analysis of large numbers of fired rounds. The statistical methods enable one to gain confidence in a particular projectile design only by the sheer volume of successful firings. When the cost of projectiles is high or if a projectile is in a developmental stage a more cost effective and scientific method is the use of instrumented projectiles. Instrumented projectiles can be used to evaluate interior ballistics measure the amount of base pressure and measure the amount of blow by. The instruments may be pressure gauges or electronic instruments.

Pressure gauges are most often electro mechanical systems that use piezoelectric materials. When crushed the piezoelectric materials generate a voltage. The amount of voltage is proportional to the amount of force applied to the crystal or materials so one can calibrate a gauge and correlate the measured voltage to a well defined static or dynamic pressure. When placed on projectiles these gauges experience extreme accelerations. These accelerations also apply inertial loads to the piezoelectric materials thereby imparting some bias or error to the measured signal. These gauges also require ports to enable the pressure to act on the gauge. The ports must be recessed enough to prevent impact from the propellant gas and from the barrel. The manner in which the ports are exposed to the pressure is often of significance because pressure waves within the port can prevent accurate measurements. Even if the gauge components are correctly machined calibrated oriented ported and installed the electronic data collecting system is very expensive and susceptible to damage. The damage leads to erroneous measurements.

Another method of measuring pressure on a projectile uses pressure sensitive tape applied to the outside of the projectile. The tape materials are similar to the gauges in that the crystal structure of the tape has a known resonant frequency and wavelength. When the tape is applied to the projectile and exposed to the gas pressure the change in the crystal structure produces a frequency shift that can be observed as a change in color. Pressure sensitive tapes are to some extent sensitive to the heat applied to them by the combustion of the propellant. In addition the pressure sensitive tapes can separate from the projectile and scatter across the test range thereby eliminating their usefulness. Even if the tape remains on the projectile the change in material structure and appearance may require spectrum analysis because the color shift may be perceived differently by different observers.

One method of measuring gun chamber pressures uses copper spheres and anvils. When compressed the anvil crushes the sphere and creates two flats on the sphere. The measurement across the flats is compared to previously validated data to determine maximum chamber pressure. The copper spheres are not suitable for use on projectiles.

A need exists for a low cost accurate and dependable apparatus and method for measuring fluid pressure on gun launched projectiles.

One aspect of the invention is a method of determining fluid pressure on a projectile launched from a tube. The method includes providing a projectile having a plurality of voids formed in the external surface of the projectile. The voids have a known size shape and location on the projectile. Each void is covered with a thin metallic layer of material. The projectile is launched from the tube. Fluid pressure acting on the projectile alters the volume of one or more of the plurality of voids by deforming the thin metallic layer of material into the void volume. The projectile is recovered and the change in the void volume caused by deformation of the thin layer of material into the void volume is measured. The measured change in void volume is correlated to values of fluid pressure that caused the change in void volume.

The method may include hermetically sealing each void to prevent fluid from entering each void. The voids may be formed in the base bottom of the projectile in the body of the projectile or in an ogive portion of the projectile.

Another method of determining fluid pressure on a projectile launched from a tube includes providing a projectile that includes a metallic cylindrical body wall and a central longitudinal axis. A portion of the cylindrical body wall has an outer diameter and a radial thickness. The portion of the cylindrical body wall is altered by reducing its radial thickness and forming a plurality of indentations of known geometry on the radially outermost surface of the reduced thickness portion. The method includes fixing a metallic cylindrical sleeve over the reduced thickness portion. The cylindrical sleeve has the same outer diameter as the outer diameter of the portion of the cylindrical body wall.

The projectile is launched from the tube. The cylindrical sleeve is deformed into the plurality of indentations on the reduced thickness portion to produce a deformed cylindrical sleeve. The projectile is recovered and the deformations in the deformed cylindrical sleeve are measured. The measured deformations are correlated to values of fluid pressure that caused the measured deformations.

The step of correlating may include comparing the measured deformations to deformations created by hydrostatic tests and or comparing the measured deformations to computer simulated deformations.

The step of reducing the radial thickness may include machining the portion of the cylindrical body wall and the step of forming a plurality of indentations may include forming a plurality of indentations in the machined portion of the body wall.

The step of altering the portion of the body wall may include removing the portion of the body wall from the projectile and installing a test body wall having the reduced thickness.

The step of forming a plurality of indentations may include forming a plurality of indentations that extend axially along and circumferentially around the reduced thickness portion.

The step of forming a plurality of indentations may include forming a plurality of indentations wherein each indentation has a central longitudinal axis that is normal to the central longitudinal axis of the projectile.

Another aspect of the invention is a projectile having a hollow cylindrical body made of a metallic material a central longitudinal axis and an outer diameter. A thin walled metallic sleeve is fixed on an axial segment of the body. The sleeve has the same outer diameter as the body. A second hollow cylindrical body is made of a metallic material and has a central longitudinal axis collinear with the axis of the body. The second body is disposed radially inward of and concentric with the sleeve and is fixed to the sleeve. A plurality of indentations are formed in the radially outermost surface of the second body. Fluid pressure acting on the sleeve deforms the sleeve into the plurality of indentations.

Each indentation may have a central longitudinal axis that is normal to the central longitudinal axis of the hollow cylindrical body. Each indentation may be symmetric about its central longitudinal axis.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel apparatus and method for measuring fluid pressure on the external surface of a gun launched projectile relies on the known response of a specific material or materials to an applied force. Using Hooke s Law in conjunction with stress strain curves for the specific materials the known responses of the materials are used to calibrate permanent deflections of the materials that result from pressure acting on them. The pressure may be for example gas pressure in the interior of a gun tube such as blow by pressure or base pressure. The measured pressure may also be applied to the external surface of the projectile by an object that is impacted and penetrated by the projectile after the projectile leaves the gun tube.

The novel apparatus and method are mechanical in nature and eliminate the need for electronic instrumentation and its problems. The materials used are well characterized metallic materials. The materials remain on the projectile throughout the interior and exterior ballistic cycle. The method enables the actual mapping of pressure forces over the external surface of the projectile body. The projectile caliber may vary from about 0.17 inches to about 18 inches. The projectile may be launched from a smooth bore or rifled gun tube.

In the external surface area of the projectile where pressure measurement is desired one or more voids are formed. The void or voids have a known size and shape. The voids are covered with a thin layer of metallic material. Pressure acting on the thin layer of material plastically deforms the thin layer into the voids. The amount of deflection of the thin layer of material into each void the total amount of deformed material at each void and or the change in void volume at each void are related to the pressure applied to the thin layer at each respective void.

In one embodiment of the invention the projectile is altered by removing material from its outer surface or radial wall thickness. One or more voids or indentations are formed in the surface of the projectile or in the area of reduced diameter or thickness. Preferably and depending on the size of the projectile a plurality of the voids are formed in the area of pressure measurement interest. The location size and geometry of the voids are not arbitrary. The voids are placed at locations selected for pressure measurement. The size and geometry of the voids are selected based on among other factors estimates of maximum pressure. The geometry of each void is preferably symmetric. The size geometry and volume of the voids may vary from one void to another.

The voids are covered with a thin layer of structural material having well characterized mechanical properties for example aluminum steel or stainless steel. The outer diameter or profile of the thin layer of structural material is the same as the original outer diameter or profile of the selected pressure measurement area on the projectile. Thus the altered projectile will have an external profile and external dimensions which are substantially the same as if the projectile had not been altered for pressure measurement. Preferably the voids are hermetically sealed to prevent leakage of fluid external to the projectile into the voids.

Pressure from propellant gas or pressure from a target impact causes the thin layer of structural material to plastically deform into the voids in the projectile. After the projectile has come to rest the projectile is recovered. Then measurements are made of the amount of deflection of the thin layer of material into each void the total amount of deformed material at each void and or the change in void volume at each void. The measured deflection total deformation or change in void volume is then correlated to pressure to obtain a maximum pressure at each void.

Varying the size of the void or the thickness of the thin layer of material alters the amount of force required to plastically deform the layer of material into the void. The size geometry and depth of the voids and the thickness of the thin layer of material may be chosen to prevent the thin layer of material from completely plastically deforming into the void or fracturing. The size depth and geometry of adjacent voids may be varied to create multiple measurement points and pressure resolutions in a small area. Multiple measurement points may help to null erroneous measurements or to expose anomalies in the thin layer of material for example non homogeneities such as cracks empty spaces etc. Multiple void geometries help increase measurement resolution by altering the strain and deformation in the thin layer of material that is caused by the applied pressure.

When measuring base pressure in the launch tube the portion of the projectile selected for pressure measurement will typically be a selected base surface area of the projectile aft of the obturator groove. In one embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile base remains integral with the remainder of the projectile body while its configuration is altered and prepared for pressure measurement. In another embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile base is removed from the remainder of the projectile body and then replaced with a portion that is configured for pressure measurement.

When measuring blow by pressure in the launch tube the portion of the projectile selected for pressure measurement will typically be a selected axial length of the cylindrical projectile body. In one embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile body remains integral with the remainder of the projectile body while its configuration is altered and prepared for pressure measurement. In another embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile body is removed from the remainder of the projectile body and then replaced with a portion that is configured for pressure measurement.

When measuring hydraulic loading pressure from fluid impact the portion of the projectile selected for pressure measurement will typically be a selected axial length of the projectile ogive. In one embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile ogive remains integral with the remainder of the projectile body while its configuration is altered and prepared for pressure measurement. In another embodiment of the invention the selected portion of the projectile ogive is removed from the remainder of the projectile body and then replaced with a portion that is configured for pressure measurement.

The body wall of portion may be altered by reducing its radial thickness C to a lesser thickness D as shown in . Then a plurality of voids or indentations of known geometry are formed at specific locations on the radially outermost surface of the reduced thickness portion . is a perspective view of portion with a plurality of indentations formed therein. The remainder of projectile is not shown in only portion . Indentations may extend axially along and circumferentially around the reduced thickness portion .

Indentations in have the shape of right circular cylinders although other shapes may be used including differing shapes on the same projectile. Indentations may also vary in size and depth. For example indentations may increase in size from the smallest indentation to to to the largest indentation . As shown in for indentation each indentation may have a central longitudinal axis F that is normal to axis A of projectile . Preferably each indentation is symmetric about its axis F.

The reduced wall thickness of portion may be created by machining material from body wall and then forming the indentations in the machined reduced thickness portion. In this way portion remains integral with projectile . Alternatively portion may be completely removed from projectile and a specially fabricated test piece or portion installed in projectile in place of portion . The specially fabricated piece may be installed in projectile using for example threaded joints welding chemical adhesion etc.

One way to correlate the measurements of deformations with pressure exerted on sleeve is to hydrostatically test the projectile in a test tank. In the test tank the projectile has sleeve installed over the indentations . Using the test tank a data set that contains measures of deformation of sleeve and corresponding hydrostatic pressures is created. The measurements of deformations are then compared to the test tank data set to determine the values of the propellant pressure or other forces that caused deformations .

Another way to correlate the measurements of deformations with pressure exerted on sleeve is to use energy based computer simulations of the interior ballistic cycle to calculate plastic strain and deformation. A computerized finite element analysis FEA may be performed on the projectile configuration using interior ballistic cycle loads inputs constraints and actual material properties. The FEA may be performed using for example the ABAQUS FEA computer software program to calculate accumulated plastic strain or equivalent plastic strain known as PEEQ resulting from the simulation. The measurements of deformations may then be compared to the computer modeled plastic strains and deformations resulting from the simulation pressures. The simulated pressures and resultant deformations in model space may be used to create an equation or look up table to determine the magnitude of the pressures or forces that caused the deformations in reality.

The embodiments of show projectile with a reduced diameter portion in which indentations are formed. However voids or indentations may be formed directly in body wall of projectile without reducing its diameter. In this case sleeve is not used. The voids may be formed by for example drilling or machining body wall . The thin layer of material for each void may be for example a metal cover welded flush with the adjacent external surface of body wall . Or in lieu of welding a hollow metal insert may be fixed in each void. The hollow metal insert has a top surface that is flush or even with the adjacent external surface of body wall . The hollow metal inserts may be fixed in each void by for example press fitting or threading the hollow metal inserts in each void.

Grooves and indentations may be formed by removing material from the external surface of ogive portion and base bottom respectively. Removing material may include reducing the external dimensions of a portion or all of ogive portion or base bottom in addition to removing material to create grooves and indentations . Removing the additional material enables installation of a monolithic thin layer of metallic material similar to sleeve . Then in a manner analogous to sleeve a monolithic thin layer of metallic material may be fixed over grooves and another monolithic thin layer of metallic material may be fixed over indentations . The monolithic thin layers of material plastically deform into grooves or indentations when subjected to external fluid pressure. The thin layers of material are preferably hermetically sealed over grooves and indentations to prevent external fluid leakage into grooves and indentations .

Alternatively and as discussed above with regard to projectile grooves and indentations or other types of voids may be formed directly in ogive portion and base bottom without removing other material adjacent to grooves or indentations . Grooves and indentations may be formed by for example drilling or machining ogive portion and base bottom respectively. Each individual groove or indentation is then covered by a respective thin layer of metallic material. The thin layer of metallic material for each groove and indentation may be for example individual metal covers that are welded flush with the adjacent external surface of ogive portion or base bottom .

In lieu of welding a separate cover for each void a hollow metal insert may be fixed in each groove or indentation . The hollow metal insert for a groove may be an annular ring having a top surface that is flush or even with the adjacent external surface of ogive portion . The hollow metal insert for an indentation has a top surface that is flush or even with the adjacent external surface of base bottom . The hollow metal inserts may be fixed in each groove or indentation by for example press fitting or threading the hollow metal inserts in each groove or indentation.

Among other methods the various methods disclosed herein that may be used to fabricate the pressure measuring portions of projectile and projectile may also be used to fabricate body portion having voids and thin metallic layer .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
