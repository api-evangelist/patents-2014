This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 915 969 entitled TRAILER STABILITY CONTROL FOR LONG WHEELBASED STEERED TRAILERS AND METHOD THEREFOR filed on Dec. 13 2013 the entirety of the above noted application is incorporated by reference herein.

Generally long wheelbase trailers provide support for a vertical load between two or more axles of a trailer which may be towed connected or attached to a vehicle. Practical applications for long wheelbase trailers may include an ability to tow larger masses utilizing smaller vehicles without compromising one or more stability characteristics. Stability characteristics or the dynamics between a vehicle and a long wheelbase trailer towed by the vehicle are among the factors to consider when designing or operating a vehicle connected to attached to or towing a trailer e.g. a vehicle trailer system . A yaw stability of a vehicle towing a long wheel based trailer e.g. trailer is generally considerably lower than a yaw stability of the vehicle by itself. For example a vehicle coupled with a trailer generally demonstrates or exhibits a reduced damping ratio of yaw dynamics which may progressively worsen as the velocity of the vehicle trailer system increases.

A vehicle with a trailer in tow may have different or additional modes of instability than merely a vehicle without a trailer attached. For example jackknifing between the vehicle and the trailer may occur such as when the trailer swings about a hitch connecting the vehicle and the trailer. Explained another way when there is a large amount of relative yaw motion between the vehicle and the trailer jackknifing may occur. As another example instability may occur as a result of oscillation such as lateral oscillation or as a result of snaking which is oscillation of the trailer when high velocities are reached. In yet another example instability may occur as a result of a phase lag or a phase difference between characteristics of the vehicle and the trailer such as a phase lag between the vehicle motion and the trailer motion caused by a distance separating the two e.g. a separation distance . Yet another cause of instability may include rearward amplification RWA between a vehicle and a trailer. Rearward amplification is an increased lateral acceleration at a center of gravity CG of a trailer to that a center of gravity of a vehicle or a lead vehicle attached to the trailer operating one or more maneuvers or dynamic maneuvers.

Regardless instability or unstable motion such as excessive yaw motion or undesired yaw motion associated with a vehicle or a trailer is generally not desired. Further instability or unstable motion may be exacerbated for a vehicle when a trailer is attached to the vehicle and a vehicle trailer system is formed. When a trailer is attached or coupled to a vehicle a lower yaw stability margin or unstable dynamics may result from attachment of the trailer.

Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for purposes of illustrating one or more exemplary embodiments and not for purposes of limiting the same is an illustration of an example vehicle trailer system according to one or more embodiments. The vehicle trailer system may include a vehicle towing a trailer . The vehicle may be coupled to the trailer via a hitch H . The vehicle may have one or more wheels or tires such as tires driver side front passenger side front driver side rear and passenger side rear . Although illustrates a vehicle with four tires and a trailer with four tires other embodiments may include additional or fewer tires for the vehicle or the trailer respectively. Similarly the trailer may have one or more wheels or tires such as tires driver side front passenger side front driver side rear and passenger side rear . As used herein the following includes a list of variables or parameters and a corresponding description 

Referring now to an illustration of an example component diagram of a system for stability control according to one or more embodiments is shown. The system may include a sensor component a predictive component a storage component a management component a control component a notification component an actuation component and a mechanical damper .

The sensor component may include one or more sensors detecting calculating or receiving one or more vehicle characteristics one or more trailer characteristics one or more hitch characteristics one or more vehicle system characteristics one or more measured characteristics one or more steering inputs e.g. steering angle etc. Examples of sensors may include a yaw rate sensor a velocity sensor or velocity receiver position sensors gyroscopic sensors etc. Examples of vehicle characteristics trailer characteristics hitch characteristics vehicle trailer system characteristics measured characteristics etc. may include velocity yaw yaw motion yaw rate yaw moment hitch rate hitch angle hitch tension lateral hitch force hitch angle response damping ratio cornering force braking force etc.

The sensor component may calculate a characteristic such as a hitch rate based on one or more of the measured characteristics e.g. a vehicle yaw rate and a trailer yaw rate . As another example the sensor component may calculate a yaw rate deviation for a vehicle or vehicle trailer system based on measured characteristics e.g. velocity of a vehicle measured yaw rate etc. and steering inputs e.g. steering angle for the vehicle or vehicle trailer system. Regardless the sensor component may calculate one or more of the vehicle characteristics or one or more of the trailer characteristics based on one or more of the measured characteristics or one or more of the steering inputs.

The predictive component may calculate determine or generate one or more predictions or one or more jackknife predictions based on yaw rate deviation or hitch rate oscillation of a vehicle trailer system. As an illustrative example the predictive component may generate one or more predictions regarding a likelihood of jackknifing between a trailer and a vehicle of a vehicle trailer system by estimating a vehicle state estimating a trailer state calculating a first order approximation to determine an evolution of the state of the vehicle or the state of the trailer and determining a risk based on an estimated time left before accident TLBA .

In one or more embodiments the predictive component may generate a jackknifing prediction or prediction based on yaw rate deviation between a desired yaw rate and an actual yaw rate of a vehicle a trailer or a vehicle trailer system. In other words the predictive component may utilize yaw rate deviation to estimate or predict jackknifing between a vehicle and a trailer of a vehicle trailer system. For example the predictive component may compare the desired yaw rate with the actual yaw rate of a vehicle. The predictive component may generate a prediction associated with jackknifing based on a difference greater than a yaw rate deviation threshold or a yaw rate safety threshold such as a predetermined yaw rate deviation threshold for example. The actual yaw rate may be measured or calculated by the sensor component . Additionally the velocity of the vehicle and the steering angle of the vehicle may be detected by the sensor component .

In one or more embodiments the desired yaw rate or nominal yaw rate may be calculated for a vehicle trailer or vehicle trailer system by the predictive component . For example the desired yaw rate of a vehicle may be calculated based on a model such as a linear model or a linear bicycle model. Again the predictive component may compare the desired yaw rate with the actual yaw rate of the vehicle. During stable or near ideal driving conditions or situations an actual yaw rate of a vehicle may be similar or within a close tolerance of a desired yaw rate of the vehicle.

Because a driver may not be able to discern non linear yaw characteristics under nominal driving conditions utilization of a linear model enables the predictive component to provide a reasonable representation of what the driver may wish to accomplish e.g. a desired yaw rate . An actual yaw motion or yaw rate of a vehicle trailer system may be related to a steering wheel angle exerted from a driver and the speed or velocity of the vehicle or vehicle trailer system. In one or more embodiments the predictive component may calculate a desired yaw rate or a nominal yaw rate for a vehicle or a vehicle trailer system based on one or more steering inputs such as a measured steering angle or velocity of a vehicle or a vehicle trailer system and a linear model such as a linear bicycle model.

As an example discrepancies between a desired yaw rate of a vehicle and an actual yaw rate of a vehicle may arise or increase when large slip angles develop at one or more tires on the vehicle or trailer . When these large slip angles develop this may result in the vehicle deviating from a desired course or otherwise cause a deviation in the desired yaw rate from the actual yaw rate. For a vehicle on its own a discrepancy between a desired yaw rate and actual yaw rate may be characterized as oversteer and understeer. Oversteer occurs when an actual yaw rate is greater than a desired yaw rate e.g. indicated or determined based on one or more steering inputs such as steering angle . Understeer occurs when an actual yaw rate is less than a desired yaw rate.

When a trailer is attached to connected to or coupled with a vehicle e.g. thereby forming a vehicle trailer system the predictive component may calculate or determine a desired yaw rate based on a linear vehicle model. In other words computation of a desired yaw rate mapping may be based on one or more steering inputs such as steering angle and velocity.

In one or more embodiments the predictive component may utilize a lookup table e.g. a predetermined lookup table to determine a desired yaw rate based on a velocity of a vehicle and a steering angle of the vehicle. For example an exemplary graphical representation of a lookup table is provided in . is an illustration of an example graphical representation of a yaw rate lookup table according to one or more embodiments. In it can be seen that a desired yaw rate may be determined at provided that a velocity and a steering angle are given. Effectively is a graphical representation of an example lookup table for a desired yaw rate e.g. along axis for a vehicle based on the velocity of the vehicle e.g. along axis and the steering angle of the vehicle e.g. along axis .

Referring back to the predictive component may determine a deviation or difference between a desired yaw rate and a measured yaw rate or an actual yaw rate or otherwise utilize yaw rate deviation to enable disable activate or trigger stability control via the control component . The predictive component may thus engage stability control based on yaw rate deviation. For example a signal may be sent to the control component to activate stability control based on an error or a deviation e.g. yaw rate deviation greater than a yaw rate deviation threshold. In this way stability control may be activated by the predictive component when a difference greater than a threshold difference e.g. or absolute value thereof between a desired yaw rate and an actual or measured yaw rate is determined or found.

Additionally a maximum yaw rate limit for a coupled system or vehicle trailer system may be considered. Under assumptions of small side slip and steady state turning the lateral acceleration may be approximated as a product of the vehicle velocity and the yaw rate A U . Since the steady state lateral acceleration may not be increased beyond frictional limits the desired yaw rate from the above equation may be governed by the following relationship s 

In one or more embodiments the predictive component may transmit or send a signal to the notification component to have the notification component warn or notify a driver of a vehicle based on an actual yaw rate or measured yaw rate greater than a yaw rate safety threshold. In other words the predictive component may have the notification component warn a driver when the vehicle is turning faster than a predetermined threshold yaw rate e.g. the yaw rate safety threshold .

In other embodiments the predictive component may transmit a signal to the notification component based on a difference between the actual yaw rate and the desired yaw rate. In other words the predictive component may have the notification component warn a driver when a vehicle is turning faster than expected e.g. greater than a yaw rate deviation threshold . As will be discussed herein one or more control actions such as braking or steering may be applied in response to excessive yaw rate deviation e.g. when a yaw rate deviation between a desired yaw rate and an actual yaw rate which exceeds a pre determined threshold .

In one or more embodiments the predictive component may utilize hitch rate oscillation to estimate or predict jackknifing between a vehicle and a trailer for a vehicle trailer system. In other words the predictive component may generate a jackknifing prediction or prediction based on a hitch rate signal of a vehicle trailer system. The hitch rate signal may be utilized to facilitate such predictions because if yaw oscillations or hitch rate oscillations are present in a hitch due to snaking the oscillatory behavior on a trailer of a vehicle trailer system may grow over time thereby causing instability if left uncontrolled. Accordingly detection of these yaw oscillations e.g. via the hitch rate signal or snaking may be utilized by the predictive component to generate one or more predictions or one or more jackknife predictions.

As discussed the hitch rate is a difference between a vehicle yaw rate and a trailer yaw rate. In other words a hitch rate represents the yaw rate difference between the trailer and the vehicle dot over . Therefore when dot over or the hitch rate is a nonzero value and the hitch angle is changing thereby contributing to instability of the vehicle trailer system. The predictive component may thus utilize the hitch rate a hitch rate signal or hitch rate oscillation to determine or predict jackknifing for a vehicle trailer system.

During a transient state or a transient situation it may be useful to determine whether a final hitch angle rate converges to zero e.g. without providing one or more control actions . In a hitch angle hitch rate phase plane a region which represents stability of a vehicle trailer system may vary according to or based on a velocity of the vehicle trailer system. When trailer oscillations are present a resulting trajectory in this hitch angle hitch rate phase plane may be circular. Since the radius of such circular trajectories may increase as oscillations grow the rate of change for the hitch rate e.g. hitch angle acceleration may increase as well. In other words hitch angle acceleration may increase when trailer oscillations increase.

Accordingly the predictive component may utilize oscillation frequency and hitch angle acceleration e.g. from a hitch rate signal to determine hitch rate oscillation. The hitch rate signal may be received or calculated by the sensor component . When oscillation is present a hitch rate signal may be a sine wave signal due to the changing of the hitch rate or oscillation between the trailer and the vehicle. Because sine waves such as a hitch rate signal associated with oscillation have zero crossing points a wave duration counter may be initialized when the hitch rate signals crosses a zero line as indicated below 

In other words the wave duration counter may be utilized to measure the wavelength of a hitch rate signal thereby enabling the predictive component to determine a hitch rate oscillation wavelength.

Accordingly it can be seen that equation 3 includes a n 5 term which accounts for 5 samples at 10 millisecond time intervals. When a zero crossing is detected oscillation frequency or a hitch rate oscillation wavelength and hitch acceleration may be calculated. For example in a period may be calculated based on a period of time between a first zero crossing and a second zero crossing . Here in this example the period of time between the first zero crossing and the second or subsequent zero crossing may be a half period e.g. T 2 . Therefore a full period T may be calculated by multiplying the time between the first zero crossing and the second zero crossing by 2.

Referring again to the sensor component may receive a hitch rate signal detect one or more zero crossings for the hitch rate signal at one or more corresponding times and calculate an oscillation frequency oscillation wavelength hitch angle acceleration etc. for the hitch rate signal. The predictive component may calculate a hitch rate oscillation wavelength or oscillation frequency based on two or more of the zero crossings and corresponding times. For example the predictive component may take a difference between two subsequent succeeding or consecutive zero crossing times such as the difference between a second zero crossing time and a first zero crossing time .

The predictive component may utilize a frequency response of a transfer function to determine whether a corresponding frequency is indicative of the onset of instability e.g. or whether there is a likelihood of jackknifing . It can be seen that the resonant frequency in the response is also the same resonant frequency for . Accordingly the predictive component may set one or more oscillation detection criteria to generate a prediction of instability if oscillations near or on the resonant frequency are measured from the hitch rate signal. In one or more embodiments the predictive component may predict jackknifing between a vehicle and a trailer of a vehicle trailer system based on the transfer function or a resonant frequency thereof. Accordingly the predictive component may determine a jackknifing prediction or prediction based on a yaw rate of the vehicle a steering angle of the vehicle a related transfer function or a related resonant frequency.

In any event the peak amplitude of the hitch acceleration in the oscillation or the rate e.g. slope of a hitch rate during a zero crossing may be estimated as illustrated in . Measurements of hitch acceleration through different cycles of the hitch rate signal and analysis of one or more of the measurements e.g. hitch rate oscillation wavelength hitch acceleration one or more zero crossings e.g. etc. one or more corresponding zero crossing times etc. may enable the predictive component to determine whether a hitch rate signal converges or diverges. In other words the sensor component may receive the hitch rate signal and the predictive component may analyze one or more aspects e.g. period wavelength or slope of the hitch rate signal.

This analysis enables the predictive component to determine if a hitch rate signal is becoming unstable e.g. diverging or having an increasing oscillation magnitude or amplitude or if the hitch rate signal is damping e.g. converging or having a decreasing oscillation magnitude or amplitude . For example if the hitch acceleration is increasing over one or more oscillation cycles of the hitch rate signal the predictive component may determine that the hitch rate signal is indicative of unstable behavior e.g. possibility of jackknifing . Accordingly the control component may utilize this prediction to suggest one or more control actions e.g. control actions which increase hitch damping in closed loop motion etc. .

The storage component may house or store one or more thresholds such as yaw rate deviation threshold yaw rate safety threshold one or more predetermined thresholds time left before accident TLBA thresholds jackknife thresholds activation thresholds hitch angle thresholds etc.

In one or more embodiments the management component may activate stability control or the control component of a system for stability control based on a prediction from the predictive component e.g. indicative of instability jackknifing or a likelihood of instability for the vehicle trailer system the vehicle or the trailer . The management component may activate stability control or a have a control component engage in stability control based on yaw rate deviation e.g. an error or difference between an actual yaw rate and a desired yaw rate which is greater than a yaw rate deviation threshold or hitch rate oscillation of a hitch rate signal.

Generally the hitch rate should be reduced when stability is desired. However at lower speeds e.g. a velocity below a low speed maneuverability cutoff threshold maneuverability may be desired. Accordingly the management component may disable stability control or control actions for a vehicle trailer system based on a low speed maneuverability cutoff threshold. For example at low speeds or low velocities below the low speed maneuverability cutoff threshold stability control such as braking control actions may not be necessary e.g. to stabilize a trailer of a vehicle trailer system and may thus be disabled to enhance maneuverability at those low speeds or low velocities. In other words braking control actions may be disabled at speeds or velocities below the low speed maneuverability cutoff threshold. In this way when control actions such as braking control actions are disabled at low speeds greater maneuverability may be achieved for a vehicle trailer system.

At high speeds e.g. velocities greater than a high speed steering cutoff threshold the management component may disable one or more aspects of stability control such as one or more steering control actions for a trailer. In this way the management component may enable or disable stability control based on a velocity of a vehicle or a velocity of a vehicle trailer system.

The management component may activate stability control based on a time left before accident TLBA threshold or a threshold for activation based on a minimum TLBA which may be calculated by the predictive component .

The control component may determine one or more control actions for one or more actuators e.g. actuation component based on feedback from a vehicle trailer system. The control component may include one or more brake controllers one or more steering controllers one or more ABS controllers or a combination thereof. For example the control component may utilize hitch rate feedback or lateral hitch force feedback to determine one or more of the control actions. With regard to hitch rate feedback the control component may implement hitch rate feedback control to provide one or more control actions which mitigate or minimize the hitch rate. In other words the sensor component may monitor the hitch rate and the control component may provide one or more control actions which when implemented reduce the amount or magnitude of the hitch rate detected by the sensor component . Explained another way the control component may monitor a hitch rate of a vehicle trailer system and determine one or more control actions based on the hitch rate.

For example an activation threshold may be set in a dot over phase plane to detect one or more jackknife conditions or predictions associated with a vehicle trailer system. Accordingly the control component may apply one or more control actions such as one or more braking actions or one or more steering actions to mitigate instability or potential jackknifing. The control component may apply braking control actions or steering control actions proportional to a distance beyond a stable threshold e.g. an activation threshold .

In one or more embodiments an activation threshold and a control gain are tunable based on customizable preferences or user preferences such as desired handling or one or more conservativeness characteristics. Utilizing the hitch rate limitation approach the control component may drive a steady state configuration of a vehicle trailer system to minimize the hitch rate when possible. In other words because the desired hitch rate or dot over 0 the control component may determine one or more control actions which when implemented may drive the oscillation rate or hitch rate of a vehicle trailer system down or otherwise reduce the hitch rate.

A benefit of using hitch rate feedback is that because the hitch angle and hitch rate are relative quantities between vehicle and trailer the steady state desired value is zero. Therefore the reference desired hitch rate is zero with upper and lower bound for acceptable values in transient motion. While hitch rate limitation or reduction is desirable the hitch angle may articulate freely based on coupled trailer motion to facilitate turning. For example because non zero hitch angles may be desirable under cornering the hitch angle may be permitted to change.

In one or more embodiments the control component may utilize lateral hitch force feedback to provide stability control to a vehicle trailer system. Generally when a trailer of a vehicle trailer system is under cornering and no steering is applied to the trailer the trailer may tend to continue in a straight line. When the vehicle pulls the trailer under cornering a trailer yaw motion may result from the vehicle exerting a force on the hitch. In response the trailer may exert an equal and opposite lateral force on the hitch thereby generating a destabilizing moment for the trailer. In other words when a vehicle of a vehicle trailer system engages in a maneuver such as turning the trailer may generate a moment which increases yaw propensity or a destabilizing moment.

In a lateral hitch force in the vehicle body frame Fmay cause an increase in the vehicle yaw rate e.g. an oversteer or potential oversteer or increased lateral tire forces to compensate for additional yaw moment introduced by the lateral hitch force F. This increased lateral tire force may come from increased slip angles increasing tire wear and pushing system dynamics of the vehicle trailer system closer to the friction circle.

Referring again to in one or more embodiments the control component may implement lateral hitch force feedback control to provide one or more control actions for a trailer of a vehicle trailer system. In other words the control component may monitor a lateral hitch force and determine one or more control actions based on the lateral hitch force. Explained yet another way the control component may utilize lateral hitch force feedback to determine one or more control actions such as braking control actions or steering control actions on a trailer of a vehicle trailer system to reduce or mitigate a lateral hitch force. In this way a stabilizing moment may be increased for example. Stated another way the control component may monitor the lateral hitch force and determine one or more control actions e.g. braking control actions which when implemented may reduce the lateral hitch force and increase hitch tension. When the lateral hitch force is reduced a destabilizing moment applied on a vehicle from a trailer of a vehicle trailer system may be reduced thereby mitigating the likelihood of jackknifing or a propensity of jackknifing.

Regardless of the type of feedback used the control component may provide one or more control actions for a trailer of a vehicle trailer system in response to stability control being activated e.g. via a management component . For example one or more of the control actions may include braking of one or more tires of a trailer. Different types of braking may be applied by the control component . In one or more embodiments differential braking or a differential braking scheme may be applied to one or more tires of a trailer. In other embodiments symmetrical braking or a symmetrical braking scheme may be applied to one or more tires of a trailer. Regardless these control actions e.g. for the trailer of a vehicle trailer system may mitigate jackknifing or unstable behavior.

The control component may provide an actuation component with one or more control actions such as braking control actions or steering control actions. The control component may provide one or more braking control actions which reduce a longitudinal velocity of the vehicle trailer system thereby resulting in a higher damping ratio and greater stability characteristics. Additionally one or more of the braking control actions may facilitate providing feedback to a driver or operator of a vehicle trailer system thereby alerting the driver to slow down. In other words the automatic braking providing by the control component may alert a driver of a vehicle or cause the driver to notice a change in operation of the vehicle. In this way the control component may mitigate operation of a vehicle trailer system in a manner associated with excessive speeding.

Because the damping ratio for a hitch angle generally decreases with increasing velocity e.g. eventually crossing a critical velocity where damping of hitch oscillations is zero or no damping occurs the control component may apply a closed loop response of a hitch angle to increase the damping ratio. By applying a closed loop response of the hitch angle to a vehicle trailer system the damping ratio may be increased thereby pushing a critical velocity of the vehicle trailer system higher which enables stable operation of the vehicle trailer system within a greater operation range or operation envelope.

Generally when a vehicle trailer system undergoes a backing up motion or when a velocity of the trailer is greater than a velocity of the vehicle the vehicle pushes the trailer or exerts a rearward force on the trailer. This force is a compressive hitch force which may induce a destabilizing yaw moment on the trailer which is generally undesirable. Conversely when a vehicle trailer system moves forward the vehicle generally pulls the trailer and thus the hitch angle is self stabilizing e.g. with zero steering angles the system generally stabilizes to a zero hitch angle . One or more of the control actions or one or more of the braking schemes provided by the control component may thus create similar stabilizing effects.

In one or more embodiments the control component may provide one or more control actions such as braking control actions associated with a symmetrical braking scheme for a trailer. For example is an illustration of an example implementation of a symmetric braking scheme on two or more tires a vehicle trailer system according to one or more embodiments. Here in the symmetric braking of a pair of wheels or tires and e.g. front passenger and front driver tires at and respectively sharing a same axle may result in creation of a hitch tension thereby generating a stabilizing moment for the trailer . In this way the symmetric braking implemented by the control component of a system for stability control may straighten or reduce a hitch angle between a vehicle and a trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

Further the control component may control one or more brakes of the trailer or provide one or more control actions to control corresponding brakes such that a cornering force combined with a braking force does not exceed a corresponding friction circle as will be described herein . As a result of such control actions e.g. controlling trailer brakes such that the combined cornering and braking forces do not exceed the friction circle symmetric braking may reduce a relative difference between vehicle yaw motion and trailer yaw motion. As seen in the vehicle has a counter clockwise yaw rate and similarly the trailer also has a counter clockwise yaw rate . When a control component of a system for stability control implements a symmetric braking scheme this may reduce a difference between the two yaw rates e.g. vehicle yaw rate and trailer yaw rate thereby mitigating jackknifing. Here in wheels or tires and of a front axle of a trailer may provide a symmetric braking force in response to one or more control actions provided by the control component to an actuation component . The symmetric braking may cause a stabilizing moment to be generated for the trailer and result in a trailer yaw rate of the trailer.

In one or more embodiments the control component may provide one or more control actions such as braking control actions associated with a differential braking scheme for a trailer. For example the control component may calculate one or more braking actions which when implemented via the actuation component may create a hitch tension and a yaw moment which reduces a relative difference between a vehicle yaw rate and a trailer yaw rate e.g. reduce a hitch rate .

In one or more embodiments the control component determines a magnitude for differential braking or asymmetric braking based on an estimated reduction in lateral cornering forces. In this way the control component may mitigate wheel or tire lockup. is an illustration of an example implementation of an asymmetric braking scheme on a vehicle trailer system according to one or more embodiments. Here in the control component may implement differential braking or asymmetric braking on a right side of a trailer for tires and e.g. passenger front and passenger rear tires and respectively . An asymmetric braking force F may be applied on a right side of the trailer such that a counter clockwise or negative yaw moment is applied on the trailer thereby reducing a hitch angle between the trailer and the vehicle . In this example because the vehicle is turning left the control component may determine one or more control actions associated with differential braking or asymmetric braking for a right side or passenger side of the trailer .

Conversely if the vehicle is turning left the control component may determine one or more control actions associated with differential braking or asymmetric braking for a left side or driver side of the trailer e.g. tires and . In this way the control component may utilize differential braking to generate a stabilizing moment for a trailer of a vehicle trailer system. The control component may determine a braking side for one or more of the control actions based on a sign e.g. positive or negative of a hitch angle between the trailer and the vehicle and a desired yaw moment a desired yaw rate or a desired direction of the yaw moment of the trailer .

Accordingly the control component may implement one or more of the braking control actions based on one or more determinations by the predictive component oscillations within the trailer oscillations associated with deviations in the hitch angle greater than a threshold angle etc. In this way the control component may actively control hitch oscillation by modulating trailer yaw dynamics.

In one or more embodiments the control component may include an anti lock braking system ABS controller not shown . As an example the control component or the ABS controller may calculate or determine a friction circle associated with a trailer a friction circle associated with the vehicle or a friction circle associated with a vehicle trailer system. The control component or the ABS controller of the control component may determine one or more of the control actions based on feedforward braking from the vehicle. In other words the control component may determine one or more control actions or braking control actions for a trailer of a vehicle trailer system based on brakes being applied to the vehicle of the vehicle trailer system.

Here the control component may utilize feedforward braking or the braking from the vehicle to determine a proportional brake pressure to be applied to wheels of the trailer to mitigate compressive forces on the hitch coupling the vehicle and the trailer while the vehicle is braking. Explained another way when the vehicle is braking a coupled trailer without one or more control actions or corrective actions applied may continue movement thereby creating compressive force on the hitch which may be undesirable. Symmetrical braking or differential braking may thus be implemented by the control component to mitigate such compressive forces.

In one or more embodiments the sensor component may receive or obtain a signal associated with the brake pressure for the vehicle. In other embodiments the sensor component may include a vehicle mounted trailer brake controller which measures longitudinal deceleration of the vehicle. Regardless brake pressure information or deceleration information may be transmitted or implemented in a feedforward configuration to the control component . A feedforward brake command e.g. proportional to a vehicle brake command may be combined or implemented along with one or more embodiments of trailer stability control as seen in . is an illustration of an example component diagram of a system for stability control with an anti lock braking ABS controller according to one or more embodiments. This combined braking may be modulated through an anti lock brake system controller or ABS controller thereby mitigating lock up or loss of traction.

Here in trailer brake pressure may be a combination of feedforward braking and added braking force from a feedback stability controller or control component . For example inputs may include vehicle brake pressure information 1 a vehicle yaw rate 2 a hitch rate 3 and a lateral hitch force 4 . A trailer brake controller e.g. may be a sub component of control component may receive the vehicle brake information and feedforward respective brake information to a trailer anti lock braking system via . A control component such as the control component of may pass respective information via to a trailer ABS controller which determines a control action or braking control action for the trailer and passes the control action to an actuation component such as a trailer brake actuator or trailer brake calipers for example.

In one or more embodiments the control component may provide one or more control actions associated with trailer steering based on hitch rate feedback. These control actions may include trailer steering control actions e.g. steering of tires of a trailer to dampen a hitch angle response due to cornering at high velocities for example. Further one or more of the control actions associated with steering or trailer steering may increase a damping ratio thereby reducing a chance of undesired oscillations caused by the hitch angle between the vehicle and trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

In one or more embodiments the control component may provide one or more control actions associated with trailer steering based on lateral hitch force feedback. Respective trailer steering actions when implemented may adjust a steering angle of the trailer such that the lateral hitch force is minimized or reduced. By reducing one or more coupling forced associated with the lateral hitch force slip angles on the vehicle and or the trailer of a vehicle trailer system may be reduced thereby improving stability of the vehicle trailer system.

In one or more embodiments a vehicle steering angle may be fed forward to the control component to determine a trailer steering angle. By utilizing feedforward trailer steering such as during cornering vehicle and trailer slip angles may be reduced thereby increasing one or more stability characteristics of a vehicle trailer system. In one or more embodiments such as an embodiment illustrated in the control component may supply a component an open loop steering angle from the vehicle to determine a desired trailer steering angle based on a no slip curve component .

A high speed cutoff component may mitigate a controller or a component e.g. actuator from applying steering beyond one or more actuator bandwidth operating ranges. For example the vehicle velocity 1 may feed the high speed cutoff component which may drive the steering at e.g. as indicated by the product including an output of . Accordingly it can be seen that a velocity dependent cutoff component is provided to mitigate oversteer or understeer due to system or component limitations at velocities greater than a system bandwidth for example.

A vehicle steering angle may be fed forward to no slip component which may apply a no slip curve. The vehicle speed or velocity vehicle yaw rate hitch rate and lateral hitch force may be provided to the control component which may determine a control action associated with trailer stability such as a trailer steering control action. A sum of a trailer feedforward steering angle and a trailer stability steering angle may be determined at if the high speed cutoff component does not disable steering control actions. These control actions may be fed to the actuator .

Additionally the control component may implement feedback from the sensor component e.g. one or more measured characteristics one or more steering inputs etc. to provide stability control. The feedforward component may improve open loop stability for a given velocity while a feedback component of the control component may provide active control with one or more control actions which maintain trailer stability during the presence of disturbances.

The control component may include a damper controller which has a damper actuator enable damping of trailer oscillations via actuation of a hitch angle via a mechanical damper .

In one or more embodiments the management component may enable or disable stability control such as one or more steering control actions based on one or more system characteristics such as bandwidth limitations on an actuator or actuation component which may result in a phase difference between oscillation of a trailer and respective control actions or a lag in a response time for a component. In other words the management component may ensure that one or more control actions provided by a control component may be implemented in a manner which promotes stability e.g. implemented in phase . Accordingly the management component may have the sensor component monitor a phase difference between oscillation of a trailer and one or more control actions provided by the control component to determine whether respective oscillations and control actions are in phase out of phase becoming out of phase etc.

In one or more embodiments the management component may disable stability control or one or more control actions associated with steering based on feedback from the sensor component . As an example if oscillation of a trailer and one or more control actions associated with steering become out of phase the management component may disable one or more aspects of stability control associated with steering control. Accordingly the sensor component may monitor for such phase differences between oscillation of the trailer and control actions.

If the management component determines that one or more control actions are out of phase or becoming out of phase with respect to oscillations of the trailer the management component may provide the control component with a signal such as a shutdown signal which terminates one or more corresponding control actions. In other words the management component may monitor one or more control actions provided by the control component and analyze respective control actions to determine whether they may have potential to cause additional instability or mitigate instability. Here the management component may mitigate instability by disabling one or more control actions which are out of phase with oscillations of a trailer.

In this way the management component may disable one or more aspects of stability control such as one or more control actions associated with trailer steering or one or more steering control actions for example. Accordingly system characteristics such as a bandwidth of an actuator or actuation component response time of a system or other limitations may be taken into account when implementing stability control.

The notification component may provide one or more notifications to a driver of a vehicle when one or more thresholds are being exceeded such as a yaw rate safety threshold provided by the storage component for example. The notification component may provide one or more visual notifications audio notifications etc. Further the notification component may provide one or more of the notifications in conjunction with one or more control actions. In other words if the control component determines one or more braking control actions to be implemented the notification component may provide one or more notifications prior to during or after execution or implementation of respective braking control actions.

The actuation component may include one or more actuators such as a brake actuator not shown a steering actuator not shown a damper actuator not shown etc. The brake actuator may operate brakes or brake calipers for one or more tires or one or more wheels of a vehicle or a trailer of a vehicle trailer system. In one or more embodiments a brake actuator may actuate one or more brakes for one or more corresponding tires or wheels of a trailer based on one or more control actions provided by the control component .

For example with reference to or a brake actuator not shown of an actuation component e.g. the actuation component of may initiate braking for one or more wheels or tires such as wheels or tires or of the trailer individually or according to a braking scheme such as a differential braking scheme or a symmetrical braking scheme.

The steering actuator may steer one or more tires or one or more wheels of a vehicle or a trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

The damper actuator may engage a mechanical damper with one or more components of a vehicle trailer system. A damper actuator may enable damping of trailer oscillations via direct actuation of a hitch angle via a mechanical damper . The damper actuator may be electrically activated such as with a magnetorheological damper or electromechanically adjusted utilizing variable valves in a damper piston. In this way varying levels of damping may be applied to a hitch angle based on an estimated risk of jackknifing.

Generally at lower speeds or velocities maneuverability may be desirable and thus a lower damping coefficient may be utilized. As the speed or velocity of a vehicle trailer system increases a hitch angle damping ratio decreases. Accordingly as the velocity of a vehicle trailer system increases the damper actuator may increase a damping coefficient to offset a decreased damping ratio of otherwise unactuated hitch rotation.

In one or more embodiments the actuation component may provide passive control of hitch motion or hitch rate control by applying mechanical damping to a hitch angle response of a vehicle trailer system. In other words the mechanical damper is utilizes to reduce oscillations hitch motion or other forces at a hitch between a vehicle and a trailer.

Stability control may provide improvements in the technology of stability control by providing control actions which mitigate jackknifing and other instability characteristics thereby mitigating occurrence of accidents and instability of vehicle trailer systems. The technical field of trailer steering and stability control may thus be provided with systems and techniques for mitigating jackknifing trailer swing and trailer oscillation thereby providing stability for drivers of vehicles with trailers in tow. This may be achieved by determining predictions associated with trailer instability and taking corrective action such as control actions which implement one or more braking schemes such as a differential braking scheme or a symmetric braking scheme. Implementation of these control actions may create a hitch tension and a stabilizing yaw moment thereby reducing a relative difference between a vehicle yaw rate or yaw motion thereof and a trailer yaw rate e.g. the hitch rate . Further hitch angle response may be dampened and longitudinal velocity reduced thereby increasing a damping ratio which results in higher stability characteristics for the vehicle trailer system while mitigating undesirable oscillations in a hitch angle between the vehicle and the trailer.

One or more embodiments of techniques or systems for stability control are provided herein. In one or more embodiments a system or method for stability control is provided such as a system for providing stability control to a vehicle towing a trailer or a vehicle trailer system for example. Stability control may be provided in a variety of ways. For example a system for stability control may implement active stability control or passive stability control to facilitate stabilization of dynamics for a vehicle or trailer of a vehicle trailer system. In one or more embodiments one or more predictions may be made regarding jackknifing of a vehicle trailer system. These jackknife predictions may be made based on one or more vehicle characteristics one or more trailer characteristics or one or more measured characteristics associated with yaw rate deviation between a vehicle and a trailer of a vehicle trailer system or hitch rate oscillation of a trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

Active control may be implemented by providing one or more control actions in response to one or more of the predictions or jackknife predictions. For example one or more of the control actions may be provided based on or in response to a difference between a desired yaw rate and a measured yaw rate e.g. utilizing yaw rate deviation . As another example one or more of the control actions may be provided based on a yaw rate of the vehicle a steering angle of the vehicle a related transfer function or a related resonant frequency e.g. utilizing hitch rate oscillation . In any event control actions may include one or more braking control actions one or more steering control actions implementing one or more braking schemes such as a differential braking scheme a symmetrical braking scheme or an asymmetrical braking scheme. In this way stability may be achieved by providing braking control or steering control for a trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

Under the active approach for stability control a system for stability control may utilize a symmetric braking approach a differential braking approach or a trailer steering approach to provide stability to a vehicle trailer system. According to the symmetric braking approach brakes of a trailer may be controlled such that a combined cornering force and braking force do not exceed a friction circle. In this way symmetric braking may reduce a relative difference in yaw motion between a vehicle and an attached trailer thereby mitigating jackknifing. Symmetric braking may indirectly generate a stabilizing moment about a hitch connecting the vehicle and the trailer thereby generating a restoring or stabilizing moment for the trailer and reducing a hitch angle between the trailer and the vehicle.

Under the differential braking approach differential braking may be applied or implemented on a trailer of a vehicle trailer system to create a hitch tension and a yaw moment thereby reducing a relative difference between a vehicle yaw rate of a vehicle and a trailer yaw rate of a trailer attached to the vehicle e.g. measured in a hitch rate . Stated another way differential braking may directly generate a stabilizing moment about a hitch. Additionally trailer steering based on hitch rate feedback may be provided. By providing hitch rate feedback to a system for stability control a hitch angle response may be dampened such as a hitch angle response caused by cornering at high velocities for example. Further the system for stability control may increase a damping ratio thereby reducing a chance of undesired oscillations in a hitch angle between the vehicle and the trailer of a vehicle trailer system.

Under the passive approach for stability control a system for stability control may apply damping e.g. via a mechanical damper to a hitch angle response. For example damping of a hitch angle response or trailer oscillations may be achieved by direct actuation of a hitch angle through a mechanical damper.

One or more embodiments of techniques or systems for providing stability control are provided herein. One or more predictions or jackknife predictions may be generated based on yaw rate deviation e.g. between a desired yaw rate and an actual yaw rate or hitch rate oscillation e.g. from a hitch rate signal . These predictions may be indicative of a likelihood of an accident jackknifing undesirable trailer oscillation etc. When a prediction indicates that jackknifing is likely feedback may be utilized to determine control actions to stabilize a vehicle trailer system. For example hitch rate feedback or lateral hitch force feedback may be provided from a sensor component. A control component may determine control actions which when implemented may reduce a destabilizing moment associated with a trailer of the vehicle trailer system. In this manner stability control is provided thus enhancing stability technology for vehicles towing trailers.
