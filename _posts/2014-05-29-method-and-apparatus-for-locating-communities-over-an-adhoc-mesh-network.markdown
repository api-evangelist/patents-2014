Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

A method and apparatus for locating communities in an ad hoc mesh network are disclosed. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

As used herein the term awareness information refers to any information and or context about a local environment as well as the users and communication devices within the local environment. By way of example awareness information can be used to support applications for creating social networks determining presence determining contexts associated with a device advertising searching for information etc. Although various exemplary embodiments are described with respect to locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network it is contemplated that the approach described herein may be used within any type of communication system or network.

As shown in a system comprises one or more wireless nodes optionally having connectivity to a communication network through either operator A or operator B . The wireless nodes are any type of mobile terminal portable terminal or fixed terminal including mobile handsets personal computers stations units devices multimedia tablets Internet nodes communicators Personal Digital Assistants PDAs radio readable tags e.g. near field communication NFC tags radio frequency identification RFID tags or any combination thereof. It is also contemplated that the wireless nodes can support any type of interface to the user such as wearable circuitry etc. .

In exemplary embodiments the wireless nodes form an ad hoc mesh network for sharing awareness information. The ad hoc mesh network is for instance a connectionless and serverless device to device network e.g. a mobile ad hoc network MANET created using short range radio technology e.g. wireless local area network WLAN or Bluetooth . Within the ad hoc mesh network each wireless node may be mobile and is within communication range of any number of other wireless nodes . Accordingly the set of wireless nodes that is within communication range of any a particular wireless node is transient and can change as the wireless nodes move from location to location.

As discussed previously service providers and device manufacturers that are developing communication systems and networks for locating communities face many technical challenges. For example current ad hoc radios e.g. WLAN and Bluetooth are designed for connectivity e.g. connectivity via Internet protocol IP . However in an always on environment such as the ad hoc mesh network it is not practical to have a large number of wireless nodes e.g. mobile handset devices connected by for instance IP to each other for extended periods of time because of power usage and scalability problems. Specifically a multi hop connection in a large ad hoc network typically requires a significant amount of control signaling and power and can quickly deplete a mobile device s battery. Moreover scalability can be a problem because current ad hoc radios are typically limited in the number of connections and the related signaling that they can support at any given time. Another shortcoming of current ad hoc radios is that they do not adequately protect a user s privacy because they expose the user s identity through a fixed network address e.g. a media access control MAC address associated with the user s device.

To address these problems the system creates the ad hoc mesh network for sharing awareness information in a connectionless fashion. As used herein the term connectionless refers to the ability of a node e.g. wireless node to send and of all surrounding nodes to receive awareness information without the need to send any prior control signaling. For example sending awareness information using the transmission control protocol IP TCP IP over a WLAN ad hoc is not connectionless because of the two way TCP control signaling between the sending and receiving nodes used to establish the TCP connection. The awareness information is provided for instance in small anonymous messages that are exchanged by the wireless nodes automatically without user intervention. As used herein the term anonymous means that it is not possible to infer the true identity of the sender from the message unless the true identity is intentionally included in the message e.g. by the user or another entity authorized by the user . The exchange of awareness information occurs as a broadcast message i.e. a flooding message from a wireless node to neighboring wireless nodes that are within range of the radio of the broadcasting wireless node . As neighboring wireless nodes receive the broadcasted message each receiving wireless node may in turn rebroadcast the message to other neighboring wireless nodes . In this way the originally broadcasted message propagates throughout the ad hoc mesh network . In exemplary embodiments the extent of the propagation may be limited by criteria such as distance location time etc.

Unlike traditional systems such messages are only for carrying awareness information and are not for transporting content e.g. files or media containing voice video etc. between two wireless nodes e.g. wireless nodes and . Instead the messages contain only pointers to the content or a small amount of data e.g. presence or context information to minimize the data traffic transported over the ad hoc mesh network . The wireless nodes may then access the content using other communication channels e.g. via IP through the communication network . In addition the system eliminates the problems associated with traditional methods for route establishment and maintenance e.g. connection based communication protocols such as maintaining and handing off connections as mobile devices move and requiring high levels of network resources for maintaining connections in an environment with a high number or density of mobile devices. For example the event of a wireless node appearing disappearing to from the network does not generate any control signaling in the ad hoc mesh network . Similarly the system creates routing information only when needed to route replies to queries back to the querying node. The routing information is generated by using the query messages alone i.e. no control signaling is used for creating routing information . After the query and subsequent reply process is completed the routes are forgotten. In other words the query reply process of system provisions routes for a reply to provide awareness information on demand rather than pushing awareness information from one node to another. In exemplary embodiments both push e.g. information is published over the ad hoc mesh network and pull e.g. information is queried from other nodes of the ad hoc mesh network modes of disseminating awareness information are possible. In certain embodiments it is contemplated that the pull mode of operation can be used instead of the push mode to help suppress potential spam messages.

Moreover the system optimizes the power consumption of wireless nodes communicating over the ad hoc mesh network to enable always on operation without seriously affecting the battery life of the wireless nodes . For instance by utilizing only short awareness messages by eliminating the need for any route maintenance signaling by employing procedures to minimize transmission and reception of duplicative messages and by enabling an efficient sleep scheme for the short range device to device radio used within each wireless node allowed by the low latency requirements typical of an awareness information network the system can potentially provide hundreds of hours e.g. over 400 hours of continuous operation of each wireless node between battery charges in a mobile device. The system could be seen as a nervous system between the mobile devices where small messages nerve impulses are continuously exchanged by the mobile devices neurons in order to bring awareness to the user of a mobile device about the user s surroundings.

The system also enables the development of new services and applications based on awareness information e.g. social networking applications location based applications application for determining presence applications for determining context advertising applications . In particular the continuous and immediate nature of the awareness information with respect to local environment enables compelling new services. For instance awareness information may be combined with the increasingly available storage and computing power in mobile devices e.g. wireless nodes to create a local semantic web whereby local awareness information is created and searched for automatically by wireless nodes within the ad hoc mesh network . As used herein the term semantic web refers to a system in which the information and messages shared with the system is understandable by the nodes within the system. It is noted that establishing such a local semantic web using the system overcomes two major problems blocking the development of a global semantic web 1 lack of mechanism for providing semantic content on a large scale and 2 lack of semantically aware search engines to help users find information in a semantic web. The system can also be used for collaborative context calculation publishing pointers to information or content search for friends within a defined community finding out what is going on and what kind of people are around a user making the environment aware of the user and other like applications.

In a first use case the awareness information alerts a user to nearby people or places. For example a user is visiting a new town when the wireless node alerts the user that Salvatore a friend of your friend David is nearby. The user may then arrange to meet Salvatore to get a recommendation for sites to visit in the new town. In another example a user is looking for a good restaurant in an unfamiliar neighborhood. An application based on awareness information may present a list of local restaurants ranked by the number of people currently eating in the restaurant that have the same food preferences as the user. Such a list can be collected based on queries and replies that contain anonymous information of people s food preferences.

In a second use case an application uses the awareness information to discover events near the user. For example as a user passes a park the wireless node informs the user based on messages exchanged between nearby devices that There is a Japanese culture festival in the Tea Garden Park five members of your Kabuki community are there Zen Mi Xia Talo and Chris. The user may then decide to attend the festival.

In a third use case an application provides location based or context based services using awareness information. For example a wireless node does not have positioning capabilities but nonetheless knows that it is in a grocery store based on anonymous awareness information from other nearby wireless nodes . It is contemplated that the grocery store may also place a node in the store to provide such context information possibly combined with other store specific information such as the address of the store s web page. The wireless node then reminds the user to Remember to buy dishwasher detergent based on the user s location in a grocery store. The awareness information can also be the physical position information from a neighboring wireless node that has the positioning capability. Sharing of positioning information with a neighboring node with such a capability can enable nodes without such capability to offer navigational services.

In another example a group of people are attending a meeting. The meeting invitation includes an identification code for that particular meeting that is stored in the mobile nodes of the meeting attendees e.g. the identification code may be stored in the calendar data . Using the principles set forth in this invention the nodes can exchange the meeting identification code over the ad hoc mesh network while attending the meeting. Comparing the exchanged identification code in a user s wireless device can for instance establish whether the users was indeed at the meeting corresponding to the identification code. Such accurate social context knowledge can be used for instance to adapt the service or application behavior towards the user.

In a fourth use case an application provides for search of local information that changes rapidly and very specific to a local environment. The local information often does not reach traditional Internet search engines. For example a user bought tickets to a concert but discovers at the last minute that the user cannot attend. The user stores a string Ticket to concert X at venue Y is available into the awareness services module of the user s wireless node . As a result a nearby wireless node within a few street blocks away that searches for tickets by sending query messages with a string Ticket concert X over the multi hop ad hoc mesh network will receive the user s ticket availability message as an automatic reply.

In a fifth use case an application enables locally targeted advertising. For example it is almost closing time for a local fresh fruit market. The merchants decide to publish an advertisement over the ad hoc mesh network that Apples are 50 off for the rest of the day. The advertisement is available to users who live nearby the market. In another example a user browses an advertisement for a new printer on a wireless node . In the browsing activity a code attached to the advertisement is stored in the awareness services module . Upon searching and finding such a code a nearby electronics store sends the user an offer to sell the printer with a 10 discount.

In a sixth use case an application automatically creates an activity log based on the awareness information associated with a user. For example the application records the people the user meets along with other awareness information such as when where context etc. The user then meets a person while walking on the street. The person looks familiar but the user does not recall the person s name or how the user knows the person. The wireless node running the application reports that the person s name is David and that the user met him at a soccer match one year ago in London.

In a seventh use case an application provides the capability to initiate local discussion threads and group chats over the ad hoc mesh network . For example the supporters of a football team form a community over the ad hoc mesh network wherein community members can send short text messages e.g. of small enough size to be sent directly over the ad hoc mesh network that can be received and read only by the fan club community members of that particular team.

By way of example the awareness services module includes three layers a cognition layer a community layer and a network layer . The cognition layer is the highest control layer for sharing awareness information. As shown in the cognition layer includes a control logic and item storage . The control logic for instance provides the logic for creating publishing querying and receiving awareness information over the ad hoc mesh network . The control logic can store the information that it either creates or receives in the item storage . It is contemplated that the item storage may be of sufficient size to store all or a portion of the information that flows through the wireless node over a configurable period of time e.g. days months or years .

In exemplary embodiments the control logic enables querying and dissemination of awareness information by initiating the flooding of the query or information to neighboring wireless nodes within the ad hoc mesh network . For example upon receiving a query the wireless nodes in the local neighborhood that have the queried information reply to the querying node automatically. In exemplary embodiments the reply information is also automatically stored in the item storage of each wireless node through which the propagating reply passes. Moreover the reply to a query may result in return of a pointer to specific content relevant to the query rather than the content itself under certain circumstances e.g. when the specific content is large in size . It is contemplated that the reply may contain direct content if the content is relatively small e.g. a few tens of bytes of information . By using a pointer the system minimizes the data traffic that flows through the ad hoc mesh network . The user may then access the content via the pointer e.g. a universal resource locator URL address IP address via a more appropriate communication protocol e.g. IP and or means of communication e.g. infrastructure networks . The receipt of the pointer e.g. IP address may automatically trigger the transfer of the content using for instance the communication protocol associated with the pointer. In the case of broadcasting or publishing information any wireless node through which the published information propagates may store the information in item storage of the wireless node .

In other exemplary embodiments awareness information can also be published directly by flooding an awareness message. Such a push mode for the dissemination of awareness information can be used to support some applications e.g. advertising or group chatting over the ad hoc mesh network .

It is recognized that privacy and anonymity may be of concern to users of the system . Accordingly the control logic provides mechanisms for ensuring privacy and anonymity. For example the control logic can prevent the transmission of intimate information when the number of neighboring wireless nodes is small to prevent the possibility of inferring identity. As used herein the term intimate information refers to information directly related to the user e.g. the user s habits tastes or preferences musical preferences favorite restaurants etc. .

The control logic may also periodically broadcast decoy queries and replies to make tracking an individual wireless node more difficult. Since an outside observer does not know the authentication key associated with a community the observer cannot distinguish a valid message from a fictitious one. Accordingly by observing decoy messages the observer is likely to detect presence of a private community when there is not one. Additionally the control logic enables to user to define filters for incoming information e.g. filter advertisements and how these filters would work e.g. ignore the information completely relay the information but do not store etc. . It is also contemplated that the user can direct the control logic to control the user s visibility on the ad hoc mesh network e.g. no visibility visible only to a certain community or other user to maintain privacy. As another mechanism for protecting privacy the control logic can interact with the community layer to anonymize a specific message and corresponding identifiers as described below with respect to the community layer .

Because one of the goals of the system is to provide a mechanism for anonymous spreading of awareness information it is recognized that undesired or unsolicited messages e.g. spam messages may become a problem. To address this problem the control logic may obtain for instance information from the lower system layers of the awareness services module about the traffic load and current average power consumption. If the traffic load is medium or high meaning that also power consumption related to system is medium or high restrictions may be set for the frequency at which flooding messages are sent by the control logic . It is also contemplated that the neighboring peer nodes can be configured to not forward any flooding messages originating from a node neglecting such message restrictions.

The cognition layer together with the community layer provide an application programming interface API to enable an application to access the functions of the control logic and the item storage . In exemplary embodiments the API enables application developers to have uniform and easy access to functions related to sharing awareness information over the ad hoc mesh network . It is contemplated that the API is extensible to accommodate any application designed to access or use awareness information. The applications in the various nodes do not have to be the same or mutually compatible. It is sufficient that the applications use the API correctly to be able to publish and search awareness information in the surrounding nodes .

The cognition layer also has connectivity to the community layer . The community layer controls the formation and cataloging of communities of wireless nodes within the ad hoc mesh network . By way of example a user may create any number of communities for sharing awareness information. It is contemplated that a community may be either a peer community e.g. any wireless node may join a personal community e.g. a wireless node may join only if invited or the open local community that consists of all nodes in the local neighborhood. In exemplary embodiments the messages that traverse between the wireless nodes within the ad hoc mesh network belong to one of these three community types. Communities can either be private messages are encrypted or public no encryption used . In exemplary embodiments membership and status in a community affect how the wireless node shares awareness information see the discussion with respect to for additional details of community membership .

Furthermore a community may be created for any purpose or duration e.g. a permanent work community a permanent community of friends a temporary community of concert goers lasting only the duration of the concert . As shown in the community layer includes a community control module a community directory and an encryption decryption module . The community control module provides the logic for creating joining managing e.g. updating membership configuring settings and preferences setting privacy policies and deleting communities. The module also provides part of the API .

In exemplary embodiments the community control module assigns a unique community identification number CID to each community for use within the ad hoc mesh network . The control module can also generate authentication keys K associated with the CID to for instance authenticate users who wish to join the community or authenticate messages directed to the community. For example a wireless node may invite another wireless node to join a community by transferring the CID and authentication keys associated with the community to the other wireless node . It is contemplated that the transfer of the CID and corresponding authentication key may occur using short range radio or using another secure mechanism e.g. short message service SMS or electronic mail . It is noted that both peer and personal communities use a CID and corresponding K whereas the open local community either can use a predetermined value for CID e.g. zero or does not use the CID at all.

To ensure privacy as discussed above the community control module interacts an encryption decryption module to anonymize the CID when including the CID in messages over the ad hoc mesh network . For example a wireless node may direct a query to a specific community using an anonymized CID e.g. a pseudonym associated with the community in lieu of the actual CID. In exemplary embodiments multiple anonymized CIDs may be used to represent a single community. In this way it is more difficult to identify queries corresponding to a particular community by monitoring traffic within the ad hoc mesh network . From the perspective of an outside observer the anonymized CIDs look random. In addition the encryption decryption module may encrypt or decrypt message data using for instance a temporary key that is periodically derived from the authentication key K associated with the CID. These measures hinder the discovery of the CID by outsiders that do not have the authentication key. By way of example the community layer inserts a special header into the messages that it receives from the cognition layer . The special header for instance contains a list of anonymized community identifiers corresponding to the communities to which the message is relevant.

When the wireless node is in the joined state the wireless node may also be in either an inactive state or an active state . To transition between the inactive state and the active state the application may issue a command to either activate or deactivate the joined state via the application programming interface . When the wireless node is in the inactive state the community layer abandons the message even though it is a member of the community. In certain embodiments the wireless node may also be invisible to other members of the community while in the inactive state . For example the wireless node may enter the inactive state when it temporarily does not want to receive or share information with the community. When the wireless node is in the active state the community layer encrypts and decrypts community messages as usual for private communities and enables all outgoing and incoming community specific messages for public communities e.g. communities with no restrictions on membership .

Within the active state the wireless node may also be in either an invisible state or a visible state . To transition between the invisible state and the visible state the application issues a command to set either the visible or invisible state. When in the invisible state the community specific identity e.g. a user alias associated with the wireless node cannot be queried by other members of the community. For example in the invisible state the community layer continues to receive and send community messages without its identity known to other community members. When in the visible state the identity of the wireless node can be queried by other members of the community.

In various embodiments the community directory of the community layer maintains for instance information on the communities that the user has joined. Such information contains at least the community identification CID . Additionally it may contain public and or private authentication keys K of the joined communities and a list of anonymized community identifiers for each community. The community control module may periodically recalculate the list of anonymized CIDs. By way of example the community layer inserts a header into the message it receives from the cognition layer . The header contains for instance a list of anonymized community identifiers identifying the communities to which the message is relevant.

It is contemplated that a special personal community can be reserved for tracking new bonds or relationships created between users. Consider for example that user A meets user B for the first time and wants to create a radio bond between the mobile devices corresponding to each user. In one embodiment user A can initiate the creation this bond with user B by transferring to user B e.g. by using a secure transfer mechanism the CID and the public K of user A s personal new bonds community. Similarly user B may give user A similar credentials corresponding to user B s new bonds community. Once the credentials are exchanged and the bond has been created user A may find user B over the ad hoc mesh network by searching for members of user A s new bonds community. In other words with a simple search of a single community user A can search for all the people in user A s local neighborhood with whom user A has created a bond. This requires that a high number of community CIDs and Ks can be stored in the community directory . Also an effective lookup of the community directory must be provided. There are many existing and good solutions for such efficient lookup.

As the user creates new bonds the number community CIDs and Ks stored in the user s community directory can grow quite large. Accordingly to enable effective search of a large number of communities the community layer may generate a special community search message to initiate the search. For example the special community search message contains at least in part a list of anonymized community identifiers corresponding to the communities to be searched. To protect the privacy the community layer can generate a new set of anonymized community identifiers for each community search message. If the community layer finds a match to any of the anonymized community identifiers in any of the neighboring nodes that receives the search message the community layer generates a reply message that may contain the alias of the user in that community or other community specific information. The reply message may be encrypted with the encryption key of the community.

As shown in the community layer has connectivity to the cognition layer above and the network layer below. The network layer manages the rebroadcasting of received flooding messages and the routing of the unicast typically reply messages received by the wireless node . depicts a diagram of the components of the network layer according to an exemplary embodiment. The network layer includes a network control module routing table neighbor table message identification MID table and message table . The network control module directs the broadcasts of messages and information by managing and updating the routing table neighbor table MID table and message table . In certain embodiments the network control module may also assist in protecting the privacy and anonymity of users by periodically changing the network layer identification associated with the wireless node . It is noted that making such a change in the network layer identification between queries does not cause routing problems for replies because the routing information is recreated by each query in the ad hoc mesh network .

In exemplary embodiments the network layer may insert a header into messages it receives from the community layer to for instance direct flooding and routing of the received messages. The structure of this network layer message header is discussed with respect to . is a diagram of the data structure of a network layer message header according to an exemplary embodiment. As shown the message header contains the following fields 1 a TX field to identify the transmitter node ID NID of the last transmitting node 2 a SRC field to identify the source node ID of the node that originated the message 3 a DST field to identify the destination source ID of the intended recipient of a unicast reply message e.g. this field is give a value of zero when the message is a flooding messages 4 a MSN field to identify the message sequence number assigned by the source node and 5 a hop count field that is incremented by one by each node that transmits the message. In certain embodiments the message header may also contain the following optional fields 6 a geographical limit field to designate the extent of the physical over which the message is intended to propagate e.g. the geographical limit field may contain a geographical position of the source node and a maximum flooding radius from that position 7 a temporal limit field e.g. the temporal limit field may contain the time when the message becomes obsolete and should be dropped and 8 a context limit field that defines the context beyond which the message is not intended to propagate e.g. a message related to a particular concert is not intended to extend beyond the concert venue .

Returning to the network layer also contains a routing table . In exemplary embodiments the routing table contains a listing of the node identification number NID of the originating wireless node e.g. source NID and the NIDs of the last known transmitters of the message. The purpose of the routing table is to enable the routing of the reply messages e.g. unicast messages back to the querying node that originated the query through a flooding message. As the message propagates through the ad hoc mesh network each subsequent wireless node that receives the message adds the NID of the last transmitter to the routing table to record the next hop neighbor towards the source node. The source node is marked as the destination node DST in the routing table. Also the message sequence number of the message is recorded. The update of the routing table is coordinated by the network control module . As shown in Table 1 the routing table lists the destination NID the transmitter NIDs associated with wireless nodes that have rebroadcasted a message and the MSN of the message.

The neighbor table contains a list of the neighboring wireless nodes and an estimate of their relative radio distance see Table 3 . It is contemplated that the observed signal strength together with the known transmitting power of a neighboring wireless node is an indicator of the proximity of the wireless node and can be used to calculate the relative radio distance. The relative radio distance of the node from which the message was last received is then used as a criterion for whether or not the wireless node retransmits a received message. For instance a higher signal strength indicates closer proximity to the wireless node . The network control module monitors the signal strengths of neighboring nodes as the module receives messages from nearby devices and uses it to estimate the relative radio distance e.g. proximity of the transmitting node . It is also contemplated that the network control module may use any other mechanism for estimating the relative radio distance of neighboring nodes e.g. estimating location using global positioning satellite receivers or other positioning techniques .

In certain embodiments the network control module uses the proximity information to direct the routing and transmission of messages over the ad hoc mesh network . For example the system can reduce the potential for overloading the ad hoc mesh network by implementing a smart flooding scheme whereby only a few nodes retransmit a flooding message. Whether a node retransmits a flooding message can be dependent on the relative distance group e.g. very near near or far to which the node that is the transmitter of the message belongs. More specifically if the transmitting node is in the far or near group the receiving node can retransmit the flooding message. If the transmitting node is in the very near group the receiving node does not retransmit the flooding message. For each broadcast message received from a node in either the far or near group the network control module assigns a random delay time for relaying or rebroadcasting. The delay period for instance exhibits a distribution function based on the estimated relative radio distance as a way to randomize the delay period before transmission. The distribution should be chosen in such a way that the random delay is larger for those nodes that are near than for those that are far. This favors for instance nodes that are further away to relay the flooding message forward which results in better flooding efficiency smaller total number of transmissions . The use of a random delay time also prevents the unintended synchronization of message broadcasts as the message propagates over the ad hoc mesh network . For example unintended synchronization of the message broadcasts may result in too many nodes sending broadcasting i.e. flooding messages over the ad hoc mesh network at exactly the same time. Additionally the delay time provides an opportunity for the network control module to monitor and count rebroadcasts of the message by other neighboring wireless nodes .

The MID table contains a list of received messages. As the wireless node receives messages from neighboring nodes over the ad hoc mesh network the network control module uses the MID table to check whether the message has been received previously by for example comparing the MIDs in the MID table to that of the received message. The MID table also contains a flag indicating whether a message has been transmitted by the node and the time when the entry was last updated. In exemplary embodiments the MID is the tuple SRC MSN where SRC is the NID of the source node and MSN is a message sequence number assigned by the source node. In this way the MID is a unique identifier of each message that propagates in the network . The network control module makes an entry in the MID table for all new messages that it receives. If the message has been scheduled for transmission the module increments the message counter in the message table see Table 4 .

The message table contains messages that the network control module has scheduled to transmit. For example as the node receives a flooding message that the network control module schedules for transmission the module updates the message table to include the message in the message table . Each entry in the message table contains the message itself the time when the message is scheduled to be sent and the number of receptions of the same message by the node see Table 4 . In exemplary embodiments a message is not relayed over the ad hoc mesh network if the number of times the message has been received exceeds a predefined limit. For example a message has the initial count of 0. In this example as a wireless node in the neighborhood is observed to transmit the message the message count associated with the message is increased. When the maximum message count is reached the network control module removes the message from the message table . The transmitter of each message is also associated with an estimated relative radio distance D indicating whether the transmitting node is within close proximity of the wireless node e.g. transmitting node is in the very near relative radio distance group or far from the wireless node e.g. transmitting node is in the far relative radio distance group . If the relative radio distance associated with the transmitting node indicates that the transmission of the message occurred very near the wireless node would not have to relay the message because it is assumed for instance that most of the other neighboring wireless nodes have already received the same message. By taking into account the relative radio distances of neighboring nodes the described smart flooding functionality leads to on average each flooding message being received for a few times by each node independent of the node density. The number of times a message is received by any one node affects the scalability of the network .

If the received message however is a unicast reply message that was addressed to the receiving node the network control module checks whether the destination node can be found in the routing table e.g. can be found from the destination field in the reply message or obtained from the source field of the query by the replying node . If found the routing table entry will give the NID of the neighboring node to which the reply message will be sent in the next opportunity. If the unicast transmission is not successful the next entry for the same DST will be used as the next try. If the received message is a unicast reply message that was not addressed to the receiving node and no acknowledgment from the intended receiver node was heard the node will store the message in the message table for scheduled retransmission. It is noted that unicast messages or acknowledgement messages that are not addressed to the node are normally received D2D radio layer see discussion of the D2D radio layer below but not by the awareness services module . However under certain circumstances the D2D radio layer can provide such messages to the awareness services module to schedule for retransmission. For example if no successful unicast of the same message is observed by the time when the message is scheduled to be transmitted the node will transmit the unicast or acknowledgement message to the intended recipient found from the routing table associated with the message. In this way the nodes that are not the intended recipients of the reply messages can assist in routing the message forward towards the correct destination.

As shown in the awareness services module has connectivity to a device to device D2D radio layer . The D2D radio layer enables the formation of the ad hoc mesh network and sharing of awareness information using for instance short range radio technologies such WLAN and Bluetooth . It is contemplated that the D2D radio layer may use any wireless technology for communication between devices over short ranges. The radio technology for instance enables each wireless node within the ad hoc mesh network to broadcast messages in a connectionless way to the neighboring nodes that are within radio range. As used herein the term connectionless means the wireless nodes need not use two way signaling to establish a communication channel before broadcasting a message. In exemplary embodiments the D2D radio layer may include multiple radios using one or more different technologies or protocols e.g. WLAN and Bluetooth simultaneously . A wireless node configured with multiple radios may act as a gateway node to span two or more sub networks serviced by the different wireless technologies. In this way messages broadcast on one sub network may be propagated to another sub network.

In exemplary embodiments the low latency requirements also enable saving power in the host processor e.g. as depicted in . For illustration the following description refers to the components of exemplary chip set of . The D2D radio layer is typically implemented in the ASIC module whereas the functionalities of the awareness services module can be implemented either in the ASIC or the processor . If the functionalities of the awareness services module are implemented in the processor power consumption is reduced by for instance having ASIC wake up the processor as infrequently as possible. By way of example the periodic operation of the D2D radio layer explained above enables the ASIC to collect all messages and send them to the processor at a frequency of once per active transmission period . The processor then processes all received messages and calculates new messages to be sent for the next active transmission period . The processor then sends the messages to the ASIC for transmission. Using this process a flooding message can make one hop e.g. travel from one node to another node per period which is fully acceptable for awareness information. In contrast potential delays of hundreds of milliseconds are not possible for example for voice traffic and these kinds of power savings cannot therefore be achieved in other communication systems transporting delay sensitive traffic.

By way of example the awareness services module can use the CIDs to locate and identify communities that are active e.g. transmitting or receiving community messages among one or more neighboring wireless nodes by 1 passively monitoring messages directed towards one or more communities over the ad hoc mesh network using the process described with respect to below 2 actively searching for one or more communities using a community search message as described with respect to below and or 3 actively searching for one or more members of the communities using a member search message as described with respect to . The awareness services module then updates a list of active communities based on the identification step . For example the list of active communities includes those communities to which the wireless node belongs e.g. communities that are private such as a community of personal friends and those communities that are public and open to all nodes e.g. a general community of all wireless nodes on the ad hoc network in which system wide messages may be exchanged .

In exemplary embodiments the awareness services module is continuously updating the list of active communities by for instance monitoring for messaging traffic over the ad hoc mesh network related to one or more of the active communities step . More specifically the awareness services module tracks whether there are any messages originating from or directed to one or more of the active communities over a predetermined period of time. In one embodiment the period of time can be dependent on the on the density or stability of neighboring wireless nodes . For example if the composition of the neighboring wireless nodes is changing rapidly the time period can be shorter. Similarly if the composition of the neighboring wireless nodes is more stable the time period can be longer. In either case the awareness services module observes whether there are any messages related to one or more of the active communities e.g. by checking the header information of the messages for CIDs corresponding to any of the active communities step . If no messages are observed over the predetermined period of time for a particular community the awareness services module designates that community as inactive and updates the list of active communities accordingly step . If a message related to a particular community is observed during the time period the community is considered to be still active and the awareness services module need not update the list of active communities. It is contemplated that the awareness services module can continuously or periodically perform the monitoring process to update the list of active communities.

After creating the message the awareness services module initiates broadcast of the message over the ad hoc mesh network step . In exemplary embodiments the community search message is equivalent to a query and is transmitted and replied to using the processes described with respect to below. As the message propagates over the ad hoc mesh network mobile devices that are members of one or more of the active communities associated with the anonymized CID or CIDs included in the message automatically respond to mobile device that originally sent the message. The awareness services module initiates receipt of the reply messages step . The reply message contains for instance a list of anonymized CIDs of those searched communities which have an active status in the replying node . Based on this list the awareness services module identifies each community in the list as an active community and updates the list of active communities in for instance the community directory step .

After the member search message is generated the awareness services module initiates broadcast of the member search message over the ad hoc mesh network step . In exemplary embodiments the member search message is equivalent to a query and is transmitted and replied to using the processes described with respect to below. As the message propagates over the ad hoc mesh network mobile devices that have one or more communities associated with the anonymized CID or CIDs in the visible state automatically respond to the mobile device that originally sent the message. If aliases corresponding to one or more users are also included in member search message mobile devices corresponding to the user aliases also respond. The awareness services module initiates receipt of the reply messages sent in response to the member search message step . The reply message includes for instance a list of anonymized CIDs plaintext or encrypted user aliases and possibly the plaintext or encrypted status e.g. activity state mode etc. of the community member. In certain embodiments the awareness services module uses the reply messages to update the list of visible community members in the local neighborhood step . In addition the awareness services module also uses the replies to identify active communities within the neighborhood and to update the list of active communities step . The updates are based for instance on the anonymized CIDs the community specific member identity e.g. alias o other member specific information included in the reply messages.

Moreover it is contemplated that the state of a community in a wireless node can be used to filter incoming messages. For example to block all incoming or outgoing messages a user can set the state of a community to inactive so that all messages from that particular community are disregarded. It is contemplated that a user belonging to multiple communities may independently set the visibility state for each community. By way of example to block incoming advertisements the user can set the state to inactive for the community sending the advertisements. It is also contemplated that the user can automatically set the visibility state based on criteria such as time e.g. to automatically set a visibility state at certain periods of the day location e.g. to automatically set a visibility state at certain locations such as work or school or any other context e.g. while in a meeting or at dinner .

In step the application within querying node generates a request for searching community information e.g. wireless nodes having active communities or communities with visible members over the ad hoc mesh network and sends the request to the community layer of the querying node . The community layer generates a community query message assigns a community query identification number CQID to the query message and prepares the query message for transmission over the ad hoc mesh network by marking the query with CIDs of the communities from which the user is seeking information. If the user seeks information on members of the communities and the communities are private the community layer encrypts the community specific user identity e.g. alias using the encryption keys associated with the respective CID and stored in the community directory . If the community directory contains recent information about active communities in other nodes then the community layer may return the community information step . The community layer then sends the anonymized and partly encrypted message to the network layer step .

The network layer assigns a message sequence number MID to the query message and adds fields to the network layer message header to indicate that the querying node is the source and transmitter of the query message e.g. using the NID . The network layer sends the query message to the D2D radio layer of the querying node for broadcasting in the ad hoc mesh network step .

The query message is then broadcasted to one or more relaying nodes step . All the nodes that are able to receive the broadcast message are relaying nodes. After processing by the relaying node the query message is rebroadcasted to another relaying node or to the replying node step . The processes of the replying node are described with respect to . After processing of the query message by the replying node a reply message is generated and sent to the relaying node step which routes the reply message either to another relaying node or to the querying node step based on the route stored in the routing table .

At the querying node the D2D radio layer receives and acknowledges the reply message and forwards the reply message to the network layer step . The network layer determines that the querying node is the intended destination of the reply message by checking the DST field in the network layer message header and sends the message to the community layer for processing step . In case of a private community the community layer decrypts the reply message using the appropriate encryption keys stored in the community directory . Based on the information in the reply message the community layer updates information in the community directory list of active communities and the lists of visible members in the communities and finally sends a service response to the query to the application step .

In step the D2D radio layer of the replying node receives the query message and forwards it to the network layer of the replying node . The network layer may decide to rebroadcast the query message step . On receipt the network layer forwards the query message to the community layer step .

If the community layer determines that the query message contains one or more anonymized CIDs of the active communities associated with the replying node and the query message contains encrypted user aliases the community layer decrypts the message and updates information in its community directory e.g. containing the list of active communities and the list of visible members of the communities . Next the community layer generates a reply message that contains the same CQID as the incoming query and has the source NID of the query message set as the destination NID of the reply message. If the query requests visible user aliases and the user alias in the node is set as visible then the community layer encrypts the user alias with the encryption keys associated with the community. The community layer then retrieves a new anonymized CID from the community directory and sends the reply message to the network layer step .

On receipt of the reply message the network layer assigns a new message sequence number MSN to the reply message attaches the NID of the replying node as the source and transmitter finds the NID of the relaying node for the next hop from the routing table sets the receive NID of the reply message as the next hop and sends the reply message to the D2D radio layer step . The D2D radio layer sends the reply message as a unicast message addressed to a relaying node over the ad hoc mesh network step .

The processes described herein for locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network may be implemented via software hardware e.g. general processor Digital Signal Processing DSP chip an Application Specific Integrated Circuit ASIC Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGAs etc. firmware or a combination thereof. Such exemplary hardware for performing the described functions is detailed below.

A bus includes one or more parallel conductors of information so that information is transferred quickly among devices coupled to the bus . One or more processors for processing information are coupled with the bus .

A processor performs a set of operations on information related to locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network . The set of operations include bringing information in from the bus and placing information on the bus . The set of operations also typically include comparing two or more units of information shifting positions of units of information and combining two or more units of information such as by addition or multiplication or logical operations like OR exclusive OR XOR and AND. Each operation of the set of operations that can be performed by the processor is represented to the processor by information called instructions such as an operation code of one or more digits. A sequence of operations to be executed by the processor such as a sequence of operation codes constitute processor instructions also called computer system instructions or simply computer instructions. Processors may be implemented as mechanical electrical magnetic optical chemical or quantum components among others alone or in combination.

Computer system also includes a memory coupled to bus . The memory such as a random access memory RAM or other dynamic storage device stores information including processor instructions for locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network . Dynamic memory allows information stored therein to be changed by the computer system . RAM allows a unit of information stored at a location called a memory address to be stored and retrieved independently of information at neighboring addresses. The memory is also used by the processor to store temporary values during execution of processor instructions. The computer system also includes a read only memory ROM or other static storage device coupled to the bus for storing static information including instructions that is not changed by the computer system . Some memory is composed of volatile storage that loses the information stored thereon when power is lost. Also coupled to bus is a non volatile persistent storage device such as a magnetic disk optical disk or flash card for storing information including instructions that persists even when the computer system is turned off or otherwise loses power.

Information including instructions for locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network is provided to the bus for use by the processor from an external input device such as a keyboard containing alphanumeric keys operated by a human user or a sensor. A sensor detects conditions in its vicinity and transforms those detections into physical expression compatible with the measurable phenomenon used to represent information in computer system . Other external devices coupled to bus used primarily for interacting with humans include a display device such as a cathode ray tube CRT or a liquid crystal display LCD or plasma screen or printer for presenting text or images and a pointing device such as a mouse or a trackball or cursor direction keys or motion sensor for controlling a position of a small cursor image presented on the display and issuing commands associated with graphical elements presented on the display . In some embodiments for example in embodiments in which the computer system performs all functions automatically without human input one or more of external input device display device and pointing device is omitted.

In the illustrated embodiment special purpose hardware such as an application specific integrated circuit ASIC is coupled to bus . The special purpose hardware is configured to perform operations not performed by processor quickly enough for special purposes. Examples of application specific ICs include graphics accelerator cards for generating images for display cryptographic boards for encrypting and decrypting messages sent over a network speech recognition and interfaces to special external devices such as robotic arms and medical scanning equipment that repeatedly perform some complex sequence of operations that are more efficiently implemented in hardware.

Computer system also includes one or more instances of a communications interface coupled to bus . Communication interface provides a one way or two way communication coupling to a variety of external devices that operate with their own processors such as printers scanners and external disks. In general the coupling is with a network link that is connected to a local network to which a variety of external devices with their own processors are connected. For example communication interface may be a parallel port or a serial port or a universal serial bus USB port on a personal computer. In some embodiments communications interface is an integrated services digital network ISDN card or a digital subscriber line DSL card or a telephone modem that provides an information communication connection to a corresponding type of telephone line. In some embodiments a communication interface is a cable modem that converts signals on bus into signals for a communication connection over a coaxial cable or into optical signals for a communication connection over a fiber optic cable. As another example communications interface may be a local area network LAN card to provide a data communication connection to a compatible LAN such as Ethernet. Wireless links may also be implemented. For wireless links the communications interface sends or receives or both sends and receives electrical acoustic or electromagnetic signals including infrared and optical signals that carry information streams such as digital data. For example in wireless handheld devices such as mobile telephones like cell phones the communications interface includes a radio band electromagnetic transmitter and receiver called a radio transceiver. In exemplary embodiments the communications interface enables connection to the communication network for locating communities over an ad hoc mesh network .

In one embodiment the chip set includes a communication mechanism such as a bus for passing information among the components of the chip set . A processor has connectivity to the bus to execute instructions and process information stored in for example a memory . The processor may include one or more processing cores with each core configured to perform independently. A multi core processor enables multiprocessing within a single physical package. Examples of a multi core processor include two four eight or greater numbers of processing cores. Alternatively or in addition the processor may include one or more microprocessors configured in tandem via the bus to enable independent execution of instructions pipelining and multithreading. The processor may also be accompanied with one or more specialized components to perform certain processing functions and tasks such as one or more digital signal processors DSP or one or more application specific integrated circuits ASIC .

Similarly an ASIC can be configured to performed specialized functions not easily performed by a general purposed processor. Other specialized components to aid in performing the inventive functions described herein include one or more field programmable gate arrays FPGA not shown one or more controllers not shown or one or more other special purpose computer chips.

The processor and accompanying components have connectivity to the memory via the bus . The memory includes both dynamic memory e.g. RAM magnetic disk writable optical disk etc. and static memory e.g. ROM CD ROM etc. for storing executable instructions that when executed perform the inventive steps described herein to provide awareness information over an ad hoc mesh network .

A radio section amplifies power and converts frequency in order to communicate with a base station which is included in a mobile communication system via antenna . The power amplifier PA and the transmitter modulation circuitry are operationally responsive to the MCU with an output from the PA coupled to the duplexer or circulator or antenna switch as known in the art. The PA also couples to a battery interface and power control unit .

In use a user of mobile station speaks into the microphone and his or her voice along with any detected background noise is converted into an analog voltage. The analog voltage is then converted into a digital signal through the Analog to Digital Converter ADC . The control unit routes the digital signal into the DSP for processing therein such as speech encoding channel encoding encrypting and interleaving. In the exemplary embodiment the processed voice signals are encoded by units not separately shown using a cellular transmission protocol such as global evolution EDGE general packet radio service GPRS global system for mobile communications GSM Internet protocol multimedia subsystem IMS universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS etc. as well as any other suitable wireless medium e.g. microwave access WiMAX Long Term Evolution LTE networks code division multiple access CDMA wireless fidelity WiFi satellite and the like.

The encoded signals are then routed to an equalizer for compensation of any frequency dependent impairments that occur during transmission though the air such as phase and amplitude distortion. After equalizing the bit stream the modulator combines the signal with a RF signal generated in the RF interface . The modulator generates a sine wave by way of frequency or phase modulation. In order to prepare the signal for transmission an up converter combines the sine wave output from the modulator with another sine wave generated by a synthesizer to achieve the desired frequency of transmission. The signal is then sent through a PA to increase the signal to an appropriate power level. In practical systems the PA acts as a variable gain amplifier whose gain is controlled by the DSP from information received from a network base station. The signal is then filtered within the duplexer and optionally sent to an antenna coupler to match impedances to provide maximum power transfer. Finally the signal is transmitted via antenna to a local base station. An automatic gain control AGC can be supplied to control the gain of the final stages of the receiver. The signals may be forwarded from there to a remote telephone which may be another cellular telephone other mobile phone or a land line connected to a Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN or other telephony networks.

Voice signals transmitted to the mobile station are received via antenna and immediately amplified by a low noise amplifier LNA . A down converter lowers the carrier frequency while the demodulator strips away the RF leaving only a digital bit stream. The signal then goes through the equalizer and is processed by the DSP . A Digital to Analog Converter DAC converts the signal and the resulting output is transmitted to the user through the speaker all under control of a Main Control Unit MCU which can be implemented as a Central Processing Unit CPU not shown .

The MCU receives various signals including input signals from the keyboard . The keyboard and or the MCU in combination with other user input components e.g. the microphone comprise a user interface circuitry for managing user input. The MCU runs a user interface software to facilitate user control of at least some functions of the mobile station . The MCU also delivers a display command and a switch command to the display and to the speech output switching controller respectively. Further the MCU exchanges information with the DSP and can access an optionally incorporated SIM card and a memory . In addition the MCU executes various control functions required of the station. The DSP may depending upon the implementation perform any of a variety of conventional digital processing functions on the voice signals. Additionally DSP determines the background noise level of the local environment from the signals detected by microphone and sets the gain of microphone to a level selected to compensate for the natural tendency of the user of the mobile station .

The CODEC includes the ADC and DAC . The memory stores various data including call incoming tone data and is capable of storing other data including music data received via e.g. the global Internet. The software module could reside in RAM memory flash memory registers or any other form of writable storage medium known in the art.

The SIM card serves primarily to identify the mobile station on a radio network. The card also contains a memory for storing a personal telephone number registry text messages and user specific mobile station settings.
