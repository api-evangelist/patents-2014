This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 912 751 filed on Oct. 27 2010 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 333 785 filed on May 12 2010 . The entire contents of related applications are incorporated herein by reference.

The disclosed embodiments of the present invention relate to partitioning a storage space of a storage device and more particularly to a method of creating a target storage layout table referenced for partitioning a storage space of a storage device e.g. a flash device and related electronic device and machine readable medium.

Recently handheld devices become more and more popular. Most of them aim at low price small size high computing power and powerful functionality. Therefore there is a need for an embedded operating system. For example the Linux based embedded system has some advantages such as no proprietary problem high portability and comparatively easy to be implemented. The Linux based embedded system is usually a diskless system. In order to keep permanent data in the Linux based embedded system using a flash device as its disk system is a widely adopted strategy.

In general a storage device may be partitioned into a plurality of partitions to facilitate the use of the storage device. Taking a Linux based embedded system for example a memory technology device MTD subsystem provides an abstract layer for raw flash devices which makes it possible to use the same application programming interface API when working with flash devices of different flash types and technologies. The Linux based embedded system is internally assigned a flash layout table referenced for partitioning an employed flash device e.g. a NAND flash into a plurality of partitions for different MTDs.

However the flash device may have bad blocks scattered around the flash device when manufactured in the factory. For example 80 bad blocks may be located anywhere in the flash device. However there is no information available in the flash device for indicating the exact locations of these bad blocks scattered in the flash device after the flash device is manufactured and then shipped to the market. The conventional partitioning strategy has to consider the worst case when defining each partition in the flash device. Please refer to which is a diagram illustrating a conventional flash layout table . The desired partitions PA PB PC and PD originally required by the system have the sizes Size A Size B Size C and Size D respectively. As mentioned above there are bad blocks scattered around the flash device and the exact locations of these bad blocks are unknown after the manufactured flash device is shipped to the market. The conventional partitioning strategy therefore makes each actually used partition larger by having a reserved area included therein. As shown in each of the reserved areas RSV A RSV B RSV C and RSV D has the same size Size R corresponding to an estimated maximum number of bad blocks scattered around the flash device. For example each of the reserved areas RSV A RSV B RSV C and RSV D contains at least 80 blocks. As a result the flash layout table defines four partitions PA PB PC and PD having the actual sizes Size A Size R Size B Size R Size C Size R and Size D Size R respectively. After the additional reserved areas are assigned to the partitions PA PD the remaining storage area with the size Size R may act as a spare reserved area RSV R of the flash device that can be used for other purposes such as data buffering.

Actually some of the actual storage areas corresponding to the partitions PA PB PC and PD may have many bad blocks and the remaining may have no bad block. Regarding an actual storage area corresponding to one of the partitions PA PB PC and PD that does not have bad blocks at all the blocks included in the reserved area are not used resulting in a waste of the storage space of the flash device. Moreover as the partitions PA PD have reserved areas RSV A RSV D included therein the spare reserved area RSV R which may be used for other purposes would be small due to limited storage capacity of the flash device. As a result the flash device initialized using the conventional flash layout table shown in may lack flexibility in the use of the spare reserved area RSV R. In a worst case the flash device partitioned using the conventional partitioning strategy may have no remaining storage area available for acting as the aforementioned spare reserved area RSV R. Regarding an application which is equipped with a storage device with small storage space applying the conventional partitioning strategy to the storage device is impractical.

These and other objectives of the present invention will no doubt become obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art after reading the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment that is illustrated in the various figures and drawings.

Certain terms are used throughout the description and following claims to refer to particular components. As one skilled in the art will appreciate manufacturers may refer to a component by different names. This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function. In the following description and in the claims the terms include and comprise are used in an open ended fashion and thus should be interpreted to mean include but not limited to . . . . Also the term coupled is intended to mean either an indirect or direct electrical connection. Accordingly if one device is electrically connected to another device that connection may be through a direct electrical connection or through an indirect electrical connection via other devices and connections. Technical features of the present invention are detailed as follows.

The main conception of the present invention is to identify defective storage areas in the storage space of the storage device and accordingly generate an identification result and then create a target storage layout table according to the identification result. Please refer to which is a flowchart illustrating a method of creating a target storage layout table referenced for partitioning a storage space of a storage device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Please note that if the result is substantially the same the steps are not required to be executed in the exact order shown in . The exemplary method includes the following steps.

If yes go to step otherwise go to step to deal with another pre defined partition with a corresponding pre defined partition size defined in the pre defined storage layout table.

The exemplary method shown in may be employed by an electronic device such as a Linux based embedded system or other computer system. Please refer to which is a block diagram illustrating an electronic device according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The exemplary electronic device includes but is not limited to a processor a storage device and a machine readable medium . The machine readable medium stores a program code PROG e.g. a flash driver that when executed by the processor causes the processor to perform steps shown in . That is the processor is configured to perform the steps shown in for creating the desired target storage layout table. By way of example but not limitation the machine readable medium may be a read only memory or other data carrier capable of providing the program code PROG to the processor . In one exemplary embodiment the target storage layout table TB referenced for partitioning the storage space of the storage device is created in response to a change of the pre defined storage layout table TB or a first time initialization of the storage device . That is when the pre defined storage layout table TB is modified changed for example due to firmware program upgrade the steps directed to creating the target storage layout table TB are performed by the processor executing the program code PROG loaded from the machine readable medium step . In addition when the storage device is initialized for the first time e.g. when system s first startup occurs the steps directed to creating the target storage layout table TB are performed by the processor executing the program code PROG loaded from the machine readable medium step . That is the steps directed to creating the target storage layout table TB are performed in response to a first time initialization of the storage device and is not performed in response to a subsequent initialization of the storage device . It should be noted that the order of executing steps and may be adjusted. For example in another exemplary embodiment step may be executed before step is executed.

In a case where the pre defined storage layout table TB is modified or the storage device is initialized for the first time the processor executes the program code PROG for scanning part or all of the storage space of the storage device to identify defective storage area s . In one exemplary implementation only the storage areas belonging to pre defined partitions with pre defined partition sizes defined in the pre defined storage layout table are scanned for defective storage area identification. However in an alternative implementation all of the storage areas included in the storage device may be scanned for defective storage area identification.

By way of example but not limitation the storage device is a flash device such as a NAND flash. Thus the storage device has a plurality of blocks included therein each block is composed of a plurality of pages and each defective storage area to be identified is a bad block. is a diagram illustrating a block of a flash device. As shown in the block includes many pages Page  Page  . . . Page N. Before the flash device manufactured in the factory is shipped to the market the flash device is programmed erased to make each bit within the flash device store a predetermined logic value e.g. 1 . Consider a case where the storage device is initialized for the first time meaning that the content in the storage device is not modified yet. The processor may check the last byte   of the first page Page  the last byte   of the second page Page  and the last byte  N of the last page Page N to determine whether the block is a bad block. For example when at least one bit of the checked last bytes     and  N is not the predetermined logic value e.g. 1 the processor judges that the block is a bad block otherwise the processor regards the block as a good block. However this is for illustrative purposes and is not meant to be a limitation of the present invention. That is any means capable of identifying defective storage areas e.g. bad blocks of the storage device e.g. a flash device can be adopted to generate the identification result which will be referenced for creating the target storage layout table TB.

Please refer to in conjunction with and . is a diagram illustrating defective storage areas scattered in the storage device shown in and is a diagram illustrating the target storage layout table TB according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As shown in the identification result generated in step indicates that the storage device has a plurality of defective storage areas DS  DS  DS  and DS  with sizes Size A Size B Size C and Size D respectively. For example each of the defective storage areas DS  DS  DS  and DS  may include one or more bad blocks when the storage device is a flash device. Please note that the number of the identified defective storage areas and the sizes of the identified defective storage areas are for illustrative purposes only.

Regarding the first pre defined partition PA with the pre defined partition size Size A in the pre defined storage layout table TB the processor checks if an actual storage area corresponding to the pre defined partition PA defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB i.e. an actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR0 and ADDR1 shown in has one or more defective areas by referring to the identification result step . In a case where there is no defective area in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR0 and ADDR1 the processor will set a partition size of the pre defined partition PA defined in the created target storage layout table TB according to the pre defined partition size Size A as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB. For example the pre defined partition PA defined in the created target storage layout table TB is assigned by the same pre defined partition size Size A as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB. In another case where the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR0 and ADDR1 has at least one defective storage area DS  as shown in the processor sets a partition size of the pre defined partition PA defined in the created target storage layout table TB according to the pre defined partition size Size A defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB and a total size Size A of identified defective area s included in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR0 and ADDR1. For example the partition size of the pre defined partition PA is set by summing up the pre defined partition size Size A and the total size Size A of identified defective area s included in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR0 and ADDR1 as shown in . However this is for illustrative purposes only. That is the partition size of the pre defined partition PA may be set by any computational result derived from the pre defined partition size Size A and the total size Size A of identified defective area s . This also obeys the spirit of the present invention. As the partition sizes of other pre defined partitions PB PD in the created target storage layout table TB are not determined yet the processor proceeds to dealing with another pre defined partition defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB step .

Regarding the second pre defined partition PB with the pre defined partition size Size B in the pre defined storage layout table TB the processor checks if an actual storage area corresponding to the pre defined partition PB defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB i.e. an actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR1 and ADDR2 shown in where ADDR1 ADDR1 Size A has one or more defective areas by referring to the identification result step . In a case where there is no defective area in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR1 and ADDR2 the processor will set a partition size of the pre defined partition PB defined in the created target storage layout table TB according to the pre defined partition size Size B as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB. For example the pre defined partition PB defined in the created target storage layout table TB is assigned by the same pre defined partition size Size B as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB. In another case where the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR1 and ADDR2 has at least one defective storage area DS  as shown in the processor sets a partition size of the pre defined partition PB defined in the created target storage layout table TB according to the pre defined partition size Size B defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB and a total size Size B of identified defective area s included in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR1 and ADDR2. For example the partition size of the pre defined partition PB is set by summing up the pre defined partition size Size B and the total size Size B of identified defective area s included in the actual storage area delimited by addresses ADDR1 and ADDR2 as shown in . Similarly this is for illustrative purposes only. That is the partition size of the pre defined partition PB may be set by any computational result derived from the pre defined partition size Size B and the total size Size B of identified defective area s .

As a person skilled in the art can readily understand how to set partition sizes of the remaining pre defined partitions PC and PD in the created target storage layout table TB after reading above paragraphs further description is omitted here for brevity.

Please note that the spare reserved area RSV defined in the created target storage layout table TB has the size Size E which is determined by subtracting Size A Size B Size C and Size D from Size E. Compared to the conventional flash layout table shown in the target storage layout table TB created using the proposed exemplary method shown in has the spare reserved area RSV larger than the spare reserved area RSV R. In addition the partition size of the pre defined partition in the target storage layout table TB is properly set by either the pre defined partition size as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB or adjusting the pre defined partition size as defined in the pre defined storage layout table TB according to the defective storage areas actually detected rather than an estimated maximum number of defective storage areas contained in the storage device e.g. an estimated maximum number of bad blocks scattered around a flash device . In this way the storage device initialized using the exemplary target storage layout table TB shown in has improved flexibility in the use of the spare reserved area RSV and less waste of the storage space of the storage device. Thus the overall performance of the electronic device can be improved accordingly.

It should be noted the exemplary method proposed in the present invention is not limited to creating a flash layout table of a flash device. Actually the exemplary method proposed in the present invention may be applied to any storage device having the need for partitioning its storage space. Besides no matter whether a target flash layout table is created and referenced any application that partitions a storage space of a storage device by referring to an identification result of defective storage area s still obeys the spirit of the present invention and falls within the scope of the present invention. To put it another way the present invention may also be regarded as proposing a method of partitioning a storage space of a storage device by identifying defective storage areas in the storage space of the storage device and accordingly generating an identification result and partitioning the storage space of the storage device according to the identification result. In one exemplary implementation the step of partitioning the storage space of the storage device according to the identification result includes the steps of creating a target storage layout table according to the identification result and partitioning the storage space of the storage device according to the target storage layout table.

It should be noted that the flow shown in would create a target storage layout table by checking all pre defined partitions in the pre defined storage layout table to determine whether the corresponding pre defined partition sizes should be adjusted. However this is for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to be a limitation of the present invention. In an alternative design of creating a target storage layout table some of the pre defined partitions defined in the pre defined storage layout table are checked to see if the corresponding pre defined partition sizes originally defined in the pre defined storage layout table should be adjusted according to the identification result of defective storage area s and the remaining pre defined partitions are still assigned with corresponding pre defined partition sizes originally defined in the pre defined storage layout table. That is step in is optional and may be omitted according to actual design consideration.

Those skilled in the art will readily observe that numerous modifications and alterations of the device and method may be made while retaining the teachings of the invention. Accordingly the above disclosure should be construed as limited only by the metes and bounds of the appended claims.
