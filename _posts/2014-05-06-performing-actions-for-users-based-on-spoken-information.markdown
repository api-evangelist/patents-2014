title: Performing actions for users based on spoken information
abstract: Techniques are described for performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information, such as spoken voice-based information received from the users during telephone calls. The described techniques include categorizing spoken information obtained from a user in one or more ways, and performing actions on behalf of the user related to the categorized information. For example, in some situations, spoken information obtained from a user is analyzed to identify one or more spoken information items (e.g., words, phrases, sentences, etc.) supplied by the user, and to generate corresponding textual representations (e.g., via automated speech-to-text techniques). One or more actions may then be taken regarding the identified information items, including to categorize the items by adding textual representations of the spoken information items to one or more of multiple predefined lists or other collections of information that are specific to or otherwise available to the user.

This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 596 427 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 718 239 filed Aug. 28 2012 and entitled Performing Actions For Users Based on Spoken Information which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11 940 229 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 254 535 filed Nov. 14 2007 and entitled Performing Actions For Users Based on Spoken Information which claims the benefit of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 859 052 filed Nov. 14 2006 and entitled Categorization And Corresponding Actions On Voice Messages System And Method and of provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 859 049 filed Nov. 14 2006 and entitled Voice Driven Presence For IM Networks And Multimodal Communications Across Messaging Networks each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The following disclosure relates generally to techniques for performing actions for users based on spoken information such as to automatically categorize spoken information items provided by a user of a voice based messaging system according to multiple available collections of information for the user and to perform one or more types of actions for the categorized information items for the collections of information.

While people are increasingly using data retrieval capabilities of computing devices to access information of a variety of types voice based functionality of telephones continues to be commonly used for a variety of purposes including to obtain information of various types. For example telephones are frequently used to obtain address and telephone number information for designated individuals or businesses such as via automated and or manual directory assistance services. In addition enhanced directory assistance services exist to provide a variety of types of additional information to telephone users such as movie listings weather reports sports scores traffic reports etc. Moreover some businesses may provide automated telephone systems to provide various information to customers and or partners about their businesses such as via Interactive Voice Response IVR systems. Other types of systems may similarly provide a variety of other types of functionality to voice based telephone users such as voice message recording and or forwarding services e.g. to record a voice message to later be provided to one or more designated recipients transcription services e.g. to record voice based information that will later be manually and or automatically converted into text etc. While various services and systems thus exist for telephone users to obtain some types of voice based information it is nonetheless often difficult for telephone users to obtain a variety of other types of functionality.

In addition it is often difficult for companies and other entities to effectively provide promotional and other types of information to others and or to provide information to others about products and or services that are available. For example while a variety of types of advertising models are known e.g. via traditional print media radio television billboards Internet based banner ads and sponsored links and pop up ads location based services such as via data services of mobile devices etc. all suffer from various known problems including difficulties in providing information to users that is currently of interest and in a form and or manner that is desired.

Techniques are described for performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information such as spoken voice based information received from the users during telephone calls. In at least some embodiments the described techniques include categorizing spoken information obtained from a user in one or more ways and performing actions on behalf of the user related to the categorized information. For example in at least some embodiments spoken information obtained from a user is analyzed to identify one or more spoken information items e.g. words phrases sentences etc. supplied by the user and in at least some situations to further generate textual representations of the identified information items e.g. based on use of automated speech to text techniques . One or more actions may then be taken regarding the identified information items such as to add textual representations of the identified information items to one or more of multiple predefined lists or other collections of information that are specific to or otherwise available to the user e.g. based on an indication of that information collection supplied by the user as part of the spoken information that includes the identified information items to use textual representations of the identified information items to generate other information e.g. to perform a search based on the textual representations to provide to the user various types of automatically determined information based on the information items etc. Additional details are included below related to performing actions for users based at least in part on spoken information. In addition in at least some embodiments a Voice Message Activity VMA system automatically performs some or all of the described techniques such as by providing a VMA service to remote users as described in greater detail below.

In at least some embodiments the VMA system allows numerous remote users to each maintain one or more lists groups or other collections of information at the VMA system such that a user may place a telephone call to the VMA system to supply one or more spoken information items to be added to a particular list or other information collection. Such lists or other information collections may have various forms in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail below such as for example a shopping list a reminder list related to a particular topic a wish list of desired items etc. Thus as one specific example a user may supply a voice message during a telephone call that includes a spoken indication of shopping list and of one or more information items e.g. milk a dozen eggs etc. to be added to that user s shopping list such that a stored copy of a shopping list for that user will be updated to include textual representations of milk and a dozen eggs e.g. in addition to information items added to the shopping list during one or more prior telephone calls . In at least some embodiments the VMA system may provide one or more predefined types of lists or other information collections for selection by users such that each user may create and maintain a separate copy of a particular type of information collection e.g. a separate shopping list although in other embodiments at least some types of information collections may be configured to be shared between multiple users. Furthermore in at least some embodiments the VMA system may allow at least some users to define one or more new information collections specific to that user e.g. for user Bob to define an information collection of Bob s list of interesting facts to tell Betty . A user may gain access to information stored in one or more information collections by the VMA system e.g. in a database and or to functionality from the VMA system related to stored information for one or more such information collections in various ways in various embodiments as discussed in greater detail below.

As previously noted spoken information may be obtained from users in various ways in various embodiments. For example a user may place a telephone call to an IVR system or other automated voice based system such as via one or more of the following a cell phone a landline phone a satellite phone a phone that uses one or more computer networks at least in part such as for a Voice Over IP VOIP call a phone whose connection uses a URL Uniform Resource Locator or other URI Uniform Resource Identifier such as based on an SIP Session Initiation Protocol URI phone number e.g. sip port where is replaced by an actual username and is replaced by a domain name or IP address such as john.smith 212.111.1.111 or support abcdefgh.com as described in greater detail in the RFC 3261 standard etc. such as to provide spoken information that includes instructions and or other information related to one or more actions to be taken. Once spoken information is obtained from a user it may then be analyzed in various ways in various embodiments including in an automated manner and or based at least in part by one or more human operators of the VMA system. For example when a user includes one or more spoken information items the VMA system may analyze the spoken information in order to categorize that information such as to determine a list or other information collection on which the information items are to be included e.g. based on a spoken indication of the information collection or instead in another manner or instead to determine one or more other types of actions to take for those spoken information items. In some embodiments the spoken information from a user is analyzed in a realtime or substantially realtime manner during a telephone call with the user such as to allow appropriate responses to be provided to the user during the telephone call. In other embodiments the analysis of spoken information may occur after a telephone call from a user is completed e.g. by analyzing a voice message left by the user such as if results or other corresponding information and or functionality are provided to the user at a later time.

Various types of actions may be performed for users based on spoken information received from the user and may be determined in various ways in various embodiments. For example one or more actions to take regarding one or more spoken information items supplied by a user may be determined in at least some embodiments based at least in part on one or more of the following spoken instructions or other information that is supplied by a user along with the spoken information items e.g. supplied as part of the spoken information provided by the user during a telephone call previously supplied instructions or other information whether spoken or supplied in another manner later supplied instructions or other information whether spoken or supplied in another manner a manner of supplying the information items e.g. based on a particular telephone number that is called to provide the spoken information a type of the information items e.g. to automatically determine to add items corresponding to food to a user s shopping list rather than a list of to do items to later be performed etc. As one specific example if a user provides spoken information that indicates a particular list or other information collection and one or more information items the actions to be taken may include adding textual representations and or other representations such as audio representations of those information items to that information collection. A non exclusive list of other types of actions may include for example one or more of the following performing a search based on one or more information items e.g. by using one or more of the information items as keywords for the search and or by using one or more of the information items to indicate a particular search engine to use or other manner of performing the search sending indicated information to an indicated recipient adding information to an information collection that is available to multiple users e.g. a bulletin board etc. Furthermore in at least some embodiments spoken information from a user may indicate various other types of actions to take related to maintenance of particular lists or other information collections such as to create or delete particular information collections to remove or otherwise modify information items that are already present in one or more information collections etc.

In addition in some embodiments one or more actions to take regarding one or more information items supplied by a user may include providing information to the user about those items. For example in at least some embodiments an action for one or more supplied information items and or for the information items that are currently part of an indicated information collection may include providing information about those information items to the user and or another recipient. In particular after one or more spoken information items are supplied by a user and added to a collection textual representations of those information items may be made available to the user e.g. in response to a request from the user by automatically sending one or more electronic messages to the user whose contents include those textual representations etc. . In other situations information that is provided to a user may be otherwise based on one or more supplied information items such as to provide search results that are generated based on using one or more supplied information items. Information may be provided to a user in various ways such as via one or more electronic messages sent to the user e.g. via one or more emails instant messages paging messages SMS or other text messages etc. such as based on previously specified electronic address information for a user who registered with the VMA system via a response to an interactive query from the user e.g. as part of one or more Web pages requested by the user when interacting with the VMA system such as a request for the contents of one or more information collections of the user and or via a spoken voice based response e.g. immediately such as during a telephone call with the user and in response to a spoken request or other spoken information from the user . Furthermore in at least some embodiments a user may be able to access and modify stored information in one or more information collections from prior spoken information in one or more manners including interactively by a remote user of a computing device or system that interacts with the VMA system programmatically via an API of the VMA system via a telephone based interface e.g. via spoken commands or other instructions etc.

In addition in some embodiments one or more actions to take regarding one or more information items supplied by a user may include actions related to a communication system e.g. an instant messaging network system provided by the VMA system or a third party system . For example based on spoken information provided by a user the VMA system may perform actions such as signing the user into an instant messenger network and setting presence of the user on the instant messenger network e.g. indicating that the user is online and or in a particular location or performing a particular activity as well as optionally performing other operations related to instant messaging based on spoken information provided by a user. As one specific example a user may provide a voice message during a telephone call to the VMA system that includes an indication that the user wants to sign into an instant messenger system e.g. by saying Log in to IM and the VMA system will log the user into an instant messenger system. Other types of actions by the VMA system may include logging a user off e.g. by saying Log off IM setting status of a user e.g. by saying Set status to . . . providing contents of one or more IM communications to the user e.g. by using text to speech to automatically convert contents of an IM communication to spoken form and reciting the spoken contents to the user during a telephone call sending one or more IM communications to one or more indicated recipients e.g. by using speech to text to automatically convert spoken information items from the user during a telephone call to be textual contents of an IM communication and or to be indications of particular recipients and sending the textual contents to the recipients in one or more IM communications etc. Additional details related to actions concerning receiving and or providing communications to others and or to other interactions with one or more external messaging networks or other communication systems are included in provisional U.S. Patent Application No. 60 859 049 filed Nov. 14 2006 and entitled Voice Driven Presence For IM Networks And Multimodal Communications Across Messaging Networks which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Furthermore in at least some embodiments third parties may obtain various types of information from the VMA system and or provide various information to users via the VMA system such as advertisements or other promotional materials e.g. coupons discount or promotional codes samples etc. from businesses and other entities e.g. providers of products such as manufacturers distributors retailers etc. . For example if a user has a shopping list or a wish list of desired items retailers may in some embodiments be able to obtain information about at least some information items on at least some such lists and to provide related information to the user e.g. an offer to supply a particular item at a particular price promotional information specific to the item information about other related items etc. . In particular in some embodiments the VMA system may provide an API application programming interface to allow such third party entities to obtain and or provide such information such as via one or more Web services provided by the VMA system. Entities who wish to obtain information from and or provide information to users may further be charged various fees in various situations such as a flat fee or a fee for each time that information is obtained from and or provided to a user e.g. by allowing an entity to bid on or otherwise specify a price for a target expression which the entity then pays each time that the information is provided to a user who uses the target expression .

In some embodiments the VMA system may operate in conjunction with one or more affiliated systems that provide one or more other types of voice based functionality to users e.g. with third party systems in exchange for a fee while in other embodiments the VMA system may itself provide one or more other types of voice based functionality to users. A non exclusive list of other types of voice based functionality that may be provided in at least some embodiments to users such as via a telephone call initiated by a user include the following the ability to create voice memos or other messages intended for the user and or one or more other recipients directory services the ability to use a phone call to check for coupons and or in response to advertising in broadcast and or user directed media e.g. radio television newspapers magazines billboards online information etc. whether local or regional national etc. In some embodiments the voice based functionality may be available only to users who have a predefined relationship with the VMA system and or an affiliated system such as registered subscriber or member users who have created an account and provided one or more of various types of information about themselves e.g. a user name an actual name a password electronic message address information for the user such as an email address instant message address fax number paging number and or telephone number for SMS or other text messages other contact information demographic information information about one or more user phone numbers from which the user will contact the VMA system and or affiliated system etc. as well as in some embodiments paying a fee. In other embodiments the voice based functionality may be available to all users. In addition the VMA system and or affiliated system may provide one or more telephone numbers that users may call to receive the voice based functionality such as toll free numbers that provide information to the VMA system and or affiliated system about a calling user s telephone number and or other caller ID information.

Furthermore in at least some embodiments one or more types of information collections may be maintained by one or more third party systems but modified or otherwise accessed by the VMA system on behalf of users who provide spoken information to the VMA system. For example a third party system may provide a bulletin board system that has one or more bulletin boards that are each accessible to multiple users e.g. to a specified group of users of the third party system to any user of the third party system etc. and one or more of the bulletin boards may be an information collection for each of one or more of the users of the VMA system that are also users of the third party system. In such situations a user may provide spoken information to the VMA system during a telephone call or in another manner and the VMA system may take one or more corresponding actions that include performing a post to a particular such third party bulletin board on behalf of the user e.g. to post a textual representation of one or more information items in the spoken information in such situations the VMA system may take various actions on behalf of the user such as to identify the user to the third party bulletin board system e.g. providing a username of the user for the third party bulletin board system and or access information such as a password such as based on information provided by the user during the telephone call or previously in other interactions with the VMA system . Third party information collections may have other forms in other embodiments including any Web page or other electronically accessible location in which users are allowed to post comments or otherwise provide information.

The use of the described techniques provides various benefits to users on whose behalf actions are performed based on spoken information and to entities that obtain information from users and or make information available to be provided to the users via the VMA system. Non exclusive examples of some such benefits in at least some embodiments include the following the ability of users to quickly add information to defined information collections via spoken information provided during telephone calls the ability of users to access information specified for a defined information collection such as in a different form than provided e.g. to obtain a textual representation of information items provided via spoken information and or at a different time e.g. to later obtain indications of spoken information items via email messages or requested Web pages and the ability of advertisers marketers businesses and other entities to target particular information to particular information recipients.

For illustrative purposes some embodiments are described below in which particular types of information is obtained from users in particular ways e.g. by obtaining spoken information from users via voice messages supplied by the users during telephone calls to provide particular types of services and functionality to the users e.g. to categorize the spoken information such as to add to an indicated list or other information collection . These examples are provided for illustrative purposes and are simplified for the sake of brevity and the inventive techniques can be used in a wide variety of other situations some of which are discussed below. For example in some embodiments voice based information may be obtained from users in other manners than via an automated voice system that the users contact such as by human operators that received the voice based information from users and or in situations in which users are contacted via telephone. In addition in some embodiments information that is obtained from a user may be in a form other than voice based information such as text based information computer generated audio information video information etc. and may similarly be categorized or otherwise analyzed by the VMA system so as to determine one or more actions to perform.

In at least some of the example scenarios described below voice based spoken information is obtained from a user such as from a voice message recorded by a caller user who contacts a VMA system from a mobile phone e.g. over the mobile network and or over VOIP a landline phone or a desktop laptop on the Internet. In these example scenarios spoken information may be categorized using various techniques including explicit and or implicit techniques in varying embodiments so as to determine actions to take for the spoken information. For example explicit techniques for categorizing spoken information may include providing specific keywords associated with different categories of services and or functionality that may be spoken by caller users e.g. such as at the beginning or end of a voice message providing different telephone numbers associated with different types of services and or functionality that caller users may call to obtain the associated services and or functionality etc. Examples of implicit categorization techniques may include analyzing spoken information to determine an appropriate category based at least in part on the contents of the spoken information such as by using natural language processing machine learning techniques human intelligence etc.

In addition various types of actions may be performed on behalf of a caller user based at least in part on the categorized spoken information. For example actions performed on behalf of a caller user may include one or more of the following transcribing spoken information and adding at least some of the transcribed information to one or more types of lists e.g. a grocery list or other shopping list a wish list etc. associated with the caller user and or with one or more other users so as to allow the contents of the list to be accessed at a later time e.g. via a Web based interface performing a purchase of one or more indicated products and or services for a caller user obtaining price information for one or more indicated products and or services such as from an indicated retailer and or from one or more partner or affiliated users for the VMA system performing an Internet search for indicated information and providing results to the caller user transcribing spoken information and publishing at least some of the transcribed information on a Weblog blog or electronic bulletin board system BBS transcribing spoken information and making the transcribed information available to the caller user in one or more other formats e.g. in textual form via email SMS instant message etc. providing access to a communication service e.g. an instant messaging network etc.

In addition in some embodiments other actions may be performed on behalf of users in conjunction with one or more affiliated partners of the VMA system provider e.g. third party vendors etc. such as to enhance commerce opportunities for the affiliated partners and or to provide additional benefits to users. For example the VMA system may obtain on behalf of users price bids for products and or services offered by various partners such as by providing information related to categorized information obtained from users to the various partners and obtaining bids from the various partners for products and or services provided by those partners that may be related to the information. In some embodiments user information may be shared with affiliated partners such as for example to allow a user s wish list to be transferred to or otherwise manifested on one or more partner sites e.g. if the user opts into such a manifestation . In addition in some embodiments actions may be performed in conjunction with affiliated partners in a manner that protects the identities of users such as by withholding users identities from the various partners e.g. to maintain user anonymity . For example anonymous information included in a user s wish list may be provided to non affiliated partners to obtain bids on product and or services.

In the example scenario illustrated in a caller user places a call to an example embodiment of the VMA system that provides a VMA service for use by remote users. In this example the caller user is a registered VMA system user whose phone number and email address are previously specified to the VMA system such that the user may be automatically identified by the VMA system e.g. via use of caller ID or related information that is available about the caller user via login or other related information explicitly provided by the user etc. . The caller user dials a general access phone number provided by the VMA system and delivers a voice message by saying a keyword associated with a category of services and or functionality provided by the system and then speaking one or more information items e.g. instructions content etc. associated with that keyword. The VMA system recognizes the keyword and associates the voice message with the appropriate category of services and or functionality and performs one or more associated actions using the voice message. In some of the examples provided below the keyword is associated with a particular list such that the associated action includes adding information from the voice message to a list and optionally initiating other actions related to the performance of the action e.g. purchasing goods on behalf of a caller user etc. .

In particular in the example scenario of the registered caller user calls a general number provided by the VMA system. After hearing a welcome prompt the caller user delivers a voice message that includes saying Wish List followed by Lawn Mower and then hangs up after hearing a confirmation. The VMA system records the voice message adds an indication of the Lawn Mower information item e.g. a textual representation of the item to the caller user s wish list for later access by the user and also in this example obtains bids from affiliated VMA Partner Service e.g. an online retailer and affiliated VMA Partner Service e.g. an online auction site for lawn mowers to provide to the user in various ways. The VMA system may then optionally send an SMS message to the caller user s mobile phone e.g. to the number from which the caller user dialed or a number known to the VMA system to be an SMS number for the caller user with some or all of the information e.g. the best price obtained from the affiliated partners. The caller user may later access the wish list provided by the VMA system e.g. via a Web site or other Web based interface provided by the VMA system and interact with the wish list in various ways e.g. view modify etc. including the added indication from the voice message and or any offers or other information obtained from affiliated partner sites.

Some examples of keywords used by associated information items stored by and actions that may be taken by an example embodiment of the VMA system are as follows 

In the example scenario of a caller user who places a call to an example embodiment of the VMA system is a registered VMA system user whose phone number and email address are previously specified to the VMA system. In contrast to the use of a general access phone number in the example scenario described with respect to the caller user in the example scenario of dials a specific phone number provided by the VMA system for use in accessing a specific category of information and or functionality in this example a specific phone number associated with a particular type of information collection such as a 425 SHOPPING phone number associated with shopping lists and then says a voice message associated with that category. The VMA system adds information from the voice message to the specific list associated with the dialed number.

In particular in the example scenario of the registered caller user calls a specific Shopping List Number e.g. 425 SHOPPING hears a welcome prompt says Milk Butter and then hangs up after hearing a confirmation. The VMA system records the voice message adds an indication of the Milk Butter information items e.g. textual representations of the item to the user s Shopping List and also in this example sends the information item indications to the user s preset partner service e.g. an online grocery service . The partner service may then ship the shopping list items to the user according to a predetermined arrangement by the user e.g. immediately as part of the next delivery etc. .

Some examples of phone numbers provided by and associated information items stored by an example embodiment of the VMA system are as follows 

In the example scenario of a caller user who places a call to an example embodiment of the VMA system is a registered VMA system user whose phone number and email address are previously specified to the VMA system. In a manner similar to that of the caller user in the example scenario of dials a general access phone number provided by the VMA system and delivers a voice message by speaking one or more information items e.g. instructions content etc. . However in this example the caller user also tags the message during the telephone call using one or more tags from a list of predefined tags e.g. tags associated with the caller user s account and or with specific lists or other information collections such as by speaking one of the tags. After the VMA system recognizes the tag it adds the one or more information items from the voice message to a specific list associated with the tag.

In particular in the example scenario of the registered caller user calls a general number provided by the VMA system. After hearing a welcome prompt the call user says Smallville DVD presses the pound sign button on his her phone says Wish List which in this example is a predefined tag associated with a wish list and hangs up after hearing a confirmation. The VMA system records the voice message automatically identifies the Smallville DVD information item from the voice message and then adds an indication of that information item to the caller user s wish list such as for later access by the caller user and or another user. In this example scenario the VMA system also shares the information item obtained from the voice message with one or more partner services e.g. online retailers auction sites etc. such as to provide information to one or more partner services. The caller user may then later visit a Web site provided by the VMA system and view the wish list which now has new information based on the caller user s voice message e.g. a textual representation of the Smallville DVD information item related offers from partner sites etc. .

In some embodiments the VMA system may further share information on a caller user s wish list with a partner service such as for that partner service to replicate the user s wish list at the partner service or to otherwise include some or all information items from the wish list on the user s wish list at the partner service. If so the caller user may also be available to access the user s wish list information from a Web site of that partner service. Alternatively in some embodiments a user s wish list information may be available to the user while the user is interacting with a partner s Web site but without the VMA system having provided the wish list information items to the partner service such as via a wish list GUI widget provided to the partner from the VMA system e.g. a small wish list window embedded in the partner s Web site which retrieves data from the VMA system .

Some examples of tags provided by and associated information items stored by an example embodiment of the VMA system are as follows 

In the example scenario illustrated in a caller user who places a call to an example embodiment of the VMA system is a registered VMA system user whose phone number and email address are previously specified to the VMA system. The caller user dials a general access phone number provided by the VMA system and leaves a voice message that includes one or more spoken information items. In this example the VMA system uses implicit techniques to categorize the voice message e.g. using human input artificial intelligence techniques etc. so as to determine a specific list to which the information items should be added and or to determine some other action to be performed regarding the information items e.g. to provide information to users that is related to the information items such as information associated with one or more affiliate sponsored keywords or phrases corresponding to one or more of the information items .

In particular in the example scenario of a caller user calls a general access phone number provided by the VMA system. After hearing a welcome prompt the caller user says Smallville DVD and hangs up after hearing a confirmation message. The VMA system records the voice message and analyzes it whether manually and or automatically to determine an appropriate category that may be associated with the spoken information item of the voice message such as to add an indication of the spoken information item to a wish list and or a shopping list e.g. based on the information item corresponding to a type of product and or service that is appropriate for a wish list and or shopping list but not corresponding to one or more types that are appropriate for other types of lists . In a manner similar to the scenarios described for after the spoken information item is categorized and added to an appropriate list additional actions may be performed in at least some embodiments such as in this example to obtain price bids from partner services e.g. one or more online retailers etc. related to the product represented by the spoken information item. The caller user may then later access the list and interact with it in various ways.

The routine begins at step where an indication is received of input to the routine e.g. voice based spoken input from a user during a telephone call or of another type of information or instruction. While not illustrated here in some embodiments if information or an instruction is received from a user the routine may further attempt to identify whether the user is a registered user or to otherwise gather information from the user related to performing actions for the user.

After step the routine continues to step to determine whether an instruction was received to define a new information collection for a user and if so continues to step to receive information regarding the new information collection being defined for an indicated user. For example information regarding a new information collection being defined for an indicated user may include a name of the information collection one or more keywords and or tags associated with the information collection one or more types of actions to take when new information items are added to the information collection and or in other indicated situations one or more information items as contents for the new information collection restrictions and or characteristics of the information collection e.g. user access restrictions size limitations etc. etc. The routine then continues to step to create the new information collection for future use by the indicated user and or others e.g. for use in steps and discussed below such as by storing information about the new information collection in a manner associated with the indicated user. In some embodiments information received at step may be provided by the indicated user and or by another party on behalf of the indicated user e.g. such as a provider of the VMA system a partner service other users etc. . In addition in some embodiments at least some of the received information may be voice based information and if so the voice based information may be analyzed for instructions and or other information items regarding the new information collection. In some embodiments at least some of the received information may be in forms other than voice based such as text based or other types of input e.g. from a user interacting with an interface to indicate information regarding a new information collection such as via an interactive Web site based user interface or a programmatic interface etc. . In addition while not illustrated here in some embodiments a user may similarly specify various information for one or more predefined lists or other information collections e.g. predefined information collections provided by the VMA system such as one or more keywords and or tags to be associated with the predefined information collection one or more types of actions to take when new information items are added to the predefined information collection and or in other indicated situations etc.

If it was instead determined in step that an instruction to define an information collection for a user is not received the routine continues instead to step to determine if a user has provided an instruction to take one or more actions regarding one or more information collections. While not illustrated here in some embodiments a party other than the user may similarly provide an instruction to take one or more actions regarding one or more information collections on behalf of a user. If it is determined in step that an instruction is provided to take one or more actions regarding one or more information collections the routine continues to step to perform the appropriate action s for the information collection s . In some embodiments one or more actions to be taken for an information collection may further be determined in other manners whether instead of or in addition to instructions provided by a user such as on the basis of the type of information collection the type of information items contained in the collection and or other criteria. After step the routine proceeds to step to optionally provide information to the user about results of the one or more performed actions e.g. to send a user email SMS instant message etc. containing information related to results of a Web search price bids for products from partners confirmation messages etc. .

If it was instead determined in step that an instruction to take one or more actions regarding one or more information collections is not provided the routine continues to step to determine if voice based spoken input is received from a user e.g. a voice message and if so then continues to step to analyze the voice based input to identify one or more information items e.g. keywords keyphrases tags other words or phrases associated with content to be added to one or more information collections etc. and to generate textual representations for any identified information items. In step the routine then determines an information collection of the user to which the identified items correspond and adds the generated textual representations to the determined information collection. Various techniques may be used to determine an information collection of the user such as by the use of a particular phone number associated with a particular information collection by the user by detecting one or more keywords phrases associated with a particular information collection spoken at the beginning or end of a voice message by other indications from the user e.g. such as responses to an IVR etc. etc. After step the routine continues to step to determine if one or more actions should be performed for the one or more identified items at the current time such as based on instructions indicated by the user in the voice based input or otherwise provided along with the information items based on previously specified instructions that are associated with the information collection etc. If so the routine continues to step to perform any appropriate other actions.

If it was instead determined in step that voice based input from a user was not received the routine continues to step to perform one or more other indicated operations as appropriate. Such operations may include for example one or more of the following registering users of the VMA system modifying an existing information collection providing access to users and or entities about prior interactions with the VMA system performing a periodic or other analysis of information items included on one or more information collections of one or more users such as for data mining purposes providing voice based interaction with an instant message service on behalf a user as discussed in greater detail elsewhere sending voice based email on behalf of a user etc. . After steps or or if it was determined in step not to perform actions for one or more identified items the. routine continues to step to determine whether to continue. If so the routine returns to step and if not continues to step and ends.
