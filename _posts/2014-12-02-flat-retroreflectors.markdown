The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 911 046 filed Dec. 3 2013 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The invention described herein was made in the performance of work under a NASA contract and is subject to the provisions of Public Law No. 96 517 35 U.S.C. 202 in which the Contractor has elected to retain title.

The present disclosure relates generally to optical devices. More particularly an example embodiment of the present invention relates to optical retroreflector devices.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure relate to optical retroreflector devices. Retroreflector devices are also referred to herein synonymously and or interchangeably as retroflectors. An example embodiment may be implemented in which a retroreflector device is fabricated using a binary lithography process on flat substrates. Retroflectors thus fabricated may be incorporated with other optical components such as optical modulators.

An example embodiment thus implements retroflectors such as those of the cat s eye type or related varieties which have a focusing lens or unit elements thereof comprising an array of various sizes and or shapes of lattice structures or unit elements thereof and are disposed over a flat substrate. The retroreflectors have high reflection efficiencies and are quickly and easily applied over a surface.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector is integrated with an optical modulator e.g. as a component of a remote transceiver and or transmitter which may be mounted on a satellite an aircraft or another vehicle or used in various other applications. The size weight form factor and other features of the retroflector allow integration with the optical modulator.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a retroreflector device. The retroreflector comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence. The retroreflector also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector further comprises an optical modulator component integrated therewith e.g. monolithically or with a hybrid technique. The modulator component is operable for performing a function as a transmitter and or a transceiver.

The modulator component may be disposed externally or internally in relation to the retroreflector device with which it is integrated. The modulator component may be operable for performing an optical modulation function which relates to amplitude modulation phase modulation and or polarization of radiation incident to the retroreflector.

In an example embodiment the lens component and or the mirror component of the retroreflector are disposed on a semiconductor substrate such as silicon. An example embodiment may implement a retroreflector device that is operable optically over a range of wavelengths corresponding to an infrared spectral range.

The semiconductor substrate may comprise a material with a high refractive index over the infrared spectral range such as silicon. A material of low refractive index at infrared wavelengths such as silicon dioxide may also be used in the retroflector.

The optical operating range of the retroreflector device comprises a range of wavelengths over which the retroreflector functions efficiently. The optical operating range relates to a parameter associated with a characteristic of the lens component and or the mirror component. The parameter of the lens and or mirror may relate to a size and or a shape of a lattice associated with one or more of the lens component or the mirror component.

The parameter of the lens and or mirror may relate to a size and or a shape of each of multiple unit elements which comprise the lattice. The retroreflector may be operable over one or more frequency ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum e.g. radio microwave Terahertz infrared visible ultraviolet and or an x ray . An example embodiment is also described in relation to a method for fabricating a retroreflector.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a flat and low profile retroreflector which reflects back a substantial portion of the incident radiation along the direction of incident.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a retroreflector which can be mass produced using conventional micro fabrication techniques and binary lithography.

The present disclosure provides a retroreflector fabricated on a flat substrate that can be readily integrated with optical components such as optical amplitude phase or polarization modulators.

In an example embodiment of the present disclosure a retroreflector comprises a flat lens and a flat mirror which are separated from each other by a spacer layer. The spacer layer is substantially transparent at the operating wavelength of the retroreflector.

In an example embodiment one or more of a lens component and or a mirror component may be implemented with a gradual change of optical parameters thereof over a one dimensional or a two dimensional periodic structure in which a quasi periodic structure is formed.

In an example embodiment an optical transceiver apparatus is implemented by integration of an optical modulator component and a photodetector component.

In an example embodiment a retroreflector device is implemented which is operable over any parts or portions of the electromagnetic spectrum including over one or more microwave Terahertz infrared visible or ultraviolet even x ray wavelength ranges.

A flat retroreflector in a cat s eye configuration focuses the light using a lens. The focused light is reflected back off a focusing flat mirror. The focusing lens is flat and is composed of a quasi periodic array of materials with high refractive index surrounded by materials of lower refractive index. The flat mirror is also composed of a quasi periodic array of materials with high index contrast compared to its surroundings.

In an example embodiment of the present disclosure a retroreflector that reflects back a portion of the incident radiation along the incident angle is composed of a lens and a mirror and at least one of them is realized using a quasi periodic array of sub wavelength elements.

In an example embodiment a retroreflector modulator transmitter and or transceiver uses and or is integrated with the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator is located outside of the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator is integrated either monolithically or using hybrid integration techniques with the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator may also comprise an integral part of the retroreflector.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector is operable in the infrared spectral range or another spectral range without limitation. In an example embodiment the retroreflector may be disposed on a semiconductor substrate such as silicon or another semiconductor.

Retroreflector devices retroreflect light. As used herein the term retroreflect relates to reflecting a significant portion of light which is incident to a retroreflector back to the source of the incident light light source . Retroreflectors are also sometimes referred to as retroflectors retroreflect as retroflect and or retroreflection as retroflection etc. and these terms may be used respectively herein as interchangeable and or synonymous. Familiar types of retroreflectors include corner cube retroflector devices and cat s eye retroflector devices.

Corner cube retroreflectors typically comprise three reflecting surfaces which are mutually perpendicular to each other. Corner cube retroflectors may thus be conceptualized by picturing reflective surfaces arrayed in a configuration not dissimilar to those of inner surfaces which contour the planar regions approaching a corner of a cube surface such as corners in a cubic prism. Corner cube retroflectors typically have high efficiencies for retroreflection over a wide range of angles of incident light e.g. angles scribed by light which is incident to the retroflector.

Corner cube retroflectors have useful applications in optics and free space optical communications. Corner cube retroflectors used in these applications are made by coating the outer surfaces of a corner made of glass or other transparent materials with a reflective material. Corner cube retroflectors may also comprise polymers and or layers of plastics which are arrayed over an assembly of multiple corner cubes used for making road signs and night safety signs which reflect light emitted by headlights searchlights or flashlights back toward its sources.

Cat s eye retroreflectors typically comprise a focusing lens and a concave mirror. Cat s eye retroflectors may be implemented with a combined telescopic lens and flat mirror approach Ref. 1 . Cat s eye retroflectors may also be implemented by coating a portion or an array of small glass beads plastic beads or micro spheres with a material when applied thereto in such a coating forms a highly reflective surface.

The beads micro spheres or the like may be embedded in a thin sheet of plastic paint or adhesive for use in retroreflective coatings. While such retroreflective coatings may be quickly and easily applied over a surface the retroreflection efficiency thereof may be limited e.g. in relation to corner cube retroflectors.

For free space communication applications a retroreflector may be integrated with an optical modulator e.g. as an optical device component of a remote transceiver and or mounted on a satellite an aircraft or another vehicle. In such applications size weight form factor and or other features may be significant to the ability of a retroreflector component to integrate with an optical modulator. Ref. 2 

Modern optical modulators may be disposed over a flat substrate e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 154 299 to Gilbreath et al. which is incorporated herein for background information. Corner cube type retroflector components are typically integrated with such optical transceivers.

However the corner cube retroreflector components typically used with such transceivers unfortunately contribute significantly to the size and weight of the integrated transceiver and retroflector assembly.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure is described in relation to a retroreflector device. The retroreflector comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence. The retroreflector also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component and or the mirror component comprise a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation.

Retroreflector devices are also referred to herein synonymously and or interchangeably as retroflectors. An example embodiment may be implemented in which a retroreflector device is fabricated using a binary lithography process on flat substrates. Retroflectors thus fabricated may be incorporated with other optical components such as optical modulators.

As used in this sense the term transparent refers to a property e.g. transmissivity of the spacer which for a frequency range over which the retroreflector is operable optically allows for transmission through spacer of substantially all light incident on a surface thereof without significant optical loss therein e.g. from absorption or reflection .

In an example embodiment the flat lens and or the flat mirror are implemented by patterning a layer of material having a high refractive index in a quasi periodic array.

As depicted in for example the lens and the mirror are implemented as a quasi periodic array realized by gradual changes introduced over diameters of circular posts which are patterned over a hexagonal lattice. Example embodiments may also be implemented with arrays comprising patterns of other types and kinds of lattice forms and or unit cell elements. In an example embodiment the flat lens and mirror may be implemented using quasi periodic structures having one dimension.

In an example embodiment the flat lens may be implemented with a first quasi periodic lattice shape and or unit cell element the flat mirror may be implemented with a second quasi periodic lattice shape and or unit cell element and the first quasi periodic lattice shape and or unit cell element may differ from the second quasi periodic lattice shape and or unit cell element. Thus the quasi periodic lattice shapes and unit cell elements used for implementing the lens may be different from the lattice shapes and unit cell elements used for implementing the mirror .

Example embodiments are implemented in which the quasi periodic structures comprise lattices of sizes that are small relative to wavelengths over the retroreflector s optical operating range which prevents or deters scattering into higher orders of diffraction and related losses or inefficiencies. The phase and amplitude of reflection and transmission of a periodically patterned layer relate to e.g. depend at least in part on the size of the lattice.

Further the reflection transmission phase and amplitude relate to the shape s and size s of the elements inside each of the unit cells. An example embodiment of the present disclosure is implemented in which parameters of the periodic e.g. quasi periodic layer change gradually.

For example depicts a top view of a quasi periodic array of posts which form a lens or mirror e.g. lens mirror according to an example embodiment. As shown in parameters of the quasi periodic layer change gradually e.g. over the circumferential contours of each of the successively concentric rings. Thus a quasi periodic structure is implemented to have local transmission and reflection phases which may be approximated by periodic structures having the same or similar parameters e.g. layer thickness lattice shape element shape size .

In an example embodiment selective adjustments made over the thickness of the periodic layer layer thickness the shape of the lattice lattice shape and or the shape and or size of each of the elements thereof element shape size implement full or partial control over the transmission or reflection amplitude or phase of a retroreflector.

The quasi periodic structure characterizing the lens implements an optical function similar to that performed by a convex lens design which thus operates to focus radiation incident thereto e.g. incident radiation . The quasi periodic structure characterizing the mirror implements an optical function similar to that performed by a concave mirror which thus operates to reflect light incident thereon toward a focal point determined by a concavity characteristic of its surface.

The focal length of the lens may approximate or be roughly equal to a radius of curvature of the concave mirror implemented by the mirror s quasi periodic structure. In an example embodiment the distance of separation between the lens and the mirror is implemented to approximately equal the focal length of the lens and thus adjusted to maximize the radiation reflected back along the incident direction.

An example embodiment is thus described in relation to a retroreflector device. The retroreflector comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence. The retroreflector also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component and or the mirror component comprise a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation.

Finite difference time domain simulation results of the set of Maxwell s equations computed for a Gaussian beam incident on a retroreflector e.g. retroflector is shown in and or .

The lens structure and or the mirror structure may be implemented with a high refractive index material such as silicon. A spacer layer which is disposed between the lens and the mirror may comprise a polymeric material such as an SU 8 or other epoxy based or viscous polymers. Retroreflector device may thus be mass produced using standard silicon micro fabrication techniques familiar to artisans skilled in related technologies.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure thus relates to an optical retroreflector device. The retroreflector device may be disposed on a semiconductor or other flat substrate. The retroreflector device comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence.

The retroreflector device also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component or the mirror component of the retroreflector comprises a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation within the operationally efficient wavelength range.

The retroreflector device also comprises a spacer component which is transparent over the operationally efficient wavelength range and disposed between the lens component and the mirror component thereof. The retroreflector may further comprise a material which has a low refractive index in relation to the operationally efficient wavelength range and is disposed over the semiconductor substrate beneath the mirror component in relation to the lens component.

Integration of the modulator device with the retroreflector device may be implemented in the optical apparatus with a separation of the modulator and retroflector devices from each other. Example embodiments may thus be implemented in which the modulator device is placed outside in relation to the flat retroreflector device in which the modulator is fabricated on top of the lens layer e.g. using a monolithic integration platform or a hybrid integration platform .

An example embodiment may also be implemented in which the modulator is between the lens and the mirror. An example embodiment may be implemented in which the modulator is combined with the lens combined with the transparent spacer layer or combined with the mirror in such that the transparent layer or the low refractive index layer is operable to perform the modulation functionality in situ.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure thus relates to an optical apparatus. The optical apparatus comprises a retroreflector device disposed on a flat substrate having a high refractive index in relation to a range of frequencies over which the optical apparatus is efficient operationally. The apparatus retroreflector device comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence.

The retroreflector device also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component or the mirror component of the retroreflector comprises a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation within the operationally efficient wavelength range.

The apparatus retroreflector device also comprises a spacer component which is transparent over the operationally efficient wavelength range and disposed between the lens component and the mirror component thereof. The retroreflector may further comprise a material which has a low refractive index in relation to the operationally efficient wavelength range and is disposed over the semiconductor substrate beneath the mirror component in relation to the lens component.

The optical apparatus also comprises an optical modulator transceiver or transmitter device integrated with the retroreflector device and operable over the operationally efficient wavelength range for performing one or more of amplitude phase or polarization related modulation of the incident radiation. The optical modulator device may be integrated with the retroreflector device monolithically or using hybrid integration. The modulator may be disposed externally in relation to the retroflector or internally e.g. within the transparent spacer or low index components .

Example embodiments of the present disclosure may implement retroreflectors operable over one or more wavelength ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum without restriction. A flat retroreflector may thus be implemented to be operable in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

One or more operational features with which an example embodiment may be implemented may be described in relation to computations executed using Maxwell s equations. Operating wavelength s and wavelength ranges as well as geometrical dimensions and related characteristics of the flat retroreflectors of example embodiments are fully scalable with full operational functionality.

Example embodiments are implemented using materials selected for the substrate mirror spacer and lens layer components which allow the retroreflector they comprise to operate in or over one or more wavelength ranges. The wavelength ranges may correspond to one or more of radio microwave Terahertz infrared visible or ultraviolet even x ray regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In step a lens component is disposed on the semiconductor substrate. In step a mirror component is disposed on the semiconductor substrate. Step and or step may comprise at least in part a step in which a quasi periodic array such as a lattice of elements is disposed on the semiconductor array. Each of the elements of the array is smaller in its dimensions than wavelengths characterizing the range of optical operability of the retroreflector.

In step a decision is made relative to whether the retroreflector device will include a spacer component. If so then in step an optically transparent spacer such as an epoxy based polymer e.g. SU 8 or another transparent polymeric material is disposed between the mirror component and the lens component on the substrate. The spacer may be added before the lens for example if the mirror is disposed on the substrate before the lens. Thus steps and may precede step .

An example embodiment may also be implemented in which the lens is disposed on the substrate before the mirror and or the spacer. Upon disposition of the transparent spacer between the lens and the mirror or if no spacer is to be added e.g. per step then in step a decision is made in relation to whether an optical modulator device is to be integrated with the retroreflector. If so then in step an optical modulator is integrated with the retroreflector.

The optical modulator may comprise a transmitter and or a transceiver device which is operable optically for performing amplitude modulation phase modulation and or polarization modulation. Example embodiments may be implemented in which the optical modulator is integrated externally in relation to the retroreflector device or internally thereto e.g. within the transparent spacer or a low index material which is disposed beneath the mirror in relation to the substrate .

Upon integration of the modulator or if no modulator is to be integrated e.g. per step then process may be complete. Example embodiments maybe implemented in which additional process steps characterize process . For example a low refractive index material may be disposed between the mirror and the substrate. Other steps may relate to epitaxy microlithography chemical and or mechanical treatment electrical connection packaging and or backend processes etc.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure has thus been described in relation to a process for fabricating an optical retroreflector device. The fabrication process may relate to disposing a retroreflector device on a silicon based substrate or another semiconductor substrate. In an example embodiment the process for fabricating the retroreflector device may relate to a binary lithography process implemented over a flat substrate surface. Retroflectors thus fabricated may be integrated with other optical components such as optical modulators.

An example embodiment is described in relation to a retroreflector that can be mass produced using conventional micro fabrication techniques and binary lithography. The proposed retroreflector has a low profile and weight is fabricated on a flat substrate and can be readily integrated with other components such as optical modulators. As described above a retroreflector is implemented to comprise a flat lens and a flat mirror separated from each other by a transparent spacer layer. The lens and the mirror comprise high contrast gratings and are implemented by gradually changing the geometrical parameters of a two dimensional periodic structure Ref. 3 4 .

The periodic structure is patterned on a layer of material with high refractive index surrounded by lower refractive index materials. The lens and the mirror realized by gradually changing the diameters of circular silicon posts arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The retroreflector may comprise periodic structures made of silicon posts arranged in a hexagonal lattice and resting on a 5 um thick silicon dioxide membrane. To find the phase and amplitude of reflection and transmission coefficients for a plane wave incident normal to such a periodic structure example numerical simulations compute a rigorous coupled mode analysis.

Using this periodic structure an example embodiment implements a parabolic phase mask which focuses the light similar to a convex lens. A similar plot shows the reflection amplitude and phase of the same example periodic structure but with a different post height of h 0.7 m. This periodic structure is mostly reflective and the reflection phase spans a full 2 range. As seen with reference to plot the reflectivity goes down around the duty cycle value of 75 .

An example embodiment is implemented in which duty cycles close to that range are excluded and in which a reflective phase mask behaves as a concave mirror with a focal length of f m 20 m. The focal length of the lens f l 40 m is roughly equal to the radius of curvature of the concave mirror. The separation between the lens and the mirror d 38.5 m is approximately equal to the focal length of the lens and is adjusted to maximize the optical power reflected back along the incident direction. Light is focused by the lens at the mirror s plane and is reflected back by the mirror along the incident angle.

An example embodiment has thus been described in relation to a retroreflector device. The retroreflector comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence. The retroreflector also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component and or the mirror component comprise a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector further comprises a modulator component integrated therewith e.g. monolithically or with a hybrid technique. The modulator component is operable for performing a function as a transmitter and or a transceiver. The modulator component may be disposed externally or internally in relation to the retroreflector device with which it is integrated. The modulator component may be operable for performing a modulation function which relates to amplitude modulation phase modulation and or polarization.

In an example embodiment the lens component and or the mirror component are disposed on a semiconductor substrate such as silicon. An example embodiment may implement a retroreflector device that is operable optically over a range of wavelengths corresponding to an infrared spectral range. The flat substrate.

The optical operating range of the retroreflector device comprises a range of wavelengths over which the retroreflector functions efficiently. The optical operating range relates to a parameter characteristic of the lens component and or the mirror component. The parameter of the lens and or mirror may relate to a size and or a shape of a lattice associated with the one or more of the lens component or the mirror component.

The parameter of the lens and or mirror may relate to a size and or a shape of each of multiple unit elements which comprise the lattice. The retroreflector may be operable over one or more frequency ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum e.g. radio microwave Terahertz infrared visible ultraviolet and or an x ray . An example embodiment is also described in relation to a method for fabricating a retroreflector.

A flat retroreflector in a cat s eye configuration focuses the light using a lens. The focused light is reflected back off a focusing flat mirror. The focusing lens is flat and is composed of a quasi periodic array of materials with high refractive index surrounded by materials of lower refractive index. The flat mirror is also composed of a quasi periodic array of materials with high index contrast compared to its surroundings.

In an example embodiment of the present disclosure a retroreflector that reflects back a portion of the incident radiation along the incident angle and is composed of a lens and a mirror that at least one of them is realized using a quasi periodic array of sub wavelength elements.

In an example embodiment a retroreflector modulator transmitter and or transceiver uses and or is integrated with the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator is located outside of the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator is integrated either monolithically or using hybrid integration techniques with the retroreflector. In an example embodiment the modulator may also comprise an integral part of the retroreflector.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector is operable in the infrared spectral range or another spectral range without limitation. In an example embodiment the retroreflector may be disposed on a semiconductor substrate such as silicon or another semiconductor.

An example embodiment of the present disclosure has also been described in relation to an optical apparatus. The optical apparatus comprises a retroreflector device disposed on a semiconductor substrate having a high refractive index in relation to a range of frequencies over which the optical apparatus is efficient operationally. The apparatus retroreflector device comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence.

The retroreflector device also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component or the mirror component of the retroreflector comprises a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation within the operationally efficient wavelength range.

The apparatus retroreflector device also comprises a spacer component which is transparent over the operationally efficient wavelength range and disposed between the lens component and the mirror component thereof. The retroreflector may further comprise a material which has a low refractive index in relation to the operationally efficient wavelength range and is disposed over the semiconductor substrate beneath the mirror component in relation to the lens component.

The optical apparatus also comprises an optical modulator transceiver or transmitter device integrated with the retroreflector device and operable over the operationally efficient wavelength range for performing one or more of amplitude phase or polarization related modulation of the incident radiation. The optical modulator device may be integrated with the retroreflector device monolithically or using hybrid integration. The modulator may be disposed externally in relation to the retroflector or internally e.g. within the transparent spacer or low index components .

An example embodiment thus implements retroflectors such as those of the cat s eye type or related varieties which have a focusing lens or unit elements thereof comprising an array of various sizes and or shapes of lattice structures or unit elements thereof and are disposed over a semiconductor substrate. The retroreflectors have high reflection efficiencies and are quickly and easily applied over a surface.

In an example embodiment the retroreflector is integrated with an optical modulator e.g. as a component of a remote transceiver and or transmitter which may be mounted on a satellite an aircraft or another vehicle or used in various other applications. The size weight form factor and other features of the retroflector allow integration with the optical modulator.

Thus example embodiments of the present disclosure have been described in relation to a retroreflector device. The retroreflector comprises a lens component operable for focusing radiation which is incident thereto at an angle of incidence. The retroreflector also comprises a mirror component operable for reflecting the radiation focused by the lens component back along the angle of incidence. The lens component and or the mirror component comprise a quasi periodic array of elements each of which comprises a dimension smaller than a wavelength of the radiation.

Example embodiments of the present disclosure are thus described in relation to retroreflectors. In the foregoing specification example embodiments have been described with reference to numerous specific details that may vary from one implementation to another.
