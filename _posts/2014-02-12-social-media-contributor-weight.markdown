No. 12 789 715 filed on May 28 2010 which claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61 346 394 filed on May 19 2010 and of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 035 286 filed on Feb. 25 2011 the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

Recent years have seen an explosion in the popularity and availability of social media platforms such as social networking applications web logs blogs message boards interactive news websites photo sharing sites etc. Social media allows users to interact with one another such as by posting new content and or by posting reactions to content posted by others. As such social media platforms provide users with forums in which to engage in conversations with one another.

The wealth of data embodying sentiment and opinion that exists on social media platforms is of great value to companies that wish to understand potential customers to gauge public sentiment regarding particular brands to detect social trends and or to otherwise understand target customer demographics. Further wealth of data embodying sentiment and opinion that exists on social media offers the opportunity to influence public sentiment and creates demand for new tools focused on gathering and interpreting this valuable data. A single social media platform may include millions of posts organized into many different threads and posted by a combination of millions of different users. In many cases conversations started on one platform may spill over onto another different users may have different audiences levels of influence multiple usernames or multiple accounts posts may express different sentiments or may be of varying levels of interest etc. Many types of businesses stand to benefit greatly from tools for gathering and understanding social media data.

A system and method is disclosed for measuring social media. Content posted by a user on one or more social media platforms is identified. The identifying the content posted by the user includes searching the one or more social media platforms for content posted by the user with identifying information. Downstream content associated with the content posted by the user is identified. Metrics measuring a contributor weight of the user based on the downstream content are calculated.

While the invention is described herein by way of example for several embodiments and illustrative drawings those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention is not limited to the embodiments or drawings described. It should be understood that the drawings and detailed description hereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed but on the contrary the invention is to cover all modifications equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims. Any headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not meant to limit the scope of the description or the claims. As used herein the word may is used in a permissive sense e.g. meaning having the potential to rather than the mandatory sense e.g. meaning must . Similarly the words include including and includes mean including but not limited to.

Social media marketers use various tools to monitor content on social media platforms and to thereby gauge and influence consumer sentiment. For example given a keyword or phrase such tools may retrieve content e.g. posts that contains the given keyword or phrase from various social media platforms. Posts that include a given keyword or phrase of interest may be referred to herein as directly relevant.

However directly relevant content represents only a fraction of the overall relevant content. This is due to the conversational nature of social media discussions. Directly relevant posts which contain the keyword s of interest may be only the start of much larger conversations. For example users may post replies to directly relevant posts as well as replies to those replies and so forth. Such response chains may sometimes spill onto multiple social media platforms creating even more relevant content. Therefore by capturing only content that directly mentions a given keyword or phrase traditional social media marketing ignores downstream content that is still relevant to the keyword s of interest even if it does not mention the keyword s directly.

According to various embodiments a social media measurement tool may be configured to receive keywords e.g. one or more supplied words or phrases from a user and in response to identify gather aggregate and or analyze social media data that is relevant to the keywords from one or more social media platforms including both directly relevant and downstream content. As used herein the term directly relevant content may refer to content that includes one or more given keywords identified as relevant while the term downstream content may refer to content that is conversationally relevant to the directly relevant content e.g. replies to relevant content replies to those replies content referencing other relevant content etc. which in some cases may not include the one or more given keywords.

Embodiments further enable users of social media measurement tools to identify contributor weight or influence in social media. By analyzing content hosted on social media platforms users of a social media measurement tool identify individual users who exhibit particular influence over the discussion of particular topics on a single social media platform or multiple platforms or identify users who are generally influential in a particular social media platform. Using these measures of contributor weight the sentiment of influential users is monitored in some embodiments and communications are targeted to influential users in some embodiments. Use of these measures of contributor weight is also used in some embodiments to assess the commercial value of communications target to those users.

In the illustrated embodiment social media platform may be independent of social media platform . That is each platform may be autonomously administered by different entities e.g. different companies and may or may not share content or interact with one another.

In the illustrated embodiment social media platform includes content and one or more web applications configured to access the content. Content may include various user generated content e.g. posts replies user generated metadata e.g. relationships among users post ratings system generated metadata e.g. usage statistics analytics data etc. and possibly other information.

In various embodiments content may be stored in one or more databases on one or more computers of a compute cluster datacenter and or any other hardware configuration. In some embodiments social media platform may include various internal APIs e.g. RDBMS software libraries etc. for internal access to content by one or more web applications .

As used herein the term web application refers to any software program and or logic accessible by one or more clients from over a network. For example in some embodiments web applications may include code executable to implement a social networking website e.g. Facebook that a client e.g. clients may access from across a network e.g. network via a browser interface e.g. browser interface that is configured to receive HTTP requests from a browser executing on a client. In some such embodiments the social networking website application may be configured to respond to client requests by sending HTML to the corresponding client via browser interface .

In some embodiments a social media platform such as may include various other web applications and or interfaces . For example client may be executing a mobile application e.g. an application on a mobile phone that is configured to access a mobile platform specific web application of via a mobile platform specific interface such as interface . Similarly interfaces may include one or more rich client interfaces e.g. web API interfaces e.g. and or other interfaces. In various embodiments different web applications may expose multiple interfaces of one or more types to clients from over the network.

As shown in different social media platforms may service different and or overlapping sets of users. For example while clients and are users of social media platform client uses only social media platform . However client interacts with both social media platforms.

According to various embodiments social media measurement tool may access retrieve aggregate and or analyze social media content e.g. stored on one or more social media platforms . For example in some embodiments social media measurement tool may be configured to query social media platform via web API such as a web services interface to retrieve content relevant to a given keyword or phrase of interest. As used herein the term keywords refers to any word phrase or other logical combination of words phrases such as those including negations AND OR exclusive OR regular expressions etc.

In some embodiments Web API interface may be implemented as a web service that uses one or more protocols such as Representational State Transfer REST or Simple Object Access Protocol SOAP to exchange messages with clients such as social media measurement tool . In some embodiments social media measurement tool may be configured to access content via other interfaces such as browser interface .

According to the illustrated embodiment social media measurement tool may gather data from both social media platforms and . Social media platform may include any or all of the components depicted in social media platform including respective content one or more web applications and one or more interfaces to those web applications. In various embodiments social media measurement tool may access each of the social media platforms using the same or different types of interfaces. For example if social media platform includes a robust Web API interface such as while social media platform includes only a browser interface social media measurement tool may be configured to utilize the appropriate respective interface for accessing each platform.

According to the illustrated embodiment social media content may be arranged into multiple conversational threads such as threads . Each thread may comprise any number of user posts where each post includes some content such as text pictures video audio and or other types of multimedia. As used herein the term post may be used to refer both to independent posts e.g. and and to reply posts e.g. which are posted in response to other posts. As illustrated in thread replies in a given thread may be arbitrarily deep. As indicated in each post may contain some content generated by and attributable to a corresponding user of the social media platform. For example post is a textual comment posted by user1.

As indicated in posts on a social media platform may be associated with respective metadata such as metadata . In various embodiments such metadata may include system generated metadata e.g. author of the post time date of the post relationships between posts and or user specified metadata e.g. relationships between posts rating or flagging of the content in a post etc. . For example metadata may include indications that reply post is a reply to post and was posted at a given date time. In addition metadata may include an indication that User4 is the author of the post such as by associating post with a unique identifier corresponding to User4. Metadata may indicate the number of times that a post has been viewed or provide a listing of users having viewed or forwarded the post. System generated metadata may further include location identifiers e.g. URLs for similar e.g. by keyword analysis or identical e.g. forwarded or copied content.

In various embodiments users of social media platform may determine the author of a given post by viewing various identifying information about the author such as a unique username a not necessarily screen name a picture and or other information. In different embodiments different information identifying the author of each post may be programmatically available via different interfaces such as a Web API.

In some situations a user of the social media platform may author numerous posts which may appear in one or more threads. For example in the illustrated embodiment User4 is the author of both reply post and of post which appear in threads and respectively.

In many situations a user may participate in numerous social media platforms. For example in the illustrated embodiment User4 participates in both social media platform and . However a given user may sometimes have different identifying information across different social media platforms e.g. different username . Therefore it may be difficult to recognize when two posts on two different platforms e.g. posts and on platforms and respectively are authored by the same person. According to various embodiments the social media measurement tool may leverage various user stitching techniques described herein to ascertain that posts on multiple different social media platforms are actually authored by the same person and or entity.

In some embodiments content in one post may reference another post. For example post on social media platform includes a URL that points to post on social media platform . In some situations a user that embeds a URL in a post e.g. post may use a URL miniaturization service to reduce the length of the URL. An embedded URL may refer to another post on a different social media platform as post refers to post to a post on a different thread of the same social media platform or even to another post on the same thread.

In traditional social media data mining an interested party e.g. a marketer may search a given platform for one or more keywords and find posts that directly include that keyword. For example a marketer wishing to learn more about Dave s Taxi may query social media platform for that business name. Using traditional search tools the marketer may find only directly relevant content e.g. only posts that contain the search phrase Dave s Taxi such as post . However such traditional tools may ignore relevant downstream content such as replies and post and its replies and or potentially post .

Embodiments further enable users of social media measurement tools to identify contributor weight or influence in social media on one or more of several varied metrics. For example some embodiments identify contributor weight in terms of the number of replies to a post by a contributor. In the example portrayed with respect to a scoring system based on the number of replies to a post by a contributor identifies the influence of user1 based on the number of replies to post . Likewise some embodiments identify contributor weight in terms of the number of distinct users replying to a post by a contributor. In the example portrayed with respect to a scoring system based on the number of users replying to a post by a contributor identifies the influence of user1 based on the number of users replying to post . Similarly some embodiments identify contributor weight in terms of the sentiment of replies to a post by a contributor. In the example portrayed with respect to a scoring system based on the sentiment of replies to a post by a contributor identifies the influence of user1 based on the number of users replying in agreement to post . As is discussed below both with respect to and elsewhere embodiments accommodate other metrics. One of skill in the art will readily realize in light of having read the present disclosure that embodiments accommodate metrics for assessing contributor weight other than those listed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Further in some embodiments metrics used to identify contributor weight are user configurable.

According to the illustrated embodiment method begins by receiving one or more keywords as in . In some embodiments the keywords may be input by the user retrieved from another system or be determined automatically as described below in relation to method . For example the user may enter initial keywords of interest in such as keywords that represent certain products or brands keywords that represent marketing posts or press releases or other keywords of interest. In some embodiments such manual entry may include the user specifying logical operations for combining a plurality of keywords e.g. AND OR NOT etc. . These words may be of interest for various reasons e.g. a company name keywords that the user has bid on or is considering bidding on in an advertisement server environment etc. .

In other embodiments the tool may receive the keywords in from another software application. For example a user may bid on one or more keywords in an advertisement server environment using a bid management system e.g. see . As part of various facilities to assist the user in selecting and or evaluating one or more keywords the bid management system may be configured to programmatically invoke the social media measurement tool for example via a Web API interface. As part of this invocation the social media measurement tool may receive one or more keywords from the bid management system on which the user is bidding. This receiving may correspond to the receiving step of . In further embodiments keywords received in may be supplied by various other means.

According to the illustrated embodiment after receiving the one or more keywords the social media measurement tool may search one or more social media platforms for directly relevant content. For example the tool may invoke various interfaces of different social media platforms e.g. one or more of interfaces to query the respective platforms for posts that include the keywords received in . The social media measurement tool may query different platforms using different interfaces depending on the interfaces made available by each platform. By querying for keywords in the tool is able to retrieve directly relevant content from the one or more queried sites.

In some embodiments the measurement tool may allow a user to specify the social media platforms that the tool should search for content. For example the social media measurement tool may present a user with a list of platforms. In some embodiments a programmatic interface of the social media measurement tool may include parameters indicating the social media platforms that the tool should search.

Once the tool has gathered directly relevant social media content from the one or more platforms as in for the keywords received in the tool may use the directly relevant content to identify relevant downstream content as in . In various embodiments the measurement tool may use metadata associated with the relevant posts and or metadata e.g. metadata corresponding to the relevant posts to identify relevant downstream content.

For example suppose that the keywords received in include the keywords Dave s Taxi . In this case if the tool searches social platform of for the given keywords the tool may determine in that post includes directly relevant content. Subsequently the measurement tool may also determine in that posts and comprise relevant downstream content since both posts are responses to directly relevant post . In some embodiments the measurement tool may determine that posts and are relevant downstream content by examining respective metadata corresponding to posts and or . Such metadata may disclose the reply relationship between the posts. In other embodiments the tool may examine metadata associated with thread and or other metadata in the system to discover the relationship between posts and .

Similarly the tool may also determine that post comprises relevant downstream content since post is a reply to relevant post . Thus post may be considered a second level reply to post since a reply path exists from post to post to post . In various embodiments the social media measurement tool may consider any post on a reply path from another relevant post to itself be relevant. The set of all reply paths from a given post may be referred to herein as the reply tree of the given post.

In some embodiments the measurement tool may use the content and or metadata of relevant posts to identify new keywords and then search the one or more social media platforms for content directly related to the newly determined keywords. Using this technique the measurement tool may identify content that may be considered a reply to other relevant content and therefore itself relevant. For example since post references post posts and may be considered a single reply path. Therefore if the social media measurement tool determines that post comprises directly relevant content then it may also determine that both posts and comprise relevant downstream content. The technique of identifying that posts from across different threads are part of a single reply path may be referred to herein as conversation threading.

According to the illustrated embodiment method begins by identifying at least some relevant content from one or more social media platforms as in . For example the tool may identify a post containing content that is directly relevant to a given one or more keywords and then identify some relevant downstream data such as posts in the reply tree of the directly relevant post. In this initial iteration the downstream posts may be in the same thread as the directly relevant post.

According to method the measurement tool may then create a collection of keywords from the identified relevant content as in . In some embodiments the measurement tool may create a separate respective collection of keywords for each post identified as relevant. For example for a given relevant post the corresponding collection of keywords may include the metadata elements from the post such as a post title the author identifier the author screen name the social media platform and or other information usable to identify the given post.

In some embodiments the collection of keywords created in for a given post may include one or more URLs at which the given post may be accessed. In some circumstances a given post may be accessible via multiple URLs each of which may be included in the collection of keywords created by the measurement tool in for the post. In some embodiments the measurement tool may utilize one or more URL miniaturization services e.g. tinyurl.com bit.ly is.gd etc. and or URL miniaturization algorithms to generate miniaturized forms of one or more of the URLs and include the miniaturized forms of the URLs in the collection of keywords.

In some embodiments the collection of keywords may include one or more words from the content of the post itself. For example if the post includes various unique and or otherwise interesting keywords the tool may add those words to the collection of keywords for the post. For example if the text of a given relevant post includes a full or miniaturized URL this URL may be added to the collection of keywords for the post. In some embodiments the measurement tool may consider content posted at such a URL to be relevant downstream content.

After generating a keyword collection for an identified relevant post the measurement tool may search one or more social media platforms for the keywords in the collection as in . Thus the measurement tool may identify additional potential downstream content that may be relevant to the content identified in . For example consider the content of . If the measurement tool receives the keywords Dave s Taxi it may determine in that post contains directly relevant content and that post contains relevant downstream content. In the tool may create a collection of keywords corresponding to post which may include a URL at which post can be accessed and one or more miniature versions of that URL. For example one miniaturized version of the URL might be http url.com xyz . In the measurement tool may search social media platforms and for keywords in this collection including the URLs and miniaturized URLs . Since post includes the miniaturized URL the measurement tool may identify post as a part of a reply path from post and therefore as potential downstream data that may be relevant.

In another example some social media platforms e.g. Twitter may associate each user with a respective audience of users to which the user can broadcast content. These may be referred to herein as audience based platforms. In such platforms if the user broadcasts content to his audience users in the audience may have the option to view the content. Such platforms may allow a user to rebroadcast content that the user received from another user e.g. re Tweet . In some embodiments by performing the search of the tool may identify forwarded content as potentially relevant.

In the measurement tool may filter the potential relevant downstream content to determine relevant downstream content. In various embodiments the filtering step of may include checking whether various exclusion conditions are met such as by analyzing metadata and or content of the potentially relevant posts. For example in some embodiments if the potentially relevant post is associated with metadata indicating that it was posted at an earlier date time than was the relevant content identified in then this potentially relevant post may be filtered e.g. excluded from the content identified in . Such rules may be arbitrarily complex for example the tool may be configured to filter out a potentially relevant post with an earlier date time as in the example above unless relevant content directly references the post e.g. includes a URL to the post . In different embodiments various other exclusion criteria and or combinations may be used to filter the content in .

Once additional relevant downstream content has been identified in the measurement tool may decide whether to continue to recursively search for yet more downstream data. For example if one or more stop conditions are not met as indicated by the negative exit from the method may include performing steps for the newly identified downstream content as indicated by the feedback loop from to . In such cases the method includes creating new collections of keywords for the additional content as in searching the one or more social media platforms for these keywords to identify potential downstream content as in and filtering the potential downstream content according to one or more exclusion rules as in .

In different embodiments the measurement tool may use different stop conditions to perform the decision of . For example in some embodiments the recursive search e.g. feedback loop of to may continue until no new relevant downstream content is identified in or until the tool has performed a maximum number of iterations of the feedback loop. In some embodiments the measurement tool may continue to execute iterations of the loop for each reply path until the reply path has reached a maximum length or no more relevant content is found. In various embodiments a user of the measurement tool may specify any of these or other criteria.

When the stop conditions of are met as indicated by the affirmative exit from the measurement tool may calculate values for one or more metrics based on the relevant content as in . Step may correspond to in . For example in the measurement tool may calculate one or more metric values for each post in the identified content. In some embodiments the measurement tool may calculate metrics for various possibly overlapping groups of posts such as all posts in a given thread all posts in a given reply path all posts in a given reply tree all forwards of a given post all direct replies to a given post and or for any other grouping.

Some examples of possible metrics are listed below. In various embodiments the measurement tool may calculate respective values for one or more of these metrics for each post and or for each group of posts 

According to the illustrated embodiment method begins by searching one or more social media platforms to identify content posted by a given user as in . For example the measurement tool may utilize various interfaces e.g. interfaces to find content posted by a user with particular identifying information e.g. a given username screen name and or other identifying information .

In some embodiments the measurement tool may receive the identifying information as direct input from a user of the system while in others the tool may automatically determine identifying information from various posts. For example if the tool is attempting to determine the contributor weight of a given post and the social media platform makes the screen name of the author available via a query interface the tool may attempt in to identify other content posted by an author with the same screen name. More detail regarding how the tool may identify content that was posted by the same user on different social media platforms e.g. user stitching are discussed below with regard to .

According to the illustrated embodiment the tool may then use the identified content to identify various downstream content as in . The tool may then use the identified content and or downstream content to calculate metrics measuring a contributor weight as in . The process of identifying contributor weight discussed above with respect to method may be performed iteratively. For example a social media measurement tool may identify relevant content as in method above and then perform the steps of method to determine contributor weight for each of the contributors identified as providing content in method .

In various embodiments the weight of a given user may be dependent on the values of various metrics including any of those listed above for measuring posts and or groups of posts. For example the tool may calculate values for any of the metrics listed above for any one or more posts posted by the user and or for reply trees from those posts. For example some metrics on which a contributor weight may be dependent may include one or more of 

Thus by performing method the social media measurement tool may measure a general contributor weight for a given contributor or a weight for the given contributor within a given subject area e.g. taxis based either in whole or at least in part on downstream content. Marketers may use such contributor weight calculations to identify influential contributors and to assess the importance of various posts when posting their own comment e.g. posting replies presenting advertising content on social media platforms or measuring sentiment on social media platforms.

As discussed above the measurement tool may be configured to calculate contributor weights based on data gathered from one or more social media platforms e.g. in . However identifying content posted by the same person across multiple social media platforms may present special challenges because the same person may use different aliases screen names or user names across different platforms.

In some embodiments the social media measurement tool may utilize statistical inference techniques to determine that two users on two different platforms are actually the same user. Such techniques may be referred to herein as user stitching. For example in some embodiments the tool may start by receiving the identity of a given user on a first social media platform. The tool may then use various interfaces of the platform to retrieve a profile for that user from the first platform. The profile may include different personal information about the user such as the user s actual name physical address affiliated networks and or organizations interests photographs and or other personally identifying profile data.

According to various embodiments the tool may then search a second social networking platform s for the user name and or for various other combinations of data retrieved from the profile information e.g. real name and home city . In some embodiments for each match the tool may retrieve the matching user s profile from the second social media platform and compare various elements of that profile with those of the profile retrieved from the first social media platform. The tool may then utilize various statistical inference techniques for determining a probability that the matching user from the second social media platform is actually the same person as the user on the first social media platform.

In some embodiments the tool may iteratively adjust these probabilities based on profiles found on other social networking platforms. For example if the tool matches a first user account from a first platform with a second user account from a second platform but the two user accounts list different screen names in their respective profiles then the tool may assign the match a first probability. However if a subsequent search finds a third user account on a third platform where the third user account is a high probability match for the first user account but has the same screen name as the second user account the tool may revise upward the match probability of the first and second user accounts.

In various embodiments the tool may perform various searches based on different combinations of user profile information. The searches that the tool performs may be dependent on the particular elements available in each profile the number of matches found the probabilities and or other stop conditions.

In some embodiments the measurement tool may be configured to determine that two user accounts belong to the same person if the tool calculates the matching probability between the two accounts to be above a given threshold. In some embodiments a user of the social media measurement tool may specify this threshold.

Social media platforms are then searched to identify content posted by the identified profiles . Content posted by the user that is relevant to a selected keyword is then identified . In some embodiments a social media measurement tool may optionally filter the content identified in according to one or more keywords. In some embodiments a user of the measurement tool may supply such keywords to enable the tool to determine contributor weight based only on content that pertains to a given field or topic. For example if the user wishes to determine contributor weight in a given subject e.g. taxi services the user may supply one or more keywords that are indicative of that subject e.g. taxi taxi OR cab etc. and in the measurement tool filters the posts identified in according to those keywords such that posts that do not meet the specified keyword criteria are excluded. In some alternative embodiments content is first identified for keyword relevance and users are then identified from the content identified for keyword relevance. Further the content posted by the user on the one or more social media platforms that is relevant to the keyword may not contain the keyword and in some embodiments the identifying content that is relevant to the keyword includes identifying the content that is relevant to the keyword based on a connection to downstream content in which the keyword appears.

According to the illustrated embodiment the tool may then use the identified content to identify various downstream content by identifying one or more posts in the reply trees of content posted by a user . Characteristics of the downstream content such as the metrics discussed above with respect to and are calculated . A user is scored i.e. assigned a contributor weight based on the characteristics i.e. metrics calculated in . The user is then ranked against other users based on scores for contributor weight . In some embodiments ranking the user against other users includes identifying keywords with respect to which the user has particular weight. Likewise a user may be ranked against other users on contributor weight with respect to a set of keywords. Communications are then initiated based on the rankings . Some embodiments target communications to or monitor postings by contributors with high contributor weight.

Metrics based on forwarding and quotation behavior as discussed above are calculated for posts by a user. Examples include forwards discussed above with respect to . Examples further include forwarding velocity as discussed above with respect to . Metrics based on contributor weight of downstream contributors as discussed above are calculated for posts by a user. Examples include average influential followers discussed above with respect to . Metrics based on keyword presence in downstream content as discussed above are calculated for posts by a user. Thus in some embodiments calculating the metrics measuring a contributor weight includes calculating metrics measuring a contributor weight of the user based on the downstream content containing a particular keyword. In some embodiments the degree to which downstream users write posts with selected keywords may be measured and used as a metric for assessing contributor influence.

Metrics based on audience engagement as discussed above are calculated for posts by a user. Examples include audience engagement discussed above with respect to . Examples further include audience audience contribution and audience interest as discussed above with respect to . Metrics based on affinity connections as discussed above are calculated for a user. Examples include number of connections and influence scores of those connections.

For purposes of clarity the embodiment illustrated in is explained assuming that each component measurement tool ad server web server and clients is executing on a different respective computer and that the computers are configured to communicate with one another over a network. The arrows connecting the illustrated components signify communications any of which may take place across one or more networks e.g. Internet LAN WAN etc. . However given the benefit of this disclosure those skilled in the art will recognize that in different embodiments various ones of the components depicted in may be executing on the same or different physical or virtual machines.

According to some embodiments web server may be configured to serve web pages to clients e.g. over a network. For example web server may be configured to implement an e commerce website where clients may browse and purchase products. The web server may be configured to serve content at least in part by executing various components and or applications such as recommendation engine and internal search system . Such components may be implemented as components of a web application or as separate components. During operation each of recommendation engine and internal search system may query or otherwise interact with social media measurement tool to obtain social media measurements during the course of their operation.

Consider for example recommendation engine . Many companies use recommendation engines such as to provide applicable recommendations to users. Such recommendations may traditionally be based on the items the user has already purchased or viewed taking into account correlations the company has observed between purchases made by other users. However traditional approaches are limited in that correlations are only built on local data which may be biased by site configuration and or may be insufficient for making meaningful recommendations.

According to various embodiments a recommendation engine such as may be configured to communicate with social media measurement tool to gain insight into social media trends and thereby recommend related products or to recommend products based on the identify of a user. For example in some embodiments an administrator of the recommendation system may associate one or more keywords with each product available for sale on the e commerce site. When the recommendation engine needs to determine one or more products to recommend but lacks sufficient data with which to form such a recommendation the engine may query the social media measurement tool for data relevant to each of the keywords associated with different possible products. In response the measurement tool may collect and analyze social media data related to each of the keywords and send such data metrics or analysis to the recommendation engine. The recommendation engine may use the received data to determine which product to recommend. For example in some embodiments the recommendation engine may calculate a buzz score for each keyword or collection of keywords associated with each product. The recommendation engine may then use these metrics to calculate a buzz score for each product and recommend the products with the top buzz scores. Alternatively if a user is identified as an influencer with respect to a particular line of products based on social media metrics a product in that line may be recommended to the user or offered at a steep discount.

In some embodiments the web server or a different web server may include an internal search system such as . Websites often include internal search functionality that allows users to enter a keyword or phrase and be presented with a list of search results e.g. content from the website that are related to the given keyword or phrase. The order in which these results are displayed may influence which result the user will select and therefore affects which section of the site the user will visit. It may be desirable for an internal search system such as to present the results in an order that will drive the most conversion e.g. most sales on the site. Thus results may be presented based on a listing of keywords with respect to which the user has particular influence and likely has considerable interest and pricing may be adjusted to reflect that interest.

According to various embodiments an internal search system such as may query social media measurement tool to determine social media trends which the search system may use in determining an order for presenting search results. In some embodiments this process may be similar to that used by the recommendation engine. For example an administrator of the internal search system may associate one or more respective keywords with different sections of the web site e.g. with each page group of web pages portion of a web page etc. . When a user performs a search the internal search system may retrieve the search results determine the keywords associated with each retrieved result and query the measurement tool to determine the respective levels of popularity regarding each set of keywords. The internal search system may then present the search results to the user in an order dependent on the determined levels of popularity.

For example consider a retail clothing store website that includes an internal product search system that allows users to search for various products matching different keywords and be presented with related products being sold on the site. According to some embodiments the user may enter the search term jeans and the internal search system may respond by retrieving a standard set of product results related to that word. Then the search system may query the social media measurement tool for the keywords associated with each site section on which the results reside. If for example the term Jean shorts has the most mentions for the last week then search results on a site section associated with the term Jean shorts may be displayed earlier on the search results page than are other search results on sections associated with less popular keywords. Likewise if a particular user is an influencer with respect to Jean shorts results for particular jean shorts may be shown to the user and charge for placement of the results may be billed to a party that has bought such a placement.

In some embodiments the web server or a different web server may include a behavioral targeting system such as . Companies may use traditional behavioral targeting systems to serve applicable content to users based on previous user behavior. As users continue to use a website the targeting system may learn more about the user and provides content e.g. advertisements that is better tailored to that particular user based on the user s behavior. However at times the system may not know much about the user e.g. the user s first visit .

According to some embodiments a behavioral targeting system e.g. may query the social media measurement tool to gauge the popularity of different servable content according to social media trends. As with the internal search system in some embodiments an administrator may associate each portion of content servable by the behavioral targeting system with one or more keywords. When the behavioral targeting system attempts to determine which portion of content to serve e.g. needs to choose a banner advertisement to serve in a pre defined space the behavioral targeting system may query the social media measurement tool with the keywords associated with potential content. As with recommendation engine and internal search system behavioral targeting system may choose to serve the content that is most popular as indicated by the response data sent by social media measurement tool .

For example consider a banking website that includes a large piece of screen real estate reserved for targeted advertisements on a given page. The displayed advertisement could include any of the several different products or services offered by the bank depending upon the user s interests and history. However for a first time visitor the system may not have a user history. According to some embodiments in such a situation the behavioral targeting system may search the social media networks using sets of keywords that correspond to different advertisements available to serve. So for example if the measurement tool indicates that the keyword refinance is a highly popular keyword over the last month on several social media platforms the behavioral targeting system may serve to the user an advertisement for refinancing.

Another example of a system that may be configured to utilize social media popularity measurements provided by measurement tool may be a bid management system such as . A popular form of advertising for many companies is Search Engine Marketing SEM where the company purchases various keywords or phrases from a search engine such as search engine e.g. Google Yahoo etc. and associates different advertisements with the purchased keywords. When the search engine receives client requests to search for one or more of the purchased keywords it may serve one or more of the advertisements as part its response.

Often such search engines allow advertisers to purchase keywords by bidding on them via a keyword bidding interface such as keyword bidding interface . When serving advertisements that match the keywords the search engine may choose to serve only a limited number of advertisements which correspond to the highest bids for the particular keywords. Furthermore the order in which the advertisements appear on a search page may also be dependent on the respective bid amounts. Some search engines employ even more complex schemes whereby the advertisers pay respective amounts for impressions of a given advertisement the number of times the given advertisement is shown and for clicks on the advertisements the number of times a user follows a link associated with the advertisement to view the advertised content . Therefore advertisers are interested in evaluating keyword purchases discovering the most effective keywords and discovering an optimal bid price for them. Embodiments allow for additional billing to be assessed in keyword bidding interface with respect to advertisements shown to influencers with respect to the keywords.

Advertisers sometimes use bid management systems such as to automatically track the effectiveness of bids and bid on new keywords. For example bid management system may be configured to track the costs associated with purchasing each keyword and the revenue generated on an advertised website as a result of purchasing the keyword. The bid management system may then report these metrics to the advertiser suggest bid amounts for each keyword and or bid on particular keywords automatically. The bid management system may interface with a keyword bidding interface of a search engine such as bidding interface with search engine and may allow for premium bidding for display of ads to influencers.

According to various embodiments a bid management system such as may be configured to consider social media measurements when evaluating various keywords on which to bid. For example bid management system may be configured to track a given set of keywords on which the user is currently bidding or on which the user is considering bidding. Such keywords may be referred to herein as SEM keywords.

The bid management system may be configured to query social media measurement tool for respective measurements regarding various ones of the SEM keywords that the bid management system is tracking. The bid management system may then present the respective measurements to a user to inform the user s bidding decisions. For example for different SEM keywords the bid management system may present such social media measures as the number of directly relevant posts e.g. those that contain the keyword number of relevant posts e.g. those that contain the keyword plus downstream posts relevant to those sentiment of the relevant posts contributor influence of posters of the relevant posts audience contribution audience interest and or various other ones of the metrics discussed above. In some embodiments the bid management system may further combine process the measures gathered from the social media measurement tool to derive other relevant measures of popularity for each keyword.

In various embodiments the bid management system may present such metrics to a user according to different organizations. For example bid management system may break out the measures according to each keyword respective collections of keywords in different advertising campaigns respective groups of keywords being bid on at different search engines user specified collections of keywords and or any other groupings that may help the user determine appropriate bidding behavior.

In some embodiments the bid management system may utilize the social media measurements acquired from social media measurement tool or measures derived from those acquired from the measurement tool to determine whether to automatically bid on various keywords whether to increase or decrease bid amounts on various keywords or whether to otherwise modify automatic bid behavior. For example the bid management system may be configured to enforce a policy whereby it would automatically increase a bid amount of a keyword if it determines that the keyword is receiving a significant spike in social traffic.

In addition to discriminating between different possible SEM keywords in some embodiments bid management system may be configured to utilize social media measurements to discover new SEM keywords. Using this functionality advertisers may discover new keywords on which to bid and or on which a bid management system may automatically bid.

According to method begins when the measurement tool receives one or more initial keywords as in . In some embodiments these keywords may correspond to SEM keywords received from a bid management system such as those SEM keywords on which a user of the bid management system is currently bidding.

In the measurement tool may use the keywords to identify content on one or more social media platforms that is relevant to the keywords received in . The content identifies in may comprise directly relevant content and or relevant downstream content as described above. For example in some embodiments step may correspond to method of . In some embodiments the measurement tool may be configured to create different combinations of the keywords received in and attempt to also identify content in that is relevant to these different combinations.

In the measurement tool may then parse the content identified in to identify a set of unique words that appear in the content. In the tool may filter common words e.g. a the etc. from the set of unique words identified in . The set of common words to filter may be predefined specified by the user and or adaptively derived by the measurement tool. In some embodiments the tool may also filter the initial keywords received in from the set of unique words as in .

According to the measurement tool may then rank the remaining keywords in the set by a relevance metric as in . The measurement tool may then identify users with high contributor weight on the selected words as in . For example in some embodiments the tool may rank the remaining keywords by respective number of occurrences in the content identified in . In other embodiments the relevance metric may include a more complex calculation such metrics dependent on the number of unique posts that include the word the number of unique threads that include the word the size of the audience that has viewed at least one post containing that word the contributor weight e.g. as determined in of contributors that have posted that word etc.

In some embodiments the tool may return the words and their respective ranks to the bid management system. In various embodiments the bid management system may present the top N ranked words to the user perform further analysis on those words and or bid on those words according to a given bidding policy.

In some embodiments the measurement tool may be configured to identify additional keywords by performing steps recursively as indicated by the feedback loop from to each time using the top ranking words identified in the previous iteration. For example after performing a first iteration of method the measurement tool may identify the top ten keywords by a given relevance metric and then repeat steps using those top ten words as input instead of the initial keywords received in . Using this recursive approach the measurement tool may discover additional and or yet more relevant keywords. In various embodiments method may terminate upon executing a predefined number of iterations after a given iteration does not identify any new keywords in the top set and or another condition is met.

In some embodiments the tool may consider user feedback when determining relevance. For example the bid management system may allow a user viewing the suggested keywords to remove or accept the suggestion. Subsequently the bid management system may indicate these choices to the measurement tool which may use them to guide subsequent performances of method . For example in a step such as the tool may filter out one or more keywords that have been previously rejected by a user of the bid management system.

As discussed above the bid management system may suggest the keywords identified in method to a user. Such presentation may include various metrics or analyses to help the user understand the social media measurements that were used to arrive at the keyword suggestion.

In some embodiments the bid management system e.g. of may be configured to estimate the effectiveness of various keywords that the user is considering such as those suggested by the social media measurement tool as in . For example in some embodiments the bid management tool may attempt to predict the effectiveness of various SEM keywords at least in part by analyzing historical data for keywords with similar social media metrics and similar users with similar contributor weight.

As presented in the measurement tool receives one or more initial keywords . In some embodiments these keywords may correspond to SEM keywords received from a bid management system such as those SEM keywords on which a user of the bid management system is currently bidding.

The measurement tool may use the keywords to identify content on one or more social media platforms that is relevant to the received keywords . The content identified in may comprise directly relevant content and or relevant downstream content as described above.

The measurement tool may then parse the content identified in block to identify a set of influencers who have significant influence over content on the various social media platforms related to the keywords .

The measurement tool may then monitor postings associated with the profiles of the influencers block . For example in some embodiments the tool may monitor changes in content associated with the profiles belonging to particular identified users or monitor content posted by the user with respect to a set of keywords based on a contributor weight with respect to the set of keywords.

Targeted communications may then be directed to the influencers block . Influencer response behavior may then be measured by monitoring changes in the content associated with selected profiles block . Embodiments may target advertising content to the user based on a contributor weight with respect to a set of keywords and sentiment expressed in the downstream content. In some embodiments measurement of influencer response behavior may include calculation of metrics designed to measure the effectiveness of the targeted communications directed to the influencers.

According to the illustrated embodiment method begins by receiving a group of initial keywords for evaluation as in . For example these keywords may correspond to a group of SEM keywords that a user of the system is tracking or that were suggested by social media measurement tool as shown in .

In the bid management system correlates the received keywords with respective values for one or more social media measurements. As discussed above the bid management system may be configured to communicate with social media measurement tool to determine various measures for each keyword it tracks.

In the bid management system locates comparable keywords for comparison. That is for each received keyword the system may identify one or more comparable keywords whose social media measurements are similar to those of the received keyword. In some embodiments the comparable keywords may correspond to those on which the bid management system is currently bidding has bid in the past or for which the bid management system can otherwise obtain SEM metrics e.g. return on advertising spend .

In the bid management system analyzes the relevant content to identify a set of influencers. In the bid management system may determine respective values for one or more search engine marketing metrics e.g. return on advertising spend for the comparable keywords identified in . If the bid management system has bid on these comparable keywords before it may have stored such data as part of its normal operation. If the system did not bid on these comparable keywords before it may retrieve historical SEM statistics from a repository of such data. SEM metrics may include any metrics usable to assess the effectiveness of a keyword in an SEM campaign.

In the system attempts to predict SEM metric values for each word receive in . To do this the system may use various statistical inference techniques to determine a correlation between the social media metric values of the comparable keywords and their SEM metric values. Using this statistical model the system may attempt to predict SEM metric values for each of the received keywords given the social media metric values of those keywords. In some embodiments parts of the SEM metric values are based on the identity and characteristics of the influencers.
