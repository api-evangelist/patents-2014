This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 11 841 158 filed on Aug. 20 2007 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This disclosure relates to methods and systems supporting online consumer interactions by a user in a networked system.

Conventional network based marketplaces e.g. consumer websites provide users with functionality to browse a collection of items e.g. goods or services at a website and to make purchases using a variety of means. Many commercial websites provide several payment methods. Some of these methods include transferring customer credit card information to the merchant site for processing. The well known PayPal system enables a customer to set up a user account that may be used for payment of network based commercial transactions. In other payment systems a merchant can take customer credit card information by telephone and process the credit transaction manually. Although phone based payment systems are easy and fast for consumers conventional phone payment services typically require the merchant to perform additional processing steps such as entering customer credit card information into a phone based system. These additional steps create delays and the potential for errors in processing the phone payment transaction. Further the merchant becomes aware of the customer s credit card information or other personal financial information which may lead to security problems for the customer.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of an embodiment of the present invention. It will be evident however to one of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments may be practiced without these specific details.

Below are described various aspects of a networked e commerce system that may be used with voice communications and related electronic payment. A system architecture of an example networked e commerce platform is illustrated in .

Referring to a networked e commerce system is shown to include a consumer system a merchant site and a payment site . Consumer system represents a conventional client system such as a conventional personal computer with a standard consumer browser e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer and a network connection to public network e.g. the Internet . A user can operate consumer system to perform e commerce transactions with a merchant site via network .

Merchant site represents a conventional vendor server computer with a standard web server and a network connection to public network e.g. the Internet . A merchant can operate merchant site to perform e commerce transactions with a consumer system via network . The merchant site typically maintains a data repository in which consumer and transaction information can be stored and queried. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that data repository may equivalently be remotely connected to merchant site e.g. via a network .

Payment site represents a conventional payment server computer e.g. a site operated by PayPal with a standard web server and a network connection to public network e.g. the Internet . A financial service provider can operate payment site to perform e commerce financial transactions with a consumer system and merchant site via network . The payment site typically maintains a data repository in which consumer and financial information can be stored and queried. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that data repository may equivalently be remotely connected to payment site e.g. via a network .

In addition to the conventional networked e commerce platform described above consumer system may also establish a voice communication connection with merchant site using conventional voice over Internet Protocol VoIP technology or VoIP via a peer to peer P2P network such as Skype. In either case voice communication is converted to data packets and transferred between consumer system and merchant site via network . This voice connection is represented in as consumer system voice communication connection and merchant site voice communication connection . It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many types of networked voice call communication systems may be used with the various embodiments described herein. In a representative example embodiment described herein a P2P voice communication network e.g. Skype is used. However any other conventional voice communication networks could equivalently be used with the various embodiments described herein.

The P2P network according to an example embodiment consists of P2P nodes rather than web clients and web servers. A P2P node may operate both as a provider and consumer of services so it is both the client for some operations and the server for other operations. In the example system shown in consumer system merchant site and payment site all may act as a P2P node. The P2P nodes may connect to each other directly using a conventional P2P protocol. In an example embodiment described herein a consumer system acting as a P2P node may establish a voice call communication connection with the merchant site acting as a P2P node via the P2P network through network using a P2P call application. A consumer P2P call application is resident in the consumer system . A merchant P2P call application is resident in the merchant site . The consumer P2P call application can be used to create and maintain the voice call communication connection with the merchant P2P call application .

Using a conventional P2P protocol merchant site may also communicate with payment site via the P2P network through network using a merchant interface of payment site . In a particular embodiment merchant interface is an application programming interface API through which merchant site may send and receive payment information to from payment site . In a particular example merchant site may use merchant API of payment site to convey a payment request to payment site . Such a payment request may be related to a transaction a merchant is processing for a user of consumer system .

Using a conventional P2P protocol consumer system may also communicate with payment site via the P2P network through network using a consumer interface of payment site . Consumer interface can be used by the consumer to log into a pre established payment site financial account and to authorize payment to from a consumer s payment site financial account. Note that in conventional systems a payment site can deposit a data object e.g. a cookie on a consumer system when a user of the consumer system visits the payment site and or establishes a financial account on the payment site. Using this data object a merchant site can detect whether or not a consumer system has an account on a particular payment site.

Referring now to diagrams illustrate example operation flows in typical usage scenarios of various embodiments. Referring to a consumer system may initiate a P2P voice call to a merchant site in a first operational step 1 . In a second operational step 2 the merchant site can create a consumer transaction record associated with the consumer system P2P voice call and can store the consumer transaction record in a database or data repository . In operational step 3 in response to the P2P voice call from the consumer system the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record in the database or data repository and initiate a payment request to the consumer via the consumer P2P Call Application . In operational step 4 the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record and initiate a payment request to a merchant interface of the payment site via the P2P Call Application . In operational step 5 in response to the merchant site request for payment the consumer P2P call application accesses the payment site . In operational step 6 the payment site opens a consumer interface and prompts the consumer using consumer system to log in to the payment site if the consumer has an active account with the payment site or prompts the consumer to open a payment site account if the consumer has no active account with the payment site . In operational step 7 the consumer using consumer system logs in to the payment site and authorizes payment to the requesting merchant of merchant site . In operational step 8 the payment site provides confirmation of payment from the consumer account to a merchant account. Optionally the payment site can also provide additional consumer information to the merchant site e.g. preferred shipping information . In an alternative embodiment the consumer transaction record can be passed to the merchant site via the merchant P2P call application e.g. a Skype connection . In another embodiment a saved consumer transaction identifier can be passed to the merchant site via the merchant P2P call application .

The payment request as triggered by the P2P voice call from the consumer system may represent charges incurred by the consumer system as a result of an e commerce transaction between the consumer system and the merchant site . Alternatively the payment request as triggered by the P2P voice call from the consumer system may represent charges incurred by the consumer system as a result of the P2P voice call itself between the consumer system and the merchant site . In general the payment request as triggered by the P2P voice call from the consumer system may represent payment for charges incurred by the consumer system as a result of the voice call itself e.g. consulting services or customer support services and the like or a result of a purchase made while on the phone e.g. a pizza order .

Referring to a diagram illustrates an example operation flow in an alternative embodiment. In this case the merchant site may use a separate merchant application programming interface API that can be separate from the merchant P2P call application . A consumer system may initiate a P2P voice call to a merchant site via a merchant P2P call application in a first operational step 1 . In a second operational step 2 the merchant site can create a consumer transaction record associated with the consumer system P2P voice call and can store the consumer transaction record in a database or data repository . In operational step 3 in response to the P2P voice call from the consumer system the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record in the database or data repository pass the consumer transaction record to a merchant API and initiate a payment request to the consumer via the merchant API and the consumer P2P Call Application . Subsequent processing of the payment proceeds as described above and shown in .

Referring to a diagram illustrates an example operation flow in another alternative embodiment. In this case the merchant site may use a phone based prompt to request payment from the consumer. As shown in a consumer system may initiate a P2P voice call to a merchant site via a merchant P2P call application in a first operational step 1 . In a second operational step 2 the merchant site can create a consumer transaction record associated with the consumer system P2P voice call and can store the consumer transaction record in a database or data repository . In operational step 3 in response to the P2P voice call from the consumer system the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record in the database or data repository and initiate a payment request to the consumer via a phone based prompt and the consumer P2P Call Application . Subsequent processing of the payment proceeds as described above and shown in .

Referring to a diagram illustrates an example operation flow in another alternative embodiment. In this case a consumer system may be involved in a conventional e commerce transaction while initiating a P2P voice call with the merchant site . In a first operational step 1 a consumer system may initiate a conventional e commerce transaction at the merchant site . In a second operational step 2 the merchant site can create a consumer transaction record associated with the consumer system e commerce transaction and can store the consumer transaction record in a database . In operational step 3 the consumer system can initiate a P2P voice call to the merchant site via a consumer P2P call application and a merchant P2P call application . In operational step 4 the merchant site can associate the P2P voice call with the previously generated consumer transaction record associated with the consumer e commerce transaction. The merchant site can add P2P voice call information to the consumer transaction record and can store the updated consumer transaction record in the database . In operational step 5 in response to the P2P voice call from the consumer system the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record in the database or data repository and initiate a payment request to the consumer via the consumer P2P Call Application . In operational step 6 the merchant site can access the consumer transaction record and initiate a payment request to a merchant interface of the payment site via the P2P Call Application . Subsequent processing of the payment proceeds as described above and shown in .

Referring to a flow diagram illustrates an example of the processing logic used for the merchant site . In the example embodiment the merchant site receives a P2P voice call associated with a purchase transaction from a consumer in step . In step the merchant site generates a payment request corresponding to the consumer purchase transaction. In step the merchant site sends the payment request to a payment site . In step the merchant site receives confirmation from the payment site that payment for the consumer purchase transaction has been received.

Referring to a flow diagram illustrates an example of the processing logic used for the payment site . In the example embodiment the payment site in step receives a payment request corresponding to a consumer purchase transaction from a merchant site in response to a P2P voice call from a consumer of consumer system to a representative of the merchant site via a merchant call application . In step the payment site prompts the consumer of consumer system corresponding to the purchase transaction to access a consumer account and authorize payment from the consumer account. In step the payment site receives a payment authorization from the consumer system . In step the payment site initiates a funds transfer from the consumer account to the merchant account and sends confirmation to the merchant site that payment for the purchase transaction has been confirmed.

In an example embodiment a large scale P2P network may employ an existing communication based P2P network e.g. Skype to enable voice communication with online e commerce. Such a network may rely on the P2P node to perform certain functions of online transactions for example facilitate payment and delivery or interface to existing financial mechanisms or sites e.g. PayPal .

In a peer to peer network the network connection may be shared by chat voice traffic and file transfers that the peer to peer client application supports. Because the e commerce traffic is also passing through the peer to peer client application the peer to peer client applications may be configured to prioritize and control bandwidth. For example when a voice call starts the peer to peer client application may slow down file transfer and e commerce traffic to maintain call quality. If a web browser was being used to view content from an e commerce web server at the same time as a voice call perhaps to discuss what to buy the two applications may contend for bandwidth reducing voice quality and giving a slow e commerce experience.

In an example embodiment a central e commerce site e.g. eBay may connect its own sellers to the P2P network by having the sellers link a pay peer to peer user name e.g. Skype name to a marketplace name e.g. eBay name then hosting a link to the P2P network within eBay s own datacenter infrastructure. This example feature allows P2P power sellers to host items on a highly available high bandwidth platform rather than on their own computer systems and to maintain synchronization between marketplace items e.g. listed via a central server and the same items listed in the P2P network.

An example embodiment provides a P2P message exchange protocol that is efficient secure and reliable for C2C C2B consumer to consumer consumer to business and designed for multi channel communication networks that exploit both TCP IP internet and VOIP like networks. An example embodiment includes a distributed P2P marketplace where sellers and buyers communicate over a multi media communication network e.g. VOIP like communication medium provided by for example Skype . Authenticated application level connections may be provided between buyers sellers and payment sites who exchange e commerce related messages.

Buyers Sellers and payment sites may in various example embodiments communicate with the e marketplace over XML HTTPS Web Services SOAP APIs or equivalent protocols. These marketplace interfaces may be integrated into the peer to peer client application e.g. a plug in software component that supports a P2P payment platform . The P2P payment platform may provide built in application to application secure connectivity and communication services with multiple trading facilitators e.g. eBay PayPal and Skype .

The example computer system includes a processor e.g. a central processing unit CPU a graphics processing unit GPU or both a main memory and a static memory which communicate with each other via a bus . The computer system may further include a video display unit e.g. a liquid crystal display LCD or a cathode ray tube CRT . The computer system also includes an alphanumeric input device e.g. a keyboard a user interface UI navigation device e.g. a mouse a disk drive unit a signal generation device e.g. a speaker and a network interface device .

The disk drive unit includes a machine readable medium on which is stored one or more sets of instructions and data structures e.g. software embodying or utilized by any one or more of the methodologies or functions described herein. The software may also reside completely or at least partially within the main memory and or within the processor during execution thereof by the computer system the main memory and the processor also constituting machine readable media. The software may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device utilizing any one of a number of well known transfer protocols e.g. HTTP .

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present invention or that is capable of storing encoding or carrying data structures utilized by or associated with such a set of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories optical and magnetic media and carrier wave signals.
