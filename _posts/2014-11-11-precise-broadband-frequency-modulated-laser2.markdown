Many laser applications require the laser s frequency to be changed in time frequency modulated in an extremely controlled and predictable manner over large optical frequency bandwidths. Many of these applications require the optical frequency to change linearly and monotonically in time to form a linear frequency chirp called simply a chirp hereinafter . For instance researchers have actively linearized an optical frequency radio frequency RF sideband to improve the performance of frequency modulated continuous wave FM CW laser detection and ranging LADAR . Other researchers have actively linearized the carrier optical frequency for reading out spectral information recorded in optical crystal transitions.

Previous work has demonstrated techniques for providing feedback through circuits that drive a laser to provide stable highly linear laser output for low optical bandwidth systems. This previous work exhibits frequency tuning including highly linear chirps with bandwidths of up to 10 gigaHertz GHz 1 GHz 10cycles per second also called Hertz and abbreviated Hz .

Previous techniques for precise laser tuning are observed to break down for extremely large tuning bandwidths such as a bandwidth greater than 50 GHz which is 5 times more frequency tuning bandwidth than demonstrated by the previous work. Broadband chirps greater than 50 GHz have been produced but with deviations from linearity of about 1 percent or more. Therefore there is a need for a broadband frequency modulated laser that is highly precise and accurate for bandwidths greater than about 50 GHz. For example there is a need for a broadband chirped laser that produces a chirp that deviates from linearity by less than 1 for bandwidths greater than 50 GHz.

In one set of embodiments an apparatus includes a tunable laser having a plurality of drive inputs for affecting an optical frequency of light output by the laser. The plurality of drive inputs have a corresponding plurality of different frequency response bands for changing optical properties of the tunable laser and a corresponding plurality of actuation ranges of optical frequencies affected. The apparatus also includes an optical detector and a plurality of optical paths configured to direct light output by the laser onto the detector. The apparatus further includes a laser controller configured to provide a plurality of inputs to the plurality of drive inputs based on a detector signal output from the optical detector and the corresponding frequency response bands and actuation ranges.

In another set of embodiments an apparatus includes a laser an optical detector and a plurality of optical paths. The optical paths are configured to direct light output by the laser onto the detector. The apparatus also includes an optical actuator in an optical path between the laser and the plurality of optical paths. The optical actuator is configured to affect the optical frequency of light transmitted into the plurality of optical paths based on a first signal input to the optical actuator. The apparatus further includes a laser controller configured to provide the first signal input to the optical actuator based on the detector signal output from the optical detector.

In another set of embodiments an apparatus includes a tunable laser having one or more drive inputs for affecting an optical frequency of light output by the laser and an electrical sweep generator configured to generate a series of signals that cause the tunable laser to produce a waveform with alternating increasing and decreasing optical frequencies.

The apparatus also includes an optical detector and a plurality of optical paths configured to direct light output by the laser onto the detector. Still further the apparatus includes a laser controller configured to provide to a second drive input a loopback signal based on a detector signal output from the optical detector.

The system also includes an optical detector and a first optical path configured to direct light output by the laser onto the detector a second optical path configured to direct light output by the laser toward a target and a third optical path configured to direct light received from the target onto the detector. A processor determines range to one or more portions of the target based on a detector signal output from the optical detector.

In various other embodiments a method or computer readable storage medium is configured to perform functions of or operate one or more of the above components.

Still other aspects features and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description simply by illustrating a number of particular embodiments and implementations including the best mode contemplated for carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different embodiments and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects all without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly the drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.

An apparatus method and software are disclosed for providing precise and or accurate broadband frequency modulated optical waveforms. In the following description for the purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments of the invention. It is apparent however to one skilled in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details or with an equivalent arrangement. In other instances well known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the embodiments of the invention.

Although several embodiments of the invention are discussed with respect to a broadband chirped laser for frequency modulated continuous wave FMCW laser detection and ranging LADAR applications embodiments of the invention are not limited to this context. It is explicitly anticipated that the broadband chirped laser is useful in many applications including scanning imaging time delay determination dimensional metrology surface characterization arbitrary waveform generation TeraHertz THz 1 THz 10Hz generation through nonlinear processes such as photomixing or coherent spectral readout analysis of unknown optical or TeraHertz signals among others alone or in some combination. It is further anticipated that non linear or non monotonic precise and accurate broadband modulated optical waveforms are generated and used in various applications.

Some general embodiments are described at a high level first. More details for various components described herein and specific embodiments are provided below. Additional information measurements and theory that underpin these embodiments in the context of high precision ranging applications are also provided in more detail below.

As used throughout the terms optical wave optical beam laser beam and beam are used interchangeably to describe a focused or parallel or mixed propagating optical beam at a given frequency and waveform to describe the optical frequency as a function of time. An optical path is a trajectory followed by an optical wave through one or more optical components in 3 dimensional coordinate space and may include a vacuum gas glass glass fiber fiber isolator lens mirror beam splitter combiner polarizer diffraction grating optical filter optical amplifier phase or frequency actuator or any other optical component that directs or affects the direction frequency speed strength or any other property of the propagating optical wave alone or in some combination. A linearized sweep or linearized chirp refers to an optical waveform with a more accurately controlled linear frequency or phase over the entire bandwidth of the optical waveform than is available in the prior art. A precise broadband sweep or chirp refers to an optical waveform with a more precisely controlled arbitrary frequency or phase over the entire bandwidth of the optical waveform than is available in the prior art.

Prior art approaches to producing linear chirps rely on heterodyne detection which splits a portion of a laser s output beam into two optical paths that converge on the same detector. A controlled frequency difference is introduced into one path usually by adding a controlled time delay to a frequency modulated optical wave. The frequency difference produces a low frequency typically but not necessarily less than 100 MHz heterodyne beat at the detector which is relatively easy to detect and process with conventional electronic components. According to various embodiments one or more additional components or steps alone or in some combination are taken over prior art approaches to achieve more precise and or accurate control of optical frequency modulation especially over large bandwidths.

The time delay between any two optically coherent chirps can be obtained by heterodyning the two chirps on a photodetector. The photodetector records a time series of intensity that includes a sinusoidal component at a heterodyne beat frequency given by the frequency difference f . The frequency f of the resulting beat is determined by the chirp rate and the delay time t between the two chirps. The time delay between the two waveforms and corresponding range to target R can be accurately measured by taking the Fourier transform of the digitized output from the photodetector to obtain the frequency of the beat note or by otherwise determining the frequency of the sinusoidal component.

Current technologies provide moderate resolution LADAR that can make measurements over a relatively short window of ranges. However for ultra high resolution applications that require measurement over more than a few cm up to over 100 meters the required extremely linear high bandwidth phase stable optical frequency chirps have proven exceedingly difficult to generate. In fact this obstacle has been singled out as the significant impediment to successful implementation of high resolution synthetic aperture LADAR.

A recent approach using a feedback loop is given in U.S. Pat. No. 6 034 976 by T. W. Mossberg C. Greiner B. Boggs entitled Method and apparatus for laser frequency stabilization issued Mar. 7 2000 hereinafter Mossberg . is a diagram of apparatus to produce a limited band FMCW in the prior art Mossberg . The apparatus includes a frequency controlled laser an acousto optical modulator AOM to split output from the laser into two optical paths and add an offset frequency a fiber delay loop in one path mirrors collectively referenced hereinafter as mirrors and beamsplitter to cause the two optical paths to converge on photodetector . The optical paths are indicated by thick arrows. The photodetector outputs an electrical signal indicated by thin line segments. The apparatus also includes a feedback loop that comprises a phase locked loop PLL generator well known in the art to generate an output electrical signal that is proportional to the phase difference between the input heterodyne beat from photodetector and an internal stable frequency reference. The apparatus feedback loop also includes a temporal integrator and amplifier that drives the laser to output a particular frequency based on an input from the PLL generator . The beam output by the laser has a waveform given by time varying frequency t and the AOM introduces an additional optical frequency offset . The fiber delay introduces a delay of resulting in a beat frequency at photodetector of . The term moves the beat frequency away from low frequencies near zero where there are substantial noise components. Here and in the mathematical treatment below it is assumed for simplicity that refers to the time delay introduced in one path and that the other path has zero time delay. However this can be generalized to cases where there is time delay in both paths or neither path and represents the time delay difference between the paths.

In Mossberg it was shown that by varying the frequency of the PLL generator the beat frequency could be made to vary in an arbitrary but controlled manner such that the variable wavelength laser s frequency could sweep as an arbitrary function of time. Thus the laser s optical frequency could be made to vary in a controlled nonlinear manner. Mossberg also showed that by setting the PLL generator frequency to zero the laser s optical frequency did not change in time and the linewidth of the laser which results from the laser s phase and frequency noise could be suppressed when the feedback loop was engaged.

Previous optical frequency waveform stabilization approaches involving the self heterodyne technique including Mossberg employ lasers with relatively small tuning ranges less than about 10 GHz . Widely tunable mode hop free lasers are now available. Table 1 lists three example widely tunable mode hop free lasers that could not be used in the apparatus of Mossberg without modifications to the apparatus to accommodate the large bandwidth. Table 1 includes model names manufacturers wavelength tuning range in nanometers nm 1 nm 10 meters sensitivity to acoustic perturbations based on mechanical components tuning response speed in TeraHertz per second THz 1 THz 10cycles per second size in centimeters cm 1 cm 10meters spectral linewidth in kiloHertz kHz 1 kHz 10cycles per second or MegaHertz MHz 1 MHz 10cycles per second approximate cost in United States dollars and power consumption in Watts W . The acronym MEMS for micro electro mechanical systems is also used in Table 1. These lasers offered access to the one or more actuators needed to actively control optical sweeps. These actuators are typically a low bandwidth motor control a medium bandwidth piezo electric actuator that controls the cavity length and a high bandwidth laser injection current control.

Wavelength tuning is achieved by MEMS actuation of the feedback mirror which can tune the full range at 10 Hz repetition rates. Fine tuning can be accomplished by translating the diffraction grating with the piezoelectric actuator . The entire laser is confined to a fiber coupled butterfly package as shown in . The laser exhibits a linewidth of about 1 MHz which is predicted to provide a range window limit greater than 100 m even without linewidth narrowing resulting from the active feedback.

However the inventors own work has shown that significant foreseen and unforeseen obstacles to applying these approaches arise when attempting to stabilize broadband frequency waveforms greater than about 50 GHz from the newly available widely tunable mode hop free lasers. 1 Even when the beat frequency is perfectly stabilized to a reference oscillator the laser s optical frequency sweep is not linear due to dispersion differences between the two heterodyne paths. 2 The laser stabilization quality is degraded when non polarization maintaining and multi mode optical fibers are used in the setup. 3 Errors in the stabilized waveform result from acoustic and thermal perturbations to the setup. 4 The laser stabilization cannot be achieved over the full optical frequency sweep range when the required large error signals drive either the loop filter electronics or the frequency phase actuator out of its range for making frequency phase corrections. 5 The stabilization quality is insufficient for some applications because systematic errors remain in the laser frequency sweep despite the active linearization e.g. non linear responses to a linear driving voltage cannot be perfectly modeled by analytical curves . 6 The stabilization lock is lost when the laser frequency is returned to its original nominal value for the start of the next repetitive sweep. 7 High bandwidth frequency and phase errors from the desired waveform persist because the feedback bandwidth of intracavity laser frequency actuators can be insufficient to achieve the desired stabilization. 8 The achievable optical frequency waveform repetition speed is limited to low values due to limited bandwidth of actuators and excitations of the optical frequency actuator mechanical resonances.

For example the PHOENIX 1000 is subject to non linear responses to linear driving voltages. Thus to deliver a linear frequency output a non linear driving voltage must be input. and are graphs 150 that illustrate an example analytical fit to a non linear response of the laser source of and according to an embodiment. In the horizontal axis is voltage applied to one of the control leads of the PHOENIX 1000 that controls the counterclockwise rotation of the mirror . The vertical axis is output wavelength inversely proportional to optical frequency . Measured wavelengths are indicated by the dots . A functional fit to the measurements Y for a given input X is given by the Equation 1a plotted as curve 0.0017712 0.0345391541 1a However deviations from the functional fit of Equation 1a can still lead to important deviations from linearity over large bandwidths B.

Similarly in the horizontal axis is voltage applied to another one of the control leads of the PHOENIX 1000 that controls the clockwise rotation of the mirror . The vertical axis is output wavelength inversely proportional to optical frequency . Measured wavelengths are indicated by the dots . A functional fit to the measurements Y for a given input X is given by the Equation 1b plotted as curve 0.00188721 0.0240751541.9 1b However deviations from the functional fit of Equation 1b can still lead to important deviations from linearity over large bandwidths B. When following the manufacturer s recommendation to operate these two mirrors simultaneously a more linear chirp is produced. Deviations from the more linear chirp can still lead to important deviations from linearity over large bandwidths B.

An active feedback loop as suggested by Mossberg as well as corrected driving functions suppress but do not eliminate errors in the optical frequency waveform. Residual errors are unavoidable for stochastic noise processes that produce random errors and for characteristics of various components that produce systematic errors. Systematic errors are those that are not random and are consistently present in a repeatable manner for each chirp. Systematic errors to the desired waveform can be measured. For example the measured frequency error after several repeats of the waveform can be determined and treated as systematic errors.

An often important cause of deviations from ideal frequency response over large bandwidth B is dispersion differences in the two or more optical paths over which heterodyne measurements are made. This problem is an example of obstacle enumerated above. Dispersion errors arise because much of the various measurement systems utilize fiber technology for splitters reference delays and delivery. With dispersive delays such as occurs in optical fibers like fiber delay becomes a function of the instantaneous optical frequency and therefore time as the optical frequency changes in time. The mathematical development and description in Mossberg and the culminating statement that each value of corresponds to a specific time rate of change of laser frequency do not hold true for dispersive delays. Therefore the desired precision tuning described by Mossberg will not be achieved for dispersive delays and large bandwidths.

To understand the effect of dispersion on the linearity of the chirp and the heterodyne beat note and resulting ranges the following theoretical considerations are offered. However the embodiments and scope of the claims are not limited by the accuracy or completeness of these theoretical considerations.

In the presence of dispersion the optical delay is a function of the optical frequency. The time domain effect of dispersion is calculated by transforming the time dependent field to the Fourier domain multiplying by a quadratic phase factor exp i where is the material dispersion coefficient then transforming back to the time domain. For single mode fiber at optical wavelengths near 1550 nm is about 23 picoseconds ps 1 ps 10seconds squared per kilometer km 1 km 10meters i.e. about 23 ps km. The main result is that a linear frequency chirp with an initial rate d dt 2 after propagation through a medium of length z emerges with a new chirp rate given by Equation 2a. 1 1 2a Therefore in the self heterodyne setup of Mossberg the interferometric beat note beat f will change with time t as given by Equation 2b. beat 1 . 2b where Lis the physical length of the dispersive delay path such as the length of the delay fiber.

For small and or small bandwidth B neglecting material dispersion in the reference delay may not cause noticeable deviations from linearity. However for large sweep bandwidths B the experimental data shown next highlights how systems with dispersive delays must be treated differently from the prior art prescriptions. are graphs and that illustrate the effect of differential dispersion on a reference path according to an embodiment. In the horizontal axis is relative range in millimeters mm 1 mm 10meters and the vertical axis is relative power in decibels dB . Traces and are Fourier transforms of photodetector signals of broadband chirps to be compared to . Trace is based on using fiber in both optical paths to compensate for dispersion. Trace is based on a fiber delay in one path and no dispersion in the second path and performing the Fourier transform with a square window. is the same experimental setup with a Hanning window used before performing the Fourier transform. In the horizontal axis is time in milliseconds ms 1 ms 10seconds and the vertical axis is optical frequency deviations from linearity in megahertz MHz . Trace shows the output of the stabilized beam with no compensation for dispersion.

For the data shown beat was held constant using a feedback loop to cause a laser sweep over 5 THz. The data shows the deviations from linearity for the laser s frequency sweep. In contrast to system in the prior art such as in Mossberg the present system s optical frequency trace does not exhibit linear tuning in time. In fact the deviations from linearity are almost as large the original laser tuning bandwidth 100 MHz in Mossberg. These deviations are significant for many applications. For example in ranging systems as depicted in the dispersion leads to a broadening of the peak delay range seen in traces and compared to trace leading to greater uncertainty in the determination of the delay or range.

To ameliorate the effects of one or more of the obstacles enumerated above to achieving broadband precise optical frequency chirps one or more components of the apparatus of Mossberg depicted in are changed or additional components are added alone or in some combination.

The source controller provides control signals for various components of the source such as the frequency sweep driver output actuator and a laser controller described in more detail below. In some embodiments the source controller also receives data from the laser controller e.g. data indicating measurements made of deviations from linearity of other desired waveform as indicated by the two way arrowheads. In some embodiments source controller also sends out signals that depend on dispersion differences in the two optical paths or measured environmental conditions or residual systematic errors predetermined for laser source . In some embodiments the source controller is a separate computer in some embodiments the source controller is a built in computer or chip set or processor.

The frequency sweep driver provides a sweep signal such as a RF electronic signal that causes the tunable laser to change the tunable laser s optical frequency over the desired bandwidth e.g. 50 GHz for the output waveform e.g. linearized sweep output beam produced by the source . Any method known in the art may be used to generate the sweep signal. Any type of signal may be used including a voltage or a current which is appropriate for driving a particular tunable laser . Example commercially available tunable lasers and the corresponding driver signals are described above in Table 1. In some embodiments the controller or frequency sweep drive is configured to introduce small deviations from an output waveform e.g. a linear sweep to correct for predetermined systematic errors in the output of the source as described in more detail below with respect to passive error correction to overcome obstacle enumerated above. In some embodiments the controller or frequency sweep driver is configured to generate a series of alternating increasing and decreasing signals which cause the laser s optical frequency to increase and decrease respectively or vice versa over the desired bandwidth as described in more detail below to overcome obstacle enumerated above.

The output actuator is an optical device or combination of devices such as an acousto optic modulator AOM or electro optic modulator EOM widely known in the art which changes the frequency or phase of an optical waveform. The effect is controllable based on an input signal from the source controller . In various embodiments the output actuator modulates the frequency or phase or both of an output beam in response to any imperfections such as non linear response of the laser to the frequency sweep driver environmental perturbations to the laser uncorrected dispersion differences among multiple optical paths in the feedback loop environmentally caused changes to the delay in one or more optical paths in the feedback loop or other systematic errors in the beam leaving the feedback loop alone or in some combination. The modulations imposed by output actuator are among the out of loop corrections to overcome obstacle and or enumerated above. In some embodiments sufficient correction is applied within the driver or feedback loop or both and output actuator is omitted.

The feedback loop includes optical components and electrical components. The feedback loop electrical components include laser controller AOM RF source and phase locked loop PLL RF source described in more detail below. Optical detectors that output electrical signals and lasers with electrical controls are considered optical components for the purposes of this description.

The feedback loop optical components include the tunable laser one or more in loop frequency phase actuators also called an in loop actuator a beam splitter an AOM an optical detector also called a photodetector or simply a detector and two optical paths between the AOM and the detector . One optical path called a delayed path includes an optical delay component . In the illustrated embodiment the delayed path includes a dispersion compensation component and an environmental compensation component . The other optical path includes dispersion compensation component . In some embodiments one or more of dispersion compensation components and environmental compensation component and in loop actuator are omitted. In some embodiments additional optical paths between AOM and detector are included. In some embodiments other or different optical components such as a polarizer or fiber isolator are included in one or more optical paths. For example another beam splitter either separate from or integrated with beam splitter is used with or in place of AOM in some embodiments.

The tunable laser outputs a frequency varying optical waveform based on signals input to one or more drive inputs. In the illustrated embodiment the tunable laser includes three drive inputs and . The signal received at drive input from the frequency sweep driver is used to vary an internal actuator of the tunable laser to output a laser beam that varies over the entire frequency bandwidth of interest. Direct individual control of one or more additional internal actuators is represented by the additional drive input and drive input . For example as described above the PHOENIX 1000 has an internal MEMS motor that moves a mirror to define the laser cavity piezoelectric component that deflects a diffraction grating and a laser injection current supply that can be driven separately using drive input drive input and drive input respectively. As described below the response times of these various internal components differ e.g. the motor is slowest to respond and the current is fastest to respond. The frequency range over which an actuator responds linearly is typically referred to as its response bandwidth . For the PHOENIX 1000 the MEMs motor that rotates the minor has the lowest bandwidth about 400 Hz slow the piezo electric actuator has the next highest bandwidth about 10 kHz medium and the current has the highest bandwidth about 500 kHz fast . This means that if there is some error needing correction at 100 kHz frequency the current has to be used to suppress that error. The actuation range refers to the optical frequencies over which an actuator has control. For instance the MEMS mirror can tune over about 6 THz very broad the piezo electric actuator is possibly able to tune the laser s frequency over 50 GHz fairly broad and the current can tune the laser s frequency over about 2 GHz not so broad . Therefore if some noise source is causing a very large deviation from desired frequency modulation say 200 GHz the mirror motor has to be used to correct it. Typically the larger deviations are slower so this works out well. Within the response bandwidth a particular frequency might be most effective often associated with a resonant frequency for a mechanical portion of the internal actuator if any. In general a drive signal at the resonant frequency of the internal actuator produces a large output optical change within the actuation range for a relatively small input signal change.

The in loop actuator is included in some embodiments to modulate the optical waveform output by the tunable laser at actuation ranges or response bandwidths beyond those available for the internal actuators e.g. at drive inputs . Such modulation is described in more detail below. In some embodiments in loop actuator is omitted.

Beam splitter directs a portion of an incident beam to the output of the laser source such as to output actuator to be used as the linearized sweep or other waveform output beam . In some embodiments the beam splitter is a 90 10 splitter with 90 of the incident beam directed to the output. The remainder of the beam is directed to an optical detector through two or more optical paths for heterodyne detection of deviations from desired modulation.

The optical detector outputs an electrical signal in response to the combined optical waves incident on the detector s optically active face. In particular as a result of the heterodyne combination of waves traversing two optical paths the signal output by the detector produces a beat frequency beat dependent on the difference between the frequencies of the optical waves arriving at the detector via the two different optical paths.

In the illustrated embodiment the remainder of the beam output from beam splitter is directed to an AOM which splits the beam and introduces a frequency and phase shift away from noisy low electrical e.g. radio frequencies. Beam splitter AOM and detector are known and used in prior art approaches e.g. in the apparatus of Mossberg. AOM RF source drives the AOM with a particular RF signal that is converted to an acoustic signal that causes the desired shift in optical frequency of the optical wave.

Delay component such as a length of coiled fiber cable introduces a travel time delay along one of the optical paths called the delayed path relative to the other path s . When a delay is introduced into a frequency varying waveform it arrives at a detector simultaneously with a non delayed waveform having a potentially different frequency. While delay components are known in heterodyne detection e.g. fiber delay in the apparatus of Mossberg in some embodiments delay component includes additional features. For example in some embodiments delay component includes a single mode optical fiber that maintains a single inserted polarization throughout its length and a polarizer a polarization filter to polarize the beam to match the fiber s properties before insertion as described below to overcome obstacle enumerated above. In some embodiments delay component includes a single mode optical fiber that is insensitive to inserted polarization.

In some embodiments either or both optical paths include a dispersion compensation component such as dispersion compensation components and depicted in . Dispersion causes different frequencies traversing the same optical delay element e.g. same optical fiber to travel at different speeds and thus experience different delays. If the non delayed path does not travel through fiber at all or travels through a shorter length of fiber than the delayed path then the non delayed wave travel time will not change with frequency or not as much as for the delayed wave s respectively. As a result the frequency difference of the heterodyne combined wave changes with frequency and hence changes with time for a perfectly linear chirped waveform emitted from the tunable laser . The purpose of the dispersion compensation component s is to decrease the difference in dispersion between the two paths. Various approaches to dispersion compensating components are described below for the delayed path and non delayed path respectively to overcome obstacle enumerated above.

In some embodiments the time varying frequency difference is compensated by causing AOM RF source to provide a compensating time varying RF signal as described in more detail below.

The environmental compensation component is included in some embodiments to correct for environmental effects on delay component such as temperature and acoustic pressure on the length of or speed in an optical fiber to overcome obstacle enumerated above. Some approaches are described below for stabilizing the fiber length.

The electrical output signal from detector i.e. the detector signal is input to the laser controller . The RF beat of the heterodyne combination is fully captured in this detector signal including phase frequency and amplitude. Deviations from a desired beat associated with perfect linearization or other desired waveform are determined by comparing the detector signal to a reference signal for the desired beat frequency and phase. The phase locked loop PLL RF source provides the reference signal. Without dispersion or with effectively compensated dispersion in the optical components the desired beat frequency and phase is a constant for a perfectly linear chirped waveform. However with remaining dispersion the desired beat frequency and or phase would be time varying. Thus in some embodiments a time varying frequency reference is provided by causing PLL RF source to provide a time varying RF signal as described in more detail below. The same effect can be achieved using a time varying AOM RF source instead of or in combination with the time varying PLL RF source .

The laser controller includes a frequency phase discriminator a signal splitter and one or more filters e.g. filter filter filter and filter collectively referenced hereinafter as filters . These filters may include frequency dependent amplification. The frequency phase discriminator determines a frequency or phase difference between the detector signal and the reference signals produced by the PPL RF source . Any phase or frequency differences between detector signal and the reference signal indicate errors from the desired time rate of change of the optical frequency of the tunable laser . The splitter replicates this error signal or portions thereof as separate signals that are each directed to one of the filters . Each filter passes the portion of the error signal within the response bandwidth of one of the tunable laser s internal actuators or external in loop actuator and feeds that portion of the error signal to the corresponding drive input or external actuator as described in more detail below. In the illustrated embodiment filtered signal output from filter is input to drive input . Similarly filtered signal outputs from filters are input to drive inputs and in loop actuator respectively. In some embodiments the maximum amplitude output from the filter is limited to account for an actuator s limited actuation range to avoid damage to laser components or in loop actuators. In some embodiments the filter outputs are adjusted further to correct for at least some predetermined systematic errors as described in more detail below.

In some embodiments dispersion errors or other contributions to systematic errors are corrected by the processor based on algorithms appropriate to the ranging application. The measured effects of dispersion and other systematic errors for ranging are described above with reference to and . In other applications the same or different algorithms to correct for dispersion differences or other systematic errors are employed.

Although a particular set of optical components electrical components beams signals and processes are shown in and for purposes of illustration in various other embodiments more or fewer optical components electrical components beams signals and processes are involved. Furthermore components and beams are depicted as particular blocks in a particular arrangement for purposes of illustration in other embodiments each component or beam or portions thereof may be separated or combined or arranged in some other fashion.

In step the optical frequency output by a tunable laser is swept through the bandwidth of interest in alternating directions e.g. increasing optical frequency followed by decreasing optical frequency. For example source controller causes the frequency sweep driver to input a sweep signal to motor drive input to cause the optical frequency of the tunable laser to change smoothly first in one direction e.g. increasing frequency and then in the opposite direction e.g. decreasing frequency . Step corresponds to generating a beam of a laser comprising a series of alternating increasing and decreasing frequency modulated waveforms e.g. chirps of a desired large bandwidth.

In step the systematic errors in the frequency or phase or both of the laser output beam is corrected. Step includes determining the errors in the sweep linearity by any means desired such as based on previously collected measurements of sweep linearity e.g. using the recently developed methods described in Tae Jung Ahn and Dug Young Kim Analysis of nonlinear frequency sweep in high speed tunable laser sources using a self homodyne measurement and Hilbert transformation Appl. Opt. 46 2394 2400. In some embodiments the measured errors are averaged over many iterations to determine the systematic errors versus random errors.

In some embodiments during step the in loop actuator modulates the laser beam based on input from filter to correct for the measured errors. Thus one or more of multiple filtered signals is employed as loopback to one or more of the actuators to generate a more stable rate of change of the frequency of the beam of the laser. In some embodiments this step also accomplishes modifying the beam of the laser based on an otherwise uncorrected difference in dispersion between the different optical paths.

In step the output beam is split off such as in beam splitter . In step the output beam frequency or phase or both are modulated to correct for one or more predetermined systematic errors such as residual nonlinear response of the laser frequency to the frequency sweep driver e.g. using frequency phase actuator . In some embodiments other steps provide sufficient correction and step is omitted. In step a highly linearized beam or other precise waveform over a broad frequency band greater than 50 GHz is output.

In step the residual beam not split off as output called the loopback beam herein is split into a reference beam and delayed beam to traverse the reference optical path and the delayed optical path respectively. Thus the laser beam is split into first and second beam portions which traverse different optical paths with different travel times for a same optical frequency.

In step the delayed beam is delayed using a single mode polarization independent fiber. In other embodiments the delayed beam is delayed using other means such as a free space path with adjustable mirror to trap and then release the beam or using fibers that are single mode for single polarization with a polarizing filter e.g. in delay component . In step the actual delay in the delay device is stabilized e.g. using the environmental compensation component . In some embodiments step is omitted.

In step either the reference beam or the delayed beam is or both are passed through a dispersion compensation component. Thus at least one of the first and second beam portions passes through an optical component to compensate for differences in frequency dispersion between the different optical paths that would otherwise result. In some embodiments that perform dispersion correction external to the loop or with algorithms step is omitted.

In step both the reference and delayed beams are directed onto the same detector and the modifications to the optical frequency necessary to obtain sufficient linear optical sweep is determined Thus the first and second beam portions are combined after the first and second beam portions have traversed the different optical paths. The combined beam has a time varying intensity that is a function of the time rate of change of the frequency of the laser and the delay between the two optical paths.

In step the error signal is filtered into one of multiple actuation bands for driving different inputs for the tunable laser. For example the error signal from the frequency phase discriminator is filtered by filters into correction signals for different actuator ranges. Thus a signal is derived from the time varying intensity which is a function of the time rate of change of the frequency of the beam of the laser. The derived signal is filtered into a plurality of filtered signals in a corresponding plurality of response bandwidths and actuation ranges for a corresponding plurality of actuators that affect an optical frequency of the beam of the laser.

In step a forcing function is determined in each response bandwidth and actuator range based on the response of the tunable laser in the band including any resonances and the desired change in the band. Thus multiple filtered signals are determined for loopback to the plurality of actuators to stabilize the rate of change of the frequency of the beam of the laser.

In step each laser input is driven based on the corresponding forcing function. Thus multiple filtered signals are employed as loopback to the plurality of actuators to stabilize the rate of change of the frequency of the beam of the laser.

In some embodiments the entire frequency change is used to force a single actuator and steps and are omitted while a forcing function signal derived from the error signal determined in step is employed as the loopback signal to stabilize the rate of change of the optical frequency of the beam of the laser.

In step deviations from desired linearization are determined In some embodiments the deviations from linearization are measured during step . In some embodiments predetermined deviations are received. Any method may be used to receive this data. For example in various embodiments the data is included as a default value in software instructions is received as manual input from a network administrator on the local or a remote node is retrieved from a local file or database or is sent from a different node on the network either in response to a query or unsolicited or the data is received using some combination of these methods.

In step the linearized sweep output beam is used in an application such as for ranging using the system . In step a detected signal is received e.g. in processor from detector .

In step the received signal is numerically or algorithmically corrected for deviations from desired linearization for example using a chip set or a general purpose computer and stored instructions as processor .

In some experimental embodiments the PHOENIX 1000 laser was used as described in Table 1 and and . In other experimental embodiments the PICO D laser was used. and are diagrams of this example laser source which can be used as an apparatus to produce a precise broadband optical waveform according to another embodiment. depicts the external look of the PICO D laser . As indicated in Table 1 this laser offered the best performance available in terms of wavelength tuning and linewidth. illustrates example internal components including a rotatable diffraction grating to adjust the cavity size and resulting optical wavelength a lens a laser diode fiber coupling optics including an optical isolator and an optical fiber carrying the output waveform. Like the PHOENIX 1000 the PICO D laser offers the following actuators a low bandwidth MEMS motor control a medium bandwidth piezo electric actuator that controls the cavity length and a high bandwidth current control.

To overcome obstacle concerning systematic errors one or more components are operated to compensate for known system errors. For example when a distributed feedback DFB laser is tuned over large bandwidths using significant nonlinearities are evident in the sweep. Or for the PHOENIX 1000 such nonlinearities can be observed when tuning the MEMS motor as seen in and . To minimize this laser s frequency deviations from linearity throughout the sweep it is useful to apply a passive linearization procedure before or after active linearization. Once the optimal temporal form for the voltage waveform that minimizes the deviations from linearity is determined that form is used to drive the laser. Subsequently active feedback to the laser s current is then summed in as described in more detail below.

For example the inverse of Equations 1a and 1b solving for X as a function of Y are determined A linear equation for Y as a function of time in substituted for the Y variable and a resulting equation is obtained for X as a function of time. A driving voltage with this non linear function of time produces a near linear optical wavelength and thus near linear optical frequency output. The result is a passive correction to deviations from ideal waveform.

Thus a linearly interpolated drive voltage was derived for the CCW actuator using the data in . This voltage was applied by frequency sweep driver controlled by source controller and the instantaneous frequency measured. From this data a new drive voltage was interpolated to passively compensate for as much of the remaining nonlinearities as possible. This new drive voltage was applied by frequency sweep driver controlled by source controller . The instantaneous frequency was again measured to assess how well the system performed. is a graph that illustrates example driving voltages that compensate for non linear response of the laser source of according to various embodiments. The horizontal axis is time in seconds s the vertical axis is voltage V . The curve is a first order input voltage to produce a frequency output that is near linear in time. The curve is a second order input voltage to produce a frequency output that is more nearly linear in time.

Such passive corrections are not sufficient for some applications such as some LADAR applications. is a graph that illustrates example deviations from an ideal chirp output for passively compensated systematic errors according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis is time in milliseconds ms . The vertical axis is frequency deviation in gigahertz GHz . After the type of passive compensation described above applied by frequency sweep driver controlled by source controller the measured residual deviation from linearity is about 0.15 GHz.

In other embodiments one or more other systematic errors such as those indicated in are corrected by passive compensation. As indicated above errors to the desired waveform can be measured and the needed electronic corrections can be added to the appropriate frequency actuator according to the time scales of the errors. This process is referred to as passive error correction because no automated feedback loop is present. Due to complexities in the behavior of the optical frequency actuator iterative or learning algorithms are often useful to achieve the greatest suppression of systematic errors using passive error correction. One desires to achieve the greatest suppression of systematic errors using this technique. To obtain an accurate measurement of the original systematic errors averages over multiple optical waveform errors can be taken. This reduces the stochastic error components in the averaged waveform. The passive error correction process can be applied before or after the active feedback loop has been engaged by applying passive corrections from laser controller independent of those deduced from differences between the output from detector and PLL generator . When applied after the active feedback loop has been engaged the systematic error corrections for each actuator should be measured and the appropriate feedback applied directly before that actuator after filtering and amplification electronics of the servo . In fact it is possible to measure the error signal directly out of the servo average this signal over many successive sweeps and then sum this signal with the output of the error signal but with opposite phase.

One embodiment of this uses the measured frequency error after several repeats of the waveform to create a corrective signal that is added to one of the frequency actuators. shows an example average systematic frequency deviation from the desired waveform in this case a linear chirp. The average frequency error due to these systematic errors in the stabilization system is shown in graph . The actual frequency error on each measurement would deviate from the average frequency error due to random fluctuations which cannot be eliminated by this process though by removing the systematic errors the stabilization system may be better conditioned to reduce random stabilization errors . In order to suppress the systematic errors that are not removed directly by the heterodyne detection of deviations in the active feedback loop the frequency error versus time of several repeated waveforms is measured and averaged to find the average frequency error versus time. This error is then reproduced electronically scaled in amplitude and added directly to the electronic feedback to one of the frequency actuators in order to cancel the systematic errors. If the systematic errors cannot be removed directly due to non linear responses or non flat frequency response of the actuator to which the average frequency error is applied the average frequency error can be pre processed digitally or analog prior to being reproduced. The pre processing should take into account the non linearities or non flat frequency response so that the reproduced signal has the proper feed forward response and spectral conditioning. The processed signal that is fed to a frequency actuator anticipates the actuator s response to the systematic errors and provides the proper correction to best cancel out the systematic errors.

In some embodiments one or more of the systematic errors are corrected in one or more of frequency phase actuator or external frequency phase actuator driven by either the laser controller or the source controller or some combination.

Obstacle enumerated above indicates that stabilization lock is lost when the laser frequency is returned to its original or nominal value for the start of the next repetitive sweep. For example for repetitive optical frequency waveforms the optical frequency must be returned to its nominal starting value. However the start and end of the optical frequency waveform often differ greatly in optical frequency. In this case if the laser s frequency is very rapidly returned to its starting position then resonances in the mechanical tuning mechanism can easily be excited which causes degradation or loss of the stabilization in the subsequent optical frequency waveform.

To address this obstacle in some embodiments alternating cycles reverse the direction of the frequency sweep. In some embodiments such reversals are implemented in the frequency sweep driver controlled by source controller . For many applications such as FMCW LADAR this time reversed waveform can be used to acquire data just as effectively as the time forward waveform. To produce the smallest errors it is desirable to ensure that the optical frequency waveform slope slowly reaches zero relative to the actuator resonance frequency at the transition points between the time forward and time reversed waveforms. This can enable the stabilization to be retained for all times throughout a repetitive optical frequency waveform.

For the case of the linear chirp waveform one method of stabilization has an acousto optic modulator in one path of the reference loop such as AOM . According to the embodiment shown in the AOM serves both to split the beam and frequency shift one of the paths relative to the other. Alternatively it is possible to use another optical splitter well known in the art instead of the AOM and insert an AOM in one path to perform the frequency shift. This allows for positive and negative chirp rates to be distinguished. For a particular configuration of the system beat is greater than the AOM modulation frequency f for positive chirps and less than the AOM frequency for negative chirps. This ability to distinguish positive and negative chirps can also be used to shape the transition from a positive to negative chirp rate as illustrated in . To achieve a constant positive chirp the beat is locked to reference frequency fa which is equal to f . The frequency reference is set by the system electronics used as the reference in the phase lock loop. To achieve a constant negative chirp the beat is locked to reference frequency fc which is f . Note that the fshould be much greater than . To transition smoothly from positive to negative chirps at the end of a sweep the reference frequency of the stabilization system is tuned smoothly from fa to fb to fc. At fb the frequency reference would be roughly equal to f. The opposite would be done at the bottom of the sweep to transition from negative chirp to positive chirp. Doing so will ensure that the stabilization system does not lose lock.

To address obstacle enumerated above the effects of dispersion differences between the two or more optical paths in the feedback loop should be compensated. To generate a constant linear change in the laser optical frequency the RF frequency reference from the PLL generator should change in time according to Equation 3a. 2 3a where and is the group velocity of the optical waveform and Lis the physical length of the dispersive delay path. If instead is kept constant then the optical frequency of the laser will change nonlinearly with time as given by Equation 3b. 2 4 3b 

In various embodiments one or more of the following steps are taken or components changed to compensate for dispersion differences between the two optical paths.

In some embodiments a dispersion compensation element is placed within the time delay path that has equal magnitude but opposite sign as the existing delay dispersion. For instance if the time delay is due to a length of optical fiber then one can splice onto this fiber a section of dispersion compensation fiber with the opposite sign of dispersion and appropriate length to generate zero net dispersion in the combined fiber delay. Other common forms of dispersion compensation are using diffraction gratings prisms and or grisms combinations of a prism and grating .

In some embodiments a dispersive element is placed in the non delayed optical path. The dispersive element has the same dispersion as the delay component in the delay beam path. For instance when a section of fiber is used for the time delay in delayed optical path then a shorter piece of fiber or other material with larger dispersion per unit length is used as dispersion component in the non delayed optical path. Again a number of materials and established techniques well known in the art can be used to generate the desired dispersion compensation component .

In some embodiments the AOM frequency is programmed to follow Equation 3a to compensate for the dispersion such that d t dt is constant. In some embodiments the PLL generator is configured to output a time varying frequency that follows Equation 3a. Specifically beat can be accurately measured as a function of time during the sweep external to the feedback loop. Then by comparing the measured beat behavior in time to the desired beat behavior one can determine the required modification to that must be implemented in order to generate the desired beat waveform in time.

In some embodiments errors due to dispersion in the time delay lines within the feedback loop are accurately measured external to the feedback loop e.g. as depicted in and an AOM is used external to the feedback loop e.g. as frequency phase actuator to continuously shift the output laser frequency to compensate for the dispersion.

In some embodiments errors due to dispersion in the time delay lines within the feedback loop are accurately measured external to the feedback loop e.g. as depicted in and mathematical processing algorithms are used afterwards e.g. in processor to compensate for the errors in the desired optical frequency waveform for any application. This procedure is shown in practice below for a LADAR application with a single target range. Algorithms that can compensate over all range distortions can also be performed based on a method similar to the interpolation as described in the passive stabilization section above.

Compensating for the dispersive broadening using an algorithm was demonstrated to provide Fourier transform limited peaks. However this computational approach is computationally intensive and slows the obtaining of results. Therefore a better solution is to mitigate the effects of dispersion in the reference delay line so that a perfectly linear chirp is created. Then for typical free space path lengths the deleterious effects of dispersive broadening would be negligible.

Experiments were performed using a dispersion compensating element. In this embodiment the element chosen was a ruled spatial grating in an out of loop setup e.g. introducing the dispersion compensating component to counteract the nonlinearities in the chirp that were created by dispersion in the target path. In this way the appropriate amount of dispersion compensation was demonstrated while still maintaining the optical source useful to adjust the dispersion compensating element. Once the appropriate amount of dispersion compensation was identified it could simply be added to the in loop delay as dispersion compensating component to create precisely linearized broadband chirps.

In an experimental setup not shown the stable swept optical source is amplified and split. One path passes directly to a combiner 50 50 splitter . The other path travels to a grating and roof prism combination and then to a long free space path length before being coupled into a fiber and combined with the reference field. Coarse adjustment of the amount of dispersion is performed by adjusting the length between the grating and the roof prism. The roof prism is a unique approach to handling the angular deviation induced from the grating as a function of the optical frequency sweep. In essence this portion of the optical setup allows the free space path length of the light to change as a function of the wavelength of the optical sweep. Fine adjustment of the overall amount of dispersion is performed by adjusting the long free space path length. Because the average dispersion in the total line is what matters the path length can be adjusted to provide these fine corrections.

Once the setup was operational both the coarse and fine adjustments were operated to compensate for the dispersion induced nonlinearity in the optical chirps. The residual frequency error in the chirp passing through the target interferometer was plotted. is a graph that illustrates example effects on active range determination by compensating the chirp for dispersion in a reference path according to an embodiment. The horizontal axis is relative range in millimeters mm the vertical axis is relative power in decibels dB . The Fourier transform of the heterodyne output without correction for dispersion is shown as trace . The Fourier transform of the heterodyne output with the dispersion compensation component is shown as trace . The peak center and width are improved with the dispersion compensation.

Polarization dispersion is identified as obstacle enumerated above and is also mitigated in some embodiments. To improve the quality of the laser stabilization in some embodiments only single mode optical fibers that maintain a single inserted polarization throughout the length of a fiber is used as delay component . It is advantageous for the inserted light polarization to match the polarization maintaining fiber axis to achieve the polarization uniformity that improves the stabilization characteristics. In some embodiments only single mode optical fibers that are insensitive to the inserted polarization are used. The attention to polarization decreases the adverse effects of polarization mode dispersion which can lead to multiple delays and therefore multiple simultaneous values of beat. Such multiple values of beat can confound the stabilization electronics and cause errors to propagate into the laser stabilization system.

Acoustic and thermal perturbations are identified as obstacle enumerated above and are also mitigated in some embodiments. Environmental perturbations to the delay path in component such as temperature variations and mechanical vibrations cause to depend on time. Again this causes beat to depend on the optical frequency sweep rate in a non linear fashion. For example when beat is held constant a perfectly linear optical frequency sweep is expected for constant . When is not constant in time the optical frequency sweep is not linear when measured external to the feedback loop.

In some embodiments the portion of the setup where two beams exist one with a time delay relative to the other between the two optical branches is thermally and acoustically isolated and protected. The most important part to isolate is the extended delay portion e.g. fiber delay but preferably the entire section where the two beams are physically separated should be isolated. This minimizes the environmental perturbations to and therefore maintains the most linear relationship between beat and .

In some embodiments the length of the time delay line is actively stabilized. For instance by putting a laser with very stable frequency through both the first splitting branch and the last combining branch changes in the delay line length are determined by measuring the resulting interferometric fringes on the optical detector. It is possible to then use a feedback loop to ensure that the measured fringes remain fixed. This ensures that the optical length of the time delay remains fixed to within at least half of the optical wavelength. The fringe maintenance system constitutes environmental compensation component in this embodiment.

In some embodiments the laser frequency is swept across multiple calibrated stable optical transitions to determine the optical sweep rate. This information can be used to feed back and stabilize the delay length. In some embodiments the optical sweep rate is accomplished for instance by sweeping the laser frequency across two vapor phase acetylene transitions in the 1550 nm wavelength region. With accurate a priori knowledge of the optical frequency separation between two acetylene transitions and a measurement of the time taken to sweep between the two transitions the sweep rate can be obtained by simply dividing the optical bandwidth by the time taken. Errors in the chirp rate are fed back to the delay length to correct for slowly varying delay length changes. The multiple calibrated stable optical transitions and feedback constitute environmental compensation component in this embodiment.

Error signals that exceed the response or optical frequencies of an actuator are identified as obstacle enumerated above and are also mitigated in some embodiments. For example driving different actuators and with different portions of the error signal as described above.

For instance when stabilizing with the injection current to correct the laser frequency typical diode lasers give less than 100 MHz per milliAmpere mA 1 mA 10Amperes . Even though one can often achieve 1 MHz closed loop correction bandwidths correction ranges are typically limited to less than 1 GHz to keep the diode in a safe operating region. To correct the larger fluctuations that often occur at lower radio frequencies and keep the laser current within its safe operating range a piezo electric transducer is used in some embodiments to tune the laser s frequency. Such an element can often tune over greater than 10 GHz but its closed loop bandwidth is typically limited to a few kiloHertz. For even larger and slower errors a mechanical motor that changes the laser frequency can be used to keep the piezo electric element within its range.

Error signals that exceed the bandwidth of a tunable laser actuator are identified as obstacle enumerated above and are also mitigated in some embodiments. When controlling the optical frequency and phase of the laser the speed and range of intracavity optical frequency and phase actuators can be limited. Therefore optical frequency and phase actuators external to the laser cavity located between the laser and the splitting optical branch AOM or not shown between the combining optical branch and the optical detector can be used to improve stabilization. For instance both an AOM and an EOM can be used as the frequency phase actuator . These frequency and phase actuators can be used to make corrections to the errors in the optical frequency waveform.

Error signals that exceed the frequency response magnitude of a tunable laser actuator are identified as obstacle enumerated above and are also mitigated in some embodiments. Thus in some embodiments the laser actuators are driven at the actuator s resonant frequency. This allows small input signal amplitudes to produce large optical frequency ranges at relatively fast speeds in a controlled manner. The even faster actuators then provide corrections to the errors in the optical frequency waveform. For instance if a motor is used to tune the optical frequency of a laser and the motor tuning arm is known to have a resonance at 100 Hz then one can drive the motor at 100 Hz for repetitive scans. This will require less voltage or power to the motor in order to achieve a larger tuning modulation.

Thus the effectiveness of the frequency chirp linearization is shown in . This figure shows the Hanning filtered Fourier transform of the digitized beat note with the horizontal axis scaled to provide relative target range at an effective range of 37 m. The beat note is shown both before trace and after trace the feedback loop is engaged. For both cases the systematic nonlinearities were suppressed as described above. However the active stabilization provided a reduction in the range peak width of an additional 4 orders of magnitude to 47 mm FWHM with the Hanning filter 31 mm without . This matches the Fourier transform limit dictated by the optical bandwidth 4.8 THz and to the authors knowledge represents the narrowest LADAR range resolution ever achieved over a range window greater than 1 cm. This system is therefore very attractive for precision industrial metrology.

Using the measured delay of the fibers in the reference path the distance to target measured by the LADAR system is 774.1 m. It is noted that the target range is less than the range offset of the fiber delay. This measurement is within the accuracy of the GPS. For a transmit power of 100 milliWatts mW the average return optical power was measured to be 0.3 mW. The reference optical power was 0.2 mW. For this embodiment the average signal to noise ratio SNR was measured to be 74.8 dB.

Using these values the measured absolute range to target was 14.124 km. The average SNR was measured to be 59.5 dB and the range precision was measured to be 1.446 mm. At this distance this represents a precision of 1 part in 10 million. As with previous demonstrations the transmit power was 100 mW. The return power was not measured but is estimated to be 5 to 10 microWatts W 1 W 10Watts . The reference power was 0.15 mW.

A second demonstration at the 14 km range was performed. In this embodiment the optical amplifier was removed from the system. This reduced the reference power to 3 to 4 W. The return power should be reduced by the same factor and is thereby estimated to be 0.2 to 0.4 W. Under these extreme conditions the system was able to achieve an average SNR of 31.4 dB.
