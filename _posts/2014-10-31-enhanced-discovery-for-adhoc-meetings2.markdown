This applications is related to and claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62 006 711 filed on Jun. 2 2014 and entitled Enhanced Discovery for Ad Hoc Meetings which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

A great deal of software technology exists that allows users to participate in video conference sessions and other types of multi user communication exchanges. Microsoft Lync Skype Google Hangouts and IBM Sametime are only a few examples of technology offerings in the marketplace today.

Users typically participate in such sessions through an application client running on their own device. A familiar scenario might involve users engaging in a video conference with each other from their desks or individual work space via a client running on their desktop computer laptop computer tablet or mobile phone.

However another familiar scenario might involve users gathering in a meeting space such as a conference room or huddle from where they connect to other users remote from the meeting space. In these situations a lead participant may plug in his or her device to multi media equipment in the space such as a video capture device and a display so that the local scene may be captured for those participating remotely. Should others in the room also want to join in online they would need to join the online meeting by clicking on a uniform resource locator URL associated with the lead participant for example.

Advanced meeting technology has been developed to allow users to hold ad hoc online meetings from a meeting space without having to bring their own device to the space. The Lync Room System LRS from Microsoft is just one example of such a meeting system that serves as its own node in an online meeting. Users can simply enter a room where the LRS is available and installed and begin meeting with other participants.

While such systems reduce the need for users to bring their own device to a meeting some may also want to participate in the session using their own device. For instance a user may want to download content that is being presented share their own content or chat with others who are engaged in the meeting.

In order for a user to join an ongoing meeting in an ad hoc fashion the user has to have knowledge of the identity of the room in which the meeting is occurring or more likely the identity of the meeting system associated with the room. The identity of the space or the room would then be used by the user s client to call into or otherwise join the meeting. Once joined to the meeting the user would be able to participate through his or her client to consumer and share content for example while still also participating in the session through the meeting system in the room.

Provided herein are systems methods and software to enhance meeting technology in support of ad hoc meetings.

In various implementations a user may be engaged in an online session via an initial service client. The online session may be handed off to a service client associated with the user. The user may move to a new location such as a conference room at which time the online session may be handed off again from the service client to an in room service client. In this manner the user can move with ease from one meeting space to another while remaining engaged in the online session throughout the process.

This Overview is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Technical Disclosure. It may be understood that this Overview is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

Device and session discovery is an important part of joining a meeting for Lync or Skype as well as any other communication service. Today device discovery is done manually by plugging in a conferencing device into your laptop for example. However discovery can be done automatically using a variety of techniques which would allow a user to join a meeting using a variety of devices in the conference room e.g. RoundTable interactive whiteboard Lync Room System etc. and would allow the devices in the room to automatically know about each other. Implementations disclosed herein enable enhanced device discovery and session discovery for ad hoc meetings.

In an example audible or inaudible sounds may be used to transmit a device ID or IP address. A receiving device can use the device identifier ID Internet protocol IP address uniform resource locator URL or other similar information to join an ongoing session in the room or possibly to initiate a new session share content or consume content. Other technology could be used to distribute such information in a room such as infrared LEDs quick response QR codes or the like. Even ambient room lighting can be used to encode a URL or room ID which can be detected by a device s camera such as a smartphone s camera. Alternatively the ambient lighting can be used to perform room proximity validation in combination with other aforementioned techniques.

In some scenarios a Bluetooth or Wi Fi transmitter access point may be used to broadcast the room ID as part of the device name SSID. A receiving device may use the strongest signal seen and then validate the room proximity using an audible or inaudible signal that is provided by a different device such as a room speaker s . In other scenarios instead of using a proximity validation sound the ambient room noise can be used for proximity detection. If there is sufficient HVAC noise talking or other background noise then this sound can be captured by the participant s device e.g. smartphone and room system and compared to see if they are a match and in the same room .

In some cases the Wi Fi signals in a building not necessarily specific to a room can be used to determine the approximate room location. A conference room system can then create audible or inaudible audio to perform room proximity validation. Thus a room need not have a wireless transmitter itself. The audible or inaudible sound can be played from a small speaker built into satellite microphones or separate small speakers placed on a conference room table. By placing several small speakers closer to a participant the inaudible sound can have a lower volume but higher signal to noise ratio SNR for that user s device. Near field communications NFC may also be used between two devices to validate the proximity of one to the room. NFC may also be used to share content or hand off sessions.

Some implementations may use a structured signal in a room s display to encode the room ID meeting URL or document ULR that is being displayed. A QR like code can be encoded using alternating 1 and 1 signals that when presented at 120 Hz are not visible to humans but that can be detected by a camera. Another method is to encode the URL by using a quadrature like signal where the display intensity is changed by 1 to 1 at the corners using a bilinear multiplier mask.

Referring now to the drawings illustrates an operational scenario in an implementation. Operational scenario involves service client room system in conference room service client and service client . In this example scenario service client is engaged in an online session with service client . Other service clients may also be engaged in the session although just two clients are illustrated for purposes of clarity.

Service client may be implemented on a mobile device such as a laptop tablet or notebook computer as well as a mobile phone wearable device or some other suitable computing system of which computing system in is representative.

As such a user may carry or otherwise physically transport the mobile device from one location into or nearby conference room . Accordingly service client may be considered to have moved and entered conference room . Upon entering conference room service client identifies the session that is ongoing with respect to room system by way of service client . Service client employs process in order to identify the session. and each illustrate a flow diagram representative of the functionality that may be driven by process .

After identifying the session service client is able to dynamically join the session allowing the user to participate and communicate with others on the session. For example another person or people may be present in conference room and may be speaking with or otherwise communicating with another person or people engaged in the session by way of service client .

As mentioned includes a flow diagram that illustrates steps representative of the functionality provided by process in some implementations when employed to identify a session. Process may be embodied in program instructions executed by a computing system suitable for implementing in a service client such as service client . Process may be integrated in service client although in some implementations process may be separate from service client or distributed across multiple programs application modules or software layers.

To begin process functions to detect an in room discovery signal step that identifies a room. Examples of an in room signal include but are not limited to Wireless Fidelity Wi Fi signals modulated light signals sound audible or sub audible ambient noise signals or any other type of in room signal capable of identifying the room.

Process examines the signal to identify the room with which the signal is associated step . In many cases the signal may originate from within the room. For instance a speaker may output an audible noise that identifies the room a light in the room may oscillate in such as manner as to encode the identity of the room in the light or the SSID of a Wi Fi signal may include information that identifies the room.

Upon identifying the room process identifies a session associated with the room step thus allowing service client to join the session. This may be accomplished by for example querying an online service with the room identity in order to discover a session or sessions associated with the room. The online service may reply with a session identifier with which service client can join the session. In other implementations the online service may be queried with the room identity for the identity of a service client associated with the room. The online service could return a handle or other such identifier with which service client could initiate a session. Thus an ongoing session could be joined or a new session could be initiated.

Accordingly process examines the signal to identify the session step . Having discovered an identifier for session service client is able to join the session. This may be accomplished by for example sending a request to an online service to join the session. Alternatively this may be accomplished by sending an invite to a service client such as service client to initiate a new session.

Service clients and may each be implemented on a suitable computing system such as a desktop laptop tablet or notebook computer a mobile phone wearable device smart appliance or some other suitable computing system of which computing system in is representative.

In operation service client is engaged with service client via online session . A user operating service client may desire to move the session to a different location. To do so online session is handed off to service client at which point online session is transferred to service client . At this point online session is established between service client and service client . The user may move service client to conference room at which point online session can be handed off to service client via room system .

Service client employs process to assist with both taking the hand off of online session from service client and making the hand off to service client . includes a flow diagram that illustrates steps representative of the functionality provided by process in some implementations when employed to carry a session from one service client to another as describe above. Process may be embodied in program instructions executed by a computing suitable for implementing in a service client such as service client . Process may be integrated in service client although in some implementations process may be separate from service client or distributed across multiple programs application modules or software layers.

In operation process functions to establish a near field communications NFC channel with service client or the device on which service client is implemented step . A session identifier for online session is exchanged over the NFC channel between service client and service client step . Service client may respond to the receipt of the service identifier over the NFC channel by communicating with the online service hosting online session or directly with service client so that online session can be moved from service client to service client . It is possible that in some scenarios service client may remain engaged on the session at least for a limited period of time until the session is handed off fully to service client . Regardless service client joins the session step .

A user engaged with service client may decide to move to a different location such as conference room . The user may also desire to hand off online session from service client to a service client in conference room . To do so the user enters conference room with the device in hand on which service client is employed. Upon entering the room the user may position the device in close enough proximity to room system that process detects that it is proximate to another system associated with another service client step . In response process establishes another NFC channel with that system which in this example is room system step .

Once the NFC channel is established process may communicate the session identifier for online session to service client step . Service client can use the session identifier to join the session such as by sending a request to an online service that identifies the session. The session will thus be handed off from service client from service client via service client .

Each computing system in service architecture includes a service client capable of communicating with conference service to facilitate conference sessions such as online voice video and data conferences with other service clients. Microsoft Lync Google Hangouts and Apple FaceTime are examples of conference service which may also be considered a unified communications service. Service client runs on computing system service client runs on computing system service client runs on computing system and service client runs on computing system .

Upon entering conference room service client discovers the room ID from one of the aforementioned sources and queries conference service to identify a service ID for conference room . Subsequent to the query or possibly at substantially the same time as the query audio system transmits a proximity signal that can be detected by service client or some other component on computing system . The proximity signal may be an audible or sub audible sound detectable by computing system .

Service client provides the proximity signal or a proximity code carried within it to conference service . Conference service compares the proximity signal or code to a reference signal or code to determine if service client is actually located in conference room . Assuming this is the case conference service replies to the query with a service ID suitable for joining a session ongoing in conference room .

The service ID may correspond to service client enabling service client to communicate with service client using the service ID. To join an ongoing session in conference room service client may query service client using the service ID. In reply service client may provide a session ID for an ongoing session. Service client can then join the ongoing session using the session ID. In this example service client is depicted as exchanging session communications with conference service although service client may communicate directly with session participants.

Service client may be physically moved such that it becomes proximate to conference room system . Service client establishes an NFC connection with an element in conference room system such as display system or possibly computing system . Upon doing so the session is handed off to conference room system in general and one or more of its elements in particular.

Various improvements to meeting technology may be appreciated from the foregoing implementations. The ability to join an online session in an ad hoc manner allows users to enter rooms and easily participate with others engaged in a meeting in the room without having to be specifically invited to have possession of a specific identifier for the meeting. Rather users can merely walk into a room with their device and their device can be joined to an ongoing meeting with a great deal of ease and efficiency.

Such technical effects improve the functioning of online meetings and enhance the user experience. For instance when a room system is deployed in a meeting space participants in the room can engage with remote participants through the room system. Any of the participants in the room or a new participant who enters the room can join the online meeting with their own device just by virtue of being in the room. This substantially reduces the barriers to hosting online meetings and increases the likelihood that people will use such conferencing technology.

In addition in some implementations users are able to handoff their sessions from one device to another increasing user mobility and the ability for users to move from one meeting space to another. For example a user may begin an online session at their desktop computer hand it off to their phone walk with their phone to a conference room and then seamlessly handoff the session to a system in the conference room.

Computing system may be implemented as a single apparatus system or device or may be implemented in a distributed manner as multiple apparatuses systems or devices.

Upon discovering the session in the room the service client may join the session thereby changing its state. In another example a session may be handed off from one client to another and moved from one location to another and changing its state.

It may be understood that computing system is generally intended to represent a computing system or systems on which software may be deployed and executed in order to implement enhanced device and session discovery.
