This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 891 676 filed Oct. 16 2013 the entire content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The present disclosure relates to note content capturing recognition extraction and or management tools and systems.

Paper notes have been broadly used in recording sharing and communicating ideas and information. For example during a collaboration session e.g. brainstorming session participants write down ideas on Post It notes whiteboard or paper and then share with one another. In addition people commonly use notes throughout the day to memorialize information or content which the individual does not want to forget. As additional examples people frequently use notes as reminders of actions or events to take in the future such as to make a telephone call revise a document or to fill out a time sheet.

For example in many situations people participate in a collaboration session by writing information on paper based notes such as Post It notes. Paper Post It notes can readily be removed from a dispenser pad of sticky back paper Post It notes and applied to various surfaces such as whiteboards documents the tops of desks telephones or the like. Information can be written on paper Post It notes either before or after the paper Post It notes are detached from their dispenser pad or attached to their target surfaces. Paper Post It notes can be easily moved from one surface to another such as between documents or between documents and the tops of desks they can overlap edges or boundaries of documents they can be layered and they can be moved with the objects to which they are attached.

Software programs currently exist which permit computer users to generate software based notes in digital form and to utilize the digital notes within computing environments. For example a computer user may create digital notes and attach the digital notes to an electronic document a desktop or an electronic workspace presented by the computing environment. The computer user may manipulate the notes allowing the notes to be created deleted edited saved and selectively viewed. The computer user may move such a note within a document or between documents and or the desktop by cutting the note from a document storing the note in a clipboard and then pasting the note to another area of the same document or to a different document. In this way the software programs provide a virtual representation of notes and allow an individual to utilize the digital notes in a manner similar to physical notes that he or she may use on a daily basis.

In general the disclosure describes techniques for creating and manipulating software notes representative of physical notes.

In one example a method comprises receiving an input image of an environment having a plurality of physical notes and separating the input image into a plurality of channelized input images each of the channelized input images associated with a different color. The method further comprises generating a plurality of transformed channelized input images by applying edge detection to each of the plurality of channelized input images processing the plurality of transformed channelized input images to identify based on edges detected within the transformed channelized input images a plurality of polygons corresponding to the physical notes within the input image. In addition the method includes grouping the plurality of polygons from the plurality of transformed channelized input images into a plurality of groups each of the groups comprising one or more of the polygons and corresponding to different one of the physical notes and selecting a representative one of the polygons from each of the plurality of groups. The representative one of the polygons is selected for each respective physical note in the plurality of physical notes.

A computer system configured to receive an input image of an environment having a plurality of physical notes separate the input image into a plurality of channelized input images each of the channelized input images associated with a different color generate a plurality of transformed channelized input images by applying edge detection to each of the plurality of channelized input images process the plurality of transformed channelized input images to identify based on edges detected within the transformed channelized input images a plurality of polygons corresponding to the physical notes within the input image group the plurality of polygons from the plurality of transformed channelized input images into a plurality of groups each of the groups comprising one or more of the polygons and corresponding to different one of the physical notes and select a representative one of the polygons from each of the plurality of groups for each respective physical note in the input image.

A non transitory computer readable medium comprising instructions for causing a programmable processor to receive an input image of an environment having a plurality of physical notes separate the input image into a plurality of channelized input images each of the channelized input images associated with a different color generate a plurality of transformed channelized input images by applying edge detection to each of the plurality of channelized input images process the plurality of transformed channelized input images to identify based on edges detected within the transformed channelized input images a plurality of polygons corresponding to the physical notes within the input image group the plurality of polygons from the plurality of transformed channelized input images into a plurality of groups each of the groups comprising one or more of the polygons and corresponding to different one of the physical notes and select a representative one of the polygons from each of the plurality of groups for each respective physical note in the input image

In another example a computing device comprises a processor and a note identification module executable on the processor and configured to separate an input image into a plurality of channelized input images. Each of the channelized input images is associated with a different color. The note identification module is configured to apply edge detection and feature extraction to identify polygons within each of the channelized input images and to select from the polygons from the channelized input images a representative polygon for each of the physical notes in the input image.

The present disclosure describes techniques for creating and manipulating software notes representative of physical notes. For example techniques are described for recognizing physical notes present within a physical environment capturing information therefrom and creating corresponding digital representations of the physical notes referred to herein as digital notes or software based notes. Further at least some aspects of the present disclosure are directed to techniques for managing multiple notes such as storing retrieving editing the digital notes categorizing and grouping the digital notes or the like.

In general notes can include physical notes and digital notes. Physical notes generally refer to physical objects with a general boundary and recognizable content. Physical notes can include the resulting objects after people write draw or enter via other type of inputs on the objects for example paper white board or other objects accepting the inputs. By way of examples physical notes can include hand written Post It notes paper or film white board with drawings posters and signs. In some cases physical notes can be generated using digital techniques e.g. printing onto printable Post It notes or printed document. In some cases one object can include several physical notes. For example several ideas can be written on separate areas of a single piece of poster paper or a white board. In some implementations to facilitate the recognition of these notes marks such as lines shapes colors symbols markers or stickers can be applied to the edges of the notes. Physical notes can be two dimensional or three dimensional. Physical notes can have various shapes and sizes. For example a physical note may be a 7.62 7.62 cm 3 3 inches note a physical note may be a 66.04 99.06 cm 26 39 inches poster and a physical note may be a triangular metal sign. In some cases physical notes may have known shapes and or sizes that conform to standards such as legal A3 A4 and other size standards and known shapes which may not be limited to geometric shapes such as stars circles rectangles or the like. In other cases physical notes may have non standardized sizes and or irregular shapes.

Digital notes generally refer to digital objects with information and or ideas. Digital notes can be generated using digital inputs. Digital inputs can include for example keyboards touch screens digital cameras digital recording devices stylus digital pens or the like. In some case digital notes may be representative of physical notes.

In some cases digital notes may be representative of physical notes used in a collaboration space. Collaboration space generally refers to a gathering area allowing more than one person to brainstorm such as sharing ideas and thoughts with each other. The collaboration space can also represent a virtual space allowing a group of persons to brainstorm such as sharing ideas and thoughts remotely besides the gathering area. The collaboration space may be referred to as workspace or the like. In other cases workspace may generally refer to a desk and or notebook of a single person with two or more physical notes.

In the example implementation mobile device includes among other components an image capture device and a presentation device . In addition although not shown in mobile device may include one or more processors microprocessors internal memory and or data storage and other electronic circuitry for executing software or firmware to provide the functionality described herein.

In general image capture device is a camera or other component configured to capture image data representative of workspace and notes positioned therein. In other words the image data captures a visual representation of an environment such as workspace having a plurality of visual notes. Although discussed as a camera of mobile device image capture device may comprise other components capable of capturing image data such as a video recorder an infrared camera a CCD Charge Coupled Device array a laser scanner or the like. Moreover the captured image data can include at least one of an image a video a sequence of images i.e. multiple images taken within a time period and or with an order a collection of images or the like and the term input image is used herein to refer to the various example types of image data.

Presentation device may include but not limited to an electronically addressable display such as a liquid crystal display LCD or other type of display device for use with mobile device . In some implementations mobile device generates the content to display on presentation device for the notes in a variety of formats for example a list grouped in rows and or column a flow diagram or the like. Mobile device may in some cases communicate display information for presentation by other devices such as a tablet computer a projector an electronic billboard or other external device.

As described herein mobile device and the software executing thereon provide a platform for creating and manipulating digital notes representative of physical notes . For example in general mobile device is configured to process image data produced by image capture device to detect and recognize at least one of physical notes positioned within workspace . In some examples the mobile device is configured to recognize note s by determining the general boundary of the note s . After a note is recognized mobile device extracts the content of at least one of the one or more notes where the content is the visual information of note .

As further described below mobile device may implement techniques for automated detection and recognition of physical notes and extraction of information content or other characteristics associated with each of the physical notes. For example mobile device may allow user fine grain control over techniques used by mobile device to detect and recognize physical notes . In accordance with the techniques described herein mobile device may implement techniques for automatic non marker detection and recognition of physical notes by processing the image data to find contours representing discontinuities in brightness or color. Moreover as described in further detail below mobile device may utilize automated note extraction techniques that utilize shape and color features of the physical notes within the input image to recognize the physical notes. In one example implementation a note management application executing on mobile device may separate the input image into a plurality of color channels spaces and for each of the color channels separately apply edge detection to detect contours within the channelized image data. According to this multi channel approach polygons detected from the different channelized image data are detected and polygons from the different channels potentially representing the same physical note are grouped and used to ultimately define the boundaries for an individual physical note. As a result each of the plurality of digital notes generated by note management application for a given input image may be represented by the best polygon detected for the respective digital note across a plurality of color channels. In another example implementation a note management application executing on mobile device may separate the input image such as a gray scale input image into a plurality of gray scale channels spaces and for each of the gray scale channels separately apply edge detection to detect contours within the channelized image data. According to this multi channel grayscale approach polygons detected from the different channelized image data are detected and polygons from the different channels potentially representing the same physical note are grouped and used to ultimately define the boundaries for an individual physical note. In this way the different color channels of the input image may represent different ranges of grayscale values associated with the input image.

In some example implementations mobile device provides functionality by which user is able to export the digital notes to other systems such as cloud based repositories e.g. cloud server or other computing devices e.g. computer system or mobile device .

In the example of mobile device is illustrated as a mobile phone. However in other examples mobile device may be a tablet computer a personal digital assistant PDA a laptop computer a media player an e book reader a wearable computing device e.g. a watch eyewear a glove or any other type of mobile or non mobile computing device suitable for performing the techniques described herein.

In this example mobile device includes various hardware components that provide core functionality for operation of the device. For example mobile device includes one or more programmable processors configured to operate according to executable instructions i.e. program code typically stored in a computer readable medium or data storage such as static random access memory SRAM device or Flash memory device. I O may include one or more devices such as a keyboard camera button power button volume button home button back button menu button or presentation device as described in . Transmitter and receiver provide wireless communication with other devices such as cloud server computer system or other mobile device as described in via a wireless communication interface as described in such as but not limited to high frequency radio frequency RF signals. Mobile device may include additional discrete digital logic or analog circuitry not shown in .

In general operating system executes on processor and provides an operating environment for one or more user applications commonly referred to apps including note management application . User applications may for example comprise executable program code stored in computer readable storage device e.g. data storage for execution by processor . As other examples user applications may comprise firmware or in some examples may be implemented in discrete logic.

In operation mobile device receives input image data and processes the input image data in accordance with the techniques described herein. For example image capture device may capture an input image of an environment having a plurality of notes such as workspace of having of notes . As another example mobile device may receive image data from external sources such as cloud server computer system or mobile device via receiver . In general mobile device stores the image data in data storage for access and processing by note management application and or other user applications .

As shown in user applications may invoke kernel functions of operating system to output a graphical user interface GUI for presenting information to a user of mobile device. As further described below note management application may construct and control GUI to provide an improved electronic environment for generating and manipulating corresponding digital notes representative of physical notes . For example note management application may construct GUI to include a mechanism that allows user to easily select digital notes from defined sets of digital notes recognized from the image data. In some example implementations note management application provides functionality by which user is able to record and manage relationships between groups of the digital notes by way of GUI .

As described in further detail below note management application may utilize automated note extraction techniques that separate the input image into a plurality of channels and for each of the channels apply edge detection to detect contours within the image data. According to the multi channel approach feature polygons are separately detected within each of the channelized versions of the input image and similar polygons between the channels that may correspond to the same physical note are grouped. Note management application may for example detect a polygon from each of the channels that is likely to correspond to the same physical note and based on a comparison of the polygons from the different color channels and or gray scale channels select a highest rank best polygon to represent the physical note. In some examples note management application may rank the polygons based on a comparison of the corners of detected edges for the polygons. As a result each of the plurality of digital notes generated by note management application for a given input image may be represented by the best polygon detected for the respective digital note across a plurality of channels.

In this example user application includes image processing engine that provides image processing and object recognition functionality. Image processing engine may include image communication module note identification module and digital note generation module . In addition image processing engine includes image processing Application Programming Interfaces APIs that provide a library of image manipulation functions e.g. image thresholding masking filtering edge detection and the like for use by the other components of image processing engine .

In general image data may be stored in data storage device . In this example note management application stores images within data storage device . Each of images may comprise pixel data for environments having a plurality of physical images such as workspace of .

As described herein note identification module processes images and identifies i.e. recognizes the plurality of physical notes in the images. In accordance with the techniques described herein note identification module utilizes automated note extraction techniques that separate the input image into a plurality of channels and for each of the channels apply edge detection to detect contours within the image data. According to the multi channel approach polygons from each of the channels are detected and a best candidate polygon is selected for each of the detected physical notes.

Digital note generation module generates digital notes corresponding to the physical notes recognized within images . For example each of digital notes corresponds to one of the physical notes identified in an input image and digital note generation module utilizes for each of the digital notes a best candidate polygon from multiple color spaces. During this process digital note generation module may update database to include a record of the digital note and may store within the database information e.g. content captured from boundaries of the physical note within the input image as detected by note identification module . Moreover digital note generation module may store within database metadata associating the digital notes into one or more groups of digital notes.

Image communication module controls communication of image data between mobile device and external devices such as cloud server computer system mobile device or image capture device . In some examples image communication modules may for example allow a user to communicate processed or unprocessed images of environments and or digital notes and associated information extracted therefrom including metadata from database . In some examples image communication module exports this data to a zip file that may be communicated by FTP HTTP email Bluetooth or other mechanism.

In the example of note management application includes user interface that constructs and controls GUI . User interface may in some examples output for display an input image overlaid with the plurality of digital notes where each of the digital notes is overlaid in place of a corresponding physical note.

In some example implementations user interface provides an image editor that allows a user to edit the overlay image the vector forms the polygons and or the digital notes. In another example digital note generation module may include a process or processes that enhance the extracted information from the input image.

Additional example details of note management application for detecting and recognizing physical notes are described in U.S. Patent Application 61 844 140 filed Jul. 9 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR NOTE RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT USING COLOR CLASSIFICATION U.S. Patent Application 61 844 152 filed Jul. 9 2013 entitled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR NOTE CONTENT EXTRACTION AND MANAGEMENT USING SEGMENTED NOTES and U.S. Patent Application 61 844 176 filed Jul. 9 2013 SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR NOTE CONTENT EXTRACTION AND MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENTING NOTES the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

As shown in note management application of mobile device receives an input image of a workspace having a plurality of notes . Upon receiving input image note management application may pre processes input image to remove noise by for example normalizing input image to produce normalized image data optimized for subsequent contour detection. One example of normalization is application of a normalization operation in the L a b color space by maximizing the L channel and also the YUV color space by minimizing the Y channel to create normalized input image . L a b may be advantageous to use since the color space may be more robust under many real world conditions. The normalization technique of input image may also be selected from a plurality of normalization techniques dynamically or automatically based on the properties of input image . In general normalization may be used to remove noise and shadows yielding better input to edge detection and feature extraction thereby improving note detection.

Upon normalization note management application may process normalized input image to separate the normalized input image into a plurality of different color channels such as blue color image data green color image data and red color image data . Each of image data may be referred to herein as a channelized version of the input image .

Next note management application separately applies edge detection to each of the channelized version of the input image to transform the input image and produce corresponding images and in which detected edges are enhanced to aid subsequent feature extraction. In the example of note management application applies Canny edge detection which is a multi stage process involving multiple filters. Application of edge detection within each color space transforms the input image and produces resultant black and white images where edges of notes are enhanced.

Continuing to note management application performs feature extraction on the resultant black and white images . That is transformed images for each of the different color channels is further processed to detect contours representing discontinuities in brightness or color thereby converting black and white images into contour images . During feature extraction note management application may identify corners of contours to generate vector forms referred to herein as polygons or shapes described by their corner points that approximate the contours representing discontinuities in brightness or color of different portions of the image. As a result note management application identifies each shape in the different channelized versions of the image data and each shape is represented in vector forms such that the shapes polygons are described by their corner points that approximate the contours representing discontinuities in brightness or color of different portions of the image.

Next note management application processes each polygon to remove any shapes that are asymmetrical or that do not match a pre determined size criterion and or criteria such as noise contours . For example note management application may remove any polygons having vector data indicative of a non square shape. As another example note management application may remove any polygons that significantly exceed or are significantly less than a pre determined size criterion. This may be advantageous in reducing any false positives. Image depicts only for purposes of example each remaining polygon overlaid on original input image .

As shown in note management application further processes the identified polygons to determine groups of polygons that are substantially similar in size and orientation. In the example of note management application identifies a group of polygons in which polygons are substantially similar in size and orientation. For example note management application may determine that polygons are each substantially rectangular in shape and each of their four corners is within a threshold distance from the corresponding corner of the other polygon. As a result note management application identifies a plurality of sets of polygons where each set of polygons corresponds to a different one of the physical notes in the input image. Moreover each set of polygons comprises one or more polygons each of the polygons being detected from a different one of the color channels.

After grouping the polygons note management application analyzes each set of polygons to select one of the polygons for each set to define the boundaries of the respective physical note and to represent the corresponding digital note. In some examples selection of the polygon associated with the corresponding note from an array of notes in input image is based on an evaluation of the relative similarity of polygons to expected shapes of predetermined types of physical notes. For example a best candidate polygon may be selected from a group of polygons after comparing each polygon and assigning scores to each polygon based on the symmetry of the polygon e.g. how closely each of the corners of the vectors of the polygon approach a right angle. In this way note management software reduces each group of polygons such as group associated with a respective underlying physical note to one polygon.

Upon selecting a representative polygon for each physical note note management software creates a corresponding digital note e.g. digital note for which the selected polygon defines the shape and boundary of sub images extracted for each of the digital notes from the input image. Note management software constructs and outputs a graphical user interface in which sub images associated with the digital notes are overlaid on the physical notes detected within the input image to create final overlay image . In this way the GUI presented by note management software may depict a best candidate polygon for each of the digital notes where the polygons may have been selected from a plurality of different color spaces.

In other examples this shape based detection and extraction utilizing a plurality of different color channels may include the use of a gray scale input image lines to form rectangles squares intelligent thresholding or segmentation to create blobs machine learning techniques such as scale invariant feature transform SIFT speeded up robust features SURF trained on a set of sample images and other such techniques. Moreover other image processing techniques may be used in combination with the techniques described herein to improve the accuracy of detection and extraction of the physical notes. For example the shape based multi color channel techniques described herein may be augmented with color classification or segmentation techniques using operations such as an ensemble or voting based classifier Markov models Bayesian statistics and other such techniques.

Some classifiers are generative in nature while others are discriminative. In general generative classifiers generate an individual model for each class e.g. a color and a queried pixel group of pixels value is given a probability score as to whether it belongs to that class or not. Discriminative classifiers on the other hand model the boundary between two or more classes 2 class and multiclass classification respectively . Generative models provide easier generalizability to new classes colors that are not already modeled while separate discriminative models have to be retrained to every existing class colors . Many examples of generative and discriminative classifiers are described in Christopher M. Bishop 2006 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning Information Science and Statistics Springer Verlag New York Inc. Secaucus N.J. USA the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. Some examples of generative models are na ve Bayes classifier Gaussian Mixture Models and other probabilistic Bayesian models using Gaussian or other priors and Dictionary Learning such as those described in Michal Aharon Michael Elad and Alfred Bruckstein 2006 K SVD An Algorithm for Designing Overcomplete Dictionaries for Sparse Representation IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing 54 11 4311 4322 the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. Some examples of discriminative classification models are neural networks Support Vector Machines Decision Trees Linear and Quadratic discriminate classification logistic regression. Other example classification methods are neither generative nor discriminative e.g. nearest neighbor classification algorithm. In addition the performance of any of the above mentioned classification models can be improved by ensemble learning algorithms that combine multiple instances of classification models mentioned above. Ensemble learning may be implemented as Bagging Boosting and their variants.

Initially note management application of mobile device receives an input image of a workspace having a plurality of notes . As described the input image may be captured by image capture device e.g. a camera of mobile device or may be imported from cloud server or another computing device such as computer system or mobile device .

Note identification module of note management application pre processes the input image to remove noise by for example normalizing or thresholding the input image to produce normalized image data .

After pre processing the input image note identification module may process the normalized input image to separate the normalized input image into a plurality of different color channels such as blue color image data green color image data and red color image data .

Upon separating the image data into image data for each of the plurality of different colors note identification module separately applies edge detection to each of the channelized version of the input image to transform the input image and produce enhanced image data for each of the color channels . That is the edges detected within the image data for each of the different colors are transformed to aid subsequent feature extraction.

Note identification module performs feature extraction on the transformed image data for each of the different colors so as to identify for each color channel polygons contained within the different sets of color image data . During this process note identification module may construct data representing each shape in vector form representing the detected edges within the image data e.g. discontinuities in brightness or color.

Note identification module processes the polygons determined from the different color channel image data to pre screen discard any shapes that do not match certain criteria . For example note identification module may discard polygons that are not substantially rectangular in shape that are asymmetrical or that do not match a pre determined size criterion and or other criteria.

Next note identification module further processes the polygons associated with the different color channels to identify and group polygons of different color channels that are substantially similar in size location and orientation . After grouping the polygons note identification module analyzes each set of polygons to select one of the polygons as a representative polygon for the respective physical note and to be used with respect to the corresponding digital note . Upon selecting a representative polygon for each physical note digital note generation module creates a corresponding digital note for which the selected polygon defines the shape and boundary of sub images extracted for each of the digital notes from the input image . In addition user interface constructs and outputs a graphical user interface in which sub images associated with the digital notes are overlaid on the physical notes detected within the input image .

In other examples this shape based detection and extraction utilizing a plurality of different color channels may include the use of a gray scale input image lines to form rectangles squares intelligent thresholding or segmentation to create blobs machine learning techniques such as scale invariant feature transform SIFT speeded up robust features SURF trained on a set of sample images and other such techniques. Moreover other image processing techniques may be used in combination with the techniques described herein to improve the accuracy of detection and extraction of the physical notes. For example the shape based multi color channel techniques described herein may be augmented with color classification or segmentation techniques using operations such as an ensemble or voting based classifier Markov models Bayesian statistics and other such techniques.

In this way the system may create one or more respective digital notes representative of a corresponding one of the recognized physical notes. As one example a record may be created to contain a plurality of database fields including fields for storing the particular content of each color segment of the physical note. The system may associate the content extracted from the visual representation for a given physical note with the corresponding digital note representative of the physical note.
