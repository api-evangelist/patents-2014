For example the battery pack may continue to collect data e.g. monitor medical conditions for a patient to which it is coupled and wirelessly transmits the collected data or an alarm to the mobile device. This is possible since the processors may be powered by the power cell and can be configured to operate whether or not the mobile device is coupled to the battery pack.

In some embodiments of the battery pack battery pack may also include an integrated display or screen. For example the integrated display may be on the outer surface of the back plane of the battery pack. Alternatively the display may slide out from within the housing of the battery pack. This integrated display may allow displaying additional information or data to a user. The additional display screen may be electrically coupled to the mobile device via an interface to allow the mobile device to send images or video to the additional display screen.

In another example the rear of the back plane may house a Braille input and or output interface that electrically coupled a mobile device mounted within the holster or battery pack.

In yet another embodiment the rear of the back plane may provide a keypad that serves as an input to the mobile device.

According to another feature the battery pack and or holster may provide an external interface e.g. Bluetooth wireless interface USB port infrared port etc. that may allow the mobile device mounted in the battery pack and or holster to communicate via that external interface. Thus the external interface may provide a different wireless interface than provided or supported by the internal system of the mobile device.

One or more of the features illustrated in may be rearranged and or combined into a single component or embodied in several components. Additional components may also be added without departing from the invention.

While certain exemplary embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative of and not restrictive on the broad invention and that this invention not be limited to the specific constructions and arrangements shown and described since various other modifications may occur to those ordinarily skilled in the art.
