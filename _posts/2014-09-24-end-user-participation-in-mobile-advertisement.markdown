These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.

It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations drawings and techniques illustrated below but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.

Embodiments of the disclosure are directed to methods and systems for customizing advertising content for use on a mobile communication device. The user interface of a mobile communication device may comprise advertisement spaces that are available for presenting advertisement content. In some cases the advertisement spaces may be located within a graphical user interface GUI of a communication application executed on the device.

In some cases it may be desirable to allow a user to customize the advertisement content that is presented on his or her device. For example personal content such as images video audio etc. may be used to replace at least part of an advertisement that may be presented on the device. If personal images are used in the advertisements on the device a user may be more likely to look at the ads more likely to enjoy the advertisement experience and less likely to be unhappy about the advertisement taking up space on the user interface of the device. For example if a user sees an advertisement for a travel company or vacation related company a user may wish to associate a personal photo of his or her family on vacation with future advertisements from that company or type of company.

This may be accomplished by monitoring the advertisement activity on the mobile device and then allowing the user to customize advertisements from that monitored activity. Personal content may be uploaded to a content data store from the mobile device to be used for a specific ad or type of ad and the uploaded content may be associated with an identifier for that specific ad or type of ad. In some embodiments the content data store may be maintained and or controlled by an ad gateway. The functionality may be provided by a customization application executed by the device which may handle customizing advertisements for a plurality of communication applications. In other cases the individual communication applications may provide this functionality via the settings or a customization tool within each of the applications. In still other cases the ad gateway in communication with the mobile device may provide an interface for a user to choose customization options and then may facilitate the implementation of those choices.

In some cases the uploaded content may be used by an ad provider for other advertisement purposes for example presenting an ad with the content uploaded by a first user in a user interface of an application executed on a second mobile communication device to a second user. This may broaden the resources for the ad provider for a particular ad or type of ad. The ad provider may also form a gallery of uploaded user images from a plurality of users which may be accessed by a user who may then choose customization options from the gallery. Additionally a user may be reimbursed and or recognized for any personal content that is used by the ad provider and or other users. In some cases a user might earn rewards or credits with the ad provider and or service provider when their personal content is uploaded used shared and possibly voted on by other users.

The uploaded content may be associated with an ad identification at the time of uploading. A plurality of different ad content e.g. photographs or digital images associated with the ad content for example a picture of a late model car with a family having fun in the mountains a picture of the same late model car with a different family having fun at the beach may be uploaded independently by different subscribers each associated with the same advertisement for example each associated with the same ad identification. When the second mobile communication device requests an ad a textual component of an ad for the model of car may be selected and one of the plurality of uploaded content may be selected to fill into the ad based on a profile of the user. For example a first user profile may indicate the user enjoys mountain recreation activities and the ad may be filled with the photograph of the car with a family having fun in the mountains. A second user profile may indicate the user enjoys visiting the beach and the ad may be filled with the photograph of the car with a family having fun at the beach.

It is understood that by programming and or loading executable instructions onto the computer system at least one of the CPU the RAM and the ROM are changed transforming the computer system in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software because re spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re spinning a software design. Generally a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware for example in an application specific integrated circuit ASIC because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed by well known design rules to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus likewise a computer that has been programmed and or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.

The secondary storage is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non volatile storage of data and as an over flow data storage device if RAM is not large enough to hold all working data.
