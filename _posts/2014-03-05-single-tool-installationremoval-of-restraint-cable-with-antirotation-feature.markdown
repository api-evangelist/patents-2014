This application is a continuation in part of and claims priority benefit under 35 U.S.C. 120 to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 310 430 filed Dec. 2 2011 titled ANTI ROTATION CABLE RESTRAINT FOR CONNECTING FLEXIBLE DUCTS the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

The present invention generally relates to devices systems and methods for connecting flexible ducts to each other and in particular relates an anti rotation duct restraint device and system thereof and methods for using the anti rotation duct restraint device for connecting ducts with a single tool.

Ducts are commonly used in aircraft houses and vehicles for heating ventilating and cooling by the conveyance delivery and removal of air. Air ducts are designed for the efficient delivery of air and to ensure acceptable indoor air quality as well as thermal comfort. Ducts can be made out of a variety of materials including metals and fiberglass but are typically made from galvanized steel or aluminum sheet metal. The standard and most commonly used material in fabricating ductwork is galvanized steel. For insulation purposes metal ducts can be lined with a fiberglass duct liner or wrapped externally with a fiberglass blanket. Typically sheet metal ducts are installed first and then covered with insulation.

Commercial aircraft have air duct network systems for heating and air conditioning which convey air to the passenger cabin and the cockpit. A central air supply system can be controlled from the cockpit which serves to constantly supply fresh air to the passengers and crew. The fresh air can be taken from the aircraft power unit as the so called bleed air and routed into the interior of the aircraft through a series of ducts and air inlet openings. The bleed air is drawn from the compressor stages of a turbine engine and conducted through the duct network at temperatures of up to 957 F. and pressures of up to 312 psi. The hot fresh air can be cooled and dehumidified and distributed to the various parts of the plane for the comfort of the passengers and crew. Bleed air may also be used for cabin pressurization and wing de icing.

The construction of ductwork starts by measuring the distance and angles to suit the installation. Ducts can be customized for special shapes either on site or in the shop. The duct parts can be cut or bent if required to obtain different fittings e.g. elbows and tapers. For the final assembly the ducts can be connected or bolted together through a series of connectors. The use of connectors however may require a large working area for their installation and may result in a rigid ductwork structure. This is not particularly desirable in aircrafts where ease of installation and motion absorption are important.

It would therefore be helpful to provide new devices systems and methods for connecting flexible ducts particularly an anti rotation duct restraint device and system and methods for using the device and system for installing connecting and removing ducts with single hand using a single tool. Accordingly in one aspect of the invention an anti rotation duct restraint for connecting flexible ducts includes a flexible cable a swaged cable end coupled to the cable along an axis of the cable and a flattened threaded cable end coupled to the cable along the axis of the cable.

In another embodiment of the invention an anti rotation duct restraint system for connecting flexible ducts includes a flexible cable a swaged cable end coupled to the cable along an axis of the cable a flattened threaded cable end coupled to the cable along the axis of the cable a washer wherein the washer fits between the swaged cable end and a first flange of a first flexible duct a mating metal bushing wherein the mating metal bushing is adapted to fit over flattened threaded cable end and wherein the flattened threaded cable end and mating metal bushing together fit into a second flange of a second flexible duct and a nut wherein the nut can be threaded onto the flattened threaded cable end for connecting the first flexible duct with the second flexible duct.

In yet another embodiment of the invention a method for connecting flexible ducts using an anti rotation duct restraint system includes preparing a flexible cable having a swaged cable end coupled to the cable along an axis of the cable and a flattened threaded cable end coupled to the cable along the axis of the cable aligning the swaged cable end with a through hole in a first flange of a first flexible duct and a washer wherein the washer fits between the swaged cable end and the first flange of a first flexible duct aligning the flattened threaded cable end and a mating metal bushing with a through hole in a second flange of a second flexible duct wherein the mating metal bushing is adapted to fit over flattened threaded cable end and wherein the flattened threaded cable end and mating metal bushing together fit into the second flange of the second flexible duct and securing the flattened threaded cable end to the second flange of the second flexible duct using a nut.

These and other features aspects and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings description and claims.

The following detailed description illustrates one or more possible modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention.

The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating general principles and enabling various ways of making and practicing of the invention since the scope of the invention is defined by the appended claims.

Various inventive features are described below that may each be used independently of one another or in combination with other features.

Broadly embodiments described below generally relate to one or more ways to connect duct segments using one or more cable restraints. The cable restraints of one or more of the embodiments may be configured to be anti rotation such that the restraint does not rotate when coupled to a duct flange. In this manner the cable restraints may be attached to or detached from the duct flange using a single tool and or a single hand or other manipulation apparatus .

In one embodiment an anti rotation cam is adapted to prevent rotation of a cable restraint the cam includes a body having a through hole adapted to be coupled to a fitting of the cable restraint a first leg extending out from the body and adapted to prevent the cam from rotating in a clockwise direction and a second leg extending out from the body and adapted to prevent the cam from rotating in a counter clockwise direction. In another embodiment an anti rotation cable restraint for connecting ducts includes a flexible cable a first threaded end coupled to the cable along an axis of the cable and a first anti rotation cam coupled to the first threaded end perpendicular to the axis of the cable the cam being adapted to prevent rotation of the cable and the threaded end when a nut is secured to the first threaded end.

As shown in the anti rotation cams may be V shaped pieces of metal i.e. a triangular shape having two legs that may be coupled to the threaded ends such that the cams rotate when the threaded end rotates. The cams may be fashioned from a sheet of flat metal of an appropriate thickness e.g. a thickness that is at least partly based on the stresses to be absorbed by the cams .

The cable may be made of various materials e.g. braided steel rope cables and or be formed in different lengths as appropriate. The specific dimensions of the cable may be based at least partly on various factors such as the diameter weight operating tension and or flange characteristics of the ducts being connected. In addition the intended use of the ducts may at least partly influence the dimensions of the cables. The ducts and duct flanges may include various materials types etc.

The threaded ends may be any appropriate diameter and or pitch. The diameter of the threaded ends may depend on various factors such as the size of any available through holes in the flanges of the ducts being connected the diameter of a securing nut used to couple each threaded end to a flange etc. The pitch may depend on the type or pitch of the securing nut and or other appropriate factors. The securing nut attached to the threaded joint may be a lock nut i.e. a nut that resists loosening under vibration and or torque . The threaded ends may be attached to the cable in various appropriate ways and or may be formed in conjunction with the cable . For instance the threaded ends may be swaged or welded to the cable may be attached using adhesive etc.

The anti rotation cams may be V shaped pieces of metal of appropriate thickness height and width. The cams may be coupled to the threaded end . The cams may be attached to the threaded ends in various appropriate ways e.g. welding the cams to the threaded ends using a nut forming the cams and threaded ends as a single casting or machined piece using adhesive etc. . The thickness height and or width of the anti rotation cams may be at least partially based on various appropriate factors such as the diameter size and or type of cables the characteristics of the flanges intended use etc.

Although the anti rotation cable restraints have been described with reference to various specific features one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the restraints may be configured in various different ways without departing from the spirit of the invention. For instance although the restraints have been described as being formed of metal components the restraints may also be made at least partly from various other appropriate materials e.g. plastic rubber etc. and in various appropriate ways e.g. welded bonded formed injection molded etc. . As another example although the cams have been described as V shaped the cams may be made in various other appropriate shapes e.g. oval rectangular etc. . The materials manufacturing processes and or shapes used may depend on various appropriate factors associated with various particular applications.

The anti rotation cam may be configured in various appropriate ways to match various flanges. For instance the height or width of the V may be varied such that appropriate mounting clearance is provided by the cable restraint i.e. the V may be sized such that the cable restraint allows some rotational movement without contacting the cable flange . In this manner the restraint may be aligned with an associated attachment point on the flange e.g. the position of the restraint may be varied as the threaded end of the restraint is positioned within a through hole in the flange without having the cam come in contact with the surface of the duct flange in a way that allows some flexibility in the position of the cables as they are attached or detached. In addition the edges of the contact sections may be shaped in various appropriate ways e.g. rounded at various diameters angular etc. .

In another embodiment a method of coupling a first flexible duct with a first flange to a second flexible duct with a second flange using an anti rotation cable restraint includes aligning the cable restraint with a through hole of the first flange securing the cable restraint to the first flange using a first lock nut aligning the cable restraint with a through hole of the second flange and securing the cable restraint to the second flange using a second lock nut.

Different numbers and or types of cable restraints may be used to secure various duct segments depending on various factors. For instance the number of cable restraints used to connect ducts at one location may vary depending on the size of the ducts the operating conditions of the ducts the loads placed on the ducts etc. In addition a single connection may include different restraints e.g. restraints of different physical dimensions different material compositions etc. which may vary depending on the size of the ducts the operating conditions of the ducts the types of ducts etc.

As shown in the anti rotation cams each being coupled to each of the outer threaded fittings which are each coupled to the cable in this example do not allow linear movement of the duct flanges along the cable or linear movement of the ducts corresponding to the flanges . In this manner the anti rotation restraint maintains the desired gap between the ducts by maintaining a corresponding gap between the flanges of the ducts.

The process then secures at the cable restraint to a first duct flange. When the cables are to be disconnected the cable restraint may instead be released from the first duct flange. As described above in reference to when the cable restraint is secured or released the anti rotation cam may prevent the cable restraint from turning allowing one handed installation or removal of a securing nut coupled to a threaded end of the cable restraint.

Next the process secures at the cable restraint to a second duct flange. When the cables are to be disconnected the cable restraint may instead be released from the second duct flange. As above when the cable restraint is secured or released the anti rotation cam prevents the cable restraint from turning allowing one handed installation or removal of a securing nut coupled to the other threaded end of the cable restraint.

Process or portions thereof may be performed multiple times e.g. when installing more than one cable restraint at a connection and or may be partially performed e.g. when disconnecting the cable restraint s from one flange but not the other .

As shown in the unthreaded first end may include a balled or swaged cable end which may be used to secure the flexible cable against the first flange . That is the flexible cable may be inserted through an optional washer and the through hole not shown in the first flange such that the washer fits between the swaged cable end and the first flange . The through hole in the first flange may be of any size diameter so long as the structural integrities of the first flange and first flexible duct are maintained.

The threaded second end may include one or more machined or flattened surfaces not shown which may be inserted into a mating metal bushing having a matching configuration and is adapted to fit over the flattened threaded second end . In some embodiments the threaded second end may include 1 10 flattened surfaces or 1 6 flattened surfaces or 1 4 flattened surfaces or 1 3 flattened surfaces or 2 flattened surfaces. Together the mating metal bushing and threaded second end may be inserted into the through hole not shown in the second flange of the second flexible duct . The through hole of the second flange may also be of any size diameter including about the same diameter size of the first flange in the first flexible duct so long as the structural integrity of the second flange and second flexible duct are maintained.

The threaded second end may extend through the second flange and be secured by a nut to reversibly connect the first flexible duct with the second flexible duct . As the nut is tightened onto the threaded second end the swaged cable end comes to rest on the washer and first flange and the nut on the threaded second end is secured against the mating metal bushing installed into the second flange which prevents the rotation of the flexible cable and the rotation of the first flexible duct and the second flexible duct . This configuration requires using only one tool with one hand to tighten or loosen the nut . The mating parts i.e. the mating metal bushing and threaded second end should be sufficiently robust in order to withstand multiple installation removal cycles. In some embodiments the nut can be a locknut.

In some embodiments the length of the flexible cable allows for a desired space and or angle between the first flexible duct and the second flexible duct . The space and or angle may depend upon the size and types of ducts being connected. For example in some embodiments the space between the first flexible duct and the second flexible duct may be from about 0 cm to about 2.5 cm or from about 0.5 cm to about 2 cm or from about 1.0 cm to about 1.5 cm and the angle may be from about 0 to about 5 or from about 1 to about 4 or from about 2 to about 3 or about 2.5 .

It should be understood of course that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. Also various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives modifications variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims. Unless specifically recited in a claim steps or components of claims should not be implied or imported from the specification or any other claims as to any particular order number position size shape angle color or material.
