A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material that is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever.

This disclosure relates to systems and methods which can determine at least the denomination of a token resting on a surface and more specifically systems and methods which can determine properties of a gaming token resting on a gaming table.

Gaming tokens are well known. Tokens are used in gaming in lieu of cash and usually represent different token denominations. Typically tokens appear as molded plastic cylindrical discs or plastic cylindrical discs with metallic cores or are rectangular tiles and have different color combinations to distinguish denomination value. The disc shaped tokens are often referred to as chips or checks. In many casinos these chips are of solid colors but in others establishments these chips are of different basic colors and have radial bands of a distinguishing color which can be seen when viewing the circular face of the chip as well as when viewing the perimeter of the chip. Thus when the chips are stacked on a playing table surface or in a chip tray the different denominations of the chips can be visually distinguished. Distinguishing between the denominations of the chips is important since each chip represents its stated value and can be exchanged for currency. In casinos in the United States these chips typically have distinguishing colors representing at least the following denominations 1 5 25 100 and 500.

A drawback to using such molded tokens is that manual counting is required which can introduce a human error element into the count. Routinely floor personnel walk to each gaming table to count the chips in the chip trays. They must through observation of the number of stacks of a known number of chips of the same denomination make this determination without significantly interrupting play. It would be useful to obtain accurate chip counts without relying upon the expertise of floor personnel to assemble and count the chip stacks.

Regarding fraud considerations it has been known for players to past post which means surreptitiously increasing their wager by adding chips after the result is known. It would be useful if there were a system or method adapted to detect this type of cheating. Other fraud considerations include the counterfeiting of chips. It would also be useful to prevent the use of counterfeit chips.

Additionally casinos like to track the game play of their players for the purposes of rating the player s worth to the casino. Thus player tracking systems have been developed. For table game players to gain a rating floor personnel typically watch the play of the table game players over time. The floor personnel then estimate the time the player spends at the game and the average wager of the player for game hand based upon a known estimated measured or calculated rate of hand play. Using this information the floor personnel can estimate how much the player will likely lose to the casino. This amount along with the total amounts wagered can be used in determining the worth of the player to the casino. The player can be reward in comps rewards in meals gifts cash back and the like which may be provided to the player based upon these determinations to instill player loyalty.

It would be useful if the table game rating process could be more reliable and less dependent on the skill of the floor personnel to make the process more accurate and consistent. Over compensating the player is a loss to the casino. Under compensating the player frustrates the purpose for the program.

It would also be useful if casino and other gaming establishments could distinguish between their issued chips and chips from other casinos gaming establishments. Accepting another casino s chips typically results in the inconvenience of having to present these chips for exchange.

Additionally it would be useful for inventory purposes if the chip amounts in circulation were able to be accurately determined. By determining how many chip are on hand and how many chip are in play the number of the chips that have been lost or kept by players as souvenirs may be calculated.

One of the technologies used by casino chip manufacturers to address the issue of counterfeit chips in table game operations is RFID technology. Typically an RFID chip contains an RFID tag embedded inside the chip. The RFID tag usually contains the ID of the chip and may include other pertinent data. These are usually passive RFID tags containing a radio device that broadcast the serial number when brought close to a RFID reader. With the help of RFID tags and readers systems in the casino identify genuine chips and fake chips.

One of the common issues that occurs with use of RFID chips in casino is that the ambient RF Radio Frequency noise caused by mobile phones displays fluorescent lights and other electronic equipment as well as the presence of RF reflector e.g. metal objects near to the reader results in problems with the RFID technology. These problems may manifest themselves by impacting the RFID reader performance and accuracy of chips detection in a specific bet area.

In another aspect of some embodiments E Chips are associated with a particular player or players. Additionally the E chip capacitive coupling system and method greatly enhances inventory management of the E Chips. Continuing the E chip capacitive coupling system and method may increase the game speed since chips do not need to be manual counted which can be a time consuming and cumbersome process. Moreover the E chip capacitive coupling system and method can detect various kinds of fraud from players.

Notably the E chip capacitive coupling system and method includes chip duplication prevention security measures for re programmability. In another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip stores information related to a specific player Player ID to whom chips has been issued by casino. In still another aspect the E chip may communicate with other chips Inter chip communication in the chip stack using capacitive coupling. Continuing in yet another aspect the E chip may communicate with the gaming table table to chip communication and vice versa using capacitive coupling.

Referring now to capacitive coupling occurs between two parallel conductive plates separated by a dielectric medium. When a high frequency signal applied to one of the conductive plates energy is transferred to second plate. The energy transferred depends on 1 the frequency of the signal applied to the first plate 2 the distance between the two plates 3 the area of overlap of the plates and the permittivity of the dielectric medium dielectric constant .

Referring now to the application of capacitive coupling in the E chip capacitive coupling system and method is shown. Three E Chips are placed as a stack where the E Chips are called T top M Middle and B Bottom . Each E Chip has two conductive layers one on top and the other one at the bottom. A parallel plate capacitor is formed between the top layer of the M chip and the bottom layer of the T chip. When a high frequency signal is applied to the bottom plate i.e. the top layer of Chip M energy gets transferred to the top plate i.e. the bottom layer of T chip . Additionally a parallel plate capacitor is formed between the bottom layer of the M chip and the top layer of the B chip. When a high frequency signal is applied to the bottom plate top layer of Chip B energy gets transferred to the top plate bottom layer of M chip . Data communication may be achieved between the chips by applying high frequency signal to the top or the bottom layers of the chips.

Referring now to the circuitry of an E Chip in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method is shown. In one embodiment the microcontroller has two I O pins connected to the top and bottom circular conductive layers. These I O pins carry high frequency signals containing communication data necessary for capacitive coupling which are highlighted by green colored lines in . Continuing in one embodiment an ultra thin battery supplies power to the microcontroller which is highlighted by a red colored line in . A battery is used with minimum leakage current.

Referring still to as well as the components of an E Chip in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method are shown. In one embodiment the microcontroller marked as Controller in is an embedded microcontroller typically an 8 bit ultra low power microcontroller. A microcontroller is selected that consumes ultra low power in sleep mode typically 0.1 UA and has small wake up time on receiving an interrupt. In one aspect the controller uses its internal clock as this avoids the use of external oscillator which adds to the size and cost. In another aspect the controller is driven at its lowest clock speeds to keep the power consumption in active mode least. In still another aspect the controller mainly performs I O operation during its active mode. It also performs data processing tasks when necessary.

In one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method shown in a lightweight ultra thin battery is included in the system that supplies power to the microcontroller. In one embodiment this battery is a button cell of 3.3 v and 100 mAh capacity. Ultra thin batteries are also available in markets which are much thinner than those button cell batteries. In another embodiment this battery may be embedded into the PCB board.

Referring now to in some embodiments of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip contains flat circular conductive layers made of copper or any other conductive material marked as A2 in . In one embodiment this conductive layer is a thin layer of copper laid over dielectric substrate. Thickness of this copper layer is in order of few microns. This copper layer is coated with a layer of insulating material which is in order of few microns. This flat circular conductive layer forms one of the parallel plates of the capacitor. In one such embodiment there are two layers in each chip one on top and one at the bottom.

In some embodiments of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip contains a flat circular insulating layer on top of the conductive layer that is marked as A1 in . In one embodiment this insulating layer is coated over flat circular conductive layers. This layer prevents the circular conductive layer being touched by ground ring when another chip is placed above or below. Thus the circular insulating layer protects the circular conductive layer from being shorted to ground.

Continuing in some embodiments of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip contains a flat ring shaped conductive layer that runs around the periphery of the chip that is marked as B in . In one embodiment this is a thin nickel plated layer using Electro less nickel plating. Typically Nickel is selected as the material for this layer since it is a very good conductor of electricity as well as being highly resistant to tarnish and wear. Electro less nickel plating enables the surface to be very smooth and flat thereby enabling a firm contact between chips when placed on top of each other. This smooth flat ring surface is used for grounding purpose between two chips. The ring shaped conductive layer makes the circuit complete for communication between two chips.

Referring now to in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method communication between the chips is described below. In this example the chips are named T op and B ottom . For chip T to send information to chip B chip T s controller sends high frequency signals containing data to chip T s bottom conductive layer. This signal is then sent by capacitive coupling to the top layer of chip B. The top layer in chip B sends the signal to chip B s controller. In this manner chip B receives the data from T. If chip B wants to send information to chip T chip B s controller sends high frequency signal containing data to chip B s top conductive layer. The signal is then sent by capacitive coupling to the bottom layer of chip T. The bottom layer in chip T then sends the signal to chip T s controller. In this manner chip T receives the data from chip B.

In another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the same logic may be extended if the chip stack has multiple chips. Each of the chips communicates with the chip above or below in the same manner as explained above. The bottom most chip on a chip stack communicates to the table transceiver in the same manner.

Referring now to in another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method a stack of chips T N to T 1 are placed on the table. Chip T 1 is at the bottom of the table and Chip T N is at the top. illustrates how the data is communicated to the table transceiver from chip T N to chip T 4 chip T 4 to chip T 3 and the like and finally from chip T 1 to the table transceiver. Chip T N sends information to chip T 4. Next chip T N s controller sends high frequency signal containing data to chip T N s bottom conductive layer. The signal is then sent by capacitive coupling to the top layer of chip T 4. The top layer in chip T 4 then sends the signal to chip T 4 s controller. In this manner chip T 4 receives the data from chip T N. Continuing chip T 4 sends information to chip T 3. Next chip T 3 s controller sends high frequency signal containing data to chip T 3 s bottom conductive layer. The signal is then sent by capacitive coupling to the top layer of chip T 2. The top layer in chip T 2 then sends the signal to chip T 2 s controller. In this manner T 2 receives the data from chip T 3. Accordingly data gets progressively communicated to chip T 1. Chip T 1 sends information to table transceiver. Here T 1 s controller sends high frequency signal containing data to chip T 1 s bottom conductive layer. The signal is then sent by capacitive coupling to the top layer the table transceiver. The top layer in the table transceiver then sends the signal to the transceiver s controller. In this manner the table transceiver receives the data from chip T 1.

Refer now to fabrication of E Chip is described below accordingly to one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method. In one embodiment an E Chip has four PCB Printed Circuit Board layers. As shown in Layer 1 is the top most layer of the PCB. In one embodiment Layer 1 contains a flat conductive layer of copper a layer of insulating material lay over circular conductive copper layer and a flat conductive ring layer plated with nickel. As shown in Layer 2 is the middle layer of the PCB. In one embodiment Layer 2 contains an embedded battery for the electronics which are in Layer 3 . Layer 2 also contains electrical routing needed to connect Layer 1 and Layer 4. Additionally Layer 2 is the thickest of all layers and provides mechanical strength to the chip. As noted above Layer 3 contains the electronics e.g. controller used by the E Chip to perform its operation. Layer 3 is the thinnest layer and is embedded into Layer 2. As shown in Layer 4 is the bottom most layer. Layer 4 is a replica of the top layer in terms of dimension and functionality. In one embodiment Layer 4 contains a flat conductive layer of copper a layer of Insulating material lay over circular conductive copper layer and a flat conductive ring layer plated with nickel.

In one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method these layers contain very tiny lead balls at their contacts points. When these layers are properly aligned pressed together and exposed to hot air the lead balls in each layer melt and fuse the layers together strongly holding each of these layers and making the entire set of layers look like a single monolithic layer. Referring now to in one embodiment the thickness of the E Chip is 3 mm which is the same as an existing casino tournament chips. In other embodiments the E Chips may be thinner or thicker by using thinner or thicker PCBs respectively. Since casinos typically desire to keep the look and feel of the E Chips like a normal chip painting of conductive ink or color may be done on the flat conductive ring. The painting may be performed using screen printing technology or any other technology for printing conductive ink smoothly over the surface.

Referring now to the clothing on the gaming table is now described according to another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method. The table transceivers receive information from the E chip stack placed on the table betting areas. To enable communication between the E chip stack and the table transceivers the cloth on the table is appropriately constructed and configured.

According to one embodiment the longitudinal section of the table cloth is shown in . In one such embodiment the clothing on the table has three layers. The top layer which includes conductive polymer lines on the top serves for grounding purpose. The top layer of the table is normally made of wool or polyester. The conductive polymer lines are printed on this layer. The thickness of the conductive polymer is on the order of few microns. This conductive polymer is transparent and is not be visible to the naked eye. Application of conductive polymer on the cloth does not cause any change in the cloth s look and feel. The distance between two conductive polymer lines is less than the diameter of the E Chip.

Continuing the middle B layer shown in is the insulating textile layer. In one embodiment this layer is water resistant so that any liquid spilled on it may be cleaned away. In another aspect this layer is on the order of less than 1 mm.

Finally the bottom C layer is also a conductive polymer layer. This bottom layer carries capacitive coupled high frequency signals to the transceiver. In one embodiment the thickness of conductive polymer layer at the bottom of the table cloth is on the order of microns.

Referring now to in another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the table transceiver circuitry is placed below the conductive polymer layer at several betting points. When an E chip stack is placed in a betting area the conductive ring in the bottom side of the bottom most chip touches the polymer lines on the top layer of the cloth. The polymer lines form the electrical ground making the circuit complete. With the circuit complete the bottom conductive layer of the E chip and the conductive polymer at the bottom of the table clothing form the parallel plate capacitor. The insulating cloth layer acts as the dielectric medium between the parallel plates.

As shown in in another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method table transceivers are placed below the betting areas of the gaming table cloth. In one embodiment the transceiver is a small embedded system with a microcontroller. The table transceivers poll for the presence of E chip stacks. There can be multiple E chip stacks on a given betting area. The table transceivers send the data obtained from the chip stack to the table system. In some embodiments there are several table transceivers placed for a given table. shows an example of a table layout.

As shown in in another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip stack communicates with the table transceiver using capacitive coupling. In this embodiment the conductive ring of bottom chip A in the stack touches the polymer lines on top surface of the cloth T . This makes the conductive ring electrically grounded and hence completes the circuit. A parallel plate capacitor is formed between the bottom conductive layer of the bottom most chip A on the table and the conductive polymer layer of the table cloth B . The bottom conductive polymer of the table cloth is connected as an input to the controller of the table transceiver C . The bottom most E chips sends high frequency signal to the table transceiver through the capacitive coupling between the E chip stack and table transceiver. The table transceiver controller is connected to the table system D .

In one embodiment the table system polls each table transceiver at a fixed frequency. If there is an E chip stack on a betting area the transceiver polls the E chip stack starting the communication with the bottommost E chip of the stack and progressively communicating up to the topmost chip of the stack. The response of the topmost E chip is progressively communicated to the bottom most chip and then to the table transceiver. In another aspect there are several table transceivers for a given table. The table transceivers are attached to the table. All the table transceivers send the data to the table system.

Referring to another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the central table system is now described. The central table system is a PC based system connected to the table transceivers through a custom multiplexer or wireless medium like Bluetooth Wi Fi and the like. The multiplexer Bluetooth Wi Fi receives the input from the table transceivers and sends the input to the central table system through a communications port such as serial port or USB. In one embodiment the central table system polls each of the transceivers periodically. As such when an E chip stack is kept on the table it is immediately recognized by the table system. The table system monitors the E chip stack placements in betting areas generates alerts on fraudulent chips and reports the association of player and chips to the central chip tracking system.

Referring to still another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the central chip tracking system is now described as shown in . The central chip tracking system is a server based system that is connected to the table system on each table. Continuing the central chip tracking system receives input from the table systems periodically and keeps track of chips issued to players. Additionally the central chip tracking system is configured to 1 track E chip inventory such as the number of E chips issued and available 2 track the mapping between player ID and chip IDs 3 Keep track of mapping between table id and chips 4 track the mapping between dealer ID and E chips and 5 generate reports on the E chip data.

With respect to another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the E chip functional scenarios are described below. An E chip stack may be placed in multiple ways by a patron or a dealer on a gaming table. In a first example shown in the E chips are completely lined up with each other with each E chip completely overlapping the E chip below it. In a second example shown in the E chips partially overlap with part of the E chip s top and bottom surfaces overlapping the E chip above or below it. In a third example shown in the E chips do not overlap but have a tilted sliding contact.

Referring again to the first example shown in the scenario of perfectly overlapping E Chips is described. In this first example two E Chips placed on top of each other to form a perfectly overlapping stack of E Chips. Since the E Chips overlap fully the conductive ring ensures common grounding between two E Chips. The top conductive layer of bottom E Chip and bottom conductive layer of E Chip top act as plates of a parallel plate capacitor. These two plates are separated by a thin layer of air in between the chips as dielectric. Even a thin insulator coating on a conductive layer contributes as an effective dielectric. shows an electrically modeling of a stack of perfectly overlapping E Chips. Since the E Chips are perfectly overlapping each other effective capacitance is at a maximum making inter chip capacitive communication possible.

Referring again to the second example shown in the scenario of partially overlapping E Chips is described. In this second example two E Chips are placed in a partially overlapping configuration to form a stack. Though the E Chips only overlap partially the conductive rings of the two E Chips touch each other and ensure common grounding between two E Chips. Due to this configuration the top conductive layer of the bottom E Chip and bottom conductive layer of the top E Chip act as plates of a parallel plate capacitor. These two plates are separated by a thin layer of air in between the chips as a dielectric. Even a thin insulator coating on a conductive layer contributes as an effective dielectric. shows an electrically modeling of a partially overlapping stack of E Chips. Since E Chips are partially overlapping the effective capacitance decreases. However this decreased capacitance has been found sufficient enough for inter chip capacitive communication.

Referring again to the third example shown in the scenario of E Chips in a Tilted Sliding position is described. In this embodiment a parallel capacitor cannot be formed and hence the E Chips cannot communicate with each other. shows an electrically modeling of a tilted sliding stack of E Chips. Since the E Chips are not overlapping in this third example the effective capacitance is zero. Due to the effective capacitance being zero it is not possible to have inter chip capacitive communication when the chips are configured in this manner.

The following example is a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method as shown in . In this example a stack of chips are named E Chip T1 T2 . . . Tn. E Chip T1 is placed at the bottom of the stack touching the table while E Chip Tn is at the top of the stack. Below are use cases that provide examples of E Chip stack table communication flow.

This example begins with the issuance of E Chips to a player. First the player provides his player card to the dealer. The dealer swipes the player card. The player attempts to purchase a certain value of E Chips. The dealer then picks up the E Chips from the dealer E Chip stack. The E Chips are placed on the chip issue area on the dealer side of the table. If player is issued a stack of E Chips named T1 T2 . . . Tn E Chip T1 is placed at the bottom of the stack touching the gaming table while E Chip Tn is at the top of the stack.

The table transceiver sends a periodic poll with casino ID to check if an E Chip stack has been placed. If there is no stack placed the table transceiver does not receive a response. When the E Chip T1 touches the table it receives the poll from the transceiver. The E Chip T1 then validates the casino ID of the table transceiver and forwards the poll to E Chip T2 which in turn validates the E Chip T1 casino ID and forwards the poll to E Chip T3. Finally the poll reaches E Chip Tn at the top of the stack. When the E Chip Tn attempts to forward the poll it does not receive a response since E Chip Tn is the top of the stack. Thus E Chip Tn determines that it is the top of the stack.

At this point of time the player ID in the E Chip is null i.e. the E Chip belongs to dealer . In some embodiments the chip contains other details such as casino ID Chip ID Chip denomination and the like. The E Chip Tn sends the casino data and chip data to E Chip T n 1 as well as the player ID which is null . The E Chip T n 1 then compares the casino data of E Chip Tn to validate E Chip Tn. If there is a match E Chip T n 1 sends its casino data along with E Chip Tn and E Chip T n 1 chip data to T n 2 . The E Chip T n 2 compares the casino data of T n 1 to validate the Tn. If there is a match E Chip T n 2 sends its casino data along with Tn T n 1 and T n 2 chip data to T n 3 . This process continues until the E Chip T1 is reached.

The E Chip T1 sends the accumulated chip data from the E Chip Tn through the E Chip T1 to the table transceiver. The table transceiver sends the E Chip Tn through the E Chip T1 chip data transceiver ID and the player ID to the table system. The table system records the chip data against the player ID which is null. Next the table system sends the player ID of player whose player card has been swiped to the table transceiver. The table transceiver sends poll with the player ID of player whose player card has been swiped along with casino ID to E Chip T1 which validates casino ID and writes the player ID on the controller memory. It then sends the player ID and casino ID to E Chip T2. E Chip T2 receives the player ID from E Chip T1 which writes the player ID on the controller memory. It then sends the player ID to E Chip T3. This process continues until E Chip Tn is reached.

When the E Chip Tn realizes that it is the top chip it sends back a player ID along with chip data and casino data to E Chip T n 1 which is forward successively to E Chip T1 then the table transceiver and finally to the table system. At this point the E Chip stack has been associated with the particular player ID. Accordingly the player may take the E Chip stack and begin wagering.

Optionally E Chips may store player position at a gaming table instead of using player card identification. In another embodiment this system may be used for uncarded players as well.

The following example is a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow on a Baccarat table in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method as shown in . First the player buys 50 worth of E chips. Then the dealer issues five E chips worth 10 each. The dealer places the E chip stack five 10 chips in the dealer area. Next the player ID is entered into the table system e.g. the player swipes his player card . The table system sends message containing the Player ID to the table transceiver connected to dealer area. Next the table transceiver sends message containing Player ID and casino ID to the bottommost E chip in the E chip stack. The bottommost E chip validates the casino ID sent by the transceiver and then writes the player ID into the RAM. Player ID is written only if the player ID is previously null. If the player ID is already present then an alert message is sent to the table system.

Continuing the bottommost chip propagates the message containing the player ID and casino ID to the E chip above it. The E chip above sends the message containing player ID and casino ID to the next E chip. This process continues until the topmost E chip receives the message. The topmost E chip attempts to send the message containing the player ID and casino ID from the E chip above it. However since there is no E chip above top most E chip does not receive an ACK acknowledgement response within a set time period and then times out. Accordingly since the topmost E chip does not receive any response it determines itself to be the topmost E chip. Next the top most chip E chip its message containing player ID casino ID and aggregated denomination to the E chip below it. Upon receiving the message from topmost E chip the E chip below it validates casino ID sent and aggregates its denomination.

The E chip below the topmost E chip sends its message which contains the aggregated denomination i.e. the sum of all the denomination values starting from the topmost E chip to the current E chip player ID and casino ID. This process continues until the bottommost E chip is reached. The bottom E chip sends the total denomination values of the E chip stack casino ID and player ID to the table transceiver. The table transceiver sends the data to the table system. The table system records player ID and the value of chips. This value is sent to central chip tracking server. The central server updates player chip relation. The central server communicates back to table manager and to the table transceiver. Hence any information from central server may be sent to individual E chip stack placed on the table. Finally the dealer gives the E chip stack to the player with his player ID stored in RAM of each E chip.

The following example is a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow for a player placing a bet at a gaming table according to one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method as shown in . First the player chooses a betting area. Next the player places part of the stack of chips or the complete stack of chips that he has purchased in the betting area. In this embodiment the player places a stack of chips named E Chip T1 E Chip T2 . . . E Chip Tn on the betting area. The E Chip T1 is placed at the bottom of the stack touching the table while the E Chip Tn is at the top of the stack of E Chips. The table transceiver below the betting area sends a periodic poll to check if an E Chip stack has been placed. If no E Chip stack has been placed the table transceiver does not receive a response. If the E Chip T1 is touching the table it receives the poll from the table transceiver. The E Chip T1 then forwards the poll which contains the casino ID to the E Chip T2 which in turn forwards the poll to the E Chip T 3. Finally the poll reaches the E Chip Tn at the top of the stack. The E Chip Tn attempts to send the poll to an E Chip above it however since the E Chip Tn is the top of the stack the E Chip Tn does not receive a response. Accordingly the E Chip Tn concludes that it is the top of the stack.

The E Chip Tn sends the casino data player ID and chip data to the E Chip T n 1 . The E Chip T n 1 validates the E Chip Tn casino ID. If there is a match E Chip T n 1 sends its casino data player ID and accumulated chip data along with Tn s chip data and player ID to the E Chip T n 2 . The E Chip T n 2 validates the E Chip Tn 1 casino ID. If there is a match E Chip T n 2 sends its casino data player ID and chip data along with accumulated chip data and player ID for E Chip Tn and E Chip T n 1 . This information is sent to E Chip T n 3 . This process continues until the E Chip T1 is reached. At this point of time the E Chip T1 has 1 Player ID in chips from E Chip T2 E Chip T3 . . . to E Chip Tn and 2 accumulated chip data of E Chips from E Chip T2 E Chip T3 . . . to E Chip Tn. The E Chip T1 sends the accumulated chip data from the E Chip T 1 through E Chip Tn to the table transceiver. The table transceiver sends the E Chip T 1 through E Chip Tn chip data transceiver ID and the player IDs to the table system. The table system records the chip data against the player IDs. There can be multiple player IDs on the given stack of chips. This procedure records information on player ID bet amount bet area information.

As described above each bet area can be sending information on various chip stacks kept on the table at the same time. All of this is data is accumulated by the table system and the chip tracking system. The accumulated data can be as follows 

According to one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method and based on the rules of the current game the system may enable multiple players to keep their chips on the same stack. For example in Roulette many patrons may keep their chips in same stack. In such an embodiment the transceiver accepts multiple player IDs along with chip data for the same chip stack. However in a game like Baccarat a patron cannot keep his chips on another player stack. In this case the table transceiver will not accept multiple player IDs along with chip data for the same chip stack. Instead the table transceiver will flag an error.

The following example is a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow on a Baccarat table in one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method as shown in . The player bets three E Chips worth 10 each by placing an E Chip stack in player betting area. The table system sends the CalculateAmt message with casino ID to the table transceiver connected to betting area. The table transceiver sends message CalculateAmt and casino ID to the bottommost E Chip in the E Chip stack. The bottommost E Chip validates the transceiver and propagates the CalculateAmt message to the E Chip above it. The E Chip above sends the CalculateAmt message to the next chip. This process continues until the topmost E Chip receives the message from the bottommost E Chip. Finally the topmost E Chip attempts to sends the message containing Casino ID and Calculate amount message to the E Chip above it. However since there is no E Chip above the topmost E Chip does not receive any ACK acknowledgement response within a preset time period and thus times out. Since the topmost E Chip does not receive any response it determines itself to be the topmost E Chip.

Continuing the topmost E Chip sends its SendDenom message which contains its denomination Player ID and casino ID. The E Chip below the topmost E Chip sends SendDenom message which contains the aggregated denomination sum of all the denomination values starting from the topmost chip up to the current chip player ID and casino ID. This process continues until the bottommost E Chip is reached. The bottommost E Chip sends the total denomination values of the chip stack player ID and casino ID to the table transceiver. The table transceiver validates the bottommost E Chip and sends the data to the table system. The table system records player ID and the value of chips. This information is sent to central table server. The central server then communicates back to the Table Manager and to the table transceiver. Hence any information from the central server can be sent to individual E Chip stacks placed on the table.

The following additional example is a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow for a player placing a bet at a Baccarat table according to one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method. After the dealing is done the patrons either win or lose. When a patron wins the patron is issued newer E Chips. The process is same as the one described above. In one example patron 1 has placed bets on Player area of Baccarat Table. This begins with the patron occupying betting area 1. The patron places a 100 bet on the player. After the deal the player wins. The patron wants to reach 200. Dealer places 100 worth of E Chips in betting area 1 on the player box. These E Chips have the player ID as null. The table transceiver reads the player ID as null. Since the table transceiver knows the status of the deal the table transceiver writes the player ID into all of the E Chips in the E Chip stack. Finally the information on chip data is entered into the table system and communicated to the chip tracking system.

The following additional example is also a functional description of E Chip stack communication flow for a player placing a bet at a Baccarat table according to one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method however in this example but the patron has lost. In this example the patron has occupied betting area 1. Next the patron has placed 100 bet on the player. After the deal the player loses. The patron wants to get back the 100 he has bet and lost. The dealer takes the E Chip stack from betting area 1 on the player box. The dealer places the E Chip stack in the dealer area and marks a return on the system. The dealer transceiver then reads the player ID and the chip data and dissociates the chips from the player ID. Next the dealer transceiver writes the player ID as null on all the E Chips in the E Chip stack. These E Chips may be issued to another patron. The above solution works for games like Baccarat Blackjack poker and the like where each patron has a specific bet area. For games like Sic Bo and Roulette the above approach is different.

Another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method is directed towards E Chip accounting. At the beginning of each accounting day a dealer is given a set of E chips. The E chips may be dispensed to the dealer in the following ways 1 using an automated dispenser that dispenses the E chips with information such as dealer ID and all player IDs to Null and 2 entering chip data against the dealer in the E Chip accounting database. At the end of the business day the dealer returns the E chips. An automated sorting machine sorts and counts the E chips. Additionally the dealer IDs are read. There can be E chips with different dealer IDs as patrons can keep moving around tables. The dealer ID chip ID return details are accounted for in the database. At the end of the accounting day system has information such as E Chip IDs associated with the dealer E Chip IDs associated with players E Chips not issued inventory and casino liability chips still with players .

In one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method fake bad E chips may be identified without using special equipment. In one scenario one of the E chips in the E chip stack is bad corrupted or counterfeit. A bad E chip chip is a genuine E Chip with the dead battery or with another component s that has become corrupt . For example it is also possible for the microcontroller to become corrupt. In another scenario one of the E Chips in the stack may be a fake i.e. counterfeit E Chip. Such a fake E Chip looks like a genuine E Chip but does not have the same circuitry inside of the E Chip. If the bad or fake E Chip is placed in an E Chip stack table transceiver receives data up to the E Chip below the bad fake E Chip. For example in a stack of E Chip T1 to E Chip Tn if E Chip Tk is faulty the transceiver receives data from E Chip T1 to E Chip T k 1 . The E Chip Tk does not respond since it is not a functional genuine E Chip. Since the expected value and the actual value of the E Chip stack do not tally it can be determined that E Chip Tk is the faulty E Chip.

In another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method fake bad E chips may be identified using special equipment that supplies current to the controller of an E Chip to find out if it is a genuine E Chip. In such an embodiment the fake bad E chip identification equipment has a transceiver similar to one on the gaming table. Additionally the fake bad E chip identification equipment may include a tool to pierce through the top layer of a suspect E chip and provide power to the microcontroller. If the microcontroller of the suspect E chip is functional the microcontroller communicates its chip data to the transceiver. In this manner the fake bad E chip identification equipment assists in identifying bad corrupted E chips. If the fake bad E chip identification equipment is used on a fake i.e. counterfeit E Chip the transceiver does not receive any data from the E chip enabling the determination of a fake chip.

In still another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method fake bad E chips may be identified using other approaches. One such alternative approach is a sensor based approach. Referring now to in this approach a two light sensor is embedded into the E Chip with a slit on the top and bottom surfaces of the E Chip. The slits are covered with glass so that light may pass through the slits. This sensor is placed at the center of the E Chip to avoid a false trigger due to the partial overlapping of other E Chips. In this manner the central chip tracker system is informed that a bad chip is detected on a particular chip stack at a particular position. Alternatively chip may contain an error LED to indicate that the top E Chip cannot be contacted.

In one embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the method of bad chip detection using sensor is explained the bad E Chip is in the middle of the stack. In one embodiment shown in there are three E chips T op M iddle and B ottom . The light slits in the B ottom E chip are covered by the M iddle E chip and the table. The light slits of M iddle E chip are covered by M iddle and T op E chip. One light slit of the T op E chip is covered by the M iddle E chip and the other light slit is open allowing light to pass through. Thus only the T op E chip in the stack is able to sense light. Refer truth table 1 stated above.

Continuing the table transceiver sends a poll to the B ottom E chip. Next the B ottom E chip sends an acknowledge message to table transceiver and forwards the poll to the M iddle E chip. In this embodiment the M iddle E chip is a fake bad E chip so it does not respond to the poll sent by the B ottom E chip. The B ottom E chip then checks its light sensor reading. Since both the slits are closed i.e. the light is blocked by the M iddle E chip and the table the B ottom E chip cannot sense light and thus the B ottom E chip knows that it is not the T op E chip. Since there no response from the chip above i.e. the bad E chip the B ottom E chip sends an error message to the table transceiver. The table transceiver in turn sends this message to table manager and central chip tracking system.

In yet another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method fake bad E chips may be identified using an input ring embodiment. In this embodiment a flat thin conductive ring is circumscribed very near to the outer ground ring on both top and bottom side of E Chip. As shown in a small aberration is introduced to ensure inner ring is shorted to the outer ground ring when E Chips overlap perfectly. The inner ring is connected to the input port of the microcontroller. Accordingly it stays in a logic high state. When an E Chip is placed on top surface the outer ground ring touches the inner ring causing the input port pin to be shorted to the electrical ground. This transition is recognized by the E Chip as identifying the presence of an E Chip on the top surface.

In one embodiment an E Chip is characterized as bad when it does not respond to any communication request. The presence of a non responsive E Chip is identified by the E Chip below it and is reported to the table server.

In another embodiment of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method fake bad E chips may be identified using a sensor embodiment. In this embodiment sensor is used to identify a fake bad E chip in the center of a stack. In one embodiment shown in there are three E chips the T op E chip the M iddle E chip and the B ottom E chip. The B ottom E chip has one side placed on table with transparent conductive polymer lines and has the other side touching the M iddle E chip which is placed on top of the B ottom E chip. Thus both the input port pins are shorted to ground. The M iddle E chip is placed between B ottom E chip and T op E chip. Accordingly both of the input port pins are shorted to ground. The T op E chip is placed above M iddle E chip and there is no E chip on top of it. Thus for T op E chip only one side of the input port pins are shorted to ground and input port pin on the other side is open. Please see the Truth Table 2 above.

Continuing the table transceiver sends a poll to the B ottom E chip. The B ottom E chip then sends an acknowledge message to table transceiver and forwards the poll to the M iddle E chip. Since the M iddle E chip is a fake bad chip in this example the M iddle E chip does not respond to the poll sent by the B ottom E chip. After a preset time out period is reached the B ottom E chip checks its input port pin reading. Since both of the input port pin are shorted to ground by the M iddle E chip and the table the B ottom E chip input port pin cannot sense a logic high state. Accordingly the B ottom E chip knows that it is not the T op E chip. Since there is no response from the chip above B ottom E chip sends error message to the table transceiver which then sends this error message confirming that the M iddle E chip is a fake bad chip to table manager and central chip tracking system.

Using another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method the life of the battery for an E chip may be determined. The microcontroller unit MCU will run as long as battery is alive. Battery life may be determined using the parameters of a 2 self discharge per year a capacity 100 mAh 10 of the day the chip is in betting area on the table communicating with the table transceiver and the CPU being active for 30 milliseconds per second. According to the above parameters the life of the battery of the E Chip is expected to be approximately 9.74 years.

Another aspect of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method enables chip duplication prevention security measures for re programmable chips. As the only way to duplicate an E Chip is by transferring the codes from original chip to fake chip. To prevent chip from duplicating following methods can be employed 1 using a blow JTAG Joint Test Action Group fuse so that no reprogramming can take place 2 employing a security password for Bootstrap Loader such that if a wrong password is entered the code memory is erased and 3 storing the E Chip program in NV RAM Non Volatile RAM rather than the traditional ROM or EPROM which ensures that anyone trying to tamper with the chip will result in complete loss of program data.

In other embodiments of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method E Chip associates player with chip by storing the player ID in the E Chip as well as associating the player to chip in the casino systems. In one embodiment the E Chip performs processing such as calculating the total amount of money in a stack thereby improving game speed for table games. In another aspect of one embodiment the E Chips enable inter chip communication i.e. a first E chip can communicate with other E chips in the stack . In still another aspect of one embodiment the E Chip uses very near field capacitive coupling communication making the chip very insensitive to ambient interferences thereby creating more reliable and faster communication. In yet another aspect of one embodiment the E Chip opens up future table innovation such as a fully automated casino table which can pay back players based on game results e.g. faster and better chip dispensers sorters and the like .

In still other aspects of the E chip capacitive coupling system and method E chips improve inventory management by providing greater granularity of information as well as faster inventory management. In another aspect of one embodiment E Chips provide player statistics at more granular form enabling improving player analysis. In still another aspect E Chips provide a high level of security since E Chips are very difficult to duplicate E Chip. Additionally E Chips are trackable. In still another aspect E Chips are able to detect any fraud or malpractice such as post betting chip stealing and the like thereby improving the casino operations. For example if the bet is changed during a game by removing or adding a chip table system can indicate a place where chip stack value is changed.

The system components include the iView processing board and game monitoring unit GMU processing board. The GMU and iView can be combined into one like the commercially available Bally G iView device. This device may have a video mixing technology to mix the EGM processor s video signals with the iView display onto the top box monitor or any monitor on the gaming device.

In accordance with one or more embodiments is a functional block diagram of a gaming kernel of a game program under control of base game integrated circuit board . The game program uses gaming kernel by calling into application programming interface API which is part of game manager . The components of game kernel as shown in are only illustrative and should not be considered limiting. For example the number of managers may be changed additional managers may be added or some managers may be removed without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.

As shown in the example there are three layers a hardware layer an operating system layer such as but not limited to Linux and a game kernel layer having game manager therein. In one or more embodiments the use of a standard operating system such a UNIX based or Windows based operating system allows game developers interfacing to the gaming kernel to use any of a number of standard development tools and environments available for the operating systems. This is in contrast to the use of proprietary low level interfaces which may require significant time and engineering investments for each game upgrade hardware upgrade or feature upgrade. The game kernel layer executes at the user level of the operating system and itself contains a major component called the I O Board Server . To properly set the bounds of game application software making integrity checking easier all game applications interact with gaming kernel using a single API in game manager . This enables game applications to make use of a well defined consistent interface as well as making access points to gaming kernel controlled where overall access is controlled using separate processes.

For example game manager parses an incoming command stream and when a command dealing with I O comes in arrow the command is sent to an applicable library routine . Library routine decides what it needs from a device and sends commands to I O Board Server see arrow . A few specific drivers remain in operating system s kernel shown as those below line . These are built in primitive or privileged drivers that are i general ii kept to a minimum and iii are easier to leave than extract. In such cases the low level communications is handled within operating system and the contents passed to library routines .

Thus in a few cases library routines may interact with drivers inside operating system which is why arrow is shown as having three directions between library utilities and I O Board Server or between library utilities and certain drivers in operating system . No matter which path is taken the logic needed to work with each device is coded into modules in the user layer of the diagram. Operating system is kept as simple stripped down and common across as many hardware platforms as possible. The library utilities and user level drivers change as dictated by the game cabinet or game machine in which it will run. Thus each game cabinet or game machine may have an base game integrated circuit board connected to a unique relatively dumb and as inexpensive as possible I O adapter board plus a gaming kernel which will have the game machine unique library routines and I O Board Server components needed to enable game applications to interact with the gaming machine cabinet. Note that these differences are invisible to the game application software with the exception of certain functional differences i.e. if a gaming cabinet has stereo sound the game application will be able make use of API to use the capability over that of a cabinet having traditional monaural sound .

Game manager provides an interface into game kernel providing consistent predictable and backwards compatible calling methods syntax and capabilities by way of game application API . This enables the game developer to be free of dealing directly with the hardware including the freedom to not have to deal with low level drivers as well as the freedom to not have to program lower level managers although lower level managers may be accessible through game manager s interface if a programmer has the need. In addition to the freedom derived from not having to deal with the hardware level drivers and the freedom of having consistent callable object oriented interfaces to software managers of those components drivers game manager provides access to a set of upper level managers also having the advantages of consistent callable object oriented interfaces and further providing the types and kinds of base functionality required in casino type games. Game manager providing all the advantages of its consistent and richly functional interface as supported by the rest of game kernel thus provides a game developer with a multitude of advantages.

Game manager may have several objects within itself including an initialization object not shown . The initialization object performs the initialization of the entire game machine including other objects after game manager has started its internal objects and servers in appropriate order. In order to carry out this function the kernel s configuration manager is among the first objects to be started configuration manager has data needed to initialize and correctly configure other objects or servers.

The upper level managers of game kernel may include game event log manager which provides at the least a logging or logger base class enabling other logging objects to be derived from this base object. The logger object is a generic logger that is it is not aware of the contents of logged messages and events. The log manager s job is to log events in non volatile event log space. The size of the space may be fixed although the size of the logged event is typically not. When the event space or log space fills up one embodiment will delete the oldest logged event each logged event will have a time date stamp as well as other needed information such as length providing space to record the new event. In this embodiment the most recent events will thus be found in the log space regardless of their relative importance. Further provided is the capability to read the stored logs for event review.

In accordance with one embodiment meter manager manages the various meters embodied in the game kernel . This includes the accounting information for the game machine and game play. There are hard meters counters and soft meters the soft meters may be stored in non volatile storage such as non volatile battery backed RAM to prevent loss. Further a backup copy of the soft meters may be stored in a separate non volatile storage such as EEPROM. In one embodiment meter manager receives its initialization data for the meters during start up from configuration manager . While running the cash in and cash out managers call the meter manager s update functions to update the meters. Meter manager will on occasion create backup copies of the soft meters by storing the soft meters readings in EEPROM. This is accomplished by calling and using EEPROM manager .

In accordance with still other embodiments progressive manager manages progressive games playable from the game machine. Event manager is generic like log manager and is used to manage various gaming machine events. Focus manager correlates which process has control of various focus items. Tilt manager is an object that receives a list of errors if any from configuration manager at initialization and during game play from processes managers drivers etc. that may generate errors. Random number generator manager is provided to allow easy programming access to a random number generator RNG as a RNG is required in virtually all casino style gambling games. RNG manager includes the capability of using multiple seeds.

In accordance with one or more embodiments a credit manager object not shown manages the current state of credits cash value or cash equivalent in the game machine including any available winnings and further provides denomination conversion services. Cash out manager has the responsibility of configuring and managing monetary output devices. During initialization cash out manager using data from configuration manager sets the cash out devices correctly and selects any selectable cash out denominations. During play a game application may post a cash out event through the event manager the same way all events are handled and using a call back posted by cash out manager cash out manager is informed of the event. Cash out manager updates the credit object updates its state in non volatile memory and sends an appropriate control message to the device manager that corresponds to the dispensing device. As the device dispenses dispensable media there will typically be event messages being sent back and forth between the device and cash out manager until the dispensing finishes after which cash out manager having updated the credit manager and any other game state such as some associated with meter manager that needs to be updated for this set of actions sends a cash out completion event to event manager and to the game application thereby. Cash in manager functions similarly to cash out manager only controlling interfacing with and taking care of actions associated with cashing in events cash in devices and associated meters and crediting.

In a further example in accordance with one or more embodiments I O server may write data to the gaming machine EEPROM memory which is located in the gaming machine cabinet and holds meter storage that must be kept even in the event of power failure. Game manager calls the I O library functions to write data to the EEPROM. The I O server receives the request and starts a low priority EEPROM thread within I O server to write the data. This thread uses a sequence of 8 bit command and data writes to the EEPROM device to write the appropriate data in the proper location within the device. Any errors detected will be sent as IPC messages to game manager . All of this processing is asynchronous.

In accordance with one embodiment button module within I O server polls or is sent the state of buttons every 2 ms. These inputs are debounced by keeping a history of input samples. Certain sequences of samples are required to detect a button was pressed in which case the I O server sends an inter process communication event to game manager that a button was pressed or released. In some embodiments the gaming machine may have intelligent distributed I O which debounces the buttons in which case button module may be able to communicate with the remote intelligent button processor to get the button events and simply relay them to game manager via IPC messages. In still another embodiment the I O library may be used for pay out requests from the game application. For example hopper module must start the hopper motor constantly monitor the coin sensing lines of the hopper debounce them and send an IPC message to the game manager when each coin is paid.

For example one or more examples of group games under control of a group game server are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20080139305 entitled Networked System and Method for Group Play Gaming filed on Nov. 9 2007 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

All or portions of the present invention may also be implemented or promoted by or through a system as suggested in . At is the gaming system of which may be hosted at a casino property enterprise across several casino enterprises or by a third party host. As described above the gaming system has a network communication bus providing for communication between the gaming terminals and various servers. To provide the functionality illustrated in a bonusing server such as a Bally Elite Bonusing Server is connected to the network communication bus for communication to the gaming system the gaming terminals and the various servers and other devices as described above. Through a secure network firewall the bonusing server is in communication with a cloud computing storage service which may be hosted by the casino enterprise a licensed third party or if permitted by gaming regulators an unlicensed provider. For example the cloud service may be as provided by Microsoft Private Cloud Solutions offered by Microsoft Corp. of Redmond Wash. USA. The cloud service provides various applications which can be accessed and delivered to for example personal computers portable computing devices such as computer tablets personal digital assistants PDAs and cellular devices such as telephones and smart phones. As but an example the cloud service may store and host an eWallet application casino or player centric applications such as downloadable or accessible applications including games promotional material or applications directed to and or affecting a casino customers interaction with a casino enterprise such as accessing the players casino account establishing casino credit or the like providing bonuses to players through system wide bonusing SMB or specific bonusing or comps to players or other applications. The cloud service includes security provide for secure communication with the cloud service between the player users and the cloud service and between the cloud service and the gaming system . Security applications may be through encryption the use of personal identification numbers PINS or other devices and systems. As suggested in the cloud service stores player user data retrieved from players users and from the gaming system .

The players users may access the cloud service and the applications and data provided thereby through the Internet or through broadband wireless cellular communication systems and any intervening sort range wireless communication such as WiFi. The players users may access the applications and data through various social media offerings such as Facebook Twitter Yelp MySpace LinkedIn or the like.

As but an example a player user may have a player account with a casino enterprise Z. That account may include data such as the player s credit level their rating and their available comps. The account may further track any certificates and the present value thereof the player may have won as a result of the playing a game according to the present invention. At their smart phone the player user sends a request to the clout service perhaps through a previously downloaded application to request the status of their available comps such as how many comp points they have and what may be available through redemption of those points e.g. lodging cash back meals or merchandise . The application for the request may present casino promotions graphics or other advertising to the player user. The application to support such a request would typically require the player user to enter a PIN. The cloud service forwards the inquiry to the bonusing servicer which in turn confirms the PIN and retrieves the requested information from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . Alternatively the data may be stored in the cloud service and routinely updated from the data warehouse or player tracking CMS CMP server . In this instance the request would be responded to from data residing with the cloud service . The information is formatted by the cloud server application and delivered to the player user. The delivery may be formatted based upon the player user s device operating system OS display size or the like.

The cloud service may also host game applications to provide virtual instances of games for free promotional or where permitted P2P Pay to Play supported gaming. Third party developers may also have access to placing applications with the cloud service through for example a national operations center Bally NOC . A game software manufacturer such as Bally Gaming Inc. may also provide game applications on its own or on behalf of the casino enterprise.

Other media such as advertising notices such as an upcoming tournament may also be provided to the cloud service . When a player user accesses the cloud service certain media may be delivered to the player user in a manner formatted for their application and device.

While the embodiment described relates to a Baccarat game it should be understood that the inventive concept could be applied to other games particularly those where inter play player decisions are not required. For example a slot machine either electro mechanical or video may operate one or more virtual games in the background and routinely report an outcome history to the player playing the primary displayed version of the game. The player may then compare the histories to the primary game and choose to instead play one of the one or more virtual background versions of the game. Each game version may operate from a differently seeded random number generator so the results and histories may differ .

Still further the histories displays may be displayed at a window to either side above or below the primary game version being wagered upon and played by the player or in a scrolling ticker display again above or below or to either side of the primary game display. In such a fashion the player may view the histories and select a version of the game which the player may feel is hotter and is having better outcomes.
