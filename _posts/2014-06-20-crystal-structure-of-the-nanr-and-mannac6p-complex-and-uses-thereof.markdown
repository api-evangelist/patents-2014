title: Crystal structure of the NanR and ManNAc-6P complex, and uses thereof
abstract: The present invention relates to a three-dimensional structure of a complex explored by crystallization of the complex of NanR which is a key pathogenic regulatory protein of and ManNA6P which is a NanR regulator. Further, the present invention relates to a modified NanR protein, a polynucleotide encoding the protein, a vector including the polynucleotide, and a transformant including the vector. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for screening a substance regulating interaction between NanR and the transcriptional control region of nan operon which is a gene cluster regulated by NanR, or a substance regulating interaction between NanR and ManNAc-6P, by designing three-dimensional structure of the complex, and to an antibacterial composition including the screened substance.
