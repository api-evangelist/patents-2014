This application claims foreign priority benefits under 35 U.S.C. 119 a d to European patent application number EP 13174855.0 filed Jul. 3 2013 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Embodiments herein relate to a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance. Embodiments herein further relate to a vehicle comprising a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance and to a method for allowing a host vehicle to autonomously avoid road irregularities.

Driving comfort depends on a multitude of factors such as vehicle suspension tire properties road conditions etc. A relevant factor is whether the vehicle is driven along a smooth road surface or into potholes and across bumps. With potholes is here understood disruptions in the road surface where a portion of the road material has broken away leaving a hole. With bumps is here understood disruptions in the road surface where a portion of the road is raised forming an upwardly extending protrusion. If contact with bumps and potholes can be avoided a perceived driving comfort may be increased.

It is known to control steering of a vehicle based on input from sensors detecting a vehicle surrounding. In U.S.2012035788A1 is described a navigation and control system for autonomous vehicles. The system includes a sensor for locating objects in a predetermined field of view from a vehicle. A processor can correlate GPS position LIDAR measurements and deflection angle data to produce a map of obstacles in a path of the vehicle. The map is used such that the detected obstacles can be mapped relative to the path of the vehicle and steering and speed control directions are provided to the vehicle in order to avoid the obstacle. The system can take into consideration the destination of the vehicle and thereby provide steering and speed control directions to the vehicle in order to avoid the obstacle and to return on course to the destination.

U.S.2010121577A1 relates to autonomous driving of vehicles. In U.S.2010121577A1 is described a method for detecting a clear path of travel for a vehicle and for generating a data stream corresponding to a three dimensional scan of a target area surrounding the vehicle from a vehicle LIDAR system. The vehicle can identify road conditions via a camera a radar imaging system GPS information or from other vehicles in communication with the vehicle.

U.S.2012323474A1 relates to a system and a method for conveying data between vehicles. The system includes means to obtain or generate information about conditions around a first vehicle which information can be sent to other vehicles via a communication system or internet. A position and a movement of the first vehicle and a second vehicle are determined and transmitted via internet to the second vehicle. The positions and movements of the first and second vehicles are analyzed at the second vehicle and the second vehicle is directed to take action based on analysis of the relative positions and movements of the first and second vehicles. An intended travel path of the second vehicle may be altered for collision avoidance purposes and the information obtained or generated at the first vehicle may be stored in a database. A maintenance state of the roadway can be automatically monitored and relevant information can be transmitted automatically over internet to a central control station along with appropriate pictures if available.

In U.S. Pat. No. 6 484 089B1 a vehicle navigation system is presented. The system includes a map database and at least one inertial sensor. When a vehicle encounters a problem road condition such as a pothole the problem road condition induces acceleration in the inertial sensor. The navigation system identifies the occurrence of a problem road condition by monitoring the signals generated by the inertial sensor. The navigation system then stores the occurrence and location of the problem road condition. This data can be used later to identify locate and repair problem road conditions.

The systems referred to may increase perceived vehicle operator comfort in some situations but improvements in the field of autonomous road irregularity avoidance are still desirable.

Embodiments herein aim to provide a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance eliminating or at least reducing the problems and or drawbacks described above.

According to a first aspect this is achieved by a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance comprising vehicle sensors arranged to detect irregularities on a road travelled by a host vehicle position determination means arranged to continuously determine the host vehicle position communication means arranged to send vehicle sensor data relating to detected road irregularities and host vehicle position information to an external database for compiling road irregularity position information processing means comprising steering control logic a vehicle steering system arranged to affect at least one host vehicle wheel for enabling steering of the host vehicle wherein the communication means are arranged to receive from the external database information relating to road irregularity positions on the road ahead of the host vehicle the processing means further being arranged to determine a trajectory for the host vehicle for which all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle and the vehicle steering system further being arranged to autonomously steer the host vehicle along the determined trajectory and in that the processing means further are arranged to evaluate whether all wheels of the host vehicle were laterally displaced from all detected road irregularities for a predefined road section of a used trajectory and that the communication means are arranged to send the result of the evaluation to the external database.

Since the system is arranged to receive information relating to road irregularity positions to determine a trajectory for which all wheels are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities to steer the host vehicle to evaluate whether all wheels of the host vehicle were laterally displaced from all detected road irregularities and to send the result to the external database vehicle operator comfort may be increased.

Thanks to the vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance driving comfort during autonomous or semi autonomous driving can be increased. Semi autonomous refers to driving with both manual and autonomous input. During manual driving a driver that drives the same road frequently may soon learn a unique profile of the road. An example of such a road may be a road between the driver s home and the driver s workplace. An active driver may learn the exact position of road irregularities such as bumps and potholes along the road and may make an effort to avoid them when possible. Often just a small lateral adjustment of the vehicle is enough for the avoidance. The vehicle system according to embodiments herein can achieve a comfort level similar to the comfort level achieved when an active driver drives the vehicle along a road that he she knows well.

The avoidance of driving into road irregularities is beneficial not only for the driving comfort but also for reducing wear on e.g. a vehicle chassis and a vehicle suspension system. It may also slow down further degradation on the road since a pothole is quickly worsened with the number of vehicles that are running their wheels over the pothole.

However when an experienced driver only may learn one or a few roads the vehicle system according to enclosed embodiments may use compiled data relating to road irregularities for many roads.

Several vehicles equipped with the system may send vehicle sensor data relating to detected road irregularities and host vehicle position information to an external database such that a lot of road irregularity position information for road networks may be compiled. Hereby the collectively gathered data may be used in each and every one of the vehicles in order to avoid road irregularities. In autonomous or semi autonomous vehicles the system may be very beneficial since a driver may not be prepared to repeatedly intervene in a situation where the vehicle approaches a pothole.

Thus hereby is provided a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance eliminating or at least reducing the problems and or drawbacks described above.

According to some embodiments the position determination means are arranged to determine the host vehicle position using input both from a global positioning system and from a vehicle system for detecting a lateral distance from road markings.

Since input both from a global positioning system and a vehicle system for detecting a lateral distance from road markings are used a very accurate determination is achieved. A global positioning system may provide good positional information and a vehicle system for detecting a lateral distance from road markings may provide the system with accurate information of the vehicle s lateral position on the road. When inputs from both systems are used together the host vehicle position can be determined in a precise and reliable manner.

According to some embodiments the vehicle system comprises lateral acceleration sensors arranged to detect lateral acceleration of the host vehicle and that the processing means are arranged to determine the host vehicle trajectory for which a lateral acceleration of the host vehicle is minimized.

Since the lateral acceleration sensors and the processing means are used to determine a host vehicle trajectory for which a lateral acceleration of the host vehicle is minimized comfort may be increased. The host vehicle can travel as smooth as possible along a road section while road irregularities are avoided.

According to some embodiments one or more of the vehicle sensors are arranged to detect a road irregularity when at least one of the host vehicle wheels is in contact with the road irregularity the sensor being at least one of an inertial sensor an active chassis sensor a wheel sensor an acoustic sensor and a vehicle level sensor.

Since the road irregularity is detected with at least one of an inertial sensor an active chassis sensor a wheel sensor an acoustic sensor and a vehicle level sensor road irregularities can be detected in a reliable manner when the host vehicle passes the road irregularity.

According to some embodiments one or more of the vehicle sensors are arranged to detect a road irregularity ahead of the host vehicle the sensor being at least one of an image capturing sensor a radar sensor and a lidar sensor.

Since the road irregularity is detected with at least one of an image capturing sensor a radar sensor and a lidar sensor road irregularities can be detected in a reliable manner ahead of the host vehicle.

According to some embodiments one or more of the sensors are arranged to detect at least one of an elevation and an extension of a road irregularity when at least one of the host vehicle wheels is in contact with the road irregularity the communication means further being arranged to send vehicle sensor data relating to at least one of the elevation and the extension of the road irregularity to the external database.

Since at least one of an elevation and an extension of a road irregularity is detected and sensor data relating to this is sent to the external database detailed information relating to the road irregularities can be compiled in the database.

According to some embodiments one or more of the sensors are arranged to detect at least one of an elevation and an extension of a road irregularity ahead of the host vehicle the communication means further being arranged to send vehicle sensor data relating to at least one of the elevation and the extension of the road irregularity to the external database.

Thus hereby is provided a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance eliminating or at least reducing the problems and or drawbacks described above.

Hereby vehicle operator comfort can be increased.

According to some embodiments the method further comprises determining by the processing means the host vehicle trajectory for which a by the vehicle sensors detected lateral acceleration of the host vehicle is minimized.

Well known functions or constructions will not necessarily be described in detail for brevity and or clarity.

The vehicle drives autonomously or semi autonomously along a determined vehicle trajectory on a road . The road runs in a longitudinal direction of the vehicle and the road is provided with road markings at its sides. Trajectories for vehicle wheels are indicated with dashed lines on the road . The trajectories for the wheels are parallel to the determined vehicle trajectory but displaced in a lateral direction i.e. perpendicular to the determined vehicle trajectory .

The road comprises road irregularities in form of bumps obstacles and or potholes. If no care is taken to avoid the road irregularities ahead of the vehicle the wheel trajectories may intersect the road irregularities as illustrated in . When one or more of the vehicle wheels are driven into one or several of the road irregularities a driver of the vehicle may experience discomfort.

In a host vehicle and a vehicle system for autonomous road irregularity avoidance according to some embodiments are illustrated.

The host vehicle is driven along vehicle trajectory on a road comprising road irregularities . According to the illustrated embodiment the road is provided with road markings on its sides but the host vehicle may be driven also along roads without any road markings.

The host vehicle comprises vehicle wheels which are in contact with a surface of the road . Trajectories for the wheels are illustrated in parallel with the vehicle trajectory . The trajectories for the vehicle wheels are indicated with dashed lines. The trajectories for the wheels runs in parallel with the vehicle trajectory and are displaced in a lateral direction i.e. perpendicular to the determined vehicle trajectory . A host vehicle steering system is arranged to affect at least one host vehicle wheel for enabling steering of the host vehicle .

The vehicle system comprises vehicle sensors arranged to detect any irregularities on the road . The sensors may be direct sensors arranged to detect road irregularities when one or more of the wheels is in contact with one or more of the road irregularities . Different kind of sensors may be used such as Inertial sensors arranged to detect acceleration in different directions. Wheel sensors which can detect forces acting on a wheel. Tire pressure sensors arranged to detect a tire pressure and or changes of tire pressure. An active chassis sensor which can detect chassis movement A vehicle level sensor capable to detect when at least a part of the chassis is raised or lowered. An acoustic sensor arranged to detect a sound related to the contact between a wheel and a road irregularity .

One or more of the sensors may be indirect sensors arranged to detect road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle. The sensors can include an image capturing sensor such as a front facing camera. The image capturing sensor may be a camera arranged to detect objects in visible light IR light or UV light. The sensors may include a radar sensor and or a lidar sensor arranged to detect road irregularities on the road ahead of the host vehicle .

The vehicle system further comprises one or more position determination means arranged to continuously determine the host vehicle position. Two or more position determination means may cooperate for the determination of the host vehicle position. The position determination means may comprise a combined satellite based positioning and mapping system such as the American Global Positioning System GPS the European Galileo global navigation satellite system GNSS the Russian Globalnaya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema or Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS or the Chinese BeiDou Compass Navigation Satellite System.

According to some embodiments the position determination means comprises a vehicle system for detecting a lateral distance from road markings or from other detectable references along the road . An image capturing system comprising logic for object recognition may be used for detecting the distance between a host vehicle or any part thereof such as the wheels and road markings .

The vehicle system illustrated in comprises communication means arranged to send vehicle sensor data relating to detected road irregularities and host vehicle position information to an external database for compiling road irregularity position information. The communication means are also arrange to receive from the external database information relating to road irregularity positions on the road ahead of the host vehicle . The communication means may comprise a transmitter which converts vehicle sensor data and host vehicle position information to a signal such as an electrical signal and or a signal carried by electromagnetic waves and a receiver that receives signals and converts them to information such as information relating to road irregularity positions. Any suitable means may be used for the communication between the host vehicle and the external database e.g. radio signals such as according to either of the GSM 3G LTE and or WiFi standards and or satellite communication signals.

Several different vehicles equipped with vehicle systems for autonomous road irregularity avoidance may send vehicle sensor data to the external database and receive information relating to road irregularity positions on a road ahead of the respective vehicle. Hereby information relating to road irregularities on a road network may be compiled. Information sent to the external database from one vehicle may thus be available for other vehicles during autonomous road irregularity avoidance.

Since the communication means are arranged to receive information relating to road irregularity positions on the road ahead of the host vehicle from the external database the information is received to the vehicle system based on the location and or direction of the vehicle hosting the vehicle system .

The vehicle system in the host vehicle is also arranged to evaluate whether all wheels of the host vehicle were laterally displaced from all detected road irregularities for a predefined road section of a used trajectory. The result of the evaluation is sent to the external database such that the database continuously is updated. If no road irregularity was detected when a host vehicle was driven along a vehicle trajectory for a predefined road section where a road irregularity was earlier detected the updated information is sent to the external database . Hereby the external database is updated not only with information of detected road irregularities but also with information of repaired road irregularities where the road is in good condition again. New trajectories for which all wheels of a host vehicle can be laterally displaced from detected road irregularities for a predefined road section can thereby be determined.

As illustrated in there is a distance between a trajectory for a wheel and the vehicle trajectory . This distance can be different for different vehicle models and this is distance is taken into account during the determination of trajectories for the host vehicle for which all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle .

The vehicle system may be part of or connected to an Intelligent Transport System with road side units for determination of the position and or for communication with the external database .

The vehicle system as illustrated in further comprises processing means . The processing means comprises one or more processing units with associated steering control logic and one or more memory units in communication with the one or more processing units. A processing unit may be a central processing unit CPU also referred to as a central processor unit. A CPU is hardware within a computer that carries out instructions of a computer program software when this is executed by performing basic arithmetical logical and input output operations. The processing means may also comprise an accelerated processing unit APU also referred to as an advanced processing unit. An APU is a processing unit that includes additional processing capability designed to accelerate one or more types of computations outside of a CPU. The processing means may also comprise an application programming interface API which specifies how software components may interact with each other.

The processing means upon execution of the associated steering control logic on the one or more processing units can determine a trajectory for the host vehicle for which all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle . The processing means are further arranged to control the vehicle steering system to autonomously steer the host vehicle along the determined trajectory .

The processing means are arranged to determine the vehicle trajectory ahead of the host vehicle based on gathered data relating to road conditions and host vehicle position direction and or velocity. The processing means are further arranged to determine whether all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle when the host vehicle is driven along the trajectory . If the processing means determine that one or more of the wheels will intersect the one or more road irregularities the determined trajectory is adjusted laterally along at least a part of the vehicle trajectory such that the vehicle wheels may pass the one or more road irregularities on a left hand side and or on a right hand side as seen in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle trajectory . Thus the system may only intervene when necessary i.e. when it is determined that contact between one or more of the wheels and one or more road irregularities will occur. According to some embodiments a vehicle trajectory is only determined when the host vehicle is within a predefined distance from upcoming road irregularities .

The system may receive information of upcoming road irregularities at any desired predefined distance ahead of the host vehicle . Therefore if a vehicle trajectory is determined well before a road irregularity the processing means may control the vehicle steering system to autonomously steer the host vehicle just a small amount such as one or a few degrees to the right or to the left of upcoming road irregularities . Thanks to this the vehicle trajectory can be very smooth such that only a small lateral acceleration will act on the host vehicle due to the intervention of the system . The autonomous road irregularity avoidance may be particularly useful in situations where a driver normally may encounter difficulties to see potholes ahead e.g. when driving at night or in tunnels.

The processing means are arranged to evaluate whether all wheels of the host vehicle were laterally displaced from all detected road irregularities for a predefined road section of a used vehicle trajectory . This may be done continuously or when the host vehicle is in within a predefined distance from road irregularities . The result of the evaluation may be sent to the external database such that the database is continuously updated of road irregularities . According to some embodiments the result of the evaluation is sent only when one or more road irregularities are detected. If no road irregularities were detected during the evaluation the used vehicle trajectory is considered free from road irregularities.

In is illustrated a method for allowing a host vehicle to autonomously avoid road irregularities on a road travelled by the host vehicle. The method comprises 

Continuously determining the host vehicle position using position determination means. Sending by communication means vehicle sensor data relating to detected road irregularities and host vehicle position information to an external database for compiling road irregularity position information. Receiving from the external database information relating to road irregularity positions on the road ahead of the host vehicle. Determining by processing means a trajectory for the host vehicle for which all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle. Autonomously steering the host vehicle along the determined trajectory. Evaluating by the processing means whether all wheels of the host vehicle were laterally displaced from all detected road irregularities for a predefined road section of a used trajectory. Sending by the communication means a result of the evaluation to the external database.

According to some embodiments the method further comprises Determining by the processing means the host vehicle trajectory for which a by the vehicle sensors detected lateral acceleration of the host vehicle is minimized.

According to some embodiments the method further comprises Detecting by the vehicle sensors at least one of an elevation and an extension of a road irregularity when at least one of the host vehicle wheels is in contact with the road irregularity. Sending by the communication means vehicle sensor data relating to at least one of an elevation and an extension of the road irregularity to the external database. With the term elevation of a road irregularity is here to be understood its height above or below the fixed reference of the road surface.

Although the aspects has been described with reference to example embodiments many different alterations modifications and the like will become apparent for those skilled in the art. For example if no trajectory for which all wheels of the host vehicle are laterally displaced from one or more road irregularities ahead of the host vehicle may be determined a trajectory that intersect with the lowest amount of road irregularities may be determined instead.

The system and method for autonomous road irregularity avoidance described herein is applicable both to fully automated vehicles i.e. vehicles capable of autonomous driving without any continuous input from a vehicle operator driver and to vehicles having a combined manual and autonomous input during essentially manual driving so called semi autonomous driving. In the latter case the system and method for autonomous road irregularity avoidance described herein may be arranged to semi autonomously provide a steering torque to the steering system even when a driver has his her hands placed on the steering wheel. In this case the contribution may provide a supportive input but still be subordinated to the control of the driver.
