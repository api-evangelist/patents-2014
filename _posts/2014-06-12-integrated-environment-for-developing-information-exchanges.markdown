This application is a continuation application which claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 13 940 037 filed Jul. 11 2013 which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

This disclosure relates to facilitating information exchanges between systems through an integrated environment the integrated environment comprising a global registry local registries repositories and or any other components that facilitate development of the information exchanges.

Systems that provide development environments for generating exchange artifacts are known. The exchange artifacts generated by these systems typically include documents describing schemas metadata and or documentations that specify the information exchanges. For facilitating generation of the exchange artifacts these systems tend to provide information exchange reference models specific to individual business domains or subdomain within a business. As such these systems lack capabilities to enable the individual businesses to cost effectively develop individual information exchange standards based on a global information exchange standard for achieving cross domain or sub domain consistencies. Moreover these systems tend to generate exchange artifacts based on a singular exchange standard e.g. such as the National Information Exchange Model NIEM and thus lack capabilities to enable developers of the information exchanges to generate exchange artifacts conforming to different exchange standards while maintaining a consistent business model. Another drawback of these systems is that they lack capabilities to import from and or export to external resources for creating and or consolidating the information reference models.

One aspect of the disclosure relates to providing an integrated development environment facilitating development of information exchanges based on a logical global information exchange standard and one or more local information exchange standards established for individual business domains. Standardized objects corresponding to data elements of the global information exchange standard may be provided in a global registry. Conceptual objects representing concepts for establishing a local information exchange standard reflecting an understanding how information may be represented in an individual domain may be provided in a local registry associated with the individual domain. The conceptual objects in the local registry may be promoted to the global registry upon approvals by an administrator and or any other authentication body of the global registry. The promoted conceptual objects from one or more local registries may be provided in the global registry for developing information exchanges based on the global information exchange standard. In some examples the conceptual objects in the local registry may be created or modified based on the standardized objects in the global registry according to business use semantics appropriate for the individual domain such that they represent extensions or augmentations to the corresponding standardized objects in the global registry. In such a development environment developers of information exchanges may compose exchange objects by including objects in the global registry and or in the local registry or local registries in the exchange objects. The exchange objects such as product objects may be promoted to the global registry for providing best practice guidance. Accordingly this facilitates an integrated environment that may provide capabilities to enable individual domains to cost effectively develop consistent information exchanges conforming to a global information exchange standard while adhering to domain the specific local information exchange standard s .

Generation of exchange projects may be enabled based on the exchange objects and generation of exchange artifacts may be enabled based on the generated exchange projects. In some examples the exchange projects may be generated by including exchange objects stored in a repository associated with an individual domain. Exchange artifacts conforming to different exchange standards may be generated based on the exchange projects. Examples of such exchange standards may include but not limited to the National Information Exchange Model NIEM Health Level Seven HL7 Accredited Standards Committee X12 ASC X12 and or any other exchange standards. This may provide flexibilities for developing information exchanges adapted to different types of information exchanges based on different business needs of the individual domains.

Capabilities may be provided for integrating objects provided by external resources with the local information standards established for the individual domains and the global information exchange standard facilitated by the global registry. Such external resources may include for example XML schema files spreadsheet files database tables and or any other external resources. In some exemplary implementations such integrations may include importing from the external resources conceptual objects and or product objects analyzing the differences between the external resources and the local registry and or the global registry and importing the new objects into the local registry and or the global registry. This may enhance object creation in a local registry and or the global registry.

In some implementations the system that provides a global registry to facilitate information exchanges may include a global registry server. The global registry server may comprise one or more processor configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules may include a global registry management module a promotion request module a promotion review module a global registry provision module an object importation module an interface module and or other modules.

The global registry management module may be configured to manage a global registry of conceptual objects corresponding to data elements and or object types of a global information exchange standard which may be established by an authority or any authentication body for providing best practice and or guidelines for developing individual information exchanges standardized processes for developing the information exchanges international or national standards related to information exchanges having specific purposes and or for providing any other standards. Conceptual objects corresponding to the data elements of the global information standard may be determined and provided by the authority and or any authentication body in the global registry. The conceptual objects in the global registry may be used by developers of information exchanges administrators of local registries associated with individual domains and or any other entities to develop individual information exchanges and or to establish local information exchange standard for individual domains. The global registry may be physically implemented in one or more electronic storages. In some exemplary implementations the conceptual objects in the global registry may be determined for example for providing data models facilitating development of individual information exchanges. Examples of such data models may include entity relationship network structure object oriented and or any other data models. In those examples the conceptual objects may correspond to data elements and or object types of such data models.

In some examples for facilitating information exchanges based on the global information exchange standard product projects may be provided in the global registry. The product objects may represent logic models based on business use semantics commonly adopted for example as a best practice. In some exemplary implementations such a product object may include a set of conceptual objects in the global registry organized in a way reflecting collective knowledge about a specific type of business product or process e.g. Arrest Booking Insurance Application Insurance Plan etc. or information class Person Location Organization etc. . Such a product object may be used to specify data content of the individual information exchanges.

The global registry management module may manage the global registry by for example but not limited to adding new conceptual objects to the global registry modifying the conceptual objects removing the conceptual objects deprecating the conceptual objects e.g. obsoleting the conceptual objects for future development by deactivating the conceptual objects locating the conceptual objects and or any other management operations for managing the global registry. In some exemplary implementations programming rules such as an indexing scheme and or other rules may be preconfigured into the global registry management module at a configuration stage to facilitate the global registry management operations performed by global registry management module.

In some exemplary implementations the conceptual objects in the global registry may represent entity relationship concepts and or business use semantics. Such entity relationship concepts may include for example entities roles relationships actions elements and or any other entity relationship concepts. In these exemplary implementations business use semantics may be applied to the conceptual objects to reflect collective knowledge about such conceptual objects. In these exemplary implementations product objects may be provided to indicate relationships of entities represented by the conceptual objects in the global registry.

The promotion receipt module may be configured to receive promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects in local registries associated with individual domains to the global registry. The individual domains may include organizations agencies departments subsidiaries local governments and or any other logical groups characterized by specific functions features responsibilities and or line of businesses. Such an individual domain may exchange information within the domain and or with other domains. For establishing local information exchange standard at a domain level an administrator developer provider and or any other entities related to domain level information exchange may employ local registries for providing objects corresponding to data elements of the local information exchange standard. The objects in the local registries e.g. conceptual objects may represent knowledge about how information may be represented at the domain level. Similar to those objects in a global registry the objects in local registries may be applied with business use semantics which may be specific to the individual domains. A promotion request may be generated by for example by an administrator developer provider or any other entities related to information exchange for a domain to promote the objects including conceptual objects in the local registry to the global registry managed by the global registry management module. The promotion receipt module may be configured to receive such a promotion request via any suitable wired or wireless connections. This may involve detecting promotion requests as they arrive serializing the arrived the promotion requests detecting boundaries of the promotion requests parsing the promotion requests and or any other operations for receiving the promotion requests.

The promotion review module may be configured to obtain review information indicating approvals of the promotion requests received by the promotion receipt module. In response to a promotion request received by the promotion receipt module one or more reviews may be performed for determining whether the object s being requested by the promotion request may be promoted to the global registry. Considerations such as whether the to be promoted object s conforms to the global information exchange standard embodied by the global registry whether a similar object s has existed in the global registry whether the to be promoted object reflects information element s and or structure s commonly understood by other domains that follow the global information exchange standard and or any other considerations. In some examples the reviews may be performed by the promotion review module automatically by employing programming rules simulating these considerations. Simultaneously or alternatively the reviews may be performed by one or more authenticators administrators providers and or any other entities related to establishing the global information exchange standard via an interface for example provided by the interface module to perform the reviews. The promotion review module may obtain such review information and determine whether the promotion request has been approved. This may involve recognizing the result s of the review as indicated in the obtained review information accounting number of approvals and or denials in the obtained review information assigning weighted score to the approvals and or denials based on significances of the reviewers and or any other operations for determining an approval of a promotion request.

The global registry provision module may be configured to provide objects including conceptual objects promoted from local registries in the global registry to client computers associated with developers of the information exchanges. For accessing the objects in the global registry the client computers may transmit access requests for accessing the objects in the global registry. For facilitating such access requests the global registry provision module may be configured to provide interfaces for communicating with the client computers. The interfaces may include application programming interfaces API common gateway interfaces web interfaces and or any other interfaces that may facilitate client computers accessing the objects in the global registry.

The object importation module may be configured to import from external resources such as the external resources conceptual objects and or project objects to the global registry. Such external resources may include XML files spreadsheets database tables and or any other external resources that may provide definitions and or descriptions of conceptual objects and or project objects. For facilitating such importation the object importation module may analyze the external resources and determine which objects defined and or described in the external resources but not yet provided in the global registry extract these determined objects from the external resources creating these objects according to the definitions and or descriptions of the objects as indicated in the external resources storing these objects in the global registry such that they may be provided to the client computers by the global registry provision module and or performing any other operations for importing objects from the external resources to the global registry.

The interface module may be configured to generate information for providing graphical user interfaces implemented on client computers to enable user actions for managing the promotion requests received by the promotion receipt module. The information generated by the interface module may cause electronic displays coupled to the client computers e.g. such as the client computers as illustrated to present a graphical user interface for managing the promotion requests. User actions may be enabled by controls provided by the graphical user interface such as but not limited to navigation trees selection boxes text input boxes radio buttons and or any other field controls. The enabled user actions may include actions for managing the promotion requests e.g. for approving the promotion requests. Such user actions may be executed for example to cause the promotion review module to obtain review information and to determine whether promotion requests have been approved. The information generated by the interface module may include HTML code view information information indicating graphics for presentation on the client computers and or any other information.

In some implementations the system that provides a repository and a local registry to facilitate information exchanges may include a domain server. The domain server may comprise one or more processors configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The computer program modules may include a repository module a local registry module a promotion request module an object importation module and or other modules.

The repository module may be configured to manage a repository of exchange objects. The exchange objects may correspond to data elements of exchange artifacts that facilitate the actual information exchanges. As such the exchange objects may specify various aspects of information exchanges such as exchange metadata exchange payload one or more services being facilitated by the information exchanges and or any other aspects of the information exchanges. In some exemplary implementations the exchange objects in the repository managed by the repository module may comprise product objects based on information exchange needs of the domain. The product objects may be used to specify data content i.e. the payload of the information exchanges. In some examples the repository managed by the repository module may be physically implemented using one or more electronic storages. The exchange objects in those examples may be stored in files databases tables records and or any storage units in the electronic storages.

The local registry module may be configured to manage a local registry of conceptual objects corresponding to data elements of an information exchange standard established for the domain e.g. a local information exchange standard. The local information exchange standard may reflect an understanding how information in the individual domain may be represented best practice for developing information exchanges within the individual domain standardized process for developing information exchanges within the individual domain and or any other local standards. Data models for facilitating such a local information standard may be determined by an administrator developer provider and or any other entities related to information exchanges of the individual domain and provided through the local registry. The data models may include conceptual concepts corresponding to entity relationship network structure object oriented and or any other data models for facilitating the local information exchange standard.

The local registry module may be configured to manage the local registry by for example adding new conceptual objects to the local registry modifying the conceptual objects removing the conceptual objects deprecating the conceptual objects locating the conceptual objects and or to performing any other management operations for managing the local registry.

The promotion request module may be configured to obtain promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects in the local registry and or for promoting product objects in the repository to the global registry. A promotion request obtained by the promotion request module may include information indicating specific objects including conceptual and or product objects in the local registry and or repository to be promoted to the global registry one or more developers or entities that created the objects in the local registry textual descriptions of the objects textual descriptions of reasons why the objects may be promoted to the global registry and or any other information facilitating promotion of objects in a local registry to the global registry.

The object importation module may be configured to import from external resources information indicating one or more conceptual objects to the local registry and or one or more product objects to the repository. Such external resources may include exchange artifacts facilitating specific information exchanges XML files specifying one or more objects spreadsheet files specifying schema or views of information and or any other external resources that may provide definitions of conceptual objects and or project objects. For facilitating such importation the object importation module may analyze the external resources and determine which objects are defined described and or otherwise provided in the external resources but not yet provided in the global registry extract these objects from the external resources create these objects according to the definitions and or descriptions of the objects as indicated in the external resources store these objects in the local registry and or the repository and or perform any other operations for importing objects from the external resources to the local registry and or repository.

In some implementations the system that generates exchange artifacts pertaining to information exchanges may comprise one or more processors configured to execute one or more computer program modules. The computer program modules may include an object module an exchange object composition module an exchange project composition module an exchange artifact generation module an interface module and or other modules.

The object module may be configured to obtain standardized objects in a first set of registries facilitating global information exchange standards and to obtain conceptual objects in a second set of registries facilitating information exchange standards established for individual domains. The first set of registries may include global registries provided by servers such as one or more of the global registry server via the global registry provision module. The global information exchange standards facilitated by the first set of registries may provide best practice and or guidelines e.g. by defining elements syntax and or structures for information exchanges standardized process for conducting information exchanges international information standards standards established for exchanging information related to a general purpose the and or any other global information exchange standard. The standardized objects obtained by the object module from the first set of registries may include components of reference models provided by those registries for facilitating global information exchange standards components of data models provided by those registries that represent collective knowledge about how information should be represented in an exchange objects that may be readily used to a start information exchange as they are commonly used by most of the information exchanges associated with those registries and or any other standardized objects provided by those registries. In some examples such standardized objects may include conceptual objects and or product objects provided by those registries for establishing corresponding global information exchange standards as described above.

The second set of registries may include local registries provided by servers such as one or more of a domain server for establishing local information exchange standards for individual domains. The object module may be configured to obtain conceptual object from the second set of local registries that facilitate the local information exchange standards established for the individual domains. The conceptual objects obtained by the object module from the second set registries may include conceptual objects representing business concepts of the corresponding domains conceptual objects representing one or more local code value lists i.e. local code values and literals corresponding to objects provided by the first set of registries conceptual objects representing reusable components in individual information exchanges and or any other conceptual objects.

In any case for obtaining the objects the object module may be configured with semantics such as identities of one or more servers providing the first and second sets of registries network protocols for interacting with those servers interface information for accessing the first set of registries and or second set of registries and or any other semantics for obtaining the standardized objects from the global registries and the local registries.

The exchange object composition module may be configured to enable users to compose exchange objects corresponding to data elements of individual information exchanges by using the standardized objects and or the conceptual objects obtained by the object module. Such exchange objects may correspond to data elements of exchange artifacts which may be any tangible and potentially reusable documentations and or output pertaining to any existing or potential information exchange. The exchange object composition module may enable users to compose exchanged objects by facilitating the users to include objects obtained by the object module in the to be composed exchange objects. In some exemplary implementations an exchange object composition may be enabled by allowing users to specify information structure by adding objects to a directory tree representing the exchange object to specify required information elements and or optional requirements for the exchange object to specify one or more conditions precedent to the exchange object to specify default value lists for the exchange objects a privacy level for the exchange object to specify a security level of the exchange object maximum and or minimum data length and or to specify any other aspects that may be associated with the exchange object.

The project composition module may be configured to enable the users to compose exchange projects that specify individual information exchanges by using user composed exchange objects. An exchange project may be composed by a user to include a collection of one or more information exchanges for a specific purpose and may be implemented by exchange servers to carry out the one or more information exchanges. As such the exchange project in some examples may comprise business requirements process exchange metadata message payloads and or any other events governing the information exchanges included in the exchange project. The project composition module may enable users to compose exchange projects by using user composed exchange objects.

The artifact generation module may be configured to generate exchange artifacts representing documentations and or outputs of the individual information exchanges based on the user composed exchange projects. The generated exchange artifacts may conform to one or more exchange standards the National Information Exchange Model NIEM Health Level Seven HL7 Accredited Standards Committee X12 ASC X12 and or any exchange standard. In some examples one or more artifacts may be generated based on a user composed exchange project and make up exchange documentation such as a NIEM Information Exchange Package Documentation IEPD . For generating such exchange artifacts the artifact generation module may obtain information such as set type information for the exchange artifacts to be generated based on the user composed exchange project e.g. NIEM HL7 ASC X12 and so on a XML standard for generating the artifacts e.g. NIEM 2.1 schema style e.g. hierarchical associative attribute a source or sources from which the underlying exchange project may be obtained a name to identify the generated exchange artifacts and any other information for generating the exchange artifacts. Programming rules specifications and or semantics may be configured with the artifact generation module which may include semantics for parsing the underlying exchange project semantics for generating the exchange artifacts using the XML standard and exchange standard specified by the users semantics for packaging the generated exchange artifacts based on the exchange standards specified by the users.

The interface module may be configured to generate graphical user interfaces enabling the users to perform actions to manage the conceptual objects in the local registries to compose exchange objects to compose exchange projects to generate exchange artifacts and or to perform any other user actions. The information generated by the interface module may cause electronic displays coupled to the client computers to present a graphical user interface for managing the conceptual objects in the local registries composing exchange objects composing exchange projects generating exchange artifacts and or any other user actions. The information generated by the interface module may include HTML code view information information indicating graphics for presentation on the client computers and or any other information.

These and other features and characteristics of the present technology as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings all of which form a part of this specification wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures. It is to be expressly understood however that the drawings are for the purpose of illustration and description only and are not intended as a definition of the limits of the invention. As used in the specification and in the claims the singular form of a an and the include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

As illustrated in this example the global registry server comprises a processor configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules may comprise a global registry management module a promotion receipt module a promotion review module a global registry provision module an object importation module an interface module and or any other computer program modules. As also illustrated in this example the domain server comprises a processor configured to execute computer program modules. The computer program modules executed on the processor may comprise a repository module a local registry server a promotion request module an object importation module and or any other computer program modules.

The global registry management module may be configured to manage a global registry of conceptual objects corresponding to data elements and or object types of a global information exchange standard which may provide a basis on which individual information exchanges may be developed. Such a global information exchange standard may be established by an authority or any authentication body for defining standardized information elements and or structures of information exchanges. As such the global information exchange standard may provide best practice and or guidelines for developing individual information exchanges standardized processes for developing the information exchanges international or national standards related to information exchanges having specific purposes and or any other standards. For example a global information exchange standard may be established for a nationwide hospital group having regional member groups that exchange health care information within the individual member groups and or between one another. In that example a global information exchange standard may be established for the nationwide hospital governance body or association to define information elements and or structures representing a national standard of how the health care information should be represented within the nationwide hospital group. As such the global information exchange standard for the nationwide hospital governance body or association may specify data requirements for the health care information for example such as that information representing a patient must include a patient identification understood through all member groups of the nationwide hospital group. Such data requirements may be used as a basis for developing individual information exchanges for meeting the data requirements specified by the global information exchange standard for the nationwide hospital group.

For representing such a global information exchange standard conceptual objects may be provided in a global registry. In some implementations the global registry may be physically implemented through one or more electronic storages coupled to or included in the system such as electronic storage as illustrated. In some examples the physical implementation of the global registry may include one or more files records tables arrays data structures and or any other data objects stored in the electronic storages.

In any case the conceptual objects in the global registry may be determined by an authenticator an administrator a provider a developer and or any other entities related to establishing the global information exchange standard. In some exemplary implementations the conceptual objects may be determined for providing data models which may represent cross domain views of how the information may be represented and or exchanged best practices for developing information exchanges standardized processes for developing information exchanges international or national standard related to information exchanges having specific purposes and or any other standards. Examples of such data models may include entity relationship network structure object oriented and or any other data models. The conceptual objects in the global registry may correspond to data elements and or object types of the global information exchange standard. As an example for illustration a global information exchange standard may be established by an authority to include an object type of employee of a nationwide hospital group. In that example the authority may determine that the employee object type should have data elements corresponding to the name gender birthdate salary employee number and any other properties associated with an employee of the hospital group. To facilitate a global information exchange standard for the nationwide hospital group a conceptual object i.e. an employee object having various attributes corresponding to those data elements may be provided.

In some examples for facilitating information exchanges based on the global information exchange standard product objects may be provided in the global registry managed by the global registry management module . The product objects may represent logic models based on business use semantics commonly adopted for example as best practice. In some exemplary implementations such a product object may include a set of conceptual objects in the global registry organized in a way reflecting collective knowledge about a specific type of information exchange. Such product objects may be used to specify specific document types or data payload fields for the information exchanges. As an example of illustration a person data product object may be provided in a global registry for providing a best practice how information related to a person may be represented in an information exchange. In that example the person data object may include a set of conceptual objects in the global registry such as birthdate physical description physical feature surgery history preventive care history and or any other conceptual objects determined by an administrator provider developer and or any other entities related to establishing the global information exchange standard as the best practice for representing information related to a person in an information exchange.

In any case the global registry management module may be configured to manage the global registry. This may include adding new conceptual objects to the global registry modifying the conceptual objects removing the conceptual objects deprecating the conceptual objects e.g. making the conceptual objects obsolete for future development by deactivating the conceptual objects locating the conceptual objects and or any other management operations for managing the global registry. In some exemplary implementations programming rules such as indexing schemes and or other rules may be preconfigured into the global registry management module at a configuration stage to facilitate the global registry management operations performed by global registry management module . In some examples interfaces for managing the global registry may be provided by for example by the interface module to facilitate the administrator developer and or any entity that is authorized to manage the global registry to initiate user actions that cause the global registry management module to execute the global management operations.

In some exemplary implementations the conceptual objects in the global registry may represent entity relationship concepts and business use semantics. Such entity relationship concepts and business use semantics may be used by an information exchange developer to specify information involved in an exchange as for example entities roles relationships actions elements and or any other entity relationship concepts. An entity may represent a logical grouping of elements that describe a real world thing and may be used to represent information capturing that real world thing. Examples of an entity may include person location vehicle telephone number and or any other entities. Different types of relationships may exist between entities as how the entities may relate to one another in the real world. Entities having relationships may play roles in the relationships. For example a person entity may play a role of a patient a victim an insurer and or any other roles. An action may correspond to a context of a type of work or process that may be applied to or acted on an entity. For example an incident entity may include actions such as but not limited to occurred reported approved updated and or any other action. For an entity representing a court event the associated actions may include scheduled occurred published and or any other actions. An element may be a single unique piece of information or an atomic descriptive attribute that describes something about an entity role or action. Examples of an element may include age of a person a charge of a suspect salary of an employee time of an action and or any other atomic descriptive attributes. An enumeration may be a set of values that can be assigned to an element. For example an age of a person may be a value in a set having integers ranging from 0 to 120 a charge of a suspect may be a value representing criminal penalties that may be charged on a suspect under the Law and so on.

In these exemplary implementations where conceptual objects representing entity relationship concepts are provided in the global registry business use semantics may be applied to the conceptual objects by the authenticator administrator developer and or any other entities that may author conceptual objects. The business use semantics may reflect collective knowledge about such conceptual objects. Example of the business use semantics may include required and or optional elements for the entities required actions for entities constraints for applying relationships to the entities constraints on entities to play specific roles and or any other business use semantics that may be applied to the conceptual objects representing the entity relationship concepts. As an example for illustration business use semantics specifying that a person must have a social security number may be applied to a conceptual object representing a person entity business use semantics specifying that a suspect must not have misdemeanor charges a person may play a role as patient but may not play a role as a department of an organization and so on.

In these exemplary implementations where conceptual objects representing entity relationship concepts are provided in the global registry product objects may be provided to indicate relationships of entities represented by the conceptual objects in the global registry. For example a product object of prescription may include a personal entity playing a role as doctor another person entity playing a role as a patient an entity representing a drug and a prescribing action that may be acted on the drug. In that example the business use semantics as determined by an administrator of the global registry may specify that a range of values representing specific drugs may be prescribed.

The promotion receipt module may be configured to receive promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects in local registries associated with individual domains to the global registry. The individual domains may include organizations agencies departments subsidiaries local governments and or any other logical groups characterized by specific functions features responsibilities and or line of businesses. For example within an enterprise subsidiaries may make up individual domains having corresponding lines of businesses within a court system regional courts may make up a court domain characterized by a corresponding jurisdiction within a federal government entity e.g. such as the Environment Protection Agency local EPA agencies may make up individual domains and so on. Such an individual domain may exchange information within the domain. For instance business groups and or departments within a subsidiary of an enterprise may exchange information with one another local courts in a court domain may exchange information with one another and so on. An individual domain exchange information with other domains. For example subsidiaries of the enterprise may exchange information with one another court domains may exchange information with one another and so on.

For establishing local information exchange standard at domain level an administrator developer provider and or any other entities related to domain level information exchange may employ local registries for providing objects corresponding to data elements of the local information exchange standard. The objects in the local registries may represent knowledge about how information may be represented at a domain level. Similar to those objects in a global registry the objects in local registries may be applied with business use semantics which may be specific to the individual domains. For example a domain of a regional hospital group may provide a conceptual object of a room corresponding to hospital room in the regional hospital group. Business use semantics such as without limitations a maximum number of floors e.g. 10floor a room may be on may be applied to the room conceptual object in the local registry to reflect that the hospitals in the regional hospital group do not have more than 10 floors which may not be true for other hospitals in other regional hospital groups.

In accordance with one aspect of the disclosure a promotion request may be generated for example by an administrator developer provider or any other entities related to information exchange for a domain to promote the objects the local registry to the global registry managed by the global registry management module . Such a promotion request may include information indicating specific objects including conceptual objects in the local registry to be promoted to the global registry one or more developers or entities that created the objects in the local registry textual descriptions of the objects textual descriptions of a reason or reasons why the objects may be promoted to the global registry and or any other information facilitating promotion of objects in a local registry to the global registry.

The promotion receipt module may be configured to receive such a promotion request via any suitable wired or wireless connections. For receiving the promotion request the promotion receipt module may be configured to detect promotion requests as they arrive serialize the receipt of the promotion request detect boundaries of the promotion request parse the promotion request and or perform any other operations for receiving the promotion requests. In some examples programming rules that specify for example delimiters signifying a beginning and end of a promotion requests number of fields in a promotion request length of each fields information type of each field e.g. textual strings for the description field and or any other programming rules may be configured into the promotion receipt module for receiving the promotion requests. In some examples the promotion receipt module may be configured to receive the promotion requests at a frequency predetermined by the provider administrator and or any other entities related to the global registry. In some examples the promotion receipt module may be configured to dynamically receive the promotion requests as they are pushed to the system .

In some examples where a promotion request for promoting a product object to the global registry is received by the promotion receipt module the promotion receipt module may be configured to generate one or more promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects included in the to be promoted product objects. For example in a case where a promotion request for promoting a product object presenting a Victim Information having an entity object of Person is received the promotion receipt module may generate a promotion request to promote the Person entity to the global registry

The promotion review module may be configured to obtain review information indicating approvals and in some examples denials of the promotion requests received by the promotion receipt module . In response to a promotion request received by the promotion receipt module one or more reviews may be performed for determining whether the object s being requested by the promotion request may be promoted to the global registry. Considerations such as whether the to be promoted object s conforms to the global information exchange standard embodied by the global registry whether a similar object s has existed in the global registry whether the to be promoted object reflects information element s and or structure s as a best practice and or any other considerations. Based on such considerations reviews may be performed. In some examples the reviews may be performed by the promotion review module by employing programming rules simulating these considerations. For instance logic representing decision trees based on such considerations may be configured into the promotion review module such that the promotion review module may review the promotion request automatically. Simultaneously or alternatively the reviews may be performed by one or more authenticators administrators providers and or any other entities related to establishing the global information exchange standard via an interface for example provided by the interface module to perform the reviews.

In any case the promotion review module may be configured to obtain such review information and determine whether the promotion request has been approved. In some examples the review information may readily indicate an approval of the review s of the promotion request. In some examples the review information may indicate a number of approvals by for example a number of authenticators and a number of denials by another number of authenticators. In those examples the promotion review module may be configured to determine whether the promotion request has been finally approved. For such determination for example weighted scores may be assigned to different approvals and denials based on significance of the authenticators. Programming rules such as escalating the review upon gathering a number of approvals above a threshold may be configured into the promotion review module .

The global registry provision module may be configured to provide objects including conceptual objects promoted from local registries in the global registry to client computers associated with developers of the information exchanges. The provision of the objects in the global registry by the global registry provision module may be made in response to object access requests by the client computers e.g. such as the client computers as illustrated. For accessing the objects in the global registry the client computer may transmit an access request to the system . In response to such an access request from the client computer the global registry provision module may provide the requested objects to the client computer via any suitable wired or wireless connections between the client computer and the system . In some examples for facilitating such provisions the global registry provision module may be configured to provide interfaces for communicating with the client computers. Such interfaces may include application programming interfaces API common gateway interfaces web interfaces and or any other interfaces that may be provided to the client computers to access the objects in the global registry.

The object importation module may be configured to import from external resources such as the external resources information indicating conceptual objects and or project objects to the global registry. Such external resources may include XML files spreadsheet files database tables and or any other external resources that may provide definitions of conceptual objects and or project objects. For facilitating such importation the object importation module may analyze the external resources and determine which objects are provided by the external resources but not yet provided in the global registry extract these objects from the external resources and or creating these objects according to the definitions of the objects as indicated in the external resources store these objects in the global registry such that they may be provided to the client computers by the global registry provision module and or perform any other operations for importing objects from the external resources to the global registry.

The interface module may be configured to generate information for providing graphical user interfaces implemented on client computers to enable user actions for managing the promotion requests received by the promotion receipt module . The information generated by the interface module may cause electronic displays coupled to the client computers e.g. such as the client computers as illustrated to present a graphical user interface for managing the promotion requests. User actions may be enabled by controls provided by the graphical user interface such as but not limited to navigation trees selection boxes text input boxes radio buttons and or any other field controls. The enabled user actions may include actions for managing the promotion requests e.g. for approving the promotion requests. Such user actions may be executed by the system for example to cause the promotion review module to obtain review information and to determine whether promotion requests have been approved. The information generated by the interface module may include HTML code view information information indicating graphics for presentation on the client computers and or any other information.

The repository module may be configured to manage a repository of exchange objects. The exchange objects may correspond to data elements of exchange artifacts that facilitate the actual information exchanges. As such the exchange objects may specify various aspects of information exchanges such as exchange metadata that specify description administration legal requirements technical functionality use and usage and or preservation of the information exchange payload that specify data content of the information exchanges e.g. the actual information being exchanged one or more services being facilitated by the information exchanges and or any other aspects that may specify the information exchanges.

In some exemplary implementations the exchange objects in the repository managed by the repository module may comprise product objects based on information exchange needs of the domain. The product objects may be used to specify data content i.e. the payload of the information exchanges. The product objects may be promoted to a global registry e.g. via a promotion request obtained by the promotion request module. A product object in the repository of the domain may comprise one or more conceptual objects from the global registry and or one or more conceptual objects from the local registry. These objects may be organized in the product object in a way to reflect a logical grouping in accordance with the business purpose domain level information exchange standard business rules and or any other semantics associated with the domain. For example a law enforcement domain may have a product object representing an incident report which may comprise a victim entity from a global registry facilitating a global information exchange standard e.g. the national victim information exchange standard an offender entity from a local registry associated with the law enforcement domain that represents all possible offenders under the laws enforced by the law enforcement domain and so on.

In some examples the repository managed by the repository module may be physically implemented using one or more electronic storages such as the electronic storage as illustrated. The exchange objects in those examples may be stored in files databases tables records and or any storage units on the electronic storages. For managing the repository the repository module may be configured with data paths file location database table names query strings and or any other semantics for accessing the repositories. The management operations of the repository module may include but not limited to adding deleting modifying deprecating locating consolidating promoting and or any other operations for managing the repository.

The local registry module may be configured to manage a local registry of conceptual objects corresponding to data elements of an information exchange standard established for the individual domain e.g. a local information exchange standard. The local information exchange standard may reflect an understanding how information in the individual domain may be represented best practice for developing information exchanges within the individual domain standardized process for developing information exchanges within the individual domain and or any other local standards. Data models for facilitating such a local information standard may be determined by an administrator developer provider and or any other entities related to information exchanges of the individual domain and provided through the local registry. The data models may include conceptual objects corresponding to entity relationship network structure object oriented and or any other data models for facilitating the local information exchange standard.

By way of a non limiting example a local information exchange standard of a law enforcement domain may be established to represent information elements structures business use semantics constraints and or any other aspects of the information in the law enforcement domain. Conceptual objects such as offender charge victim incident and or any other conceptual objects may be provided in a local registry to facilitate the local information exchange standard. For instance the offender may have a group of associated attributes specific to offenders of interests to the law enforcement domain.

In any case the local registry module may be configured to manage the local registry. This may include adding new conceptual objects to the local registry modifying the conceptual objects removing the conceptual objects deprecating the conceptual objects e.g. marking the conceptual objects obsolete for future development by deactivating the conceptual objects locating the conceptual objects and or any other management operations for managing the local registry. In some exemplary implementations programming rules such as an indexing scheme and or other rules may be preconfigured into the local registry module at a configuration stage to facilitate the local registry management operations performed by local registry module . In some examples interfaces for managing the local registry may be provided to facilitate the administrator developer and or any entity that is authorized to manage the local registry to initiate user actions that cause the local registry module to execute the local management operations.

In some exemplary implementations the local registry may be physically implemented through one or more electronic storages coupled to or included in the system such as electronic storage as illustrated. In some examples the physical implementation of the local registry may include various types of indexing and or clustering one or more files records tables arrays data structures and or any other data objects stored in the electronic storages.

The promotion request module may be configured to obtain promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects in the local registry and or for promoting product objects in the repository to the global registry. In some example the promotion request module may obtain the promotion requests as they are input by an administrator developer provider and or any other entities related to the domain through a user interface. In some examples the promotion request module may be configured with programming rules to determine the promotion requests automatically for example based on the usage of the conceptual objects and or product objects within the domain and or across the domain. A promotion request obtained by the promotion request module may include information indicating specific objects including conceptual and or product objects in the local registry and or repository to be promoted to the global registry one or more developers or entities that created the objects in the local registry textual descriptions of the objects textual descriptions of reasons why the objects may be promoted to the global registry and or any other information facilitating promotion of objects in a local registry to the global registry.

In some examples where a promotion request for promoting a product object to the global registry the promotion request module may be configured to generate one or more promotion requests for promoting conceptual objects included in the to be promoted product objects. For example in a case where a product presenting a Victim Information product having an entity object of Person is requested to be promoted to the global registry the promotion request module may generate a promotion request to promote the Person entity to the global registry.

The object importation module may be configured to import from external resources information indicating one or more conceptual objects to the local registry and or one or more product objects to the repository. Such external resources may include exchange artifacts facilitating specific information exchanges XML files specifying one or more objects spreadsheet files specifying schema or views of information and or any other external resources that may provide definitions of conceptual objects and or project objects. For facilitating such importation the object importation module may analyze the external resources and determine which objects are provided by the external resources but not yet provided in the global registry extract these objects from the external resources and or creating these objects according to the definitions of the objects as indicated in the external resources store these objects in the local registry and or the repository such that they may be provided to the client computers in the domain and or perform any other operations for importing objects from the external resources to the local registry and or repository.

As illustrated the servers and may comprise electronic storage and and or other components. The servers and may include communication lines or ports to enable the exchange of information with a network and or other computing platforms.

In this example the first processor may include a host central unit CPU having multiple cores however any suitable processor may be employed including a DSP APU GPGPU or any other suitable processor or logical circuitry. The first processor may be bi directionally connected to other components of the client computer via the system bus. The second processor may include a graphics processing unit GPU which drives the display device via a display connector such as analog display connectors for example composite video S Video VGA digital display connectors for example HDMI mini DVI micro DVI wireless connectors or any other suitable connectors. It is understood that in some other examples of client computer the first processor may be integrated with the second processor to form a general processor.

In this example as shown the first processor may be configured to execute an object module an exchange object composition module an exchange project composition module an artifact generation module an interface module and or any other modules.

The object module may be configured to obtain standardized objects in a first set of registries facilitating global information exchange standards and to obtain conceptual objects in a second set of registries facilitating information exchange standards established for individual domains. The first set of registries may include global registries provided by servers such as one or more of the global registry server via the global registry provision module . The global information exchange standards may provide developers of individual information exchanges logical models to specify the individual information exchanges without concerning physical implementations. As such the global information exchange standards facilitated by the first set of registries may for example provide best practice and or guidelines e.g. by defining logical representations of elements syntax and or structures for information exchange standards e.g. such as NIEM standardized process for conducting information exchanges based of business documents e.g. the The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting SAR Initiative NSI international information standards e.g. such as the ISO IEC 11179 standard for representing metadata for an organization standards established for exchanging information related to a general purpose e.g. the ASC X12 standard for exchanging business transaction information the HL 7 standard for exchanging information related to clinical patient care and the management delivery and evaluation of health care services the IHE standard for exchanging information related to healthcare information and or any other standards established for exchanging information related to a general purpose the and or any other global information exchange standard. The standardized objects obtained by the object module from the first set of registries may include components of reference models provided by those registries for facilitating global information exchange standards e.g. predefined objects representing concepts within an information exchange or business context such as what information describing the sender and or receiver of an information exchange should entail what conditions must be satisfied for the information exchanges to take place what data requirements must be stratified by the information exchanges and or any predefined objects components of data models provided by those registries that represent collective knowledge about how information should be represented in an exchange e.g. object types properties relationships metadata semantics objects that may be readily used to a start information exchange as they are commonly used by most of the information exchanges associated with those registries e.g. best practices and or any other standardized objects provided by those registries. In some examples such standardized objects may include conceptual objects and or product objects provided by those registries for establishing corresponding global information exchange standards as described above.

The second set of registries may include local registries provided by servers such as one or more of the domain server for establishing local information exchange standards for individual domains. The information exchange standards for the individual domains may reflect understandings how information in those domains may be represented. Such understandings may be specified by business rules constraints data requirements business use semantics and or any other semantics. The object module may be configured to obtain conceptual object from the second set of local registries that facilitate the local information exchange standards established for the individual domains. The conceptual objects obtained by the object module from the second set registries may include conceptual objects representing business concepts of the corresponding domains conceptual objects representing one or more local code value lists i.e. local code values and literals corresponding to objects provided by the first set of registries conceptual objects representing reusable components in individual information exchanges and or any other conceptual objects.

In any case for obtaining the objects the object module may be configured with semantics such as identities of one or more servers providing the first and set of registries e.g. such as the servers and as illustrated in network protocols for interacting with these servers interface information for accessing the first set of registries and or second set of registries and or any other semantics for obtaining the standardized objects from the global registries and the local registries.

The exchange object composition module may be configured to enable users to compose exchange objects corresponding to data elements of individual information exchanges by using the standardized objects and or the conceptual objects obtained by the object module . Such exchange objects may correspond to data elements of exchange artifacts which may be any tangible and potentially reusable documentations and or output pertaining to any existing or potential information exchange. As such the exchange objects may include for example but not limited to exchange metadata that specify description administration legal requirements technical functionality use and usage and or preservation of the information being exchanged exchange payload that specify data content of the information being exchanged one or more services being facilitated by the information exchanges and or any other exchange objects that may be used to specify individual information exchanges.

The exchange object composition module may enable users to compose exchanged objects by facilitating the users to include objects obtained by the object module . In some exemplary implementations an exchange object composition may be enabled by allowing users to specify information structure by adding objects to a directory tree representing the exchange object to specify required information elements and or optional requirements for the exchange object to specify one or more conditions precedent to the exchange object to specify default value lists for the exchange objects a privacy level for the exchange object e.g. for setting an authorization level required to see or use the information to specify a security level of the exchange object e.g. for setting a credential level required to see or use information contained in the object maximum and or minimum data length and or to specify any other aspects that may be associated with the exchange object.

The project composition module may be configured to enable the users to compose exchange projects that specify individual information exchanges by using user composed exchange objects. An exchange project may be composed by a user to include a collection of one or more information exchanges for a specific purpose and may be implemented by exchange servers not illustrated in this example to carry out the one or more information exchanges. As such the exchange project in some examples may comprise business requirements process and or events governing the information exchanges included in the exchange project. In some examples the exchange project may include metadata content e.g. such as metadata about the project processes and exchange use cases exchange payload content used by an exchange use case e.g. a product object and or any other components that may be included in an exchange project.

By way of a non limiting example an exchange project composed by a user for exchanging information of citations made by a group of law enforcement agencies may include information describing a provider of the citation information e.g. a county court one or more receivers or consumers of the citation information exchange e.g. the county attorney office county sheriff office and so on one or more documents specifying criminal disposition use cases exchange payload content e.g. charge data collection sponsor endorser developer and or any other entities of the citation information exchange and or any other information that may be included in an exchange project for implementing the actual information exchanges.

In any case the project composition module may enable users to compose exchange projects by using the user composed exchange objects which may include metadata documentation product and or any other exchange objects. In some examples such enablement may include enabling the users to include metadata objects specifying metadata information describing the exchange project e.g. such as business name description development schedule disclosure category and or any other metadata information an object or objects indicating contact information for e.g. owner author sponsor endorser and or any other entities related to the information exchange project an object or objects indicating identity information of the provider and or consumer s of the information being exchanged as specified by the information exchange project one or more product objects representing exchange payload e.g. one or more product objects one or more document objects indicating documents to be included in the exchange project and or any other objects that may be included in the exchange project.

The artifact generation module may be configured to generate exchange artifacts representing documentations and or outputs of the individual information exchanges based on the user composed exchange projects. The generated exchange artifacts may conform to one or more exchange standards such as the National Information Exchange Model NIEM Health Level Seven HL7 Accredited Standards Committee X12 ASC X12 and or any exchange standard. In some examples one or more artifacts may be generated based on a user composed exchange project and make up an information package documentation IEPD . In those examples as such the artifacts generated by the artifact generation module may include but not limited to IEPD metadata instance product reference schema entity digest and extension schema subset schemas IEPD Catalog mapping sheet want list and or any other exchange artifacts.

In any case for generating such exchange artifacts conforming to the one or more exchange objects the artifact generation module may obtain information such as set type information for the exchange artifacts to be generated based on the user composed exchange project e.g. NIEM HL7 ASC X12 and so on a XML standard for generating the artifacts e.g. NIEM 2.1 schema style e.g. LEXS a source or sources from which the underlying exchange project may be obtained a name to identify the generated exchange artifacts and any other information for generating the exchange artifacts. Programming rules specifications and or semantics may be configured with the artifact generation module which may include semantics for parsing the underlying exchange project semantics for generating the exchange artifacts using the XML standard and exchange standard e.g. via the set type specification specified by the users semantics for packaging the generated exchange artifacts based on the exchange standards specified by the users.

The interface module may be configured to generate graphical user interfaces enabling the users to perform actions to manage the conceptual objects in the local registries to compose exchange objects to compose exchange projects to generate exchange artifacts and or to perform any other user actions. The information generated by the interface module may cause electronic displays coupled to the client computers e.g. such as the client computers as illustrated to present a graphical user interface for managing the conceptual objects in the local registries composing exchange objects composing exchange projects generating exchange artifacts and or any other user actions. Such user actions may be enabled by controls provided by the graphical user interface such as but not limited to navigation trees selection boxes text input boxes radio buttons and or any other field controls. The information generated by the interface module may include HTML code view information information indicating graphics for presentation on the client computers and or any other information.

As illustrated in this example the global registry may provide standardized objects . The standardized objects in the global registry may be determined by an authenticator an administrator a provider a developer and or any other entities for facilitating a global information exchange standard. The global information exchange standard facilitated by global registry may provide best practice and or guidelines e.g. by defining elements syntax and or structures for information exchanges e.g. such as NIEM standardized process for conducting information exchanges e.g. the The Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting SAR Initiative NSI international information standards e.g. such as the ISO IEC 11179 standard for representing metadata for an organization standards established for exchanging information related to a general purpose e.g. the ASC X12 standard for exchanging business transaction information the HL 7 standard for exchanging information related to clinical patient care and the management delivery and evaluation of health care services the IHE standard for exchanging information related to healthcare information and or any other standards established for exchanging information related to a general purpose the and or any other global information exchange standard. The standardized objects may include components of reference models e.g. based on the global information standard components of data models e.g. object types properties relationships metadata semantics based on the global information exchange standard reusable objects that may be readily used for developing a new information exchange and or any other standardized objects.
