title: Methods and apparatuses to optimize updates in a file system based on birth time
abstract: Methods and apparatuses that maintain birth time for a file system to optimize file update operations are described. The file system can include a plurality of snapshots or clones of data stored in one or more extents of blocks allocated in a storage device. Each extent may be associated with a time stamp according to the birth time. A request may be received from an executable using the file system to update data in a particular extent associated with a particular time stamp. In response, the current birth time in the file system and the particular time stamp may be compared to determine if the particular extent is not shared by more than one of the snapshots. If the particular time stamp is equal to the current birth time, the particular extent may be updated directly without performing an expensive operation to check whether a reference count of the particular extent is equal to one.

This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 12 648 273 filed Dec. 28 2009 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 849 876 entitled METHODS AND APPARATUSES TO OPTIMIZE UPDATES IN A FILE SYSTEM BASED ON BIRTH TIME the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes.

The present invention relates generally to file systems. More particularly this invention relates to copy on write operations performed in file systems.

File systems are usually cloned e.g. taking snapshots to provide for example crash recovery capabilities. A common technique employed to maintain clones or snapshots of a file system using B Tree Balanced Tree structures may be based on copy on write operations without a need to duplicate file system data shared by multiple clones. A live file system may be called a Logical Volume. The collection of all clones of a live file system and the live file system itself may be called a Logical Volume Family. Depending on which clones are created on which clone or live file system the clones and the live file system within the Logical Volume Family forms a tree structure which may be called the LVF Clone Tree. The live file system is always on the leaf of the tree. If a clone is created on another clone one of the clone is the leaf while the other clone is not the leaf of the tree. Existing implementations of copy on write operations may require a costly lookup to identify reference counts for tree structures in a file system.

For example a file system may use a reference count table to keep track of how many references there are to each tree node e.g. representing a group of consecutive allocation blocks or extents in tree structures of the file system. It is not uncommon for a block on disk to have hundreds of references. Typically whether to perform copy on write operations for a tree node associated with blocks of data in a file system may depend on a reference count of the tree node which may indicate how many references to the tree node currently existing in the file system.

However B Tree structures in a file system tend to have huge fan out. The number of links between the first and second levels in a B Tree structure can be for example in the hundreds. Thus a reference count table storing reference counts for such B Tree structures can be too large to fit in memory. Accessing the reference count table can result in wasting system resources with frequent memory paging operations. Additionally traversing such a large sized table to locate a reference count for a tree node may take significant amount of time to complete and have a negative impact on the performance of a file system.

Therefore current implementations of file systems requiring reference count checking do not optimize copy on write strategies to share data among clones and or live versions of the file systems.

An embodiment of the present invention can include methods and apparatuses that maintain birth time for a file system to optimize file update operations. The file system can include a plurality of snapshots or clones of data stored in one or more extents of blocks allocated in a storage device. Each extent may be associated with a time stamp according to the birth time. A request may be received from an executable using the file system to update data in a particular extent associated with a particular time stamp. In response the current birth time in the file system and the particular time stamp may be compared to determine if the particular extent is not shared by more than one of the snapshots. If the clone or the live file system is at the leaf of the LVF Clone tree and the particular time stamp is equal to the current birth time the particular extent may be updated directly e.g. overwriting the data in the particular extent without performing an expensive operation to check whether a reference count of the particular extent is equal to one. The file system can employ a copy on write technique if the extent cannot be updated directly.

In an alternative embodiment a birth counter may be maintained to count birth time at creation of each dataset in a file system. A plurality of datasets may be represented by multiple tree structures in the file system. Each node in the tree structures may be time stamped according to the birth time when the node is created. A particular node may be identified to update a particular dataset without affecting other datasets based on reference counts. Whether a time stamp of the particular node can be used to skip the checking of the reference count for this node can be determined according to current birth time from the birth counter if the clone or the live file system being updated is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree. The particular node can by modified in place e.g. overwriting rather than copying on write for the update of the particular dataset without retrieving the reference count from a data store if the reference count of the particular node equals to one. The time stamp may indicate the reference count for the particular node is one if the time stamp equals to the current birth time and the clone or the live file system being updated is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree.

In another embodiment a B Tree structure representing a dataset in a file system may be searched based on copy on write strategy using reference counts for nodes in the B Tree structure. The file system can maintain birth time to time stamp a B Tree. The birth time may be updated upon creation of a new dataset e.g. taking a snapshot or making a clone of the file system. When a leaf node in the B Tree structure is traversed during the search efficient update operations on data blocks associated with the leaf node may be enabled using a time stamp of the leaf node without expensive retrieval of a reference count of the leaf node if the clone or the live file system being updated is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree. Thus subsequent time consuming copy on write operations to store data for newly created leaf nodes updates of the data for the leaf nodes may be performed in place without retrieving reference counts of the leaf nodes to optimize data update operations in the file system.

Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

Methods and apparatuses for optimizing updates in a file system based on birth time are described herein. In the following description numerous specific details are set forth to provide thorough explanation of embodiments of the present invention. It will be apparent however to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances well known components structures and techniques have not been shown in detail in order not to obscure the understanding of this description.

Reference in the specification to one embodiment or an embodiment means that a particular feature structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment can be included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase in one embodiment in various places in the specification do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment.

The processes depicted in the figures that follow are performed by processing logic that comprises hardware e.g. circuitry dedicated logic etc. software such as is run on a general purpose computer system or a dedicated machine or a combination of both. Although the processes are described below in terms of some sequential operations it should be appreciated that some of the operations described may be performed in different order. Moreover some operations may be performed in parallel rather than sequentially.

In one embodiment birth time for a file system can be used in conjunction with reference counts to enable optimization to decide when a copy on write operation is needed. The birth time of an extent of blocks allocated in a storage device within a logical volume of a file system can be maintained to avoid consulting a large data structure such as a reference count table storing the usage of every extent of blocks for each logical volume group of the file system. In one embodiment if the birth time of an extent matches current birth time for families of logical volumes in a file system and the file system a clone or the live file system is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree the data in the extent can be safely overwritten without performing a copy on write operation. File system performance can be improved with little additional space for storing extra bitmaps by bypassing the expensive lookups to the reference count table.

In another embodiment implementations of copy on write operations in a file system can be improved to yield much better performance by adopting the concept of birth time. Typical birth time can be a counter e.g. a birth time counter associated with each dataset e.g. file folder collections of files and or folders or a logical volume. When a new clone or snapshot is created for a new dataset in a file system the birth time for the file system can be incremented for the new dataset. In one embodiment whenever an extent is created or modified for a dataset the extent may be time stamped with the active or current birth time for the dataset. Creating new clones or snapshots of the file system can cause the birth time counter to increment.

In one embodiment optimization to perform update operations on an extent in a file system to preserve shared data among clones or snapshots of the file system may occur when the birth time associated with the extent equals to the birth time of the file system and when the file system is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree. When optimized an update operation may not need to check a reference count for the extent from a data structure storing reference counts. In one embodiment the birth time associated with the block can indicate time of creation of the block per logical volume family. Birth time can be based on a counter counting a sequence of numbers instead of actual time.

For example three datasets representing a week old clone a day old clone and a live version of a file system can all point to a common block on disk. The live version of the file system may be at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree. A request for the live version to update a file including the common block may be limited by preserving contents of the common blocks on disk without affecting the week old and the day old clones. A new block may be created for the live version to perform the update operation. The new block may be time stamped with current birth time of the file system or the birth time associated with the live version. Subsequent requests for the live version to update the common block for the file may be optimized with a quick check to determine if the birth time for the common block equals to the birth time of the live version. If they are equal indicating there is no reference from the week old clone neither the day old clone the common block is not commonly referenced used only by the live file system and can be overwritten in place for the live version without expensive lookup for a reference count as needed in performing copy on write operations.

In one embodiment file system may include tree representations having one or more tree structures such as clones and live to represent corresponding datasets . A clone may be a dataset based on a snapshot of data in file system at a time instance e.g. current time or earlier time . Live can represent current data or a snapshot of the data at the current time instance in file system . A tree structure in tree representations may be a B Tree data structure associated with raw data e.g. content of files stored in storage to allow efficient tree operations e.g. searches insertions deletions and or sequential accesses for updating datasets e.g. in logarithmic amortized time. Each dataset may include at least one tree representation.

In some embodiments tree structures in tree representations may relate to each other in a dependency tree specifying cloning relationships among different snapshots of file system i.e. the LVF Clone Tree. For example clone may represent a snapshot of file system taken from changes made to an earlier snapshot represented by clone . A snapshot represented by clone may have multiple child snapshots e.g. corresponding to clone and live etc. A leaf snapshot may not have any child snapshot such as represented by clone live .

A plurality of tree structures in a file system may share common nodes for portions of the file system which are not updated among different snapshots corresponding to the tree structures. Typically a node in a tree or tree structure may be referenced by one parent node in the same tree. When shared a node may have multiple parent nodes in different trees. A reference count for a node may indicate the number of parent nodes associated with the node. In one embodiment ref count table may store a reference count for each node of every tree in tree representations .

In one embodiment file system may include birth time storing a number for example indicating a sequence of time instants. Birth time counter module may update or count up birth time when instructed. Clone generator module may notify birth time counter module to update birth time when generating a new snapshot or clone for file system . Birth time may increase or increment with time as new snapshots are taken for file system . Each tree node in tree representations may be time stamped according to birth time for example when the tree node is generated.

In one embodiment dataset update module can perform update operations for file system such as adding deleting files adding deleting folders changing contents of files etc. via one or more tree node operations on tree representations . Tree node operations may include modification of one or more tree structures such as inserting deleting updating one or more nodes in the tree representations. For example dataset update module may perform copy on write operations on live based on reference counts stored in ref count table . Dataset update module may rely on birth time to determine whether to load or traverse ref count table when performing copy on write operations.

File system may include interface module to receive file system access requests from runtime programs e.g. via APIs application programming interface . File management module may determine access operations such as file directory or folder access read write or create remove and or file system snapshot clone generation etc. for the received file system access requests. For example file management module may send a file access request to dataset update module to update a file represented in live . Alternatively file management module can forward a request to clone generator module to generate a new clone from an existing clone such as clone or live in tree representations .

In one embodiment tree S may include tree node stamped with a birth time of value 1. Tree node may be created for tree S at a time when birth time of the exemplary file system is of value 1. In certain embodiments tree node may be a leaf node in tree S to represent extent corresponding to an extent of blocks allocated in a storage device such as storage of . Subsequently at instance for example tree S may have been created by cloning tree S for a live dataset in the exemplary file system with birth time advanced to 2. Tree S may be modified between instances and . Tree node may be shared by both trees S and S with a reference count equal to 2. Tree S may include one or more tree nodes not shared with tree S for changes or updates in datasets made on tree S since instance .

In one embodiment at instance subsequent to instance additional tree S may have been cloned from tree S with birth time advanced to 3. Trees S and S may have a clone relationship. Tree node may be shared by all three snapshots represented by trees S S and S with a reference count equal to 3 at instance . Illustratively at instance subsequent to instance another tree S may have been cloned from tree S with birth time advanced to 4. Tree node may be shared by all trees S S S and S with a reference count equal to 4 at instance . Tree S may represent current data or a live dataset in the exemplary file system at instance . S S S and S may be related in a clone tree such as an LVF clone tree based on clone relationships illustrated in .

Turning now to in one embodiment at instance subsequent to instance updates to data stored in portion of extent for the current dataset in the exemplary file system represented by tree S live tree may have been performed e.g. based on dataset update module of . Consequently in one embodiment according to the copy on write strategy extent may be allocated in a storage device for the updates corresponding to portion while extent can be kept unchanged without affecting trees S S and S .

Tree node may have been created in tree S to share portions of extent with trees S S and S . Tree nodes and can be created as child nodes of tree node to represent separate portions of extent shared with other trees. Tree node can be created to represent extent . In one embodiment birth time of the exemplary file system remains to be 4 during the time period between instances and . Thus tree nodes and may be time stamped with birth time equal to 4. The reference count for the part of the extent pointed by node and are 2 the reference count for the part of the extent pointed by node and is 1. Tree node may no longer be shared by tree S with reference count decreased from 4 to 3.

In one embodiment at instance subsequent to instance data stored in extent may have been updated e.g. via dataset update module according to a request from file management module of . Birth time in the exemplary file system may remain as 4 during the time period between instances and . Updating extent may be based on an optimized copy on write strategy including locating node in tree S and comparing time stamp 4 of node with birth time 4 of the exemplary file system without retrieving a reference count for node .

In one embodiment the processing logic of process may time stamp each node e.g. when creating the node in a tree structure representing a dataset in a file system according to a birth time of the file system. The processing logic of process can count up the birth time of a file system for creating a snapshot or a clone of the file system. For example the processing logic of process can update the birth time and time stamp tree nodes representing a newly generated snapshot or clone for a file system.

At block in one embodiment the processing logic of process can maintain a reference count table such as ref count table of to store reference counts for tree nodes in tree structures representing datasets in a file system. The processing logic of process can assign a reference count for each tree node to indicate a number of other tree nodes referring to the tree node such as a parent node of the tree node.

Typically each tree node having a parent node in a tree structure can have a reference count greater than zero. A tree node shared by multiple tree structures may have a reference count equal to the number of the sharing tree structures. The processing logic of process can update a reference count for a tree node when performing update operations on the tree structures. As the size of a reference count table grows with the number of tree nodes associated the processing logic of process may load e.g. a portion of the reference count table from a storage device such as storage of for accessing a reference count for a tree node.

At block the processing logic of process may receive a request to update or modify a file system e.g. from runtime programs via interface module of to perform update operations for the file system. In response the processing logic of process may identify one or more tree nodes for update in a tree structure for example representing a live dataset for the file system based on copy on write strategy. For example the processing logic of process may traverse a tree structure top down including checking and updating reference counts for identified nodes during the traversal.

According to one embodiment at block the processing logic of process can compare current birth time of the exemplary file system with a time stamp of an identified tree node to determine if the identified tree node is not shared by more than one tree structure. This use of birth time can be performed when the file system or clone being updated is at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree. Typically current birth time may be readily available from the exemplary file system such as retrieved from birth time of . The time stamp of the identified tree node may be based on the birth time of the exemplary file system at an earlier time when the identified tree node was created.

In one embodiment at block if the current birth time of the exemplary file system equals to a time stamp of an identified tree node the identified tree node may be shared by no more than one tree structure. The identified tree node may have a reference count equal to 1 if the identified tree node is shared by no more than one tree structure. The processing logic of process can perform update operations directly or in place on the identified tree node similar to a copy on write strategy with a reference count equal to 1 for the identified tree node but without actually retrieving the reference count of the identified tree node. The processing logic of process can ensure a reference count equal to 1 for the identified tree node without traversing or even accessing a table or other data structures such as ref count table of storing the reference count for the identified tree node.

Otherwise at block if the file system or the clone being updated is not at the leaf of the LVF Clone Tree or a comparison between a current birth time of the exemplary file system and a time stamp of an identified tree node does not indicate the identified tree node is shared by no more than one tree structure e.g. the current birth time not equal to the time stamp the processing logic of process may retrieve a reference count for the identified tree node. For example the processing logic of process can load a reference count table from a storage such as storage of to traverse the reference count table to locate the reference count for the identified tree node. The processing logic of process may perform update operations on the identified tree node using the retrieved reference count based on copy on write strategy.

At block in one embodiment the processing logic of process may count up birth time e.g. based on birth time counter module of of a file system to generate a new tree structure for cloning data in the file system from one of existing clones or live data. For example the processing logic of process can receive a file system request to clone a live dataset of the file system e.g. based on clone generator module of . The new tree structure may include a newly generated root node and one or or more tree nodes shared with other tree structures according to copy on write strategy. In some embodiments the new tree structure may represent the live dataset of the file system. Each newly generated node in the new tree structure may be time stamped according to the already counted up birth time.

In one embodiment the processing logic of process can update reference counts for newly generated tree nodes and shared tree nodes in the new tree structure for example via a table storing reference counts for tree nodes such as ref count table of . The processing logic of process can assign reference count to a newly generate tree node and count up an existing reference count for each shared node for example based on copy on write strategy.

At block the processing logic of process can identify a particular node in the new tree structure for update. For example the processing logic of process can receive a file update request such as via a file management module of to perform update operations on live data of a file system represented by the new tree structure. The processing logic of process can traverse the new tree structure from top down to identify one or more tree nodes to perform update operations according to the file update request received.

In one embodiment at block the processing logic of process can determine or verify if a leaf condition is satisfied for a particular one of the tree nodes identified for update. A leaf condition for a tree node may be satisfied for example if the tree node belongs to a tree structure which represents a clone or a file system being updated at a leaf of a LVF clone tree and or whether the tree node is a leaf node in the tree structure. A tree node may be a leaf node or a leaf according to whether the tree node has any child node and or whether the tree node has been cloned or copied. In some embodiments the tree structures may be related in an LVF clone tree such as based on clone tree relationships of . A particular tree node of a particular one of the tree structure may be a leaf node if the particular tree structure is a leaf in the LVF clone tree.

If the particular node is a leaf node at block the processing logic of process can compare a time stamp of the particular node and current birth time maintained for a file system. The processing logic of process can determine whether the particular node is shared by more than one tree structures in the file system based on the time stamp and the current birth time. If the time stamp equals the current birth time in one embodiment the particular node may not be shared by more than one tree structure which could indicate a reference count stored e.g. in a table such as ref count table of for the particular node is equal to one without retrieving the reference count.

If the particular node is referenced in only one tree structure i.e. shared by no more than one tree structures at block the processing logic of process can perform update operations in place or directly on the particular node. For example the process logic of process can locate one of child nodes of the particular node to perform update operations. Alternatively the processing logic of process can update data represented by the particular node corresponding to blocks allocated in a storage device such as storage of without updating a reference count of the particular node.

At block the processing logic of process may continue to maintain a file system for example based on an optimized copy on write strategy using birth time. The processing logic of process may proceed to update additional identified tree nodes to complete request update operations using the birth time according to copy on write strategy. Alternatively the processing logic of process may receive additional file management requests for maintaining the file system.

At block in one embodiment if whether the particular node is shared or not cannot be determined the processing logic of process may retrieve a reference count for the particular node from a reference count store such as ref count table of . Typically locating the reference count for the particular node from the reference count store may require expensive traversal. When limited in available memory space the processing logic of process may perform memory paging operations to load portions of the reference count store to retrieve the reference count for the particular node.

At block in one embodiment the processing logic of process can determine if the particular node is shared by more than one tree structure e.g. representing more than one clone of a file system based on whether a retrieved reference count for the particular node is equal to 1. If the particular node is not shared the processing logic of process can proceed to perform update operations at block . Alternatively at block if the particular node is shared according to a retrieved reference count of the particular node the processing logic of process can perform copy on write operations to update the particular node.

For example the processing logic of process can generate a new tree node to replace the particular node in a tree structure representing live data of a file system. The processing logic of process may update a reference count store to increase reference counts for child nodes of the particular node by one. In some embodiments the processing logic of process can update the reference count store to decrease the reference count of the particular node by one. Alternatively the processing logic of process can allocate one or more blocks in a storage device for the new tree node to store data based on copy on write operations. At block the processing logic of process can update a time stamp of the new tree node with current birth time of the file system. The processing logic of process may continue at block .

As shown in the computer system which is a form of a data processing system includes a bus which is coupled to a microprocessor s and a ROM Read Only Memory and volatile RAM and a non volatile memory . The microprocessor may retrieve the instructions from the memories and execute the instructions to perform operations described above. The bus interconnects these various components together and also interconnects these components and to a display controller and display device and to peripheral devices such as input output I O devices which may be mice keyboards modems network interfaces printers and other devices which are well known in the art. Typically the input output devices are coupled to the system through input output controllers . The volatile RAM Random Access Memory is typically implemented as dynamic RAM DRAM which requires power continually in order to refresh or maintain the data in the memory.

The mass storage is typically a magnetic hard drive or a magnetic optical drive or an optical drive or a DVD RAM or a flash memory or other types of memory systems which maintain data e.g. large amounts of data even after power is removed from the system. Typically the mass storage will also be a random access memory although this is not required. While shows that the mass storage is a local device coupled directly to the rest of the components in the data processing system it will be appreciated that the present invention may utilize a non volatile memory which is remote from the system such as a network storage device which is coupled to the data processing system through a network interface such as a modem or Ethernet interface or wireless networking interface. The bus may include one or more buses connected to each other through various bridges controllers and or adapters as is well known in the art.

Thus processes taught by the discussion above may be performed with program code such as machine executable instructions that cause a machine that executes these instructions to perform certain functions. In this context a machine may be a machine that converts intermediate form or abstract instructions into processor specific instructions e.g. an abstract execution environment such as a virtual machine e.g. a Java Virtual Machine an interpreter a Common Language Runtime a high level language virtual machine etc. and or electronic circuitry disposed on a semiconductor chip e.g. logic circuitry implemented with transistors designed to execute instructions such as a general purpose processor and or a special purpose processor. Processes taught by the discussion above may also be performed by in the alternative to a machine or in combination with a machine electronic circuitry designed to perform the processes or a portion thereof without the execution of program code.

An article of manufacture may be used to store program code. An article of manufacture that stores program code may be embodied as but is not limited to one or more memories e.g. one or more flash memories random access memories static dynamic or other optical disks CD ROMs DVD ROMs EPROMs EEPROMs magnetic or optical cards or other type of machine readable media suitable for storing electronic instructions. Program code may also be downloaded from a remote computer e.g. a server to a requesting computer e.g. a client by way of data signals embodied in a propagation medium e.g. via a communication link e.g. a network connection .

The preceding detailed descriptions are presented in terms of algorithms and symbolic representations of operations on data bits within a computer memory. These algorithmic descriptions and representations are the tools used by those skilled in the data processing arts to most effectively convey the substance of their work to others skilled in the art. An algorithm is here and generally conceived to be a self consistent sequence of operations leading to a desired result. The operations are those requiring physical manipulations of physical quantities. Usually though not necessarily these quantities take the form of electrical or magnetic signals capable of being stored transferred combined compared and otherwise manipulated. It has proven convenient at times principally for reasons of common usage to refer to these signals as bits values elements symbols characters terms numbers or the like.

It should be kept in mind however that all of these and similar terms are to be associated with the appropriate physical quantities and are merely convenient labels applied to these quantities. Unless specifically stated otherwise as apparent from the above discussion it is appreciated that throughout the description discussions utilizing terms such as processing or computing or calculating or determining or displaying or the like refer to the action and processes of a computer system or similar electronic computing device that manipulates and transforms data represented as physical electronic quantities within the computer system s registers and memories into other data similarly represented as physical quantities within the computer system memories or registers or other such information storage transmission or display devices.
