The present invention generally relates to network based multimedia presentations and more particularly to a system and methods for automatic media population of a style presentation.

Multimedia is media and content that utilizes a combination of different content forms. The term is used in contrast to media that only utilizes traditional forms of printed or hand produced text and still graphics. In general multimedia includes a combination of text audio still images animation video and interactivity content forms. Multimedia is usually recorded and played displayed or accessed by information content processing devices such as computerized and electronic devices. Multimedia finds its application in various areas including but not limited to social marketing advertisement art education entertainment engineering medicine mathematics business scientific research and spatial temporal applications.

A variety of online websites are presently available to enable the creation and presentation including the publication of some form of multimedia. For example MixerCast enables a user to build a social marketing application from scratch. Scrapblog enables a user to combine photos videos audio and text to create multimedia scrapbooks. Smilebox facilitates creative messaging that draws elements from photo services scrapbooking and e cards.

Each website will typically provide one or more online tools for the creation and customization of the multimedia. Such online tools and or desktop tools such as Photoshop Illustrator etc. allow the user to collect edit create and publish or distribute the multimedia. In this regard various style presentations may be utilized photos may be resized and text may be added video may be inserted and or links to other sites or presentations may be provided. Despite providing some level of customization multimedia tools currently available are often cumbersome and difficult to use and thus limit the self expression and creativity of the non professional user when creating multimedia presentations. Accordingly there exists a need for a relatively more robust multimedia creation tool including a system and method for the automatic media population of a style presentation.

As further shown in the service provider server includes a service interface application which may be adapted to interact with the client device to facilitate the collection of media as well as the creation including editing and the publishing and or sharing of multimedia presentations over a network. In one example the service provider server may be provided and implemented by PayPal Inc. of San Jose Calif. USA.

The service application in one embodiment utilizes a collect module a create module and a publish module running on a standard web browser to collect information create presentations and publish presentations respectively. As described in greater detail herein the modules enable users such as the user to collect diverse types of audio and visual media create rich multi media presentations with real time editing and authoring using media software such as Flash and then share and or publish the rich multi media presentations with other users via the network . In one example the collect create and publish modules may be implemented within a standard web browser for interfacing with the user .

In one implementation the user is able to share multi media presentations with other users via the media channels and or embed multi media presentations directly in webpages of other users. For example the user may provide a unique URL link for the multi media presentation to other users. In another example the user may directly email multi media presentations to multiple recipients and include a message with the email. In still another example the user may provide the source HTML i.e. HyperText Markup Language code to other users and or embed the source HTML code directly into another user s webpage. Still other examples include the ability to publish multi media presentations on a website to sell a particular item or service for purchase. For items and or services a media rich presentation may help users market and sell items and or services which may be valuable for high end or high priced items and or services. Social and or dating sites may utilize these multi media presentations to provide online users with a way to better present themselves to other online users. In various implementations some type of webpage may be presented in a more dynamic manner by utilizing Rich Site Summary RSS feeds since for example a particular user s presentation may be continually changing with new media.

In various embodiments the service provider server may be configured to maintain store and or archive multi media presentations in a database each of which may include information related to one or more users such as the user and one or more multimedia channels such as multimedia distributions channels . In various examples the multimedia presentations may include attributes stored as part thereof and the attributes may be passed to the service provider server as part of a creating publishing and or sharing the multi media presentations.

Referring to in one embodiment the collect module enables the user to collect audio photographic images video and music media from various sources such as a PC KSS feeds websites and any other online source via a user interface such as the user interface application . In various implementations the user interface application comprises multiple tabs and or links for the various sources. Key words can be selected to search photos in Flicks or videos in YouTube. For example typing in flamingo and selecting Flickr results in pictures of flamingos or photos matching the word flamingo from Flickr being presented on the user s GUI or media page. The user can then drag and drop desired pictures onto a storyboard on that same screen. The pictures can be edited into stacks if desired. For videos a desired video can be placed onto the user s media page by typing in the corresponding URL in YouTube. The system can then display the complete as well as a series of shorter video clips. The whole video or selected shorter clips as well as the photos can then be dragged and dropped into a storybook section to create a presentation from the media collected.

Once collected the media may be saved and categorized in the database and edited on the system site via the service provider server . Editing may include one or more of sizing rotating overlying moving and stacking various media backward and forward with an overlay or stack. Video may be broken up automatically by the service provider server into smaller segments. Selected video segments may be combined and or used as desired. Selected media may be placed on a virtual storyboard such as a clipboard on the same screen as the collection of media. Media may be edited either in the collection or in the storyboard. Placing desired media on the storyboard or clip board may be accomplished by dragging and dropping. In one example the collect module provides selected media on a storyboard. In another example the collect module provides media on a user s media page i.e. not placed on the storyboard . In still another example uploading media may be delayed until editing is completed.

In one embodiment the create module enables the user to place selected media onto a storyboard. The service provider server may automatically suggest a story idea to launch the creative process or the user may select a specific style or presentation tool. Within the presentation there may be multiple styles such as a picture frame a television a billboard etc. In one implementation media from the storyboard may be dragged and dropped onto the presentation. In this regard media may be placed within the viewing window of each type of style.

Alternatively as shown in the user can create a presentation from the media in the storybook section by selecting a style such as a slide show a photo slider a room with different viewing areas including picture frames etc. The media is then automatically loaded into the selected style. For example a clustered set of photos may automatically play in frame and a video clip may automatically play on a television. In another example the branches of a tree are automatically filled with different selected media for viewing. Another style may be a page of postcards such that when that style is selected the previously chosen media is automatically filled into the postcards on a single page.

More specifically in one embodiment once media is collected a storyboard located on the right side of the user interface may be populated with the collected media by dragging and dropping one or more of the media items or cluster of media items collected from the various media sources from the media collection area onto the storyboard for later use in creating a media piece . In this regard the storyboard may includes two items collected from the web one item uploaded from a PC and a cluster of four items also collected from the web . Media positioned on the storyboard may be edited prior to creating a media piece. For example individual items of media in a media cluster may be reordered . Once media has been collected and edited media piece creation may proceed by clicking the create arrow at the bottom of the user interface and then choosing to proceed to the create module .

As indicated above to begin the process of creating a media piece the user may select a thumbnail from the presentation styles menu . Presentation styles may include but are not limited to a picture frame billboard kaleidoscope street scene landscape etc. Once a style is selected media from the storyboard will automatically flow into or populate the chosen style . In this regard the presentation media shown in has automatically populated corresponding presentation elements with the chosen presentation style. Some styles which support movement of media as part of a presentation style may provide the user with the ability to customize various characteristics of the movement such as speed of media rotation etc. within the style.

Once the style is chosen the user may also select different variations of the style. Each particular style typically has a different set of variations suited for that style. For example for the tree style a user may select different types of frames on the branches to contain the media a specific background may be selected from a user image and different style trees may be used. For the photo slider different types and styles of frames may be used as well as different types of presentations e.g. spacing between photos no spacing and background selection. For the page of postcards the user may select different configurations of the postcards on the page as well as different backgrounds for the page.

Once in the style presentation the media may be edited. For example the media may be rotated sized cut out e.g. by selecting the boundaries of an image such as with clicks to designate points along the boundary enabling as coarse or fine a resolution as desired moved forward or backward in relation to adjacent media slide multiple images to add or remove spaces within the presentation and adding a hotspot e.g. selecting an area of the image for additional information such as adding a link video text etc. . Other editing features may include adding audio to the background adding text and or distorting images. This further editing may depend on the style chosen as different styles may have different editing capabilities. In one aspect the editing may be achieved in real time so that the user may quickly and easily see the results and change them as needed.

Various tools or modules may be combined used and or modified to provide the user with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the multimedia presentation. For example as described blow the user may access a collage tool or application to create dynamic interactive panoramas with hot spots and layouts of photos video text and audio on an infinite stage. In one variation of collage the stage extends infinitely to the right and when viewed there is a natural progression from left to right that can map well to linear narrative time or space. In another variation the stage extends infinity downward. Again this presents a natural mapping to time space or narrative. The collage tool introduces a new creation platform for WYSIWYG online multimedia layout and sharing offering the ability to include direct links and presentations.

In one embodiment the publish module enables the user to share publish and or distribute the presentation when for example the presentation is completed. In one implementation as described herein the presentation may be saved in the database of the service provider server . Once saved the user may share publish and or distribute presentations to any selected channel such as one or more of the multi media channels . Any users on the network having access to the channels or website related to the channels may refresh the view which may automatically load the presentation into that channel and or website for viewing the content of the presentation. As such the presentations may be distributed to various online websites blogs mobile video players and IP TV networks and or on the system site.

The collect create and publish modules may be combined used and or modified to provide the user with different initial choices regarding the type of presentation and features desired for creating the multimedia presentation. The choices may be a simple easy to use tool to quickly build presentations with dynamic content from RSS feeds and online albums. Accordingly the user may select a presentation style and then link it to the user s media libraries through RSS feeds that maintain an always on permalink to the content source.
