title: Network-assisted remote access portal
abstract: A computing system contains a processor that is configured to receive, with the user interface, a registered access code and access permissions from a remote user of a property having a property location. The registered access code may be configured to provide access to the property. The access permissions may include a predefined access period that the access code is valid to provide access to the property. The processor may further be configured to receive a provided access code of a local user of the property in response to a user location of the local user being near the property location, match the provided access code with the registered access code, and grant or deny access to the property based in part on the provided access code matching the registered access code and being received within the predefined access period.

Keyless entry systems typically provide access to an area without requiring a physical key. However traditional keyless entry systems require a user to carry a keyless remote control dedicated to providing access to that area. With increased use of mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets there is a need for programs such as web based portals and mobile device applications to facilitate home and office security for example without requiring an additional keyless remote control. In particular these devices may utilize a subscriber network to provide remote entry and locking to a subscriber with respect to a property. It may be desirable to provide a system allowing a subscriber to register authenticate and provide scheduled or on demand access to an area for example personal or business property.

A system may be configured to utilize a computing system configured to use a subscriber network to provide a portal for providing scheduled or on demand access with respect to an entry point of a property. The system may further be configured to allow access to a local user e.g. with a computing device in accordance with access permissions including a user list of local users that are authorized to access the property which may be set by a remote user e.g. with a computing device such as an owner or a tenant of the property. The system may utilize an access code that may be managed by remote and administrator users. The system may define an access period e.g. date time length of time and number of uses for which the access code is valid to access the property after which the access code is invalidated by the system and denied access to the property. The system may automatically authenticate the access code without the additional keyless remote control in response to location information for example of the computing device of the local user arriving at the property. In addition the system may be used in conjunction with a third party security monitoring service for example by providing a notification to the monitoring service in response to unauthorized access to the property or denying access to the property if the monitoring service detects unauthorized access.

As illustrated in system may include a subscriber network a server a property connections a device a device a device e.g. devices and a database . The system e.g. devices may be configured to be utilized by one or more users for example a local user an admin user and a remote user . The server property and devices may include a computing system . The computing system may include a processor a memory a user interface and a transceiver . Memory may include a program configured to selectively provide access to the property . The property may include an access point a sensor an alarm and a lock . The database may include a local remote or cloud database. The memory and database may be configured to store and transfer e.g. using processor access information with respect to users property and devices 

The system may have any number of users with respect to a property . The property may include any personal or real estate property e.g. a home or office building . The users may include a local user e.g. using device a remote user e.g. using devices and an admin user e.g. using device . The local user may include any party that is near or intends on accessing the property . The local user may have scheduled and thus limited access that may be setup remotely e.g. by the device or remote user or unscheduled access that may be provided on demand at the property . Exemplary local users may include a repair service e.g. a repair person such as a plumber or an electrician a housekeeping service a pet sitter or walker an exterminator or any other party that may desire or require access to the property .

The remote user may include any party that owns rents or has authority to control access of other users e.g. with devices to the property . Exemplary remote users may include an owner a renter or a security officer. The remote user may interface with the server admin user and local user using a remote portal e.g. webpage smart phone application or application programming interface API short message service SMS e mail or voice or video call. In addition the remote user may communicate in person with the admin or local user .

The admin user may include any party that maintains the access information and access permissions of the users e.g. with device as described in more detail below. The admin user may also include any party authorized to act as a proxy for the remote user for example by authorizing access to the property in the event that the remote user is unavailable. Exemplary admin users may include a network administrator customer care personnel or a security company.

The system may include a network that provides the infrastructure through which the server property devices and database may communicate for example to distribute and authenticate access information e.g. including an access code to control access to property e.g. using access point . For instance the network may be an infrastructure that generally includes edge distribution and core devices e.g. server and enables a path e.g. connection for the exchange of access information between different devices and systems e.g. between server property devices and database . In general a network e.g. system or subscriber network may be a collection of computers and other hardware to provide infrastructure to establish connections and carry communications.

Further the system may utilize a network with any networking technology. System may utilize any wired or wireless network. The network may include a packet network or any other network having an infrastructure to carry communications. Exemplary networks may include one or more of a cellular network telephone network global area network wide area networks WAN a VoIP network an LTE network a VoLTE Voice over LTE network fiber optic network cable network television network local area networks e.g. Ethernet wireless local area networks e.g. radio frequency RF or Wi Fi power line networks private networks e.g. configured to provide network access limited to devices having network specific software or combinations thereof. The network may further include a direct connection such as a wired connection e.g. a data cable such as a universal serial bus USB or an independent secure connection e.g. using a private network with network specific access software connecting two or more devices. The system is provided as an example and thus while a single server is illustrated this illustration may represent a single network a combination of different networks components and technologies and or a plurality of networks as described herein.

Subscriber network may be configured to provide communications services to and between a plurality of devices e.g. any or all of the server property and devices . Subscriber network may also be configured to generate subscriber information including location information for example a current geographic position of any of property e.g. providing a property location and devices e.g. providing a user location . For example in response to the property location being near the user location the system may distribute the access code as described in further detail below. The subscriber network may provide communications services such as packet switched network services e.g. Internet access VoIP Voice over Internet Protocol communication services and location services e.g. device positioning to devices connected to the subscriber network . Exemplary subscriber network may include any network discussed above for example a VoIP network an LTE network a VoLTE Voice over LTE network a cellular network a telephone network a fiber optic network a cable network and a television network as some non limiting examples. The devices on the subscriber network may be associated with subscriber information including subscriber identifiers used to uniquely identify the corresponding devices such as mobile device numbers MDNs such as an number used or dialed to communicatively connect with a particular device e.g. devices mobile identification numbers MINs such as a mobile equipment identifier MEID for identification and tracking of particular devices and stored as part of the memory of each device e.g. devices mobile telephone numbers MTN common language location identifier CLLI codes Internet protocol IP addresses and universal resource identifiers URIs as some non limiting examples. The subscriber information may be received by server or the property e.g. from device to verify an identity of a device or a local user for example in response to the local user being near the property.

The server may include any computing system configured to communicatively connect the property devices and database . The server may be connected via connection to the property devices and database . Server may be in continuous or periodic communication with property and devices . Server may include a local remote or cloud based server or a combination thereof and may be in communication with and provide access information e.g. as part of memory or database to any of property and devices . The server may further provide a web based user interface e.g. an internet portal to be displayed by any of the user interface of property and devices . The server may communicate the access information with property and devices using an notification for example automated phone call short message service SMS or text message e mail http link web based portal or any other type of electronic communication. In addition the server may be configured to store access information as part of memory or database . The server may include a single or a plurality of centrally or geographically distributed servers .

The server may be configured to selectively provide access e.g. using a web based portal to the access point e.g. one or more openings or equipment of property such as a door a mailbox a lock box etc. of the property . This access may be provided without an additional keyless remote control because the system may provide controlled access to the property using the server and devices thereby optionally replacing the traditional keyless remote control. The server may be configured to allow the device or remote user to configure the access permissions for the local users having devices . For example the access preferences may be configured by the device or remote user to allow the device or admin user to provide access during predefined hours for example a security company may be allowed to provide access to the property anytime or only during specified hours such as 9 am 5 pm AM or PM only or during daytime or nighttime. The server may be remote from or local to the property . The server may manage and control a single property or a plurality of properties .

Server may be configured to store and coordinate access information with property devices and database . The access information may include subscriber information location information e.g. property and user locations an access code access preferences a component listing and an access log. The subscriber information may be used to provide an identity or location of a particular device or local user which may be provided from the device to the server in response to the location information of the device being near the location information of the property . For example the device may compare the location information of the device e.g. using a GPS and the location information of the property e.g. provided to the device by the device and in response to the device and the property being within a predefined distance defined as part of the access preferences send the location information of the device e.g. using transceiver to the server e.g. using the subscriber network . The access code may be configured to provide access to property using program as described in further detail below. The component listing may include model information and specifications regarding computing system sensor alarm and lock . The access log may include a listing of each instance in which access was provided or attempted with respect to property and in response to a predefined number of instances defined as part of the access preferences the server or property may be configured to disable access to the property and send a notification to the devices .

The access preferences may include a user list of users associated with devices and for each device or user a phone number a password a username a security level a class of service a user proximity and an access confirmation e.g. audio picture or video associated with each device or user . The user list may include one or more individual users groups e.g. companies or organizations of one or more users or categories e.g. personal or business of one or more users . The user list may specify individual names of individual users or group names of groups associated with a plurality of individual users as described in further detail below. The phone number password and username for each user may be defined by each user e.g. using a web based portal. The security level defines the types of access the user has to the property which may be defined by the remote user using the web based portal. For example an owner or parent may have a security level allowing registration of new access codes but a guest or child may have a security level allowing access but not registration of access codes. As a further example the security level may specify that on demand access to the property is allowed but not scheduling of access for other users . The class of service may include how many users or access codes may be stored or used. The user proximity may include a predefined distance e.g. specified by a user between the user location e.g. of device and the property location e.g. of property for which the access code may be transmitted from the server to the device or local user e.g. automatically in response to a device or user being at or within the user proximity or for which the alarm disarms and the lock unlocks e.g. automatically in response to a device or user being at or within the user proximity and the alarm arms and the lock locks e.g. automatically in response to a device or user being at or outside the user proximity as described in further detail below. The access confirmation may specify if audio image e.g. facial QR code video or barcode confirmation of the device or local user is to be confirmed by the device or remote user before the device or local user may access the property . The confirmation may be captured real time by a microphone camera or optical scanner as part of device or property and sent e.g. automatically to server and devices . For example the device may receive and display the confirmation along with a prompt to grant or deny access as part of the user interface and after receiving an indication in response to the prompt send the indication to the server and property .

The system e.g. server or property may include access preferences configured to control access with respect to a group including a plurality of members e.g. having devices . The system e.g. server or property may be configured to send a notification e.g. requesting service to a group from which a member of the group may be sent or dispatched to the property e.g. using device without specifying which member e.g. an individual name or subscriber identifier . Particular members of the group may have access conditions defined as part of the access preferences which may define different conditions for which particular members may be granted access to the property . For example particular members may have predefined access times e.g. a first member may enter between 7 pm and 8 pm a second member may enter between 7 pm and 9 pm and a third member may enter between 7 pm and 10 pm . Further the access may be granted by the property in response to receiving a password from the device of the member and when the location information of the device is in the predefined distance of the property as described above. Additionally the access preferences may define to which portions or equipment of the property the particular members may access e.g. all members may have access to the front door but only a particular member may have access to a lock box or mailbox or an interior door . The access preferences of particular member may overlap or may be in common with other members. Particular access preferences may be applied to an entire group or a plurality of members of the group or the access preferences may be the same for the group. A group or particular members may have a predefined number of accesses to the property after which access may be denied and a notification may be sent to the server and devices .

To promote data security the access information may be encrypted and unencrypted using secure key classes. For example a key may be included in a text field in a file record as part of the access information data or as part of memory or database . Using an encryption decryption algorithm the key may be encrypted e.g. by processor of server for transmission of the access information and decrypted e.g. by processor of property or device for the receipt of access information. Upon decryption of the access information the access code may be utilized to access to property . As the access information passes through system the access information may be decrypted and unencrypted with an algorithm using the secure key classes. An exemplary encryption decryption algorithm may include an RSA algorithm that may use a product of prime numbers along with an auxiliary value as a public RSA key to encrypt the access information e.g. at subscriber network or server and knowledge of the prime numbers as a private RSA key e.g. as part of database or memory of computing system of property or device to decrypt the access information. Upon decryption of the access information e.g. at property or device the received access code may be authenticated by comparing an access code of device with an access code of property as described in further detail below. In addition the private RSA keys may be periodically changed to change the working public RSA keys over time or as the access information passes through system .

The computing system may be configured to provide scheduled or on demand access to the property . The computing system may include any device e.g. property and devices configured to utilize program display program to a user or transfer access information and the location information of the device e.g. for enhanced security . Devices may also be configured to receive and display access information e.g. access code prompt an authorization response from the device or remote user and if authorized send the access information e.g. access code and the location information of the device to the property e.g. using connection . For example the server or device may compare the location information of the device e.g. determined using GPS with the location information of the property and display the access information in response to the location information of the device and property being in the predefined distance as described above. Alternatively the access information e.g. access code may be automatically sent from the server or devices to the device for example in response to the device being near the property . For example in response to the location information of the device and property being in the predefined distance the server may automatically send the access information to the device . The computing system of property may further communicate access information e.g. using connections to server devices and devices to register the access as part of the access information as part of memory e.g. of server or property or database .

The computing system may include a user interface . The user interface may include a display support user interfaces and or communicate within the system . A display is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form such as a user interface communicatively connected to a web based portal. Examples of a display may include without limitation cathode ray tube display light emitting diode display electroluminescent display electronic paper plasma display panel liquid crystal display high performance addressing display thin film transistor display organic light emitting diode display surface conduction electron emitter display laser TV carbon nanotubes quantum dot display interferometric modulator display and the like. Thus the display may present user interfaces or a remote portal to a user such that the user may interact with and receive information from other devices of system . For example the user interface of the property may include a touchpad or keyboard configured to manually receive an access code or an optical scanner configured to scan the access code e.g. a machine readable code from the device .

The computing system e.g. of property or server may also be configured to provide a notification to the devices e.g. local admin or remote user . The notification may include an automated phone call short message service SMS message e mail http link web based portal or any other type of electronic communication. The notification may be provided in response to the device or local user providing or entering an access code in response to unauthorized access to the property or in response to the location information of the device being near the property . The notification may include how many access attempts have been made and how many remain before the user interface prohibits additional access attempts. The notification may include the access information of the particular user .

The program may be configured to register a user with the server . The program may be configured to receive a user address e.g. owner or guest address billing information e.g. billing address of owner subscriber information e.g. user and device identification information and purchase options e.g. payment frequency and method for local and remote users . The program may also be configured to allow remote users to define passwords e.g. to access the web based portal access codes e.g. to access property and access permissions e.g. an access period such as a date time and duration and number of uses for which the access code is valid to provide access to property . The program may be configured to allow the remote user e.g. owner or an admin user to define access preferences for overriding an alarm or forcing access to the property without an access code e.g. including disarming the alarm and an unlocking the lock .

The access information may be authenticated for example to selectively provide access to an access point of the property . The access code may be generated by processor e.g. using a random number generator or may be specified and provided by the device or remote user to server . The server may send the access code to device or the device may transmit the access code e.g. encrypted to device for example in response to a notification that the device or local user is near the property or in response to a user input e.g. a notification requesting the access code from the device . The access code may be provided to a plurality e.g. group of devices or a particular device e.g. a member of the group and may be provided in advance of or in response to the device being near the property . Upon receipt of the access code the device may be configured to decrypt and display the access code to local user or transmit the access code e.g. using the transceiver of device to property e.g. using the transceiver of property . Alternatively the remote user may verbally provide the access code to local user which may be manually entered into a user interface of the computing system of the property . In this case the property may authenticate the manually entered access code with the server . The property may receive an access code referred to as received access code in response to the notification or send a request to receive an access code from server referred to as a registered access code . With the access codes of the server and local user or device the computing system of the server and property may authenticate or compare these access codes. If the access codes match access may be granted to access point for example without requiring an additional keyless remote. The access preferences may provide for access to the property with an identical or a partial match. The identical match may provide access in response to all characters of the received access code matching the registered access code. The limited match may provide access in response to a predefined number or percentage of the characters of the received access code matching the registered access code. The identical or limited match may be specified as part of the access preferences and according to the particular user or property . With matching access codes the property may facilitate access to the property via access point . The access code may be a temporary access code for example being valid for a predefined period of time.

The access code may be automatically disabled e.g. as defined by access permissions as part of server and a notification may be sent e.g. by property or server to devices for example in response to a power failure a predefined number of failed access attempts e.g. by the user or device providing an access code to the user interface of the property and processor of the server or property determining if the received access code matches the registered access code as described above or expiration of the predefined period of time. Based on and specified as part of the access permissions the user interface of the property may be configured to display an error code in response to receiving an access code that is for example invalid e.g. wrong access code disabled e.g. access intentionally denied by the remote or admin user or expired e.g. the predefined period of time has passed . The error code for each condition may be unique. In another embodiment the user interface of the device rather than the user interface of the property may be configured to display the error code having been sent the error code by the server or the property . Alternatively the access permissions may be configured not to indicate an error code e.g. as an additional security feature .

The program may be configured to utilize location information e.g. a current geographic position from transceiver for example to confirm a location of any of property and devices . For example in response to the location information of device indicating that device is at or near property program may be configured to send an access code e.g. from server to device or a notification to any or all of device and which may prompt devices or devices to provide an access code to device . Alternatively in response to the location information of device indicating that device is at or near property the device may send an access code e.g. as part of the memory of the device from the device e.g. sent using transceiver to the property e.g. received using transceiver . The location information e.g. the property location and device location may be determined by transceiver or may be stored as part of the access information. Thus based on location information program may be configured to directly provide an access code to device or a notification to any or all of devices and 

Transceiver may communicatively connect the devices of system for example using any type of wired or wireless network connection. The wireless network may utilize a wireless transmitter e.g. cellular radiofrequency RF or Wi Fi transmitter of transceiver .
