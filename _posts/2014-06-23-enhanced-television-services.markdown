title: Enhanced television services
abstract: A method and system to permit TV viewers to interact with program content broadcast over a subscriber network, such as cable, satellite, internet, or cellular telephone. The details of the ability for the viewer to interact is embedded as data in the program signal. The subscription provider broadcasts a visual indicator as a small icon during programming that informs the viewer that interaction is permitted. The viewer then uses a remote control to purchase products, vote on events, respond to polls, download files, request information, and request callback actions. The TV viewer uses the remote control to send information to a set-top box front-end application, and to iteratively create transactions that are batched and then sent to a back-end core application and database which then handles fulfillment.

No. 61 144 772 which along with the Parent Application and the First Continuation Application are incorporated by reference into this Present Application in their entirety.

Historically television technology developed so as to mirror radio technology. Television was broadcast via electromagnetic waves in analog mode. Television pictures were broadcast using amplitude modulation AM band and sound was broadcast using frequency modulation FM band . As with radio a television viewer had control over three elements 

During the early 1970 s infrared remote controls were introduced to control these same elements on television sets. Until that time television broadcasting was limited by relatively low bandwidth. The number of channels and controls were limited by bandwidth. Establishment of new television stations were limited by the Federal Communications Commission FCC . The problem was somewhat alleviated by introduction of ultra high frequency UHF broadcast capability. However UHF channels never achieved much popularity. Cable television service provided television transmission with increased bandwidth. Suddenly television viewers were able to access a large multitude of channels. Some television stations broadcasted their programming exclusively for cable while others simulcast their programs both over the airwaves electromagnetic and over cable. Other than the increased number of channels the main discernible difference between cable TV and broadcast TV was that viewers had to pay for cable service while broadcast TV remained essentially free. Cable providers provided their users with a cable box to enable tuning control. Cable ready television sets were developed to enable users to plug the cable directly into their sets.

Without a list of what programs were playing on what channels at a given time viewers would have to channel surf until they found programs that they wanted to watch. Cable service providers began to transmit a program guide that was accessed from the remote control. Previously viewers used newspaper listings and magazine type guides to help with their programming selection. Now a viewer could use the remote control to select and switch to a channel based upon a desired program. So the number of control elements were increased.

Next the cable service providers introduced Pay Per View programming. Here not only could a viewer select a special program for viewing at a specific time but they could also approve e.g. by pressing the OK button or not approve e.g. by pressing the EXIT button the charges associated with viewing the selected program. With the introduction of digital as opposed to analog transmission to cable broadcasting parents could block channels or specific programs that they did not want their children to watch. On Demand programming provided viewers with new options that would enable them to watch special programs whenever they wanted. Finally DVR afforded viewers with the ability to record programs to time shift viewing to pause live TV and to rewind and move forward through recorded programs and live TV.

All of these new features required the introduction of television remote control units having many more controls than the traditional on off volume and channel controls. Not only are remote controls themselves more sophisticated but many new television sets may only be controlled using remote controls. These new sets no longer have external controls. Even the brightness contrast color and hue settings are now controlled remotely. Viewers can use their remote controls to control television settings separately form cable settings. They can also use their remote controls to control peripheral devices such as VCR s DVD s CD players etc. With the availability of high speed internet service over cable television lines keyboards are often connected to television sets for access to the internet. In some hotels television viewers can pay their lodging bill by using the remote control. Into the television provider mix also came local telephone companies and satellite broadcasters. These providers advertise even greater increases in bandwidth and possibly more services. So control over television viewing has become quite sophisticated.

Nevertheless television viewing essentially remains as a passive activity. Viewers still only turn their sets on or off control the volume and select what they want to watch either now or in the future. Cable providers are able to determine what programs are being watched by their viewers. But viewers cannot actively communicate with cable providers or broadcasters while watching television.

Interactive television is very attractive to cable service providers. Cable companies are in the process of adopting the Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format EBIF and the Open Cable Application Platform OCAP . EBIF is a multimedia content format defined by a specification developed under the OpenCable project of CableLabs Cable Television Laboratories Inc. . The primary purpose of EBIF is to present to a television viewer one or more multimedia pages similar to web pages but specialized for use within an enhanced television or an interactive television system. Action sequences are executed as a result of firing certain predefined events such as a page load event a key press event a click event etc. These events are triggered by the viewer using the remote control. Execution of all events are serialized and controlled by event handlers. On the other hand OCAP is an operating system layer designed for consumer electronics that connects to a television system. Unlike operating systems on a personal computer the cable company controls what OCAP programs run on the consumer s set. Also designed by CableLabs for the cable networks of North America OCAP programs are intended for interactive services such as eCommerce online banking Electronic program guides and digital video recording. The OCAP standard has not yet been approved by the FCC.

A Multiple System Operator MSO is an operator of multiple cable television systems. A cable system in the US by FCC definition is a facility serving a single community or a distinct governmental entity each with its own franchise agreement with the cable company. Though in the strictest sense any cable company that serves multiple communities is thus an MSO the term today is usually reserved for companies that own a very large number of cable systems.

A number of systems currently exist to purchase items associated with content broadcast over television. An intuitive mechanism for accomplishing such a task would be to have a website associated with a television program. The TV viewer would have a computer alongside the television set. The TV viewer accesses the broadcast content and the website concurrently. Interaction with the broadcast content occurs over the internet on the computer. One such implementation is employed by http www.shopnbc.com. This corresponds to an NBC network cable channel shopNBC. This channel is a home shopping channel where viewers can purchase products that they see on television. However instead of calling a telephone number to make their purchases viewers purchase the products over the World Wide Web. A web application exists on the website that allows viewers to watch the programming streaming on their computers thereby eliminating the necessity of having a separate television set alongside the computer. This application exists for the shopNBC channel only and viewers cannot switch to watching other channels.

US Patent Application Publication No. 2006 0031285 to Ruhnke et. al. teaches an audio and video On Demand type application along with the business functions required therefore. On Demand programming is not truly interactive. While a TV viewer may use a remote control to access the content that does not happen interactively with broadcast content. On the other hand US Patent Application Publication No. 2009 10018898 to Genen teaches a method of interactively accessing music and other media associated with broadcast content using a remote control. However there is no back end application associated with this application to provide for fulfillment. The website http ensequence.com provides synchronized interactivity using a remote control. This application permits a TV viewer to purchase products vote receive targeted offers access sports specifications. It also permits children and teenagers to participate in the activities programmed into the broadcast content. However this application also lacks a back end to provide for fulfillment.

The Present Invention provides a way to cater to an untapped market through an innovative suite of products and services bundled as Enhanced Television Service ETS . ETS functions both on an EBIF and OCAP platform. The Present Invention delivers a host of interactive functions specifically tailored to the broadcast program or commercials. The enhanced and empowered media is then transmitted to the MSO in any one of the many available formats for eventual transmission to the viewer. Invisible and unobtrusive until invoked by the viewer s existing remote control the enhanced media suddenly reveals a wealth of onscreen information and choices. With no additional equipment installation or modification the standard cable television remote control transforms the once passive viewer into a participant ordering information downloads voting responding and making instant purchases. The ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment. By delivering a host of interactive functions cable television operators empowered with the ETS solution can increase their competitive position while maximizing their networks financial potential. Through an intuitive portal application advertisers are able to create and manage their own enhanced television events. They control the look feel and exact moment the trigger is available to the viewer. Advertisers Vendors can also upload products for sale or download and associate them with events described above. The portal also provides statistical data on the performance of events in a dashboard like manner. Also through an intuitive web portal subscribers can look at order history wish lists download items and purchase promotional products. This web portal resides in the MSO s web portal. Again ETS handles all of these transactions from order processing to billing and fulfillment.

A TV viewer will hereinafter be referred to interchangeably as a subscriber or a viewer. Subscribers can interact with the broadcast program or commercial with the remote control. They can participate in the following transactions using the ETS system 

By using the remote control a subscriber can view the products on the panel of the TV and they are able to purchase that product.

By using the remote control a subscriber can request any particular information. They can also request an information download of specific software.

By using the remote control a subscriber can view their past transaction history on the TV panel. These transactions can be a type of confirmed unconfirmed and wish list items.

Subscriber is able to interact with the TV using the special remote control to request downloads purchase products and vote.

Typically when viewer interaction is possible an icon called an iBug will appear on the screen usually in the lower right hand corner . At that point the viewer will be able to press a button on the remote control that would bring up a menu that is specific to the currently viewed channel. By contrast the GUIDE button brings up a universal guide no matter what channel is being viewed.

The Present Invention allows a TV viewer to use a television remote control to interact with programming content broadcast by a subscription service provider such as cable television service satellite service provided through a receiving antenna cellular telephone service and internet. The TV viewer can purchase a product vote on an event e.g. for a contestant on American Idol request information or download photographs audio recordings ring tones software games and software applications all using the buttons on the remote control.

The Present Invention allows a TV viewer to interact with the broadcast content using a remote control by associating event identification information with the content. The event identification information in the form of data is embedded in the content signals. The event identification data associates the content with an ability for the TV viewer to perform interactive tasks associated with the event by using the remote control. The viewer can purchase a DVD of a documentary while it is being broadcast. The viewer can purchase a product associated with the programming. There is no longer a need to dial a toll free number and to provide a credit card to make the purchase. The credit card information for a particular viewer is already on file with the service provider. When a viewer votes during particular programs some voting is free of charge and some voting incurs a charge. For example voting on American Idol is currently performed by sending a text message on a cellular telephone. The user is charged for the text message. American Idol and the telephone service provider share the revenues from text message charges.

After the event identification data becomes associated with the content at certain periods during the broadcast a display indicator becomes visible on the screen. For example the Discovery Channel might have a small circle with the letter D circumscribed therein. The display indicator is a signal that the viewer is able to interact with the programming. When the viewer sees the display indicator and only when the viewer sees it can be perform the interactive tasks. The viewer interacts with the broadcast content by pressing buttons on the remote control. The keystrokes are then transmitted to the set top box. In a two way conversation between the set top box and the service provider the keystroke information is sent to the service provider which starts a transaction the service provider transmits a response back to the set top box and the response is displayed to the viewer in an intelligent fashion. A series of two way communications between the viewer and the service provider collects data to iteratively form a transaction by concatenating all the data together.

Every MSO will have multiple ETS Edge systems that are geographically located on its head ends. In addition to multiple ETS Edges every MSO will have one ETS Core system that is centrally located within that MSO. The data from multiple ETS Core systems will go to the Data Warehouse on regular basis for persistent storage and reporting purposes.

Third party vendors and shippers e.g. Amazon and payment processors e.g. PayPal communicate directly with the ETS Core through an MSO network as do administrators Admin and customer service representatives CSR . Each MSO network has a plurality of ETS Edge interfaces which provided geographically local viewer polling purchasing downloading and event presentation.

Whenever the subscriber interacts with the TV he or she interacts using the Set top Box STB that is associated with that TV. The customized application Xlet that is sitting on the STB will listen to these user interactions. The Xlet application will send the relevant requested data to the ETS Edge system and the ETS Edge will respond back to the Xlet. This transaction data will eventually go from ETS Edge to ETS Core system in real time or near real time basis. The ETS Core system will process the actual transaction. In the same way when an event is created in the ETS Core system that event data will be distributed to the relevant ETS Edges. When an ETS Edge receives a request from the TV subscriber the relevant event data will be sent back to the Xlet in the form of the response.

Though the TV subscriber gets the response from the ETS Edge the actual order processing will be done by the ETS Core system. The transaction data goes from ETS Edge to the ETS Core in real time Ex live polling or near real time download request info basis as per the configuration settings. The back and forth data transmission between ETS Edge and ETS Core is being taken care of by Oracle TimesTen caching mechanism. The TimesTen gives high performance and scalability at an exceptional level.

If the user is a child and they try to purchase something beyond allowed transaction limit then the product will be added to their parent s WISH LIST

MAC ID will not be verified as part of authentication however it will be checked as whether it is in blackout list or not.

The system needs to provide a feature where the subscriber should be able to download information that is interesting to them.

The system should provide a feature where the subscriber should be able to vote for a specific event.

When the user interacts with the STB using the remote control the STB Application will identify the current event that is associated with the current TV show the user is watching. Then the STB Application will send a request to the Edge server to get the current event data. Edge Server will send the event data back to the STB Application so that the User can view the current event information on the TV panel.

Business Application Engine comprises the logic to process the User requests and automate transaction processing. It inserts the order into the core system and applies business logic into it. It contacts the payment gateway to charge the user for the amount of the product if it is a product sale . All successful transactions will be forwarded to an internal or third party fulfillment center. The confirmation of the transaction will be sent from the third party billing and fulfillment systems. Product sale download request and voting are all handled as a part of this subsystem.

A standard application programming interface that provides third party developers the ability to utilize CORE services for order processing billing and fulfillment. This is a programmatic API interface not a presentation layer interface so the system is capable of providing hooks into our system to process order generated by third parties.

A standard and secure interface for vendor and partners to view their event performance and information in near real time dashboard and be capable of generating ad hoc reports views on the same data. Report generating metrics should be based on Event ID Product ID Geography or DMA Event Type IR Polling Purchase Digital Event Coverage National Regional Local of Transactions Completed of Transactions Canceled of Transactions Added to WISH LIST of Transactions Volume Transaction Price Dollar Amount Fee Ad Sponsored etc. Transactions Frequency per minute hour day week month year quarter etc. Transactions Payment Type Visa Amex Discover etc. Transactions Denied e.g. problem with payment account blocked etc. Transaction Shipping Type Overnight Standard Email Cellular etc. By Vendor Events Transactions Fulfillment Site etc. By MSO Events Transactions etc. Main or summary reporting should include of Transactions Transaction Totals by MSO Region etc

Product identification of images group party pricing multiple item discount product Good Digital Good Service category features description inventory storage supplier fulfillment methods fulfillment logic tiers One to many e.g. warehouse A then B then C geography or DMA availability period status SKU ISBN Catalog ID UPC code DMA or Region Deployment Requirements etc.

Based on the event type and or geographic location of MULTIPLE or SINGLE transactions the CORE system needs to be capable of intelligently acting on those INCOMING requests and be capable of acting on them in a number of ways.

Ability to manage WISH LIST items view initiate order checkout remove from the Portals Admin Subscriber and CSR .

Proactive alert system tied to each process service e.g. Nagios for application monitoring Management agents for hardware monitoring Remote BIOS system level access to hardware.

Ability to provide a management and administrative interface to the CORE system Hardware System Software from both internal within local to the CORE network and external outside remote to the CORE network access methods.

Subscriber is a TV subscriber who registers their profile in ETS system. A standard plug able into existing MSO subscriber portals and secure interface for MSO subscribers to manage their subscriber accounts opt in out of service manage single or multiple profiles per household passwords security settings payment methods shipping preferences loyalty accounts general interests for more targeted offers via portal etc. 

A standard and secure interface for vendor and partners to view their event performance and information in near real time dashboard and be capable of generating ad hoc reports to screen email or document format e.g. PDF ODS CSV Tab delimited etc. Report generating metrics should be based on Event ID Product ID Geography or DMA Event Type IR Polling Purchase Digital Event Coverage National Regional Local of Transactions Completed of

Transactions Canceled of Transactions Added to WISHLIST of Transactions Volume Transaction Price Dollar Amount Fee Ad Sponsored etc. Transactions Frequency per minute hour day week month year quarter etc. Transactions Payment Type Visa Amex Discover etc. Transactions Denied e.g. problem with payment account blocked etc. Transaction Shipping Type Overnight Standard Email Cellular etc. By Vendor Events Transactions Fulfillment Site etc. By MSO Events Transactions etc. Main or summary reporting should include of Transactions Transaction Totals by MSO Region etc.

A standard plug able into existing MSO administration portals secure interface for Customer Service Representatives CSR s Managers Administrators to have access to an event order subscriber product inventory maintenance monitoring reporting and security management ALL based on their job responsibilities and roles to limit system access.

Allow CSR the ability to manage Subscriber orders e.g. place orders on hold or cancel change order payment method should a preferred payment method be denied change shipping preferences method address. If an order has not been sent out for fulfillment and other ecommerce site CSR services etc. placed via the set top box application or e commerce shopping cart interface.

Manageability of the CORE system Hardware System Software from both internal within local to the CORE network and external outside remote to the CORE network access methods.

Secure storage of sensitive information user ID passwords credit cards address etc. within EACH of the CORE system s .

Ability to secure ALL data exchange receive and transmit to the EDGE from the CORE with little effect on performance. VPN should be the standard unless secure transactions can be realized via other methods secure database transactions etc. 

Ability to secure ALL data exchange receive and transmit to external third party entities PayPal Payflow Amazon etc. 

Ability to audit the transactions and comply with future financial regulations like Sarbanes Oxley audit capabilities on all record changes report on every user who has access to any system and how they obtained that access etc. .

The first chart in each series is a hierarchy chart. This chart appearing like a corporate organization chart displays the calling relationship between the various system modules. Each module appears as a block in the diagram. Lines connect these modules to show their hierarchy. Hierarchy is further shown by assigning numeric labels to the modules. Normally the highest order module would be labeled 1.0. Modules immediately below it hierarchically would be labeled 2.0 3.0 4.0 . . . and so on. Modules hierarchically below 2.0 for example would be labeled 2.1 2.2 2.3 . . . and so on. Modules hierarchically below 2.1 for example would be labeled 2.1.1 2.1.2 2.1.3 . . . and so on. So by looking at the numeric label of any module one can determine its level of hierarchy. A black triangle located at the corner of the module block indicates that the module is re used many times either as a subroutine or as an object.

Following the hierarchy chart each module depicted on that chart receives an IPO chart. The IPO chart is divided into three columns. The leftmost column represents INPUT. The rightmost column represents OUTPUT. The central column represents PROCESS. This is where the various steps in the process are described. Most of the information in the INPUT and OUTPUT columns is graphical e.g. representing terminals hard drives printers etc. . Most of the information in the PROCESS columns is descriptive text showing the procedural steps. Arrows connect the PROCESS column to the INPUT and OUTPUT columns to show data flow.

Each IPO chart may have an Extended Description showing notes about the various steps in the process. These act almost like footnotes in a document. They are usually too detailed or extraneous to include in the steps denoted in the PROCESS column.

Following the hierarchy chart are IPO charts for each of the seven modules and following each IPO chart is an Extended Description for each module and a standard high level program flow chart for each module. The charts are self explanatory. They are grouped as follows
