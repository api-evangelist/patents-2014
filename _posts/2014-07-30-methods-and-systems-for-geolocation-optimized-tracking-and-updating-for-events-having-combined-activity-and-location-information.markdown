The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for capturing activity data over a period of time associating the captured activity data into identification of locations of a user performing activities and saving battery life while capturing the activity data.

In recent years the need for health and fitness has grown tremendously. The growth has occurred due to a better understanding of the benefits of good fitness to overall health and wellness. Unfortunately although today s modern culture has brought about many new technologies such as the Internet connected devices and computers people have become less active. Additionally many office jobs require people to sit in front of computer screens for long periods of time which further reduces a person s activity levels. Furthermore much to today s entertainment options involve viewing multimedia content computer social networking and other types of computer involved interfacing. Although such computer activity can be very productive as well as entertaining such activity tends to reduce a person s overall physical activity.

To provide users concerned with health and fitness a way of measuring or accounting for their activity or lack thereof fitness tracker are often used. Fitness trackers are used to measure activity such as walking motion running sleeping being inactive bicycling exercising on an elliptical trainer and the like. Usually the data collected by such fitness trackers can be transferred and viewed on a computing device. However such data is often provided as a basic accumulation of activity data.

Also the fitness tracker or a cell phone device consumes a high amount of power while measuring the activity. The cell phone or the fitness tracker may die while being used by a user. Also due to the high amount of consumption of power the fitness tracker or the cell phone may be to be recharged frequently.

Embodiments described in the present disclosure provide systems apparatus computer readable media and methods for segmenting a period of time into identification of locations of a user performing activities. This segmentation provides a way of identifying particular activities to particular locations. Using the segmentations the systems and methods can identify one or more events that may have occurred during the period of time of activity. In one embodiment the events can be displayed on a screen of a device and a user is able to interactively view data concerning the events with contextual information e.g. where certain events occurred.

In one embodiment as described below the events are automatically associated with locations and the locations can be associated with contextual information concerning the locations. For instance if a tracking device detects certain activity at a particular location e.g. a map location the mapping data or related databases can be queried to determine that the map location corresponds to a golf course. The system can then generate information that is graphically presented to the user concerning the particular tracked activity as corresponding to golfing. In some embodiments the locations can be identified over time e.g. by received user feedback e.g. this is my home this is a coffee shop this is my work .

In some embodiments the locations can be inferred or learned based on the activities and times of day and or repeat activities over a period of time e.g. based on an identifiable pattern . For example if the user tracker is typically experiencing low activity from 9 00 am and 11 55 am Monday Friday it can be inferred using a rules database and learning logic that the user is at work or is working. In another embodiment the user can be asked are you at work via a computing device or a tracking device and based on the user s response database can associate particular locations e.g. geo location to particular actual location e.g. work and collect the activity data for presentation along with the most appropriate location.

In some embodiments an activity that is performed by a user is inferred based on geo locations of a monitoring device or a computing device used by the user. For example a processor of the monitoring device of the computing device of a server or of a virtual machine determines based on the geo locations that a user is at a location e.g. a gym home work etc. The processor retrieves from an activity location database one or more activities that may be performed by the user at the location. For example the activity location database indicates that the user may be performing one or more activities e.g. using a treadmill using an elliptical trainer lifting weights to build resistance swimming laps etc. while at a gym. As another example the activity location database indicates that the user may be performing one or more activities e.g. walking climbing stairs descending stairs sleeping etc. while at home. The processor retrieves one or more of the activities from the activity location database that correspond to the location and determines that the user is performing one or more of the activities.

Broadly speaking the systems and methods facilitate determination of an activity level of an activity performed by a user at a location. For example the systems and methods can determine that the user is sedentary for a particular period of time when the user is at work. As another example the systems and methods can determine that the user is active when the user is at home. The activity or lack of activity is therefore contextually associated to a particular location. The systems and methods determine activity levels of one or more activities performed by the user during a period of time. The user can view the activity levels of an activity performed at a location and decide whether to perform a different activity at the location to perform an activity at another location or to continue performing the activity when at the location. By providing the user location context to activities the user is able to better view his or her actual activity performance and better health decisions can be made regarding and or adjustments can be made in lifestyle. For instance a user may find that walking to the train station can significantly improve his her health over taking a bus to the train. These simple decisions in activity can act to significantly increase a person s activity but providing context as to what and where activity is taking place can provide better understanding as to how simple changes can have large impacts in overall fitness.

Geo location data is obtained to provide whereabouts of the user while performing an activity. For example a transceiver of a mobile device that is carried by the user or a monitoring device that is worn by the user determines a geo location of the user who is walking or running. When the geo location data is obtained more frequently a battery of the mobile device or the monitoring device is consumed more frequently than when the geo location data is obtained less frequently. It is important to manage battery consumption by a device when the geo location data is obtained to reduce changes of battery drainage while the user is performing an activity at a location.

In some embodiments a method includes obtaining a first geo location and a second geo location. The first and second geo locations are associated with a monitoring device. The monitoring device is configured to be used by a user. The first geo location is determined at a first time and the second geo location is determined at a second time. The first time and the second time are associated with a rate of obtaining geo location data. The method includes calculating a difference in distance between the second and first geo locations and changing the rate of obtaining a third geo location associated with the monitoring device based on the difference in distance between the second and first geo locations.

In several embodiments a method includes obtaining an identity of a network associated with a first geo location and a second geo location. The first and second geo locations are associated with a monitoring device which is configured to be used by a user. The first geo location is obtained at a first time and the second geo location obtained at a second time. The first and second times are associated with a rate of obtaining geo location data. The method includes determining whether the identity of the network associated with the second geo location is the same as the identity of the network associated with the first geo location and changing the rate of obtaining geo location data upon determining that the identity of the network associated with the second geo location is different from the identity of the network associated with the first geo location.

In various embodiments a method includes receiving a first position and a second position. The first and second positions are associated with a device which is configured to be associated with a user. The first and second positions are associated with a rate of obtaining geo location data. The method includes calculating a difference between the second and first positions and sending data to change the rate of obtaining geo location data based on the difference between the second and first positions. The data is sent to the device. The method is executed by a processor.

In some embodiments a method includes characterizing a first activity monitored by a monitoring device which is configured to be used by a user. The first activity is associated with a first time at which a first geo location is obtained. The method includes characterizing a second activity monitored by the monitoring device. The second activity is associated with a second time at which a second geo location is obtained. The first time and the second time are associated with a rate of obtaining geo location data. The method includes determining whether the second activity is the same as the first activity and changing the rate of obtaining geo location data based on whether the second activity is different from the first activity.

Other aspects will become apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings illustrating by way of example the principles of embodiments described in the present disclosure.

Embodiments described in the present disclosure provide systems apparatus computer readable media and methods for analyzing tracked activity data and segmenting associating the activity data to contextually identifiable locations where a user wearing an activity tracker performed such activities. This segmentation provides a way of identifying events that associate the identified activities to particular locations. In one embodiment the data is collected from an activity tracker and then transferred to a computing device. In some embodiments the computing device can include a portable device such as a smart phone an internet connected watch a tablet a laptop a desktop etc. The computing device can then transfer the collected activity data to a server that is connected to the internet for processing.

In one embodiment the term location refers to a geographic position. The geographic position can be identified on a map identified on a coordinate identifier using global positioning data e.g. GPS identified using radio signal tower locator data e.g. cell towers identified using wireless internet router signal data e.g. Wi Fi signals identified using router signal data for multi floor identification e.g. floor to floor locator data or combinations thereof. In some embodiments changes in location data include determining a difference between location identified data at various times e.g. every minute every few minutes every half hour every hour at particular hour intervals or days . In some embodiments the time at which location data is obtained can vary depending on sensed activity. For example if less activity or motion is detected fewer location data points need be taken.

The server can include one or more servers which define a cloud processing system. The cloud processing system includes logic code programs and or software for processing the activity data to produce the identifiable events. The cloud processing system can provide a system for creating user accounts for users and their activity trackers. The user accounts enable users to view graphical users interfaces GUIs that render and display the events identified using the tracked activity data and the location data e.g. geo location data . Processing logic on the servers associated with the cloud processing system can process the tracked data can access other Internet services e.g. mapping services social networking services location context services etc. to enable formulation or identification of a location for particular activities which define an event . Broadly speaking an event is defined to include a location and an activity.

In one embodiment the events can be displayed on a screen of a device and a user is able to interactively view data concerning the events with contextual information e.g. where certain events occurred.

In some embodiments locations can be automatically identified by accessing mapping services and other online databases that identify locations. The online databases can include mapping programs data from social networks tagged data crowd sourced data etc.

In some embodiments the locations can be inferred or learned based on the activities and times of day and or repeat activities over a period of time e.g. based on an identifiable pattern . Databases of rules are constructed and such rules are refined over time. The rules are used to enable the system to infer locations and provide appropriate contextual identification to the locations. In some embodiments the rules can shape themselves using learning systems and can be tailored for specific users. In still other embodiments learned patterns and behaviors of other users can be used to collaboratively identify rules shape rules or determine locations or identify locations. For instance if multiple users tag a location as a coffee bar this information can be used to associate coffee bar to some range of geo location. If over time the location starts to get tagged as a breakfast bar the rules can be adjusted to now associate that geo location as breakfast bar. As businesses or location contexts change over time so can the rules.

In various embodiments the shape rules are used to associate one or more geo locations with a location. For example a shape e.g. a circle a polygon an oval a square etc. is used to identify a location on a graphical user interface. The graphical user interface may include event data a route a map or a combination thereof. A user changes a size via a user interface of a monitoring device or via an input device of a computing device of a shape to change a number of geo locations associated with the location. For example a user increases a size of a circle to include more geo locations within a location that is identified by the circle. As another example a user decreases a size of a polygon to exclude a number of geo locations from within a location that is identified by the polygon. As another example a center of a shape is changed to associate a different set of geo locations with a location than that already associated with the location. For example a user drags via a user interface of a monitoring device or via an input device of a computing device a point associated with e.g. a center of a vertex of etc. a shape to a different spot on a graphical user interface. When the point is dragged the shape is also dragged to the difference spot and is associated with a difference set of geo locations than that before the movement of the center. The graphical user interface may include event data a route a map or a combination thereof.

In another embodiment the user may be allowed to post details of particular locations. The user can identify locations with particular custom identifiers e.g. mom s house or can select from predefined identifiers. In still other embodiments the user can be asked to identify a location. In still another embodiment the user can be asked via custom queries such as Are you at work Is this your home Are you driving Do you need medical assistance if so say or type help etc. Or the queries can be presented to the user at a later time such as when the user is viewing his or her past activity on a GUI. In some embodiments the queries can be provided via a cloud program when accessing a computer with cloud access via push notifications via voice requests etc. Based on this returned feedback the servers and databases of the cloud service can learn or associate location identification to particular locations which are later identified by detecting the geo location of the tracker.

In some embodiments a user tags a location as being associated with a person known to the user. For example a user logs into his her user account and tags a location as being Mom s house Eric s house Jessica s house Buddy s gym etc. Examples of a person known to the user include a friend of the user a work mate of the user a special interest of the user a relative of the user an acquaintance of the user or a family member of the user. The user tags via an input device of a computing device or via a user interface of a monitoring device. A processor e.g. a processor of the monitoring device a processor of the computing device a processor of a server a processor of a virtual machine or a combination thereof etc. determines that the tag indicates that the user knows the person. For example the term Mom indicates that the person is a mom of the user. As another example Eric indicates that the person is a friend a relative or an acquaintance of the user. The processor determines whether the person tagged has a user account. The user account is used to display event data that includes activities performed by the person and or locations visited by the person while performing the activities etc. The processor suggests to the user to add the person to a social group e.g. a friend group a work mate group a special interest group a relative group an acquaintance group a family member group etc. When the user adds the person within the social group the user account of the user indicates the addition of the person within the social group.

In general the systems and methods facilitate determination of an activity level of an activity performed by a user at a location. For example the systems and methods can determine that the user is sedentary for a particular period of time when the user is at work. As another example the systems and methods can determine that the user is active when the user is at home. The activity or lack of activity is therefore contextually associated to a particular location. The location can be an address map or a combination of maps addresses activities and or predefined location identifiers or activities that occur at particular locations e.g. golf occurs at a golf course swimming occurs at a swimming pool etc. . By providing the user location context to activities the user is able to better view his or her actual activity performance and better health decisions can be made regarding and or adjustments can be made in lifestyle.

To determine a location of a monitoring device or of a computing device one or more geo locations are received by the monitoring device or by the computing device. The process of executing instructions to request and obtain geo location data is a processing intensive operation. In general the more processing required to execute or complete an operation the more that is required in power. As such reception of the geo location data if done without limit may cause excessive drain on the battery of a monitoring device or a computing device. In one embodiment management of the rate at which geo locations are obtained are controlled to optimize battery usage battery life of a device.

In various embodiments systems and methods for increasing or reducing demands on a battery while providing comprehensive location data of monitoring devices are described. In one embodiment the methods include determining a difference between geo locations of a monitoring device or of a computing device. Upon determining that the difference is greater than a pre determined distance difference a rate at which a geo location is updated within the monitoring device or the computing device is increased. On the other hand upon determining that the difference is less than or equal to the pre determined distance difference a rate at which a geo location is updated within the monitoring device or the computing device is kept the same or reduced.

In various embodiments any combination of a difference in times at which the geo locations are obtained a difference in distance between the geo locations a difference in position of a monitoring device or a computing device a change in an activity performed by the user or a change in a location of a monitoring device or a computing device or a combination thereof is used to determine whether to change a rate of obtaining geo location data.

In some instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure various embodiments described in the present disclosure.

In the example of a user A wears a monitoring device A on his arm while playing a sport e.g. tennis. Other examples of a sport include badminton golf running bicycling vehicle racing racquetball squash soccer etc. It should be understood that the example of sports is provided as such sports have particular identifiable activity patterns. However any activity whether sports related or not can be tracked and associated to an event. For instance another user B wears a monitoring device B on her arm while walking. Yet another user C wears a monitoring device C on his her arm while doing yoga. Another user D wears a monitoring device D on his her arm during sleep. Another user E wears a monitoring device E on his her arm while playing golf. Yet another user F wears a monitoring device F on his her clothing part while riding a bicycle. Another user G wears a monitoring device G on his her foot while walking a user H e.g. a dog. In some embodiments the user G walks other animals e.g. a tiger a cat etc. The user H also wears a monitoring device H on its arm. Another user wears a monitoring device I on his arm during running.

In some embodiments a user performs one or more of other activities e.g. swimming resistance training rock climbing skiing snowboarding hiking skating rollerblading etc. It is noted that the activities described herein are not limiting and that other activities may be used.

It should be noted that in some embodiments a user can wear hold append strap on move transport or carry a monitoring device while performing any type of activity e.g. playing ping pong climbing stairs descending stairs hiking sitting resting working etc. Additionally one user can be associated with more than one monitoring device and such data can be processed and associated to the user s activity. In some embodiments the data is selected from various devices of the user based on a priority algorithm. In some embodiments data from more than one device can be blended or alternated together to define a more complete map of the activities.

Each monitoring device A B C D E F G H and I communicates with a network . In some embodiments each monitoring device A B C D E F G H and I communicates with the network via a computing device e.g. a desktop computer a laptop computer a smart phone a tablet a smart watch a smart television etc.

Examples of the network include the Internet an Intranet a satellite network a cell phone network or a combination thereof. The network may be a wide area network a local area network or a combination thereof. The network may be coupled to one or more servers one or more virtual machines or a combination thereof.

In some embodiments the network includes one or more cell phone towers. In various embodiments the network includes one or more satellites.

A server a virtual machine a controller of a monitoring device or a controller of a computing device is sometimes referred to herein as a computing resource. Examples of a controller include a processor and a memory device.

As used herein a processor includes an application specific integrated circuit ASIC a programmable logic device PLD a processor a central processing unit CPU or a combination thereof etc. Examples of a memory device include a random access memory RAM and a read only memory ROM . A memory device may be a Flash memory a redundant array of disks RAID a hard disk or a combination thereof.

A computing resource performs data capture which is reception of activity data from a monitoring device. Examples of activity data include without limitation calories burned by a user blood pressure of the user heart rate of the user weight gained by a user weight lost by a user stairs ascended e.g. climbed etc. by a user stairs descended by a user steps taken by a user during walking or running floors descended by a user floors climbed by a user a number of rotations of a bicycle pedal rotated by a user sedentary activity data a distance covered by a user during walking running or driving a vehicle a number of golf swings taken by a user a number of forehands of a sport played by a user a number of backhands of a sport played by a user or a combination thereof. In some embodiments sedentary activity data is referred to herein as inactive activity data or as passive activity data. In some embodiments when a user is not sedentary and is not sleeping the user is active.

The data capture also includes capturing a geo location of a monitoring device. For example geographical location data A of the monitoring device A is determined by the monitoring device A and obtained by a computing resource. A geo location is determined by a device locator which is further described below. Examples of a geo location include latitude radius longitude altitude landmark city country state county village eatery commercial place commercial building province public place or a combination thereof. In some embodiments the geo location data is obtained not by the monitoring device but by a companion device e.g. such as a smart phone or other portable device with global positioning system GPS data collection capabilities .

In various embodiments a device locator obtains a speed of a monitoring device or of a computing device. For example a device locator of a computing device determines a speed of the computing device and a device locator of a monitoring device determines a speed of the monitoring device. In various embodiments a device locator of a device e.g. a monitoring device a computing device etc. obtains an orientation of the device. In various embodiments an orientation of a device includes a degree of rotation of the device with respect to an x axis a y axis and a z axis.

Similarly geographical location data B of the monitoring device B is determined by the monitoring device B and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data C of the monitoring device C is determined by the monitoring device C and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data D of the monitoring device D is determined by the monitoring device D and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data E of the monitoring device E is determined by the monitoring device E and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data F of the monitoring device F is determined by the monitoring device F and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data G of the monitoring device G is determined by the monitoring device G and obtained by a computing resource geographical location data H of the monitoring device H is determined by the monitoring device H and obtained by a computing resource and geographical location data I of the monitoring device I is determined by the monitoring device I and obtained by a computing resource.

A geo location of a monitoring device is used in conjunction with activity data by a computing resource to perform data analysis. The data analysis is performed by a processor. For example a level e.g. an amount etc. of an activity performed by a user at a geo location is determined. Examples of activity level include a number of calories burned by a user an amount of weight gained by a user a heart rate of a user an amount of blood pressure of a user an amount of weight lost by a user a number of stairs ascended by a user a number of stairs descended by a user a number of steps taken by a user during walking or running a number of floors descended by a user a number of floors climbed by a user a number of rotations of a bicycle pedal rotated by a user a distance covered by a vehicle operated by a user a number of golf swings taken by a user a number of forehands of a sport played by a user a number of backhands of a sport played by a user or a combination thereof etc. The geo location and the activity level are combined and displayed to a user to monitor activity and or health of the user over a period of time. As another example a geo location is combined with an activity level to determine whether a user is still at a location e.g. a house a work place an office a gym a sandwich shop a coffee shop etc. after performing the activity or has left the location after performing the activity. In this example when it is determined that the user is at the location and the activity level has crossed from a first side of a threshold to a second side of the threshold it is determined that the user has left the location. Moreover in this example when it is determined that the user is at the location and that the activity level has not crossed from the first side to the second side it is determined that the user is still at the location. In some embodiments the first side of the threshold is below the threshold and the second side of the threshold is above the threshold. In various embodiments the first side of the threshold is above the threshold and the second side is below the threshold.

In some embodiments a user indicates to a monitoring device or a computing device that the user has exited or entered a location. For example the user logs into a user account and indicates via a user interface of a monitoring device or an input device of a computing device that the user is exiting or entering a location. A processor e.g. a processor of a server a processor of a virtual machine a processor of the computing device or a processor of the monitoring device or a combination thereof etc. receives the indication from the user. The processor determines a time at which the user indicates that the user is entering or exiting the location and indicates the time on a graphical user interface that includes event data. In various embodiments upon determining that the user has entered a location the processor accesses the activity location database to determine one or more activities that may be performed by the user at the location and generates one or more activity identifiers of the activities.

In some embodiments a computing resource performs data synchronization which includes synchronization of activity data received from various users and synchronization of geo locations of the users. For example activity data from one user is displayed to another user when both the users are within one location. As another example activity data of one user is displayed to another user when both users are performing the same activity e.g. walking running etc. As yet another example activity data of one user is displayed to another user when both users are performing the same activity at the same location. As another example activity data is displayed to two or more users who perform similar activities in disparate locations e.g. a virtually shared walk .

In various embodiments a computing resource recommends data to a user based on activity data received from a monitoring device used by the user and based on a location of the user. For example when it is determined that a user is at a golf course and has not taken a number of golf swings the recommendation data indicates to the user that the user may take an additional amount of golf swings to achieve a goal. As another example when it is determined that a user is not going to or is unlikely to based on knowledge of the user s historical activity patterns reach his her activity goal e.g. walking a number of steps over a time period running a distance over a time period climbing or descending a number of stairs over a time period bicycling for an amount of distance over a time period bicycling for a number of pedal rotations of a bicycle over a time period lifting a weight for a number of times over a time period hitting a forehand for a number of times over a time period hitting a backhand for a number of times over a time period etc. and it is determined that the user is at a location the computing resource generates the recommendation data to indicate to the user to perform an activity or to extend performing the activity at the location or at another location that is within a distance of the location. These recommendations can be provided as electronic notifications to the user s device the user s smart phone to the tracking device or some other user interface. The recommendations can also be provided as voice notifications in case the user is occupied in a task that limits viewing a screen such as driving. The determination that the user is driving can be made using data regarding the speed motion of the device location data e.g. in a car etc.

In some embodiments a user may stand on a monitoring device that determines a physiological parameter of the user. For example a user stands on a scale that measures a weight a body fat percentage a biomass index or a combination thereof of the user.

A position sensor determines an amount of linear or angular movement of an arm of a user or of another body part of a user. For example a position sensor determines that the user A wearing the monitoring device G on his leg has climbed a number of stairs e.g. four twenty forty etc. between positions A and B over the time period t1.

In some embodiments instead of a number of stairs ascended a position sensor determines a number of stairs descended by the monitoring device G.

In some embodiments a position sensor measures an angular displacement of a leg of the user A wearing the monitoring device G on his leg.

In various embodiments a position sensor infers an activity performed by a user over a period of time based on one or more positions of a monitoring device that has the position sensor and that is worn by the user. For example upon determining that a difference between a first y position and a second y position within a xyz co ordinate system is greater than an amount and that x positions between the two y positions indicate a curved movement a position sensor of a monitoring device determines that the user A is playing golf. As another example upon determining that the user A covers less than a distance along an x axis over a period of time a position sensor of a monitoring device worn by the user A determines that the user A is walking and upon determining that the user A covers more than the distance along the x axis over the period of time the position sensor determines that the user A is running

The user account is accessed by the user A to review graphical user interface GUI data on a display device of the computing device A or of the monitoring device E. The GUI data includes geo location data a map location in the form of location activity identifiers activity data in the form of activity levels and or physiological parameter of the user A. The activity data represents activities performed by the monitoring device E. The processor associates e.g. links establishes a relationship between etc. geo location data location activity data and or physiological parameter of the user A with the user account to allow access of the geo location data activity data a map location and or physiological parameter upon access of the user account . This relationship provides context to the activity both in terms of what the activity was and where the activity occurred. This context can be used to define events that occur over a period of time and the events can be presented on a GUI of a device to provide useful information to a user regarding his or her activity over that period of time. Not only is the user provide with activity data but the activity data is displayed in a graphical or data organized manner that identifies segmented activity data and associates it to the proper or inferred context.

In some embodiments the one or more locations the type of location and or the size of the location received from the user A are sent by the monitoring device A or by the monitoring device B via the network to the server without using the computing device to be stored in the geo location location database.

In some embodiments upon accessing the geo location location database the processor or the processor determines that the geo location location database does not include a location corresponding to one or more geo locations visited by the user A over a period of time. The processor determines whether the user A is within a radius that includes one or more geo locations of the user A. Upon determining that the user A is within the radius for more than a number of instances of time the processor generates a prompt to provide to the user A via the display device or the processor generates the prompt to provide to the user A via the display device . The prompt requests the user A to provide the location corresponding to the one or more geo locations that are within the radius and that are visited by the user A.

In a number of embodiments the processor determines that among multiple locations a location within the geo location location database is closest to a geo location of the user A wearing a monitoring device and determines the location to correspond to the geo location location of the user A.

In some embodiments the processor receives a selection e.g. an expansion of a bubble shaped or another shaped graphical element or displayed on the display device a contraction of a bubble shaped or another shaped graphical element displayed on the display device etc. from the user A and the selection indicates that a location corresponds to a different set of geo locations than that indicated by the geo location location database. Upon receiving the selection the processor determines that the location corresponds to the different set of geo locations than that indicated by the geo location location database.

It should be noted that a graphical element has one or more graphical properties e.g. a shape a color a shade a texture or a combination thereof. For example a graphical element includes a block a line a box a dot a pin a circle a bubble or a combination thereof.

The method includes detecting in an operation an activity of the monitoring device A when the monitoring device A is worn by the user A . It should be noted that when the monitoring device A is worn by the user A the activity of the monitoring device A is the same as that of the user A. The activity includes an amount of movement of the monitoring device A and is performed for a period of time. In some embodiments the activity includes a number of calories burned by the user A. Examples of the activity of the user A detected by the monitoring device A include running or walking or jogging or sleeping or moving around or a sports activity or sleep or a combination thereof.

The amount of movement of the user A includes an amount of movement of a body part of the user A. For example the amount of movement of the user A includes an amount of stairs ascended by the user A or an amount of stairs descended by the user A a number of forehands of a sport played by the user A or a number of backhands of the sport or a number of serves of the sport made by the user A or a number of times a golf swing is made by the user A or a number of times a soccer ball is kicked by the user A or a number of times a ball is thrown by the user A a number of rotations of a bicycle made by the user A or a number of times a paddle e.g. a brake pedal an accelerator pedal etc. of a vehicle is pushed by the user A or a number of times a hand movement is made by the user A or a number of times a leg movement is made by the user A or a number of times a steering wheel of a vehicle is rotated partially or fully by the user A or an amount of calories burned by the user A or an amount of distance traveled by the user A an amount of steps walked or ran by the user A or an amount of hours slept by the user A or an amount of time for which the user A is active or a combination thereof.

The detection of the activity is performed by the position sensor of the monitoring device A. For example the position sensor determines the amount of movement of the user A. The position sensor determines the amount of movement at each amount of time e.g. second minute hour a fraction of a second a fraction of a minute a fraction of an hour etc. that is measured by the time measurement device of the monitoring device A.

The method further includes obtaining in an operation geo location data for the monitoring device A. For example the geo location data includes a latitude an altitude and or a longitude of the monitoring device A. The geo location data is obtained by the device locator of the monitoring device A. For example signals are sent between the device locator and another device e.g. a cell tower a satellite etc. to determine a geo location of the device locator and the geo location of the device locator is the same as a geo location of the monitoring device A. The geo location of the monitoring device A is the same as a geo location of the user A when the user A is wearing the monitoring device A.

The method also includes storing in an operation during the period of time of activity performed by the user A the activity that is detected in the operation and the corresponding geo location data that is obtained in the operation . The geo location data that is obtained in the operation corresponds to the activity detected in the operation when the geo location is obtained and the activity is detected at the same time or during the same time period. For example when the user A wearing the monitoring device A is performing an activity at a longitude 1 and a latitude 1 a geo location that includes the longitude 1 and the latitude 1 corresponds to the activity. In this example the position sensor determines that the user A is performing the activity and the device locator determines that the user is at the longitude 1 and latitude 1 at the same time the user A is performing the activity. To further illustrate the detected activity corresponds to the geo location data when the activity is detected at a time the monitoring device A is located at the geo location.

The operation of storing is performed by the memory device of the monitoring device A or by a combination of the processor of the monitoring device A and the memory device of the monitoring device A. For example the processor writes e.g. stores etc. data to be stored in the memory device .

The method further includes analyzing in an operation the activity detected in the operation and the corresponding geo location data obtained in the operation to identify one or more events e.g. an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event an event etc. which are described with reference to . The events and are displayed within an event region of . The events and are displayed within a GUI .

Each event occurs over a period of time. For example the event occurs over a time period e.g. from 12 AM to 8 AM etc. and the event occurs over a time period e.g. from a time between 8 AM and 9 AM to 3 PM etc.

As further shown in each event and is a portion of a GUI which is an example representation of the GUI data . For example each event and includes a textual and or a graphical data portion of the GUI . To further illustrate the event includes a graphical data portion that shows activity levels e.g. amounts etc. of an activity performed by the user A. Moreover in this illustration the event includes a time period during which the activity is performed and indicates the activity e.g. golfing etc. In this illustration the activity indicates a location e.g. a golf course. As another illustration the event includes a graphical data portion that shows activity levels of an activity performed by the user A. Moreover in this illustration the event includes a time period during which the activity is performed and includes a location e.g. a home of the user A etc. at which the activity is performed.

Each event is associated e.g. linked corresponded related etc. with a group of activity data and each group of activity data is associated e.g. linked corresponded etc. related with a location activity identifier. For example referring to the event includes a group A of activity data and the event includes a group B of activity data. The group A includes activity levels of an activity performed by the user A during a period of time and the group A is associated with a location activity identifier D. Similarly the group B includes activity levels of an activity performed by the user A during a period of time e.g. a time period between a time between 3 pm and 4 pm and a time between 5 pm and 6 pm etc. and the group B is associated with a location activity identifier A.

Moreover similarly a group of activity data of the event is associated with the location activity identifier A a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier B a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier C a group of activity data of the event is associated with the location activity identifier C a group of activity data of the event is associated with the location activity identifier C a group of activity data of the event is associated with the location activity identifier A a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier C and a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier A. Furthermore with reference to a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier A and a group of activity data of the event is associated with a location activity identifier B. A group of activity data is associated with a location activity identifier to provide a context as to which activity is performed and where. For example an amount of calories burned by a user are displayed in a background in which an icon representing an activity of walking performed by the user is shown and or an icon representing a public park is shown. The amount of calories is burned when the user is walking and or in the public park and or is walking in the public park.

Referring back to a location activity identifier is generated by the processor using the geo location data which is obtained in the operation and or activity data which is obtained in the operation . For example the processor of the monitoring device A determines that the geo location location database indicates a correspondence between a location of the user A and a set that includes one or more longitudes at which an activity is performed by the user A one or more latitudes at which the activity is performed and or one or more altitudes at which the activity is performed and assigns the location activity identifier D to represent the location. As another example the processor determines that a distance traveled by the user A in a period of time is within an upper limit and a lower limit. The period of time is received from the time measurement device of the monitoring device A. The distance traveled by the user A is received from the position sensor and or the device locator of the monitoring device A. As another example the processor receives a selection from the user A via the user interface of the monitoring device A that one or more geo locations at which the user A performs an activity correspond to a location of the user A and assigns a location activity identifier to represent the location.

The operation is performed by the processor based on the activity detected in the operation and or the geo location data obtained in the operation and a time period during which the activity is performed. The processor receives one or more amounts of time of performance of an activity during a time period from the time measurement device and or receives one or more geo locations at which the activity is performed during the time period from the device locator and receives one or more activity levels of the activity from the position sensor to perform the operation . For example the processor determines that the user A is in a vehicle upon determining that a speed of travel of the user A is greater than smiles per hour. The speed sis a running or walking speed of one or more users. The processor determines a speed of travel of the user A based on geo location data obtained in an hour of one or more geo locations of the user . Geo location data is received from the device locator of the monitoring device A and a measurement of the hour is received from the time measurement device .

As another example the processor determines whether the user A is in a vehicle or is riding a bicycle or a skateboard or is undergoing ambulatory motion based on a speed of the user A and motion of a body portion of the user A. To illustrate when the processor determines that a speed of the user A is greater than a pre determined number of miles per hour and motion of the body portion is less than a pre determined amount of motion the processor determines that the user A is in a vehicle and is not walking or running. As another illustration when the processor determines that a speed of the user A is less than the pre determined number of miles per hour and motion of the body portion is greater than the pre determined amount of motion the processor determines that the user A is performing the ambulatory motion. Examples of ambulatory motion include walking running jogging exercising etc. An example of the body portion includes an arm of the user A. In various embodiments a speed of the user A is determined by a device locator or a processor based on an amount of distance between two geo locations and time of the user A at each of the geo locations. In some embodiments a speed of the user A is determined by a position sensor or a processor based an amount of distance between two positions and time of occurrence of each of the positions.

As yet another example the processor determines that the user A is running upon determining that a speed of travel of the user A is greater than smiles per hour and a number of steps taken by the user A is greater than ssper hour. The speed sis a walking speed of one or more users. A number of steps are received by the processor from the position sensor of the monitoring device A. As another example the processor determines that the user A is walking upon determining that a number of steps taken by the user A is less than ssper hour and greater than ssper hour. As yet another example the processor determines that the user A is in a vehicle upon determining that a speed of travel of the user A is greater than smiles per hour and a number of steps taken by the user A is less than ssper hour.

As another example the processor determines that the user A is moving around upon determining that a number of steps taken by the user A is less than ssper hour. As yet another example the processor determines that the user A is sedentary upon determining that the user A is not walking running not moving around and not in a vehicle. As another example the processor determines that the user A is sleeping upon determining that the user A is sedentary for greater than an amount of time.

In some embodiments the processor determines a speed of travel of the user A based on geo location data obtained over a period of time of one or more geo locations of the user and the period of time.

The time period during which the activity is performed at a location is determined by the processor based on a sum of amounts of time measured by the time measurement device for performing the activity at one or more geo locations corresponding to e.g. included within linked with etc. the location.

The operation of analyzing the detected activity and the corresponding geo location data during the period of time includes determining a time element of segregation of the activity detected at the operation . For example a period of time during which an activity is performed is segmented into one or more time elements. As another example a period of time during which an activity is performed is segmented into one or more time elements and each time element includes a graphical property and or text to represent the time element. Examples of a time element include a fraction of a minute or a minute or a fraction of an hour or an hour etc. Further examples of a time element are shown as a time element and a time element in . The time element is a time of day at which a golf activity having an activity level is performed by the user A. Moreover the time element is another time of day at which a golf activity having an activity level is performed by the user A. The activity level at the time element is lower than the activity level at the time element . In some embodiments the activity level at the time element is higher than or the same as the activity level at the time element . The time element includes text e.g. 9 AM etc.

The operation of analyzing the detected activity and the corresponding geo location data during the period of time further includes determining an activity level for each time element. For example an activity level is determined as being performed at the time element and an activity level is determined as being performed at the time element . As another example the activity level is determined as being performed at the time element and is determined to include text and or a graphical property e.g. a dark gray bar etc. and the activity level is determined as being performed at the time element and is determined to include text and or a graphical property a dark gray bar etc.

The operation of analyzing the detected activity and the corresponding geo location data during the period of time also includes determining a location activity identifier of a location and or activity for each time element and for each activity level. For example the processor determines that an activity level that occurs at a time element is of an activity that occurs at one or more geo locations that correspond to a location and or that correspond to an activity e.g. a home of the user a building a park an office golfing walking running a commercial place an eatery a work place a vehicle a golf course a sandwich shop or any other location etc. and determines a location activity identifier that represents the location and or activity.

As another example the processor determines that the activity level is of an activity that occurs at one or more geo locations of a golf course and determines the location activity identifier D that represents golfing. In this example the processor accesses correspondence between geo location data and location data stored within the geo location location database to determine whether the one or more geo locations correspond to the golf course and or also accesses position data of the monitoring device A from the position sensor to determine that the activity is golfing. As yet another example the processor determines that the activity level is of an activity that occurs at one or more geo locations of a golf course and determines the location activity identifier D. In this example the processor applies a selection received from the user A via the user interface to determine that one or more geo locations at which the activity level occurs correspond to a golf course. In this example the geo locations at which the activity level occurs are the same or different from one or more geo locations determined by the processor from the geo location location database to correspond to a golf course.

Examples of a location activity identifier include a graphical element e.g. an icon an icon having a pointer a symbol a symbol having a pointer a trademark a trademark having a pointer a registered mark a registered mark having a pointer an animation icon an animation icon having a pointer an animation an animation having a pointer a video icon a video icon having a pointer a video a video having a pointer an audio icon an audio icon having a pointer an audio an audio having a pointer a multimedia icon a multimedia icon having a pointer a multimedia a multimedia having a pointer or a combination thereof etc. that represents a location at which the activity is performed.

A location activity identifier has a graphical element and or text. For example the location activity identifier B includes an icon of a person walking. As another example the location activity identifier D includes an icon of a person golfing with a golf club.

The operation of analyzing the detected activity and the corresponding geo location data during the period of time further includes associating the activity level with the time element and the location activity identifier. Upon determining the location activity identifier for each time element and for each activity level the processor associates e.g. establishes a link between establishes a correspondence between etc. the time element and the activity level with the location activity identifier. For example the processor establishes a link between the time element the activity level and the location activity identifier D. As another example the processor establishes a link between the time element the activity level and the location activity identifier D.

The operation of analyzing the detected activity and the corresponding geo location data during the period of time also includes aggregating the associated activity levels and time elements over the period of time to indicate using the associated location activity identifier a location of occurrence of the activity levels and of a group of activity data. The group of activity data includes the activity levels and the period of time. The processor aggregates e.g. combines accumulates etc. over a period of time the activity levels and time elements that are associated with a location activity identifier of an activity. The period of time over which the processor aggregates is continuous e.g. from 1 pm to 2 pm on a day from January to February of a year from year 2000 to year 2004 of a decade etc.

The aggregated activity levels time elements and the associated location activity identifier are represented by the processor within one or more graphical elements and or text of a background that represent an event to generate or identify the event. For example the processor assigns one or more graphical elements to an area within the GUI to generate the event that includes the group A of activity data the location activity identifier D and a background e.g. a gray shaded area a shaded area an area having a graphical property etc. The group A of activity data and the location activity identifier D are overlaid on the background . The event includes the time element aligned e.g. vertically horizontally oblique etc. with the activity level and further includes the location activity identifier D including or attached to a pointer D. The pointer D points to the event that includes the activity level and the time element . Similarly as shown in a pointer A that is included within or is attached to the location activity identifier A points to the event a pointer B that is included within or is attached to the location activity identifier B points to the event and a pointer C that is included within or is attached to the location activity identifier C points to the event .

It should be noted that in some embodiments a location activity identifier does not include and is not attached to a pointer. For example the event includes the location activity identifier D without the pointer D.

In various embodiments a group of activity data includes a location activity identifier in addition to one or more activity levels and one or more time elements. For example the group A of activity data includes one or more activity levels one or more time elements and the location activity identifier D.

In several embodiments each activity level is assigned a graphical property by the processor . For example as shown in the activity level is assigned a graphical property and the activity level is assigned a graphical property . The graphical property may be the same or different from the graphical property . For example the graphical property has the same color as that of the graphical property . As another example the graphical property has the same texture and color as that of the graphical property .

The previous location is a location at which the user A was before arriving at the current location. The current location is a location at which the user A is before the user A arrives at the future location. For example the processor determines based on the correspondence between one or more geo locations one or more positions of the user A and the previous location and based on the correspondence between one or more geo locations one or more positions of the user A and the future location that the previous location and the future location are the same.

In this example the processor further determines that the current location is different from the previous and future locations and the user A has arrived at the previous current and future locations within a time limit that is received from the time measurement device . In this example the processor determines that the current location is different from the previous locations based on the correspondence between one or more geo locations one or more positions of the user A and the previous location and based on the correspondence between one or more geo locations one or more positions of the user A and the future location and based on the correspondence between one or more geo locations one or more positions of the user A and the current location. In this example the processor determines that the current location is the same as the previous and future locations upon determining that the previous and future locations are the same and that the user A arrives at the previous current and future locations within the time limit.

In several embodiments the processor or the processor replaces a current activity identifier with a previous and a future activity identifier when the user A performs the previous current and future activities within a time limit and when the previous activity identifier and the future activity identifier are the same. The previous activity is an activity that the user A performs before performing the current activity and the current activity is an activity that the user A performs before performing the future activity. For example the processor determines based on positions of the user A and or geo location data of the user A that the previous activity and the future activity are the same and that the current activity is different from the previous and the future activities. In this example the processor further determines that the previous current and future activities are performed within a time limit that is received from the time measurement device . In this example the processor determines that the current activity is the same as the previous and future activities upon determining that the previous and future activities are the same and that the user A performs the previous current and future activities within the time limit.

In some embodiments the processor or the processor applies a Markov model to determine whether to replace the current location identifier that is different from the previous and future location identifiers with the previous or future location identifier. In a number of embodiments the processor or the processor applies a Markov model to determine whether to replace the current activity identifier that is different from the previous and future activity identifiers with the previous or future activity identifier.

In some embodiments a user resizes and or repositions an overlay e.g. an activity identifier a location identifier etc. to improve the precision of an event. For example an overlay indicates that the user A is performing an activity at a first activity level at a time. The user A changes a position and or size of the overlay to indicate that the user A is performing the activity at a second activity level at the time. The first and second activity levels are displayed within the same GUI. The user A changes a position and or size of an overlay via an input device of the computing device or via a user interface of a monitoring device.

The user A selects the date among multiple dates displayed on top of the map via the user interface of the monitoring device A or via the input device of the computing device . When the date is selected the processor of the monitoring device A generates the GUI to display the GUI on the display device or the processor of the computing device generates the GUI to display the GUI on the display device of the computing device .

The GUI includes events and . The event includes activity levels of an activity performed at the aquarium by the user A.

The processor of the monitoring device A or the processor of the computing device determines boundaries where the user A arrives at e.g. enters etc. and departs from e.g. exits etc. a location. For example the processor receives from the device locator a geo location 1 of the monitoring device A. Continuing with the example the processor determines that the geo location 1 corresponds to a location 1 e.g. a street a vehicle a subway a train a tunnel etc. outside a location 2 e.g. a building a street etc. The location 2 corresponds to a geo location 2. The processor determines that the user A is at the location 1 at a time tx and at the location 2 at a time ty. In this example the processor receives the geo location 1 from the device locator and the geo location 2 from the device locator and the times tx and ty from the time measurement device . In this example there is a lack of geo location data of the user A between the times tx and ty.

In the example the processor further determines a speed of an activity of the user A performed at the time tx or at the time ty. The processor determines a speed of the user A between the times tx and ty. Further in this example the processor calculates speed as a ratio of a distance between the geo locations 2 and 1 and a difference between the times ty and tx. In this example based on the speed the processor determines an amount of time taken by the user A to reach an entry of the location 2. A geo location corresponding to the entry of the location 2 is obtained from the device locator by the processor and or an amount of movement corresponding to the entry of the location 2 is obtained from the position sensor of the monitoring device A and the entry is determined from geo location the amount of movement and or the geo location location database by the processor . In this example the processor adds the amount of time taken to reach the entry from the time tx to determine a time of entry by the user A into the location 2 from the location 1.

It should be noted that the processor of the monitoring device A or the processor of the computing device determines geo location data as located along a straight line between two boundaries. For example geo location data is located on a straight line between the boundary A and the boundary B geo location data is located on a straight line between the boundary B and the boundary C and geo location data is located on a straight line between a point and the boundary D.

In some embodiments geo location data is determined for minute time intervals e.g. times between the times tx and ty every minute every fraction of a minute etc. is compared to the geo location data on a straight line between two boundaries or between a boundary and a point. The processor or the processor performs the comparison. The geo location data determined for the minute time intervals may be decimated by the processor or the processor . The processor or the processor determines whether a divergence between the geo location data obtained at the minute time intervals and geo location data on a straight line between two boundaries exceeds a value. Upon determining that the divergence exceeds the value the processor or the processor determines that there is a boundary at a point of the divergence.

For example a divergence between geo location data on the straight line and geo location data obtained at minute time intervals on a curve exceeds a value. In this example the boundary A exists at a point of the divergence. On the other hand upon determining that the divergence does not exceed the value the processor or the processor determines that there is no boundary at the point of lack of divergence. For example a divergence between geo location data on the straight line and geo location data obtained at minute time intervals on a straight line does not exceed the value. In this example there is no boundary formed at the point at which the lines and start to intersect.

In some embodiments the user A expands a size of the location via the user interface to indicate to include one or more geo locations within the location to indicate to the processor that the one or more geo locations within the location are within the location . The processor then associates the one or more geo locations with the location instead of with the location .

In various embodiments one or more geo locations are located outside the location .

Similarly in some embodiments upon receiving the request for a web page the server sends the web page via the network to the monitoring device A. The wireless communication device or a wired communication device of the monitoring device A receives a web page and the web page is displayed on the display device of the monitoring device A.

The systems and methods described above allow the user A to access his her account to view activity and location at which the activity is performed. For example the user A can see that the user was at a park jogging between 7 AM and 8 AM that the user was at work at 9 AM that the user went for walk at 11 AM was back to work at 11 30 AM left from work at 5 PM came home from work at 5 30 PM went running at 6 40 PM and went to bed at 10 PM. The user A can also view activity level when the account is accessed. To illustrate the user A can see that the user burned more calories when jogging in a park when the user walked at 11 AM and when the user ran at 6 40 PM than when the user was at work or at home.

The viewing of the activity levels the activities and the locations allows the user A to keep control of his health by increasing or decreasing an amount of activity that he performs. For example when the user A realizes based on event data that the user A is not burning enough calories the user A may increase an amount of activity. As another example when the user A realizes based on event data that he is not going to bed on time the user A may encourage himself to go to bed on time. In some embodiments the event data includes activity levels of one or more activities activity identifiers of one or more activities performed by the user A and location identifiers of one or more locations visited by the user A.

The user A uses a monitoring device that allows the user A to keep a check on his health. In some embodiments a monitoring device communicates with the computing device to display a GUI to the user A. The GUI includes event data. In various embodiments a monitoring device displays a GUI including event data to the user A. A monitoring device and the computing device uses one or more electronic storage devices ESDs .

An ESD provides power to one or more components of a device. For example a battery provides power to a processor and provides power via a processor of the computing device to other components e.g. an input device a memory device an I O a display device a communication device a NIC a GPU etc. of the computing device . As another example a group of capacitors provides power to a processor of a monitoring device and via the processor to other components e.g. a biological sensor a position sensor a device locator a memory device a communication device an environmental sensor a time measurement device a user interface a GPU etc. of the monitoring device.

A device locator obtains a geo location of a device. For example a device locator of a monitoring device obtains a geo location of a monitoring device. As another example a device locator of the computing device obtains a geo location of the computing device . As a rate of obtaining geo location data is increased by a device locator of a device more power is consumed by an ESD of the device. For example when a device locator of a device e.g. a monitoring device the computing device etc. obtains geo location data every second an amount of power consumed by the device locator increases compared to an amount of power consumed when the device locator obtains geo location data every minute. To save power consumed by a device locator it is important to manage a rate at geo location data is updated by the device locator.

The device locator is coupled to the GDDM which is coupled to the GURDM . The GURDM is coupled to the GDIM and to the TDDM . The GURDM is coupled to the device locator . The TDDM is coupled to the time measurement device .

Examples of the device locator include the device locator of a monitoring device or the computing device . Examples of the GDDM include the processor of a monitoring device the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server . Examples of each of the GURDM the GDI and the TDDM include the processor of a monitoring device or the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server . Examples of the time measurement device include a time measurement device of a monitoring device or of the computing device . The time measurement device of the computing device is coupled to the bus of the computing device .

The device locator determines a geo location 0 and the geo location 1 of a monitoring device or of the computing device . The geo locations 0 and 1 are associated with the location 1. For example the geo locations 0 and 1 are identified as being within a home of the user A in the geo location location database. As another example an input identifying a selection from the user A is received and the input indicates that the geo locations 0 and 1 are within the location 1. Moreover the device locator determines the geo location 2 of a monitoring device or of the computing device . The geo location 2 is associated with the location 2. For example the geo location 2 is identified as being within a vehicle of the user A in the geo location location database. The geo location 2 is determined by a device locator after the geo location 1 is determined by the device locator and the geo location 1 is determined after the geo location 0 is determined is determined by the device locator.

The GDDM receives the geo locations 0 1 and 2 from the device locator and determines a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1. For example the GDDM determines a difference between a latitude of the geo location 2 and a latitude of the geo location 1 and determines a difference between a longitude of the geo location 2 and a longitude of the geo location 1. As another example the GDDM determines a difference between an altitude of the geo location 2 and an altitude of the geo location 1. As yet another example the GDDM determines a difference between a latitude of the geo location 2 and a latitude of the geo location 1 determines a difference between a longitude of the geo location 2 and a longitude of the geo location 1 and determines a difference between an altitude of the geo location 2 and an altitude of the geo location 1.

In some embodiments the GDDM receives geo locations associated with a monitoring device. For example the GDDM is a component of a monitoring device and receives geo locations that are determined by a device locator of the monitoring device. As another example the GDDM is a component of the computing device and receives geo locations that are determined by a device locator of the computing device . In this example the GDDM receives geo locations from a device locator of a monitoring device via a communication device of the monitoring device and a communication device of the computing device .

The GURDM receives the difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 from the GDDM and determines based on the difference whether to update a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a monitoring device. For example the GURDM determines whether a difference between the geo location 2 and the geo location 1 is greater than a pre determined geo location difference value.

Upon determining that the difference between the geo location 2 and the geo location 1 is equal to or greater than the pre determined geo location difference value the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device or of the computing device . For example a rate at which a geo location 3 is determined by a device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 are obtained upon determining that the difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined geo location difference value. In this example a time difference between obtaining the geo location 3 and the geo location 2 is less than a time difference between obtaining the geo location 2 and the geo location 1. The geo location 3 is obtained by a device locator after obtaining the geo location 2.

In some embodiments a time difference between obtaining the geo locations 2 and 1 is the same as the time difference between obtaining the geo locations 1 ad 0.

On the other hand upon determining that the difference between the geo location 2 and the geo location 1 is less than the pre determined geo location difference value the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device or of the computing device . For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is the same as or less than a rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 2 are determined by the device locator. In this example a time difference between obtaining the geo location 3 and the geo location 2 is equal to or greater than a time difference between obtaining the geo location 2 and the geo location 1 or between obtaining the geo location 1 and the geo location 0.

In some embodiments times 0 and 1 are associated with a rate of obtaining the geo locations 0 and 1. The geo location 0 is obtained at a time 0 and the geo location 1 is obtained at a time 1. For example when the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained within 3 seconds a rate of obtaining the geo locations is 3 seconds. As another example when the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained within a 1 minute time interval a rate of obtaining the geo locations is 1 minute.

In various embodiments times 2 and 1 are associated with a rate of obtaining the geo locations 2 and 1. The geo location 2 is obtained at the time 2 and the geo location 1 is obtained at the time 1. For example when the geo locations 2 and 1 are obtained within 3 seconds a rate of obtaining the geo locations is 3 seconds. As another example when the geo locations 2 and 1 are obtained within a 1 minute time interval a rate of obtaining the geo locations is 1 minute.

The time measurement device determines the time 1 at which the geo location 1 is determined and the time 2 at which the geo location 2 is determined. The TDDM receives the times 1 and 2 and computes a difference between the times 2 and 1. For example when the geo location 1 is determined at 12 PM and the geo location 2 is determined at 12 01 PM a difference between the times 12 01 PM and 12 PM is one minute. As another example when the geo location 1 is determined at 1 AM and the geo location 2 is determined at 1 00 10 AM a difference between the times 1 00 10 AM and 1 AM is 10 seconds.

The GURDM receives the difference between the times 2 and 1 from the TDDM and determines based on the difference whether to update a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a monitoring device. For example the GURDM determines whether a difference between the time 2 and the time 1 is greater than a pre determined time difference value.

Upon determining that the difference between the time 2 and the time 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference value the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which a geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained or the rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are obtained upon determining that the difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference value. On the other hand upon determining that the difference between the time 2 and the time 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined time difference value the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device.

In various embodiments the GURDM determines whether a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined geo location difference and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference. Upon determining that the difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined geo location difference and the difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. On the other hand upon determining that the difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined geo location difference and or the difference between the times 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined time difference the GURDM decreases or does not change a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device.

In several embodiments the GURDM determines whether a ratio of a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than a pre determined geo location to time ratio. Upon determining that the ratio of a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined geo location to time ratio the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. On the other hand upon determining that the ratio of a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined geo location to time ratio the GURDM decreases or does not change a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device.

In various embodiments a ratio of a difference between two geo locations and a difference between times at which the user A is the geo locations is a speed of the user A.

In various embodiments the GURDM updates a rate by sending a signal to the device locator to update the rate at which the device locator is obtaining geo location data. For example the GURDM of the computing device sends a signal via a communication device of the computing device and a communication device of a monitoring to the device locator of a monitoring device to update a rate of obtaining geo location data. As another example the GURDM of the sever sends a signal via a NIC of the server and a NIC of the computing device to a device locator of the computing device to update a rate of obtaining geo location data.

In some embodiments the GDIM receives the difference between the geo locations 3 and 2 from the GDDM and receives the difference between times 3 and 2 and determines whether to interpolate geo location data between the geo locations 3 and 2 based on the differences in the geo locations 3 and 2 and the times 3 and 2. The time 3 is a time at which the geo location 3 is obtained. For example upon determining that the difference between the geo location 3 and the geo location 2 is less than a pre set geo location difference value and that the difference between the times 3 and 2 is less than a pre set time difference value the GDIM generates a statistical geo location value e.g. average median etc. of the geo locations 3 and 2 and determines that geo locations between the geo locations 3 and 2 is the statistical value.

In some embodiments instead of interpolating with the statistical geo location value the geo location 3 or the geo location 2 is used to interpolate between the geo locations 3 and 2. In a number of embodiments instead of interpolating with the statistical geo location value one or more geo locations lying within the location 3 or the location 2 are used to interpolate between the geo locations 3 and 2. In various embodiments instead of interpolating with the statistical geo location value linear interpolation is used to interpolate between the geo locations 3 and 2 to linearly connect the geo locations 3 and 2.

The system includes the device locator a standard deviation determination module SDDM a filter the GDDM and the GURDM . The SDDM is coupled to the device locator and to the filter . The filter is coupled to the GDDM and to the GDIM . Each of the SDDM and the filter is implemented within the processor of a monitoring device the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server . Examples of the filter includes a Kalman filter or a low pass filter or a band pass filter or a high pass filter a variable width filter etc.

In some embodiments when the variable width filter is applied with an increase in distance between two geo locations a width of the variable width filter decreases. For example with an increase in distance between the two geo locations there is an increase in a number of geo locations between the two geo locations and a there is an increase in standard deviation between the two geo locations. As the standard deviation increases a number of geo locations filtered out from between the two geo locations decreases and a width of the variable width filter decreases.

The SDDM receives the geo locations 0 1 4 2 and 3 from the device locator and determines a standard deviation of the geo locations 0 1 4 2 and 3. In some embodiments any number of geo locations are received by the SDDM from the device locator .

The filter receives the standard deviation from the SDDM and filters out one or more geo location outliers based on the standard deviation to generate filtered geo locations. For example upon determining that an outlier geo location e.g. the geo location 4 etc. between the geo locations 1 and 2 is located outside the standard deviation the outlier is filtered out.

The GDDM receives the filtered geo locations e.g. the geo locations 0 1 2 3 etc. from the filter to determine a difference between the geo locations 2 and 1. Similarly the GDIM receives the filtered geo locations from the filter to apply an interpolation between the geo locations 3 and 2.

In some embodiments the NDM is implemented within the device locator of a monitoring device or the device locator of the computing device . For example a device locator of a monitoring device requests an identification of a cell phone tower or of a router or of a satellite. As another example a device locator of the computing device requests an identification of a cell phone tower or of a router or of a satellite.

In various embodiments the NCDM is implemented within a processor of a monitoring device or a processor of the computing device or the processor of the server . For example the processor of a monitoring device controls a device locator of the monitoring device to request an identification of a network device e.g. a cell phone tower or a router or a satellite. As another example the processor of a monitoring device controls a device locator of the monitoring device to receive an identification of a network device. As another example the processor of the computing device controls a device locator of the computing device to request an identification of a network device. As yet another example the processor of the computing device controls a communication device of the computing device to receive an identification of a network device from a communication device of a monitoring device.

In some embodiments the NDM communicates with a cell phone tower to identify the cell phone tower and distinguish the cell phone tower from another cell phone tower. In various embodiments the NDM communicates with a router via a Wi Fi or a Bluetooth connection of an Internet Protocol IP network to identify the router and distinguish the router from another router of the IP network. In some embodiments the IP network is a part of the network . In several embodiments the NDM communicates with a satellite to identify the satellite and distinguish the satellite from another satellite.

Examples of an identity of a network e.g. a cell phone tower or a router or a host a communication device or a data circuit termination equipment DCE or a data terminating equipment DTE or a network device etc. to which a device locator of a monitoring device or the computing device is coupled to connect to the network include a network address. Examples of the network address include an Internet Protocol address or a media access layer MAC address or a host address or a network layer address etc. Examples of identity of a network e.g. a satellite etc. to which a device locator of a monitoring device or the computing device is coupled to connect with the network include a satellite catalog number.

The NDM determines a network associated with the geo locations 0 and 1. For example the NDM identifies a cell phone tower or a router or a satellite that is used to obtain the geo locations 0 and 1. Similarly the NDM determines a network associated with the geo location 2. For example the NDM identifies a cell phone tower or a router or a satellite that is used to obtain the geo location 2.

The NCDM receives identification of the networks used to obtain the geo locations 0 1 and 2 from the NDM and determines whether there is a change between the networks. For example the NCDM determines whether an identity of a router that is used to obtain the geo location 2 is different than an identity of a router that is used to obtain the geo locations 0 and 1. As another example the NCDM determines whether an identity of a satellite that is used to obtain the geo location 2 is different than an identity of a satellite that is used to obtain the geo locations 0 and 1. As yet another example the NCDM determines whether an identity of a cell phone tower that is used to obtain the geo location 2 is different than an identity of a cell phone tower that is used to obtain the geo locations 0 and 1.

The GURDM receives the determination as to whether there is a change in the networks from the NCDM . When the determination that the change in the networks has occurred is received the GURDM increases the rate at which geo location data is obtained. For example upon determining that the geo location 2 is obtained using a different network than a network used to obtain the geo locations 0 and 1 the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device or of the computing device . On the other hand upon receiving a determination from the NCDM that there is no change between the networks the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device or of the computing device.

The position sensor is coupled to the PCDM which is coupled to the GURDM . The device locator is coupled to the ADM which is further coupled to the ACDM . The ACDM is coupled to the GURDM .

Examples of the position sensor include the position sensor of a monitoring device or of the computing device . Examples of the PCDM include the processor of a monitoring device the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server . Examples of each of the ADM and the ACDM include the processor of a monitoring device or the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server .

The position sensor determines a position 0 a position 1 a position 2 and a position 3 of a monitoring device when used by the user A. The positions 0 and 1 are associated with the location 1 and with the geo locations 0 and 1. For example the positions 0 and 1 are used to determine that the user A is at work or at home. In some embodiments the position 0 includes a position of an arm of the user A at a time the user A is at the geo location 0. In various embodiments the position 1 is a position that occurs after the position 0 occurs and includes a position of an arm of the user A at a time the user A is at the geo location 1. In several embodiments the position 2 is a position that occurs after the position 1 occurs and includes a position of an arm of the user A at a time the user A is at the geo location 2. For example an arm of the user A is at the position 2 when the user A is at the geo location 2 which may correspond to a golf course. In some embodiments the position 3 is a position that occurs after the position 2 occurs and includes a position of an arm of the user A at a time the user A is at the geo location 3. As an example an arm of the user A is at the position 3 when the user A is at the geo location 3 which may correspond to a golf course.

In some embodiments the positions 0 and 1 correspond to an activity a1 and the positions 2 and 3 corresponds to an activity a2. As an example the positions 0 and 1 include positions of an arm of the user A while the user A is performing a less active activity. In this example the positions 2 and 3 include positions of an arm of the user A while the user A is performing a more active activity. To illustrate the positions 0 and 1 includes positions of a hand the user A while the user A is sleeping. In this illustration the positions 2 and 3 include positions of a hand of the user A while the user A is walking. As another illustration the positions 0 and 1 include positions of a leg of the user A while the user A is walking and the positions 2 and 3 include positions of the leg while the user A is running.

In some embodiments an activity that burns more calories of the user A is more active than an activity during which a lesser number of calories are burned. In various embodiments an activity that helps the user A lose more weight is more active than activity during which a lesser amount of weight is lost. In some embodiments an activity during which a heart rate of the user A is higher is more active than an activity during which the heart rate is lower.

The PCDM receives the positions 0 1 and 2 from the position sensor and determines a difference between the positions 2 and 1. For example the PCDM determines a difference between an x co ordinate of the position 2 and an x co ordinate of the position 1 determines a difference between a y co ordinate of the position 2 and a y co ordinate of the position 1 and determines a difference between a z co ordinate of the position 2 and a z co ordinate of the position 1. As another example a PCDM of the computing device receives positions of the user A from a position sensor of a monitoring device via a communication device of the communication device and via a communication device of the computing device .

The GURDM receives the difference between the positions 2 and 1 from the PCDM and determines based on the difference whether to update a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a monitoring device. For example the GURDM determines whether a difference between the positions 2 and 1 is greater than a pre determined position difference value. To illustrate the GURDM determines whether a difference between a y co ordinate of the position 2 and a y co ordinate of the position 1 is greater than a y co ordinate of the pre determined position difference value and determines whether a difference between an x co ordinate of the position 2 and an x co ordinate of the position 1 is greater than an x co ordinate of the pre determined position difference value.

Upon determining that the difference between the positions 2 and 1 greater than the pre determined position difference value the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is obtained by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo location 2 is obtained upon determining that the difference between the positions 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined position difference value.

On the other hand upon determining that the difference between the position 2 and the position 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined position difference value the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is the same as a rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are determined by the device locator. In this example the geo location 3 of a monitoring device is determined when the monitoring device is at the position 3.

In various embodiments the GURDM determines whether a difference between the positions 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined position difference and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference. Upon determining that the difference between the positions 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined position difference and the difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined time difference the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. On the other hand upon determining that the difference between the position 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined position difference and or the difference between the times 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined time difference the GURDM decreases or does not change a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device.

In several embodiments the GURDM determines whether a ratio of a difference between the positions 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than a pre determined position to time ratio. Upon determining that the ratio of a difference between the positions 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is greater than the pre determined position to time ratio the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. On the other hand upon determining that the ratio of a difference between the positions 2 and 1 and a difference between the times 2 and 1 is less than or equal to the pre determined position to time ratio the GURDM decreases or does not change a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device.

The ADM determines e.g. characterizes etc. the activity a1 of a monitoring device when used by the user A. The activity a1 may be associated with the location 1 and with the geo locations 0 and 1. For example the user A is performing the activity a1 at the location 1 which is determined based on the geo locations 0 and 1. The activity a1 is determined based on one or more geo locations e.g. the geo locations 0 and 1 etc. received from the device locator and or based on one or more positions e.g. the position 0 position 1 etc. received from the position sensor . The ADM determines e.g. characterizes etc. the activity a2 of a monitoring device when used by the user A. The activity a2 is performed by the user A after the activity a1 is performed by the user A. The activity a2 may be associated with the location 2 which may be associated with the geo locations 2 and 3. For example the user A is performing the activity a2 at the location 2. The activity a2 is determined based on one or more geo locations e.g. the geo locations 2 and 3 etc. received from the device locator and or based on one or more positions e.g. the position 2 etc. received from the position sensor .

The ACDM receives the activities a1 and a2 from the ADM and determines whether the activity a2 is different from the activity a1. For example the ACDM determines whether the activity a2 is walking and the activity a1 is running. As another example the ACDM determines whether the activity a2 is being sedentary and the activity a1 is playing a sport. As another example the ACDM determines whether the activity a2 is more or less active than the activity a1.

The GURDM receives an indication of a difference or lack of a difference between the activities a2 and a1 from the ACDM and determines whether to update a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a monitoring device. Upon determining that the activity a2 is more active than the activity a1 the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are obtained or the rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained upon determining that the activity a2 is walking and the activity a1 is sleeping. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are obtained or the rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained upon determining that the activity a2 is running and the activity a1 is walking.

On the other hand upon determining that the activity a2 is the same as or less active than the activity a1 the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device is decreased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are obtained by the device locator or the rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained by the device locator upon determining that the activity a2 is being sedentary and the activity a1 is running. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device is decreased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 1 and 2 are obtained by the device locator or the rate at which the geo locations 0 and 1 are obtained by the device locator upon determining that the activity a2 is walking and the activity a1 is running

Examples of each of the LDM and the LCDM include the processor of a monitoring device or the processor of the computing device or the processor of the server .

The LDM determines e.g. characterizes etc. the location 1 associated with a monitoring device. For example the LDM determines the location 1 of a monitoring device or of the computing device that is used by the user A. The location 1 is determined based on one or more geo locations e.g. the geo location 0 the geo location 1 etc. received from the device locator and or based on one or more positions the position 0 the position 1 etc. received from the position sensor . The LDM determines e.g. characterizes etc. the location 2 associating with a monitoring device. For example the LDM determines the location 2 of a monitoring device or of the computing device that is used by the user A. The location 2 is determined based on one or more geo locations e.g. the geo location 2 the geo location 3 etc. received from the device locator and or based on one or more positions the position 2 etc. received from the position sensor . The user A is at the location 2 after the user A is at the location 1.

The LCDM receives the locations 1 and 2 from the LDM and determines whether the location 2 is different from the location 1. For example the LCDM determines whether the location 2 is a golf course and the location 1 is a home of the user A. As another example the LCDM determines whether the location 2 is a restaurant and the location 1 is a work place of the user A.

The GURDM receives an indication of or lack of a difference between the locations 2 and 1 from the ACDM and determines whether to update a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a monitoring device. Upon determining that the location 2 is different than the location 1 the GURDM changes a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is a park and the location 1 is a home of the user A. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is a gym and the location 1 is a home of the user A.

On the other hand upon determining that the location 2 is the same as the location 1 the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. As an example a rate at which the geo location 3 is obtained is decreased or kept the same compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is a home of the user A and the location 1 is a running track. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is obtained is decreased or kept the same compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is a home of the user A and the location 1 is a racing track.

In some embodiments both activity and location change are monitored to determine whether to change a rate at which geo location data is obtained. For example the GURDM determines whether the activity a2 is different than the activity a1 and whether the location 2 is different than the location 1. Upon determining that the location 2 is different than the location 1 and the activity 2 is more active than the activity 1 the GURDM increases a rate at which geo location data e.g. the geo location 3 etc. is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is at park and the location 1 is a home of the user A and upon determining that the activity a2 is walking and the activity a1 is sleeping. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by the device locator of a monitoring device is increased compared to the rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are obtained upon determining that the location 2 is at baseball field and the location 1 is a home of the user A and upon determining that the activity a2 is playing a sport and the activity a1 is sleeping.

On the other hand upon determining that the location 2 is the same as the location 1 and or the activity a2 is the less active or the same as the activity a1 the GURDM does not change or decreases a rate at which geo location data is obtained by a device locator of a monitoring device. For example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by a device locator of a monitoring device is the same as a rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are determined when it is determined that the user A just woke up and is at his home. As another example a rate at which the geo location 3 is determined by a device locator of a monitoring device is the less than a rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or the geo locations 1 and 0 are determined when it is determined that the user A just went to bed and is at his home.

It should be noted that a rate at which geo location data is obtained is changed to reduce an amount of power that is consumed by an ESD of a device e.g. the computing device a monitoring device etc. For example when a rate at which the geo locations 3 and 2 are determined by a device locator of a device is less than a rate at which the geo locations 2 and 1 or 1 and 0 are determined by the device locator power consumed by the device locator decreases. The device locator uses less power to determine the geo locations 3 and 2 compared to determining the geo locations 1 and 2 or the geo locations 1 and 0.

In some embodiments to decrease a rate at which geo location data is obtained a location Application Programming Interface API that is stored within a memory device of a device e.g. a monitoring device the computing device etc. is turned off by a processor of the device. In these embodiments to increase a rate at which geo location data is obtained the location API is turned on from an off position by a processor of the device.

In some embodiments a processor applies adaptive learning of locations. For example a processor determines that a user is at a location and or achieves an activity level of an activity at the location for a number of times greater than a pre determined number. The processor further determines a range of times at which the user is at the location for the number of times and or achieves the activity level at the location. When the user visits the location on a day after the processor determines the range of times the processor determines whether a time at which the user visits the location falls within the range of times. Upon determining that the time at which the user visits the location at a time that falls within the range of times the processor determines that the user is at the location and or will achieve the activity level at the location.

In several embodiments a processor applies refined learning of location and size. For example a processor determines that the user A visits an inside the user s home and determines that one or more geo locations within the inside of the home corresponds to the home. In this example the processor determines that the one or more geo locations within the inside of the home corresponds to the home based on the geo location location database or based on a selection received from the user indicating that the geo locations correspond to the home. In this example a processor determines that the user A visits a backyard of the user s home and determines that one or more geo locations of the backyard of the home correspond to the home. In this example the processor determines that one or more geo locations of the backyard corresponds to the home based on the geo location location database or based on a selection received from the user indicating that the geo locations correspond to the home. When the user visits a geo location within the backyard or the inside of the home for a next time the processor determines that the user is at his her home. It should be noted that although home is used as an example in some embodiments other locations e.g. a gym a work place a golf course a race track etc. may be used.

In several embodiments a processor determines a favorite route of a user based on a number of times the user follows the route. For example a processor determines that a user follows a route for greater than a pre determined number of times. In this example the processor determines that the route is a favorite route of the user. In this example the processor determines data associated with the route e.g. a statistical amount of time taken to complete the route or a location close to the route or a destination of the route or a combination thereof etc. In some embodiments the processor determines the destination of the route from a maps service or from the geo location location database. Examples of the statistical amount of time taken to complete the route include an average amount of time to complete the route a maximum amount of time to complete the route a minimum amount of time taken to complete the route etc. In this example the processor labels within a GUI the route with the data associated with the route. To illustrate the processor labels a route as walk to a train instead of walk . As another illustration the processor labels a route as morning walk to work instead of walk . As another illustration the processor labels a route as 3 mile run down Cedar street instead of run . As another illustration the processor labels a route as 6 mile beach run instead of run . Examples of the route include a dog walking route a commute to work route a running route a route to a bus station a route to a train station a route to work a route to home a route to a friend s home etc.

In some embodiments a processor quantifies an emotional response when a user is responsive to a piece of entertainment. The emotional response includes a combination of the HRV and or the GSR. Based on the emotional response the processor assigns a rating to the piece of entertainment. For example when the HRV and or the GSR indicate to the processor that the user is sleeping during a movie the processor assigns a low rating to the movie. On the other hand when the HRV and or the GSR indicate to the processor that the user is excited during the movie the processor assigns a high rating to the movie. Based on the HRV and or the GSR the processor determines a type of the piece of entertainment that the user likes. In some embodiments the processor prompts a user to provide the rating. The piece of entertainment may be a movie an opera a ballet a concert a song a multimedia presentation a television show news etc. Examples of a type of the piece of entertainment include a horror piece an action piece a drama piece a sad piece a comedy piece etc.

In various embodiments a processor determines that a user is at a location at which the piece of entertainment is presented e.g. publicly displayed shown etc. and displays within a GUI that includes event data information regarding the location. For example a processor determines that a user is at a movie theater and populates a GUI with showtimes of movies at the theater. The showtimes of the movies are obtained from a website or a database that is used to present the showtimes. Other examples of information regarding the location include video games available at a theater types of food available at a concert etc.

In various embodiments a processor determines motion and location features from users to build a network database. For example the processor determines that a user performs an activity at a location for a number of times and performs a motion signature that identifies the activity for the number of times. The motion signature is a motion of a user that is substantially repeated over a time period. For example a first swimming motion when the user is at a swimming pool in a gym is performed on day 1 and a second swimming motion when the user is at the swimming pool at the gym is performed on day 2. The first and second motions are within a standard deviation. When the user visits e.g. enters etc. the location at another time e.g. day 3 etc. the processor determines that the user is going to perform the same activity that the user has performed for the number of times. For example the processor determines based on the motion signature and the location visited for the number of times as soon as the user enters a gym that the user will swim at the gym. As another example the processor determines that the user will do yoga at a yoga place based on the motion signature and the location visited for the number of times.
