title: Certificate evaluation for certificate authority reputation advising
abstract: In many information security scenarios, a certificate issued by a certificate authority on behalf of a domain is presented to a client in order to verify the identity of the domain. However, due to a decentralized structure and incomplete coordination among certificate authorities, the presence and exploitation of security vulnerabilities to issue untrustworthy certificates may be difficult for an individual client to determine. Presented herein are techniques for advising clients of the trustworthiness of respective certificate authorities by evaluating the certificates issued by such certificate authorities for suspicious indicators, such as hashcode collisions with other certificates and public key re-use. A trust level may be identified of respective certificate authorities according to the presence or absence of suspicious indicators in the certificates issued by the certificate authority, and a certificate authority trust set may be distributed to advise clients of the trustworthiness of certificates issued by the respective certificate authorities.

The present application claims priority to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 020 491 filed Sep. 6 2013 which in turn claims priority to U.S. Patent Application No. 61 830 121 filed Jun. 2 2013 the entirety of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Within the field of computing many scenarios involve authentication using a certificate issued by a certificate authority. For example a user may connect to a website to perform a sensitive interaction such as a financial transaction using credentials that might be misused if intercepted by a third party. Accordingly the website may submit a certificate verifying its identity and signed by a certificate authority. The device of the user may examine the cryptographic signatures of the certificate to verify its authenticity that the identity of the issuer and the authenticity of the certificate before proceeding with the transaction and the provision of credentials.

This Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to identify key factors or essential features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.

The certificate authority system is subject to exploitation due to a variety of technical and non technical aspects. As a first example vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited in the mathematical models on which security techniques are based e.g. flaws in the MD5 hashing algorithm may permit the forgery of certificates or the alteration of signed content. As a second example under the current certification model a set of certificate authorities is identified and globally trusted such that any certificate authority may issue certificates for any domain as a result the exploitation coercion or malicious actions of any one certificate authority may result in the issuance of inauthentic certificates for any domain. As a third example it may be difficult to detect exploits of certificate authorities particular certificates and the security models involved therein because relevant information may be withheld e.g. certificate authorities often do not provide public records of issued certificates and or currently utilized security techniques and or may be unable to assess outside of a collective process that currently does not exist e.g. some types of exploits may be apparent from a collection of certificates submitted to a variety of users but may be undetectable from individual certificates .

In view of these limitations the present disclosure involves a model for evaluating certificates issued by certificate authorities for respective domains. In accordance with this model a certificate authority trust service may collect a set of certificates that have been issued by certificate authorities for respective domains. The certificate authority trust service may evaluate the certificates to detect a suspicious indicator that the certificate does not legitimately reflect a certification of the domain by the certificate authority. The suspicious indicators may include e.g. a hashcode collision between the certificate and a second certificate the issuance of a certificate for a domain within a first region that has an official certificate authority where the certificate is issued by a second domain from a second region or the issuance of a certificate at a first time that uses a first security technique presenting a known vulnerability while a previous certificate was issued by the certificate authority for the domain at a previous time that used a second security technique that presented no known vulnerability which may indicate an unexplained relaxation of security standards.

The certificate may be evaluated to detect any of several such suspicious indicators. The presence of a suspicious indicator in a certificate may suggest the certificate authority is issuing certificates that it is not entitled to issue and or that the domain or a third party is able to exploit a security vulnerability of the certificate authority. Such suspicious indicators may therefore entail a reduction of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority while the absence of suspicious indicators in certificates particularly for a continuing set of certificates that are issued for domains by the certificate authority may result in promotion of the trust level of the certificate authority over time. The certificate authority trust service may generate a certificate authority trust set that indicates the certificate authority trust levels of the respective certificate authorities and may distribute the certificate authority trust set to clients which may in turn decide whether or not to trust a particular certificate based upon the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority that issued the certificate. In this manner the techniques presented herein may enable the devices to evaluate the trust of certificates using collective information in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends the following description and annexed drawings set forth certain illustrative aspects and implementations. These are indicative of but a few of the various ways in which one or more aspects may be employed. Other aspects advantages and novel features of the disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the annexed drawings.

The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident however that the claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.

In order to facilitate the first client in verifying the authenticity of the domain a first certificate authority may be provided that has established a level of trust with the first client . The first certificate authority may generate a first certificate identifying one or more aspects of the identity of the first domain and or the resource e.g. a hashcode of the content of a message and cryptographically signed with a credential of the first certificate authority e.g. using a cryptographic private key of an asymmetric encryption technique . The first certificate authority may then provide the first certificate to the first domain which may in turn provide the first certificate with the resource requested by the first client . Upon receiving the certificate the first client may authenticate the first certificate with a credential of the first certificate authority e.g. verifying the signature of the first certificate with a cryptographic public key of the first certificate authority . Verification of the first certificate with the credential of the first certificate authority establishes a trustworthiness of the first client in the authenticity of the first certificate e.g. that the first certificate was actually generated by the first certificate authority and not a third party and that the first certificate has not been altered subsequent to generation . If the verification is successful the first client may interact with the domain to complete the transaction involving the resource e.g. by providing a user s identification credentials such as a login and password in order to allow the domain to authenticate the user . In this manner the trustworthiness of domains may be established on behalf of clients by certificate authorities even if such certificates are handled by untrusted intermediaries.

In view of these techniques a body of certificate authorities may be created according to a set of security practices. Occasionally exploits in the body of certificate authorities may prompt changes to the structure and underlying security techniques of such certificate authorities . For example vulnerabilities may be occasionally discovered in some of the mathematical techniques used in certificate generation that enable an attacker to alter the contents of the certificates issued by certificate authorities . For instance the hashing algorithm identified as MD5 was regarded as applicable to a particular set of content with a cryptographic private key resulting in a hashcode for a domain that is verifiable with the corresponding cryptographic public key that enables the detection of alterations to the signed content and that cannot be generated without possessing the cryptographic private key corresponding to the cryptographic public key. However flaws discovered in the mathematical techniques comprising the MD5 hashing algorithm may be exploited to allow the generation of certificates without possession of the cryptographic private key and or the adjustment of a validly generated hashcode in a manner that verifies against altered content. While such exploits may be computationally very difficult the feasibility of generating hashcodes for forged or altered certificates has prompted a revocation of public trust in the MD5 hashing algorithm and has prompted certificate authorities to shift security practices in the generation of certificates from using the MD5 hashing algorithm to other hashing algorithms such as SHA 2 that are not currently known to present mathematical flaws or vulnerabilities.

However difficulties in this technique may arise from a decentralized body of certificate authorities . For example certificate authorities may operate independently and may not uniformly agree about the selection and implementation of security practices to be used in generating certificates . Accordingly a first certificate authority may use a security practice such as a particular hashing algorithm that a second certificate authority considers unsecure. Additionally incomplete disclosure by a particular certificate authority of the security practices utilized in generating certificates e.g. policies for rotating certificating credentials may cause difficulty in assessing the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority according to the authenticity of its certificates . Accordingly a lack of collective evaluation of trust in certificate authorities may inhibit the evaluation of the certificate authority trust level . For example a particular client presented with a certificate may have limited access to information as to the certificate authority trust level to be ascribed to the certificate authority in view of the certificate and may therefore be unable to authenticate the certificate beyond the content thereof. Additionally diagnostic information pertaining to the certificate authority trust level of certificate authorities may be apparent in patterns of activity in the issuance of a variety certificates by the certificate authority to a variety of clients but the evaluation of such information may be inhibited by the unavailability of mechanisms for collecting and evaluating the certificates issued by the certificate authority and received by a variety of clients .

Accordingly the certificate authority trust level to be placed in certificate authorities may be subject to exploitation that may be difficult to detect. As a first such example in some certificate authority scenarios any certificate authority may issue a public certificate for any domain . The certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority system may thus be subject to exploitation e.g. certificates ostensibly representing a first entity such as a first company or a first national government may be issued by a certificate authority that is collaborating with an adverse second entity such as a competing company or a hostile second national government . As a second such example because certificate authorities may not provide public records of the certificates issued on behalf of various domains it may be difficult for a domain to detect the issuance of unauthorized certificates on its behalf. As a third such example it may be difficult to review the security practices utilized by a particular certificate authority e.g. some certificate authorities may be slow or reluctant to transition away from using security practice that is found to be unsecure. As a fourth such example some types of exploits may be detectable only by a collective evaluation of many certificates e.g. the issuance of certificates on behalf of a particular domain concurrently by two or more different certificate authorities may raise a security concern but the detection of this condition may be difficult to discern from the examination of any particular certificate in isolation. Moreover due to the absence of a collective process to gather examine reach a consensus on and disseminate information about the trust placed in respective certificate authorities makes it difficult for any particular client to determine whether or not to determine the certificate authority trust level of a particular certificate authority and the authenticity of a certificate issued by the certificate authority for a particular domain .

Such problems are further illustrated in the example scenario of . As a first such example the first client may receive from a second domain a second certificate indicating issuance by the first certificate authority . However the second certificate may not have actually been issued by the first certificate authority but may instead have been forged e.g. by the second domain or a third party through the exploitation of a security vulnerability e.g. the use of a compromised credential of the first certificate authority . Accordingly it may be desirable for the client to identify an untrustworthiness of the second certificate but the first client may not be able to determine such untrustworthiness simply by examining the second certificate . As a second example a second certificate authority that exhibits untrustworthiness e.g. a history of issuing improper certificates may issue a third certificate for a third domain and the third certificate may be submitted to the first client . However even if the first client is able to determine the untrustworthiness of the third certificate issued by the second certificate authority such determination of untrustworthiness may not be communicated to a second client which upon receiving the third certificate may incorrectly determine a certificate authority trust level of the second certificate authority . Due to these aspects illustrated in the example scenario of and other aspects of a system of certificate authorities determinations of certificate authority trust level of respective certificate authorities may be difficult.

Presented herein are techniques that may enable a reduction or avoidance of exploitable vulnerabilities that may arise within a system of certificate authorities . In accordance with these techniques a certificate authority trust service may be devised that collects certificates that have been issued on behalf of various domains and presented to clients . For example the devices utilized by a set of users may automatically submit some received certificates to a certificate authority trust service. Alternatively or additionally a certificate authority trust service may utilize a set of trusted clients e.g. a trusted set of crawlers that automatically explore a set of domains and collect certificates submitted by the domains and apparently issued by a certificate authority . Based on the evaluation of the respective certificates the certificate authority trust service may generate a certificate authority trust set indicating a certificate authority trust level for respective certificate authorities and may distribute the certificate authority trust set to a set of clients . Each client may then evaluate subsequently received certificates based on the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority issuing the certificate as indicated by the certificate authority trust set as well as various other heuristics for assessing the trust of a certificate . These and other techniques may be utilized to detect disseminate and utilize a collective certificate trust evaluation process in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The certificates collected from various domains may be evaluated to evaluate a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authorities using a variety of heuristics. As a first such example the certificate authority trust service may consider the number and pattern of times that the certificate has been received from clients e.g. whether the certificate is new established or expired and whether the certificate has reappeared after a lapse in submissions by clients . As a second such example the certificate authority trust service may consider conflicts between the certificate and other certificates issued by the certificate authority for a particular domain such as a receipt of a second certificate for a domain while a prior certificate for the same domain remains in effect and unrevoked. As a third such example a sequence of certificate authorities back to a root certificate authority may be evaluated e.g. if any of the certificate authorities in the sequence by which a certificate was issued has been compromised the certificate may be regarded as suspicious even if the other certificate authorities have not been compromised. As a fourth such example the content type of the domain for which the certificate has been issued e.g. if the domain is from a particular geographic region that is unusual for the certificate authority or if the domain hosts content that is unusual for the certificate authority to certify e.g. malware the certificate may be regarded as suspicious. As a fourth such example if the certificate was generated using a certification technique such as an encryption or hashing algorithm that has a known vulnerability and that may enable forgery or alteration the certificate may be regarded as suspicious.

The certificate authority trust service also performs a certificate authority evaluation of the respective certificate authorities in order to detect the presence of a suspicious indicator that the certificate has not been legitimately issued by the certificate authority to the domain . Such suspicious indicators may result from a variety of problems. As a first such example a certificate authority may not be authorized to issue certificates on behalf of a particular domain . As a second such example a domain may have forged or altered certificates to provide the appearance that a particular certificate authority has issued a legitimate certificate for the domain e.g. using a compromised security key of the certificate authority or altering the contents of the certificate such as the identifier of a certificate that has been revoked by the certificate authority . As a third such example a security vulnerability may have permitted a third party to compromise the certificate authority and or the domain in order to alter the contents of the certificate . As a fourth such example a third party may have intercepted the certificate when transmitted from the certificate authority to the domain and or from the domain to a client .

In view of these and other sources of untrustworthiness an examination of the certificate may reveal a suspicious identifier that reduces the trustworthiness of the certificate . A certificate authority trust service may upon receiving a certificate from a client perform a certificate evaluation to detect the presence or absence of such a suspicious identifier in the certificate . As a first such example a certificate may exhibit a hash collision where the contents of the certificate may have been intentionally altered such that a hashcode of the contents matches the hashcode of a second certificate . Such hash collisions may enable the re use of the signature of a certificate authority of the second certificate as a signature of the first certificate with altered contents and may be detected by identifying that the hashcode of the first certificate matches the hashcode of the second certificate . As a second such example the certificate purportedly issued by a first certificate authority may be verifiable with a public key that is also usable to verify certificates issued by a second certificate authority . Such public key re use is unlikely to occur by coincidence and may indicate either the alteration of the signature of the certificate and or the unauthorized dissemination and use of a private key corresponding to the public key. Public key re use may also be detected by identifying a match between the public key usable to verify a first certificate issued by the first certificate authority and the public key usable to verify a second certificate issued by the second certificate authority .

The certificate authority trust service may perform the certificate evaluation to detect the presence or absence of suspicious indicators in the certificates received from certificate authorities and may accordingly establish a certificate authority trust level for each certificate authority . For example a first certificate authority that has not issued any certificates featuring a suspicious indicator may be assigned a positive certificate authority trust level . A second certificate authority issuing a small number of certificates containing a ambiguous suspicious indicator which may indicate a passing coincidence an anomalous practice utilized once by the certificate authority and or a temporary security problem that has been resolved by the certificate authority may be assigned an intermediate certificate authority trust level . A third certificate authority associated with several certificates featuring unambiguous suspicious indicators such as a chronic pattern of forged certificates may be assigned a negative certificate authority trust level .

Having identified the certificate authority trust levels of respective certificate authorities the certificate authority trust service generates a certificate authority trust set identifying for respective certificate authorities a certificate authority trust level . The certificate authority trust service sends the certificate authority trust set to the clients which may utilize the certificate authority trust set to determine a certificate authority trust level for the respective certificate authorities . Accordingly upon receiving a certificate for a domain a client may ascribe to the certificate and the domain a trust level proportional to a certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority apparently issuing the certificate . In this manner the clients and certificate authority trust service may interoperate to achieve a collaborative collection determination and dissemination of certificate authority trust levels of various certificate authorities and certificates issued thereby in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques presented herein enable a variety of technical effects that may benefit the operation of devices configured according to such techniques.

As a first such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may automatically advise other devices as to the reliability of certificates and certificate authorities . The use of a device such as a server to achieve such detection may alleviate humans such as security researchers from manually reviewing such certificates and making determinations of the certificate authority trust level of respective certificate authorities . Additionally using a device such as a server to perform such evaluation may promote the consistency of such determinations. AS a first such example using a device that consistently applies a set of heuristics to a large number of certificates enables more consistent security determinations than having a team of humans evaluate such certificates individually and subjectively and therefore possibly inconsistently perform such evaluation.

As a second such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may detect more subtle patterns among certificates domains and certificate authorities than a human reviewer may detect and observe. As a first such example an established certificate may present no apparent signs of suspicion to a human reviewer but an automated evaluation technique may detect that the certificate has not been received from any clients for an unusual amount of time e.g. heavy use by the domain a six month period wherein no clients submit the certificate to the certificate authority trust service followed by a sudden reappearance of the certificate . As a second such example a certificate by a certificate authority may represent a minor problem that raises only a low degree of suspicion but may be one of many such certificates issued by the same certificate authority that raise only a low degree of suspicion where a detected pattern of consistently low suspicion may indicate an aggregate greater level of suspicion of the certificate authority .

As a third such example a device utilizing the techniques presented herein may respond more rapidly to suspicious certificates and vulnerabilities than a human mediated review process. For example if a certificating authority begins issuing unambiguously forged certificates on behalf of a collection of domains an automated review technique may rapidly flag the certificate authority as having been compromised and may rapidly notify a large body of clients of a reduction of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority rather than waiting for a human to review the certificates and authorize the reduction of the certificate authority trust level . Such automated techniques therefore considerably reduce the window of opportunity for a compromised certificate authority to exploit forged certificates . These and other technical effects are achievable through the use of the techniques presented herein.

The example first method begins at and involves executing the instructions on the processor of the device. In particular the execution of the instructions on the processor causes the device to responsive to receiving a certificate issued by the certificate authority for a domain evaluate the certificate to detect a suspicious indicator of the certificate . If the evaluation results in the detection of a suspicious indicator in the certificate the instructions further cause the device to reduce the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set . On the other hand if the evaluation does not result in the detection of a suspicious indicator in the certificate the instructions further cause the device to maintain the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set . In either event the instructions further cause the device to distribute the certificate authority trust set to the clients . In this manner the example first method causes the device to advise clients of the certificate authority trust levels of the various certificate authorities in accordance with the techniques presented herein and so ends at .

In particular the instructions stored in the memory device and executed on the processor provide a certificate evaluator which responsive to receiving a certificate issued by a certificate authority for a domain evaluates the certificate to detect a suspicious indicator of the certificate . The certificate evaluator also responsive to detecting the suspicious indicator of the certificate reduces the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set and responsive to failing to detect the suspicious indicator of the certificate maintains the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set The instructions stored in the memory device and executed on the processor also provide a certificate authority trust distributor which distributes the certificate authority trust set to the clients . In this manner the example certificate authority trust server advises the clients regarding the certificate authority trust levels of respective certificate authorities sin accordance with the techniques presented herein.

The techniques discussed herein may be devised with variations in many aspects and some variations may present additional advantages and or reduce disadvantages with respect to other variations of these and other techniques. Moreover some variations may be implemented in combination and some combinations may feature additional advantages and or reduced disadvantages through synergistic cooperation. The variations may be incorporated in various embodiments e.g. the example first method of the example system of the example second method of and the example computer readable storage device of to confer individual and or synergistic advantages upon such embodiments.

A first aspect that may vary among embodiments of these techniques relates to the scenarios wherein such techniques may be utilized.

As a first variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized with many types of clients such as devices operated by one or more users one or more applications executing on such devices and or online services provided on behalf of one or more users or other applications. The certificate authority trust service may also be provided in a variety of architectures including a service performed on the device of the client e.g. a web browser security component a local area network service deployed over a local area network of an organization on behalf of the clients of the organization or a wide area network service deployed over a wide area network such as a service provided over the internet on behalf of a large number of clients . Such certificate authority trust services may also be implemented in a variety of architectures including a large scale server farm that is geographically grouped and or geographically distributed where respective servers of the service evaluate a subset of the certificates received by the certificate authority trust service.

As a second variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to determine a certificate authority trust level of a certificate authority and involving various types of resources presented to and or accessed by a client such as messages applications websites and or identifying credentials of one or more domains of a network.

As a third variation of this first aspect the techniques presented herein may be utilized to evaluate the determine a certificate authority trust level of various types of certificate authorities issuing certificates such as the X.509 certification based trust infrastructure.

As a fourth variation of this first aspect many types of certificate authority trust services may be provided to facilitate the evaluation by clients of determine a certificate authority trust level of various certificate authorities . Such certificate authority trust services may comprise a public service provided to any client or a semi private or private service provided to a specific set of clients . Alternatively or additionally a certificate authority trust service may identify the certificate authority trust levels of any certificate authority or of only a subset of certificate authorities such as those issuing particular types of certificates those issuing certificates only for a particular set of certificated items or those interoperating on behalf of a particular set of domains and or clients .

As a fifth variation of this first aspect one or more clients may utilize the certificate authority trust set in various ways. As a first such example a client may only permit access to resources from domains that are associated with a certificate issued by a certificate authority having a high certificate authority trust level specified in the certificate authority trust set and may restrict access to resources form other domains . As a second such example a client may permit access to resources associated with domains that are certified by certificates issued by certificate authorities that are not associated with a high certificate authority trust level according to the certificate authority trust set but may do so only after warning a user of the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority and or may provide access within tightened security credentials e.g. executing a first application certified by a first certificate issued by a first certificate authority having a high certificate authority trust level natively and with a high level of privileges and executing a second application certified by a second certificate executed by a second certificate authority having a low certificate authority trust level with a restricted set of privileges such as within an isolation construct such as a virtual machine having limited access to the device of the user . These and other scenarios may be compatible with the application of the techniques presented herein.

A second aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the manner of receiving certificates and selecting among the received certificates a subset of certificates to be evaluated.

As a first variation of this second aspect a certificate authority trust server may evaluate certificates received from a variety of sources that in turn received from a variety of domains after issuance by a certificate authority . As a first such example the source of a certificate may comprise the client upon which the certificate authority trust service is provided. As a second such example the source of a certificate may comprise an individual such as a security researcher who believes that a particular certificate may be untrustworthy. As a third such example the source of a certificate may comprise a trusted domain crawler that explores an interconnected set of domains and submits certificates received from domains during such exploration. As a fourth such example the source of a certificate may comprise an untrusted source such as a public individual or device wherein the integrity of the certificate may not be reliable e.g. a third party may have altered a certificate after receipt from a domain in order to introduce a suspicious indicator that may reduce the certificate authority trust level of the certificate authority . As a fifth such example the source of a certificate may comprise the domain and or certificate authority associated with the certificate which may submit the certificate in order to verify the absence of suspicious indicators and or to request an analysis of a suspicious indicator that has arisen within the certificate .

As a second variation of this second aspect a certificate authority trust server may be configured to evaluate all of the certificates received by the server. Such certificates may be evaluated in realtime or near realtime and or may be stored upon receipt and evaluated at a later time. Such certificates may also be evaluated in any desired order such as chronological order of issuance chronological order of receipt and or according to the certificate authority and or domain of the certificate .

As a third variation of this second aspect a certificate authority trust server may be configured to evaluate only a subset of the certificates received by the server. For example the certificate authority trust server may only be interested in evaluating certificates from a particular domain or set of domains or only from a particular certificate authority or set of certificate authorities .

As a first example of this third variation of this second aspect the certificate evaluation may be applied randomly e.g. as a random spot check of certificates .

As a second example of this third variation of this second aspect the certificate evaluation may be applied only for a limited number of certificates received from a certificate authority over a period of time e.g. only ten certificates received each day from each certificate authority .

As a third example of this third variation of this second aspect respective domains may be associated with a domain significance indicator that indicates the significance of the domain which may in turn indicate the likelihood of a third party seeking to compromise the domain and or reduce the perceived trustworthiness of the domain and its certificates and or the potential harm that may result from an undetected compromise of such devices. Such domain significance indicators may be selected from a domain significance indicator set including a security domain indicator that associates the domain with the security of a resource e.g. a domain associated with a internet infrastructure server or an industrial control system such as a supervisory control and data acquisition SCADA server that controls and or collects data about an industrial system or process a ranking of a search engine a commercial domain indicator that associates the domain with a commercial enterprise e.g. a domain involving a network router mail server business logic server and or database of a business or financial institution and or a political domain indicator that associates the domain with a political organization e.g. a domain controlled by a government agency . Due to the significance and or sensitivity of such domains a certificate authority trust service may selectively evaluate the certificates received from and associated with such domains and or the certificate authorities that issue certificates on behalf of such domains while forgoing and or de prioritizing the evaluation of certificates associated with other domains .

A third aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the manner of identifying suspicious indicators in a certificate issued by an certificate authority for a domain .

As a first variation of this third aspect presented in the example scenario of a second certificate may have been issued by a second certificate authority and may comprises a second hashcode of a second message . A match between the first hashcode of the first certificate and the second hashcode of the second certificate may comprise a suspicious indicator e.g. the first message of the first certificate may have been altered to result in a matching hashcode which may enable a re use of some credentials applied by the second certificate authority to the second certificate .

As a second variation of this third aspect presented in the example scenario of the public key included in the first certificate to verify the first signature may match a public key included in third certificate by a third certificate authority to verify a third signature of the third certificate which may enable the first certificate authority to re use the signature of the third certificate to imply that the first certificate was signed by the third certificate authority . The match may be detected and interpreted as a suspicious indicator of the first certificate in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

As a third variation of this third aspect presented in the example scenario of a first certificate may have been issued by the certificate authority with a first certificate duration such as a first date range and using a security technique e.g. a particular hashing algorithm used to generate a hashcode of the certificate . In isolation the certificate duration may not present a suspicious indicator but by comparison with a second previous certificate may have been issued by the certificate authority and using the same security techniques and with a certificate duration that is within the certificate duration of the first certificate . The previous certificate may therefore be equivalent to the first certificate and it may not be clear why the certificate authority has issued the first certificate while only a small portion of the certificate duration of the previous certificate has elapsed.

As a fourth variation of this third aspect presented in the example scenario of a certificate for a domain may have been issued by a certificate authority at a first time and a previous certificate for the domain may have been previously issued by a second certificate authority at a second time. A comparison of a time interval between the first time and the second time with a time interval threshold e.g. an indication that the certificate authorities issuing certificates for the domain has changed rapidly over a brief interval may be construed as a suspicious indicator of the certificate .

As a fifth variation of this third aspect presented in the example scenario of the first certificate may have been issued with a first security technique that presents a particular security assurance e.g. a perceived and or tested reliability of the security technique against security vulnerabilities such as susceptibility to hashcode collisions . However subsequent to the first certificate a third certificate may have been issued that utilizes a second security technique having a lower security assurance than the first security technique of the first certificate . For example if the first certificate is issued with 256 bit encryption the issuance of a third certificate subsequent to the first certificate and issued with 64 bit encryption which is much more easily decoded through brute force trial and error may represent a suspicious indicator of the third certificate . The detection of an unexplained reduction in the assurance provided by the security techniques of the certificate authority may be interpreted as a suspicious indicator of the certificates in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

As a sixth variation of this third aspect a domain may be associated with a domain region that is serviced by at least one regional certificate authority while the certificate authority issuing a certificate for the domain may be associated with a certificate authority region that is different from the domain region of the domain . A determination that the certificate authority region of the certificate authority issuing a certificate for the domain does not match the domain region of the domain may be construed as a suspicious indicator of the certificate . For example a government controlled domain in a first nation may be expected to utilize an official government controlled certificate authority to certify the government controlled domain and the issuance of a certificate by a second certificate authority controlled by a different and potentially adverse nation may be construed as a suspicious indicator of the certificate .

As a seventh variation of this third aspect a certificate authority trust service may store a certificate count of certificates issued for the respective domains by a certificate authority over a time period and may construe a determination that the certificate count for the domain over the time period exceeds a certificate count threshold as a suspicious indicator of the certificates e.g. determining that the certificate authority has issued a large number of certificates for the domain over a comparatively short period of time . These and other suspicious indicators of certificates issued by certificate authorities for domains may be detected by a certificate authority trust service provided in accordance with the techniques presented herein.

A fourth aspect that may vary among embodiments of the techniques presented herein involves the response of a certificate authority trust service to the detection of a suspicious indicator of a certificate issued by a certificate authority for a domain .

As a first variation of this fourth aspect the certificate authority trust service may include a new certificate authority evaluator that upon receiving a certificate from a new certificate authority for which certificates have not previously been received and or evaluated establishes a certificate authority trust level in the certificate authority trust set for the new certificate authority . As one such example the new certificate authority evaluator may initially establish an untrusted certificate authority trust level for the new certificate authority e.g. indicating that insufficient information has been evaluated for the certificate authority to associate any degree of trustworthiness with the new certificate authority and responsive to failing to detect a suspicious indicator for a set of certificates issued by the new certificate authority e.g. the issuance of legitimate and non suspicious certificates for an extended period of time the new certificate authority evaluator may raise the certificate authority trust level of the new certificate authority in the certificate authority trust set .

As a second variation of this fourth aspect the certificate authority trust service may include a domain notifier that upon receiving a certificate for a domain that has not previously been evaluated notifies the domain and or the certificate authority of the certificate issued for the domain by the certificate authority . Alternatively upon receiving a certificate for a domain that has been issued by a certificate authority that has not previously issued certificates for the domain the certificate authority trust service may notify the domain and or the certificate authority of the certificate issued for the domain by the certificate authority .
