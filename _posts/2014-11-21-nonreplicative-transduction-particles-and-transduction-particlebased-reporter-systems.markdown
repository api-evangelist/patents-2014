title: Non-replicative transduction particles and transduction particle-based reporter systems
abstract: Methods and systems are provided for packaging reporter nucleic acid molecules into non-replicative transduction particles for use as reporter molecules. The non-replicative transduction particles can be constructed from viruses and use viral transduction and replication systems. The reporter nucleic acid molecules include a reporter gene, such as a reporter molecule or selectable marker, for detecting target genes or cells. Methods and systems are provided for detection of cells and target nucleic acid molecules using the non-replicative transduction particles as reporter molecules.
