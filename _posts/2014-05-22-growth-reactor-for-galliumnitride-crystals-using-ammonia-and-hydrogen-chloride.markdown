title: Growth reactor for gallium-nitride crystals using ammonia and hydrogen chloride
abstract: The present invention in one preferred embodiment discloses a new design of HVPE reactor, which can grow gallium nitride for more than one day without interruption. To avoid clogging in the exhaust system, a second reactor chamber is added after a main reactor where GaN is produced. The second reactor chamber may be configured to enhance ammonium chloride formation, and the powder may be collected efficiently in it. To avoid ammonium chloride formation in the main reactor, the connection between the main reactor and the second reaction chamber can be maintained at elevated temperature. In addition, the second reactor chamber may have two or more exhaust lines. If one exhaust line becomes clogged with powder, the valve for an alternative exhaust line may open and the valve for the clogged line may be closed to avoid overpressuring the system. The quartz-made main reactor may have e.g. a pyrolytic boron nitride liner to collect polycrystalline gallium nitride efficiently. The new HVPE reactor which can grow gallium nitride crystals for more than 1 day may produce enough source material for ammonothermal growth. Single crystalline gallium nitride and polycrystalline gallium nitride from the HVPE reactor may be used as seed crystals and a nutrient for ammonothermal group III-nitride growth.

which applications are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety as if put forth in full below.

The invention is in one instance related to a production method of GaN or other group III nitride crystals for use as nutrient or seed crystals in the ammonothermal method. GaN crystals grown using the current invention can also be used for successive device fabrication.

 Note This patent application refers to several publications and patents as indicated with numbers within brackets e.g. x . A list of these publications and patents can be found in the section entitled References. 

Gallium nitride GaN and its related group III alloys are the key material for various opto electronic and electronic devices such as light emitting diodes LEDs laser diodes LDs microwave power transistors and solar blind photo detectors. Currently LEDs are widely used in cell phones indicators displays and LDs are used in data storage disc drives. The majority of these devices are grown epitaxially on heterogeneous substrates such as sapphire and silicon carbide. The heteroepitaxial growth of group III nitride causes highly defected or even cracked films which hinders the realization of high end optical and electronic devices such as high brightness LEDs for general lighting or high power microwave transistors.

Most of the problems inherent in heteroepitaxial growth could be avoided by instead using homoepitaxial growth. Single crystalline group III nitride wafers can be sliced from bulk group III nitride crystal ingots and then utilized for high end homoepitaxial growth of optical and electronic devices. For the majority of devices single crystalline GaN wafers are desired because it is relatively easy to control the conductivity of the wafer and GaN wafers will provide the smallest lattice thermal mismatch with device layers. However the GaN wafers needed for homoepitaxial growth are currently expensive compared to heteroepitaxial substrates. This is because GaN wafers are currently produced with quasi bulk growth method in which a thick layer of GaN is grown with hydride vapor phase epitaxy HVPE on a heteroepitaxial substrate followed by removal of the substrate. Due to an open reactor configuration for HVPE the growth efficiency is not as high as the conventional bulk growth method used for other semiconductor materials such as Si and GaAs.

Although a real growth method of bulk GaN is ideal it has been difficult to grow group III nitride crystal ingots due to their high melting point and high nitrogen vapor pressure at high temperature. Growth methods using molten Ga such as high pressure high temperature synthesis 1 2 and sodium flux 3 4 have been proposed to grow GaN crystals. Nevertheless the crystal shape grown using molten Ga is a thin platelet because molten Ga has low solubility of nitrogen and a low diffusion coefficient of nitrogen.

The ammonothermal method which is a solution growth method is a promising alternative for bulk GaN growth and has been demonstrated to grow real bulk GaN ingots 5 . High pressure ammonia which has high transport speed and high solubility of GaN is used as a fluid medium to grow bulk GaN. State of the art ammonothermal method 6 8 requires a sufficient supply of source material. While pure Ga metal can be used as a source material it provides an uneven growth rate as the surface of the Ga nitridizes. To provide a more stable growth rate polycrystalline GaN is desirable as a starting material.

One method to produce GaN polycrystals is direct nitridization of Ga with ammonia 9 . Nevertheless this method can only yield powder form of GaN i.e. microcrystalline or nanocrystalline .

On the other hand HVPE which utilizes gaseous ammonia gaseous hydrogen chloride and metallic Ga is commonly used to produce GaN wafers for successive device fabrication. We found that HVPE can be applied to produce source materials for the ammonothermal method.

With HVPE single crystalline GaN seed can be grown on a main susceptor and parasitic polycrystalline GaN deposited inside the reactor can also be used as a nutrient for the ammonothermal growth. However the current HVPE reactors are designed to grow GaN for relatively short duration typically for between 1 and 10 hours. In order to apply HVPE to produce source materials for the ammonothermal method the reactor must be modified to extend growth duration.

One of the major limitations in extending growth duration of HVPE is clogging in the exhaust system by powder formation. The powder is mainly composed of ammonium halide such as ammonium chloride. To avoid clogging in the exhaust system a second reaction chamber is added after a main reactor or first reactor chamber where GaN is produced. In the second reaction chamber ammonium chloride formation may be enhanced and the ammonium chloride may be collected efficiently. To avoid ammonium chloride formation in the main reactor the connection or transition zone between the main reactor and the second reaction chamber is maintained at elevated temperature. In addition or alternatively the second reaction chamber may have two three or more exhaust lines which can be switched automatically to avoid overpressure of the system by clogging. These features together with details explained below help solve a clogging problem in the exhaust line of HVPE to extend the uninterrupted growth duration.

The substrate on which GaN or other III V nitride material is deposited may be a material other than GaN or other than the III V nitride material being deposited respectively.

In the following description of the preferred embodiment reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. For instance while GaN may be formed in a method and reactor as discussed herein other group III nitride compounds may be formed such as AlGaN or InGaN.

The present invention in one instance provides a reactor design to produce polycrystalline GaN nutrient and single crystalline GaN seeds for the ammonothermal growth of group III nitride crystals primarily group III nitride single crystals that include at least the element Ga with the possible addition of another group III elements B Al and In such as AlGaN or InGaN 0 x

One method to produce polycrystalline GaN and single crystalline GaN suitable for the source material of the ammonothermal growth is the HVPE method. Nevertheless HVPE is traditionally used for growing epitaxial film up to several hundreds of microns. Since the typical growth rate of GaN in HVPE is 50 150 m h the growth reactor is designed to continue growth for up to 10 hours. In order to produce GaN source for ammonothermal growth however HVPE reactor must be operated for longer duration. If HVPE reactor in the current technology were operated for over 24 hours the exhaust line would be clogged with ammonium chloride. Also injection nozzle of source gases i.e. ammonia and gallium chloride would be clogged unless the nozzle is properly designed.

To solve the above mentioned problem the current invention discloses a new design of HVPE reactor. To avoid clogging in the exhaust system a second reaction chamber is added after a main reactor where GaN is produced. The second reaction chamber will enhance ammonium chloride formation and the powder is collected efficiently in it. To avoid ammonium chloride formation in the main reactor the connection between the main reactor and the second reaction chamber is maintained at elevated temperature. In addition the second reaction chamber has two or more exhaust lines such as three or four or five or six exhaust lines. If one exhaust line is clogged with powder the valve for an alternative exhaust line will open and the valve for the clogged line is closed to avoid overpressure of the system.

A reactor design in accordance with the current invention is explained. These features and other details are explained below together with the .

The HVPE reactor in is a vertical type reactor with source gas inlets located at the bottom and exhaust lines located at the top. The HVPE reactor consists of a main reactor made of quartz tube and a second reaction chamber made of stainless steel .

The bottom end of the main reactor is capped with a bottom flange . The bottom flange has carrier gas inlet ammonia gas inlet and hydrogen chloride gas inlet .

The main reactor is surrounded with a furnace for GaCl synthesis and a furnace for GaN growth . The hydrogen chloride inlet is connected to a Ga container where GaCl x 1 2 or 3 is synthesized. GaClis successively supplied to the seed crystal through an appropriate gas nozzle. Carrier gas such as nitrogen and or hydrogen is fed through a sheath tube in order to help isolate the ammonia flow and the GaClflow until the gases meet at the seed surface.

To grow single crystalline GaN a seed crystal is mounted face down on a susceptor . The susceptor helps to achieve uniform temperature over the surface of the seed crystal so that single crystalline GaN is uniformly grown on the seed crystal .

The height of the susceptor can be raised with a rod during the growth process so that the location of the growth front on the seed is maintained at the same level. Also the susceptor can be rotated by rotating the rod to improve uniformity of gas supply and temperature.

The main reactor is lined with a PBN sheath which extends to a point lower than the mixing point of the gases so that any parasitic deposition of polycrystalline GaN occurs on the PBN sheath . In this way polycrystalline GaN nutrient can be collected efficiently on the PBN sheath .

Baffles are located in a transition zone of the reactor above the susceptor . The baffles reduce the amount of heat transferred from the main or first reactor chamber into the second reactor chamber. The baffles also prevent the ammonium chloride powder from falling back to the main reactor from the second reaction chamber . Although there are holes in the baffles to let gas through the holes in successive baffles are preferably offset such that the baffles do not provide a direct optical path from the second reactor chamber to the first. The baffles are preferably positioned in or adjacent to the heated zone so that the temperature is sufficiently high to avoid deposition of ammonium chloride.

The upper end of the quartz tube for the main reactor may have a wide end flange which meets the flange of the second reaction chamber . The O ring is preferably located sufficiently far from the center of the reactor so that the connection between the main reactor and the second reaction chamber can be maintained at a temperature above 200 C. preferably above 350 C. If necessary the O ring can be cooled with air or fluid.

Since the sublimation temperature of ammonium chloride is 338 C. ammonium chloride powder deposition on the connection or transition zone can be avoided in this design. The residual gas is introduced into the second reaction chamber without forming ammonium chloride powder in the main reactor .

In the second reaction chamber on the other hand formation of ammonium chloride powder is enhanced because the gas slows down and cools down. To increase residence time of the gas the cross section measured at of the second reaction chamber is set larger than that of the main reactor measured at . The second reaction chamber can have fins or baffles which act as a powder collector and or help powder settle from the gas stream.

The second reaction chamber has more than one exhaust line. In one exhaust line with isolation valve is initially used and the isolation valve in the exhaust line is closed. When ammonium chloride powder builds up in the first exhaust line and the reactor pressure exceeds a certain limit the isolation valve opens to switch the exhaust path from the first line to the second line. The system can have more than 2 exhaust lines so that growth can be continued for a longer duration.

The HVPE reactor with the second reactor chamber disclosed herein avoids deposition of ammonium chloride in the main chamber. The second reactor chamber enhances formation of ammonium chloride powder and collects it efficiently so that clogging of the exhaust line is avoided. In addition multiple exhaust lines with automatic valve switching further extends growth duration without interruption by clogging.

The present application discloses a new HVPE reactor which in some embodiments can be operated more than 24 hours. Uninterrupted long growth of GaN in HVPE can produce single crystalline seed of sufficient thickness together with enough polycrystalline GaN to use in ammonothermal growth of group III nitride crystals. Since both single crystalline and polycrystalline GaN are used as source material for the ammonothermal growth the process is quite efficient. The current invention will therefore enable improvements in productivity of GaN bulk crystals by the ammonothermal method.
