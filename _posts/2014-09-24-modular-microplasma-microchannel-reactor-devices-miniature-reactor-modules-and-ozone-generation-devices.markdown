The application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 and all applicable statutes and treaties from prior provisional application Ser. No. 61 881 741 which was filed Sep. 24 2013.

This invention was made with Government assistance under U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant Nos. FA9550 10 1 0048 and FA9550 12 1 0487. The Government has certain rights in this invention.

The invention is in the field of microchannel microplasma devices also known as microdischarge or microcavity plasma devices. Additional fields of the invention include plasma chemical reactors ozone generation and plasma chemistry. Example applications of the invention include the dissociation of gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen disinfection of water with ozone and ozone generation and distribution for the preservation of food products commercial and residential laundry washing clothes towels etc. in cold water and the disinfection of surfaces wounds and medical instruments.

Plasma chemical reactors and processes seek to use plasma to initiate desirable chemical reactions. Plasma can be used to promote chemical reactions in liquids and gases and on the surfaces of solids. Present commercial plasma systems are used for printing for treating water and for sterilizing surfaces for example. An impediment to the wider adoption of commercial plasma chemical reactors is the scale and expense of conventional atmospheric pressure plasma technology. The cost size weight and high voltages characteristic of typical plasma chemical reactors limit greatly the potential of conventional plasma reactor technology. Ozone treatment is a particularly attractive application of plasma chemical technology but the cost size and weight of most existing systems render them of limited value for many commercial uses.

Existing systems include electron beam systems and discharge based systems such as the pulsed corona or dielectric barrier discharge DBD reactors. Electron beam based systems require the creation of free electrons and their acceleration to high energies under vacuum conditions. This process typically requires high voltages tens to hundreds of kV . The electrons are introduced into a gas reactor chamber to bombard one gas or a mixture of gases. This can produce fragmentation dissociation of the molecules from the gas or the gas mixture. The reaction chamber requires a robust entry point for the electron beam because this point often a metal foil through which the electrons pass is subjected to pressures and heat generated in the reaction vessel. High voltages of one hundred or more kV are generally required to accelerate the electrons so that they are able to enter the chamber. The requirements for high voltage and vacuum equipment raise the cost and complexity of these systems to a level that limits the utility of the systems.

Discharge based systems create high energy electrons directly within the treated gas volume via application of locally intense electric fields. Such plasma chemical reactors include dielectric barrier and corona discharge systems. The discharge systems often operate at pressures of hundreds of Torr to beyond 1 atmosphere and require voltages of at least several kV and typically more than 10 kV. Both dielectric barrier systems and corona discharge systems tend to produce inhomogeneous plasmas that are characterized by streamers. The reactor volumes in these systems tend to be large milliliters to hundreds of liters which restricts the influence of the reactor wall on the plasma chemistry.

Ozone can be produced when oxygen O2 molecules are dissociated by an energy source into oxygen atoms. Collisions of free oxygen atoms with oxygen molecules produce ozone O3 which must be generated at the point of treatment because the lifetime of O3 in air at atmospheric pressure is on the order of minutes. Ozone is the strongest oxidant and disinfectant available commercially. Mechanisms of disinfection using ozone include direct oxidation destruction of bacterial cell walls reactions with radical by products of ozone decomposition and damage to the constituents of nucleic acids. Particular commercially available DBD systems for the large scale production of ozone for municipal water treatment for example are large as long as 10 15 ft. in length and have demanding power requirements 150 200 kVA . Furthermore the conversion of feedstock gases into O3 is typically inefficient. Existing commercial processes for producing O3 in large volume typically convert 15 18 of the oxygen O2 feedstock gas into O3. This low efficiency for the conversion of feedstock gas to ozone is a result of the fact that ozone is produced only within or in the vicinity of the streamers produced in air or oxygen by DBD systems. Maintenance of such systems is also problematic owing to a large number of ceramic parts and fouling of device components by nitric acid. Existing dielectric barrier discharge technology is also sensitive to the level of organic impurities in the oxygen feedstock gas.

There are additional drawbacks to existing commercial plasma chemical devices and systems. Dielectric barrier discharge structures are most commonly used in present day commercial systems. These uncomplicated devices apply high voltages to electrodes separated by a dielectric often glass or quartz . Typical macroscopic reactors rely upon microdischarge streamers that are nominally 100 m in diameter and statistically distributed in space and time. Conversion efficiencies are low which therefore requires large volumes of oxygen or air flows to generate reasonable amounts of O3. Moisture and organic contaminants in the feedstock gas are another problem with conventional ozone generating systems because the system can be fouled and rendered less efficient or disabled as a result of nitric acid build up on the reactor wall or on vacuum fittings.

Research by some of the present inventors and colleagues at the University of Illinois has resulted in new microcavity and microchannel plasma device structures as well as new applications. A particularly promising class of microcavity plasma device arrays is formed in metal and metal oxide. Large scale low cost arrays of microplasma devices that can be flexible are formed by inexpensive processes with metal electrodes encapsulated in metal oxide.

One previous application and publication by several of the present inventors and colleagues has described the production of ozone in microchannels. Specifically Park et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8 442 091 discloses microchannel lasers having a microplasma gain medium. In that patent microplasma acts as a gain medium with the electrodes sustaining the plasma in the microchannel. Reflectors can be used in conjunction with the microchannel for obtaining optical feedback and lasing in the microplasma medium in devices of the invention for a wide range of atomic and molecular species. Several atomic and molecular gain media will produce sufficiently high gain coefficients that reflectors mirrors are not necessary. of that patent also discloses a microchemical reactor that is suitable for air purification and ozone production because of the channel lengths and large power loadings watts deposited per unit volume of the plasma that are available. However fabrication costs associated with channels of extended length present an obstacle to commercialization of this technology for applications that would benefit from ozone production.

Some of the present inventors and colleagues have developed devices that produce high quality plasmas in microchannels. For example linear arrays of 25 200 m wide channels have been fabricated in glass by replica molding and micropowder blasting and have been demonstrated to be capable of generating low temperature nonequilibrium microplasmas. See Sung Hwang Park and Eden Interchannel optical coupling within arrays of linear microplasmas generated in 25 200 m wide glass channels Appl. Phys. Lett. 97 231502 2010 . Parallel microchannels have also been fabricated in nanostructured alumina AlO via a nanopowder blasting process and shown to provide the capability for routing and controlling the flow of packets of low temperature nonequilibrium plasma. See Cho Park and Eden Propagation and decay of low temperature plasma packets in arrays of dielectric microchannels Appl. Phys. Lett. 101 253508 2012 . Further development and research on these and additional microchannel structures by some of the present inventors and colleagues produced ozone microreactors capable of generating ozone and fragmenting gas molecules. See 0062 0066 of commonly owned Eden et al. US Published Patent Application 2013 0071297 published Mar. 21 2013. The ozone microreactor in the 297 Application included 12 microchannels that supported a flow rate of 0.5 standard liters per minute and ozone generation efficiencies exceeding 150 g kWh.

Current technology for ozone production generally differs with the scale of ozone production required. Reactors tend to be custom designed for particular applications. As an example commercial reactors for ozone production for high throughput applications in municipal water treatment and pulp processing employ technology and system designs that differ considerably from those of lower production rate units. Commercial installations are often custom designed difficult to scale require large amounts of power and are generally inefficient as well as sensitive to contaminants in the feedstock gas flow stream.

Several manufacturers currently offer reactors designed for kilogram hour ozone production rates that are typical of many municipal water treatment facilities. Typical reactors include a number of cylindrical DBD plasma tubes each of which is separately fused. Plasma produced in each tube is spatially inhomogeneous and ozone production occurs predominately in the vicinity of the streamers. On the other hand smaller scale applications requiring lower throughput e.g. 

A portable ozone generator is described in U.S. Pat. No. 7 157 721 721 patent . In the 721 device both sides of a glass or ceramic plate are coated with conductive materials to form electrodes having different areas. Such a device produces a corona discharge in the region lying outside the smaller of the two electrodes. An ozone device based upon this corona discharge mixes ozone with water in flow channels that are formed in plastic. No microchannels exist in the ozone producing reactor. Another manufacturer provides a modular approach to ozone generation that is based upon corona discharge cells. However because the corona discharge reactors are not flat nor is the plasma confined to microscopic channels these reactors are not readily or easily combined and in particular are not amenable to being stacked. Furthermore the voltages required of corona discharge systems are high multi kV and conversion efficiencies oxygen or air ozone are low.

A preferred modular microplasma microchannel reactor device includes a microchannel array of a plurality of microchannel plasma devices. The plasma devices include electrodes arranged with respect to the plurality of microchannels to stimulate plasma generation in the plurality of microchannels upon application of suitable voltage. The electrodes are isolated from the microchannels by dielectric. A gas inlet is provided to the microchannels. A gas product outlet is provided from the microchannels. A portion of the microchannels between the gas inlet and gas product outlet are covered by a cover. The cover and device are structured to be modular so as to join with additional reactor devices.

A cover covers a central portion of the microchannel array while leaving end portions of the microchannel array exposed. A gas inlet and product outlet are arranged to permit flow into through and out of the microchannel array.

Reactor modules of the invention include pluralities of the modular reactor devices. The reactor devices can be arranged by a housing or a frame to be in fluid gas communication with other reactor devices. A system of the invention arranges pluralities of modules. Preferred module housings frames and reactors include structural features to create alignments and connections. Preferred modules include fans to circulate feedstock and reaction product. Other reactor devices provide plasma actuation for flow.

The invention provides modular microchannel microplasma reactors reactor modules and modular reactor systems that include pluralities of the modular microchannel microplasma reactors and reactor modules. The reactors reactor modules and modular systems are readily combined and scaled into large systems. The reactors reactor modules and modular reactor systems can each provide a specific predetermined throughput e.g. grams of product hour. The reactors can generate ozone as an example product. In preferred embodiment ozone production modules and systems each module and each modular system provides a respective predetermined grams per hour of ozone. Because preferred individual reactor modules can be combined through stacking arranged along a line etc. the present microplasma technology is readily scalable in ozone output.

For example preferred reactor modules are configured to seal together when stacked in a frame structure of a preferred embodiment modular system with a gas tight seal that also provides inputs and outputs from the modular system. The modules are also configured to provide electrical contacts to the electrodes of the individual microchannel microplasma reactor devices in the modules. The reactor modules and system frame structure are preferably configured to provide a predetermined registration of feedstock gas inputs and the outputs product outputs for microchannel arrays in a module. The registration can be parallel or transverse to the axis of the microplasma channels in each reactor for example. In example embodiments each reactor includes a microchannel microplasma array with parallel microchannels. The number of channels in preferred examples is 10 50. In other embodiments each reactor includes microchannels arranged in a radial pattern or a spiral pattern. The fabrication methods for the microchannel arrays permit a wide variety of other channel geometries such as zig zag and curved e.g. sinusoidal patterns.

Preferred reactors modules and systems provide a highly scalable and inexpensive ozone generation solution that has also been found to have excellent lifetimes greater than 2 500 hours for example in experimental systems . Systems of the invention are easier to service than many commercially available ozone generation units including popular dielectric barrier discharge units. A paradigm realized by modules and modular systems of the invention is inexpensively providing a specific desired output measured in grams per hour to meet the needs of a particular application. This broadens the attractiveness of ozone treatment to applications that are not served by present commercial technology due to costs and inefficiencies of the present commercial systems. However systems of the invention are also scalable to meet the larger ozone output applications currently served by existing ozone generation technology. The modular nature of the systems of the invention provides the ability to inexpensively scale a system to meet a particular desired output.

Preferred modular microchannel microplasma reactors of the invention include an array of microchannel plasma devices that are formed in high quality metal oxide with excitation electrodes being buried in the wall of the microchannel encapsulated in the oxide and flanking the channel over much or all of its length. An input provides a gas feedstock to be treated e.g. oxygen or air and an output provides a reaction product e.g. ozone. Methods for forming preferred metal and meal oxide arrays of microchannel plasma devices that are used in reactors of the invention are disclosed in commonly owned Eden et al. US Published Patent Application 2013 0071297 published Mar. 21 2013. A microchannel array in accordance with the 197 application includes microchannels defined at least partially within a thick metal oxide layer consisting essentially of defect free oxide. Electrodes are arranged with respect to microchannels to stimulate plasma generation in the microchannels upon application of a suitable time varying voltage and with at least one of the electrodes encapsulated within the thick metal oxide layer. Large arrays can be formed and are highly robust as a virtual absence of microcracks in the oxide serves to prevent dielectric breakdown. A method of fabricating a microcavity or microchannel plasma device of the invention includes anodizing a flat or gently curved or gently sloped metal substrate to form a thick tens to hindreds of micrometers layer of metal oxide which consists essentially of nanopores that are oriented perpendicular to the surface of the metal substrate. Spatially selective material removal removes metal oxide material in specific regions of the metal oxide surface so as to form a microcavity or microchannel in the thick layer of metal oxide. Micropowder ablation is preferably used as an efficient removal process that preserves oxide quality and produces a microchannel of the desired cross section. Other formation techniques include chemical etching methods.

Preferred materials for the thin metal electrodes and metal oxide are aluminum and aluminum oxide Al AlO . Another exemplary metal metal oxide material system is titanium and titanium dioxide Ti TiO . Other metal metal oxide material systems will be apparent to artisans. Preferred material systems alternatively permit the formation of microcavity plasma device arrays of the invention by inexpensive mass production techniques such as roll to roll or batch chemical processing.

Additional preferred modular microchannel microplasma reactor modules of the invention include an array of microchannel plasma devices that is formed in polymer with excitation electrodes being buried and encapsulated in the polymer. Methods for forming the arrays of microchannel plasma device arrays are disclosed in commonly owned Eden et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8 497 631. A replica molding process produces microchannels in polymers. Either of the polymer or metal metal oxide microchannel arrays can have microchannel cross sections optimized to a specific shape.

An individual reactor of the invention provides a compact and lightweight microplasma chemical reactor with an array of microchannel plasmas and is scalable in throughput product output per hour . Combining individual modular reactors into modules and systems can provide scalable massively parallel processing of gases and vapors using the same technology for different ranges of reactor system sizes i.e. product generation rates . The invention thus provides a scalable paradigm for the plasma processing of gases or vapors in which the desired chemical product such as ozone is produced in hundreds or thousands of microchannels. Reactor systems of virtually any size product output per hour are realized by incorporating the number of reactor modules necessary for a specific application. The cost of ozone production can therefore be reduced for many applications such as the disinfection of water for drinking cleaning of clothes towels etc. in commercial laundries and water treatment in residential and commercial swimming pools. Ozone production is realized by introducing oxygen or air into the microchannels as the feedstock gas.

The microchannel plasma reactors reactor modules and reactor systems are also capable of efficiently producing chemical products other than ozone. For example carbon dioxide or other gases that are environmentally unfriendly or hazardous can be dissociated fragmented efficiently in arrays of microchannel plasmas. Dissociation of carbon dioxide can also be combined with feedstock chemicals such as water or methane to produce valuable commodities such as formic acid syngas or methanol.

Another preferred embodiment modular design miniature reactor provides low profile flat reactor sheets that can yield a compact package when combined into reactor modules. Another preferred plasma miniature reactor provides a microchannel plasma network in a ladder configuration that has been demonstrated in experiments to produce ozone more efficiently than a comparable reactor having only parallel channels.

The invention also provides modular microchannel plasma systems for producing and distributing ozone. Example ozone producing and distribution systems of the invention can include a microchannel sprayer plate that joins to a reactor module and distributes ozone in a pattern and direction defined by the microchannels in the sprayer plate. Such dispersion spray ozone systems will be particularly beneficial for the food storage and distribution industry. Systems of the invention can be powered by small and portable power supplies e.g. using small batteries any 9 to 12V battery as an example and DC to AC inverters with up converting transformers in example embodiments that can support several ozone generators of the invention. Miniature reactor ozone modules of the invention can also be manufactured to be sufficiently small to be affixed to the inside of a food package e.g. a plastic bag that encloses a high value food product of interest. Experimental reactors have been powered by batteries and voltage multipliers in food packages. In such an application the miniature reactor converts a fraction of the oxygen in the gaseous volume surrounded by the packaging into ozone to destroy bacteria on the surface of the food product thereby extending its shelf life. The reactor need only run periodically for small amounts of time and the total power required is small. Example experimental food package embodiments operated with 1 to 2 Watts of power.

Miniature reactor modules and systems of the invention can have a fan incorporated into their housings and arrays of reactor systems can therefore provide a self contained package that provides a desired flow of the product gas such as ozone . In another embodiment the microplasma reactor array is configured in an actuator arrangement in which the plasma itself serves to pull ambient air into the reactor and propel the air ozone product out of the reactor. In such an embodiment no fan is necessary which further reduces the cost and weight of the miniature reactor system or arrays of the miniature reactor system.

In addition to food preservation miniature ozone systems of the invention are well suited for example for the disinfection of water in hot tubs air purifiers and other applications having a low ozone generation requirement.

Reactor systems of the invention require voltages considerably lower than those typical of existing technology to generate ozone. Embodiments of the invention also provide reactors of low weight and cost.

Preferred embodiments will now be discussed with respect to the drawings. The drawings include schematic figures and partial views that are not to scale but which will be fully understood by skilled artisans with reference to the accompanying description. Features may be exaggerated for purposes of illustration. From the preferred embodiments artisans will recognize broader aspects of the invention.

The preferred embodiments will be illustrated with respect to the preferred Al AlOmaterials system and experiments that were conducted with experimental devices. As mentioned above other metal and metal oxide systems can be used and other suitable materials for the microchannel arrays include polymers glasses and ceramics.

The voltage to be supplied to the electrodes must be time varying because the plasma generated within the microchannels is physically and electrically isolated from both electrodes. Feedstock gas air or oxygen if the desired product is ozone is introduced at one gas inlet end of the microchannel array and the desired product emerges from the other product outlet end . The inlet and outlet provide flow of gas into and out of the microchannels . An upper portion of the metal oxide forms a cover to contain flow. The cover is configured structurally to be modular and arranged with other reactors. Depending upon the efficiency of the conversion process the effluent leaving the microchannel array will also contain unreacted feedstock gas. The length of the microplasma reactor chip is typically 0.5 5 inches as mentioned above but can be much shorter or longer for specific plasma generated products. Contacts to the electrodes are conceptually illustrated in . Features of the electrodes and oxide permit stacked connection in preferred embodiment reactor devices i.e. electrical connections are established between devices when they are stacked or otherwise arranged to make physical contact.

When the microchannels are formed in the substantially defect free metal oxide via the powder blasting techniques described in Eden 197 US Published patent application discussed in the background the channel formation process can be controlled to produce a wide range of microchannel cross section geometries including ellipsoidal trapezoidal or semi circular. Microchannels can also be formed in metal metal oxide dielectric layers by micromachining laser ablation chemical etching and other techniques. See e.g. Eden et al. U.S. Pat. No. 7 573 202. Polymer microchannels can also have various tapered triangular rectangular and rounded cross sections. See e.g. Eden et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8 497 631.

The wafer or chip style reactors of are configured to permit assembly of miniature reactor modules and systems while also providing the necessary electrical connections and gas flow channels to permit plasma processing of an input feedstock gas and the output of a gas product. shows a reactor module comprising a plurality of individual microchannel plasma reactor devices held in a housing that also incorporates a fan and illustrates a preferred individual reactor device prior to installation in the housing of the reactor module . In the microchannels are covered by a top electrode which is a metal foil encapsulated by a layer of nanoporous metal oxide in the manner illustrated in detail in . This top layer also seals the microchannels below it. also shows that the shape of the top electrode can provide the registration positioning function that aligns feedstock input ports and output product ports of all of the individual arrays. Circular seals such as O rings provide an airtight vacuum seal between all of the arrays when they are clamped together in the housing . The housing defines a shape that accommodates the reactors . The fitting is snug. Internally the housing includes electrical contacts pins clips spring finger stock etc. to individual electrical contacts such as at tabs of the reactor devices . The reactor devices are spaced slightly apart at their ends away from the seals . A front opening fits to size a portion of the top electrode that extends beyond the bottom electrode . A top plate clamps the reactors and provides downward pressure to maintain seals. The seals and surrounding area can also be sealed.

The fan situated in the housing provides for the circulation of ambient air between the individual reactor devices that are separated slightly by the seals . Stacking of the individual reactor devices in the housing allows each microchannel plasma array to be air cooled and also allows for the introduction of feedstock gases at the same end of all of the microplasma arrays and for the outflow of the desired plasma reaction product from the opposite end of all the reactor devices . Exemplary modules are designed to accommodate from 4 to 10 reactor wafer devices and representative values for the width W length L and height W of a four chip module are 2 3 3 respectively.

Arrays fabricated in experiments have channels that are 100 500 microns in width and 2 5 cm in length. However channel widths below 5 microns and channel lengths of at least tens of cm can be fabricated. Also arrays with hundreds or thousands of microchannel plasma devices can be produced in a single array.

Various flow patterns can be created as shown in in which feedstock gas is processed by fewer modules two in the example provided by before the gas flow stream enters an exit plenum in which the gaseous products are collected. The arrangement of allows for readily determining and setting the optimal total length of plasma channel through which a given feedstock gas travels before leaving the reactor. If the total microchannel path through which a feedstock gas molecule passes is beyond the optimal value then power is wasted and some fraction of the product molecules i.e. the desired reactor output may be destroyed chemically in the plasma or at the microchannel wall. A major benefit to the modular approach provided by the reactors of the invention is the ability to quickly configure reactors so as to provide a specific optimal processing length permitting quick configuration of low cost but reliable reactors without requiring a new reactor design for higher levels of product output. Instead individual array modules are readily configured into series or parallel arrangements to form larger reactors thereby achieving a specific grams per hour output and or a specific duration of treatment in a feedstock input gas. With conventional ozone generation technology reactor design often changes fundamentally as the reactor size is scaled.

An alternative geometric arrangement reactor module for operating microchannel plasma reactor chips in tandem is shown in . In this embodiment the individual microchannel array reactor chips wafers are mounted side by side onto a simple planar frame into which O rings or other vacuum seal are embedded. In this arrangement feedstock gas flows along a narrow channel that as shown by the end on view of the planar system in introduces feedstock gas into the same end of each microchannel plasma wafer. The output gas ozone is collected by a second channel connected to the opposite end of all of the chips . The system includes an input and output port at ends of the channels and . The reactor design of has a low profile form factor that is well suited for applications in which a flat profile is advantageous. Manufacturing the module embodiment of is straightforward and may prove more economical than other embodiments.

The system in includes a single water inlet and outlet and uses the reactor module of . illustrates an alternate ozone generator . A primary difference is multiple water outlets . Another difference is that a reactor module is provided for each of a plurality of ozone inputs corresponding to the number of water outlets. The reactor modules are from . Other features use reference numbers from corresponding parts in . A controller can activate deactivate and monitor the various components. The reactors of employ multiple point injection of ozone. In miniature reactor modules are each fed with oxygen produced from ambient air by the oxygen concentrator . In the reactor design of ozone produced by 5 modules is collected and injected into a water stream with the bubbler . Injectors are well known in the art and separate injectors can be dedicated to each microplasma reactor module if desired. In the incoming water stream is divided into four lines each of which is treated with the ozone produced by one or more dedicated reactor modules .

Ozone distribution systems are also provided by the invention. Preferred distribution systems are particularly useful in commercial applications of ozone that require low production rates of the molecule. Weight and volume are invariably priorities and lightweight distribution systems of the invention are very well suited for applications in food storage and the deodorization and decontamination of air. A fan of a miniature reactor module as illustrated in draws room air into the ozone reactor . On the side of the unit array opposite to where the fan is located a flat ozone disperser or sprayer is attached to or embedded within the unit array.

The microchannels in the sprayer plate can be formed in like manner to the microchannels in the microchannel plasma array wafers. For example channels are micromachined into alumina or other material by micropowder ablation and typical channel depths and widths are 30 250 m and 200 800 m respectively. As was the case with the linear channel arrays of low temperature plasma is produced within the channels. The microplasmas convert a fraction of the O2 in the feedstock gas into ozone.

As shown by the diagrams of the entire miniature ozone reactor module includes and is held within a flexible plastic block that has been molded to fit snugly to maintain seals between individual reactor array devices in the module. In an example module the thickness of the plastic structure is less than 2 cm and the finished generator assembly is lightweight. A series of food preservation tests have been completed that demonstrate the efficacy of the system of in extending shelf life. For example bread of various types is rendered completely unfit for human consumption when stored at room temperature for more than a few days. However when one of the miniature reactor module units of is located with the bread in a container at room temperature and the generator is turned on for only 2 minutes each day then the bread remains in pristine condition after two weeks of storage. Power was supplied by 9 or 12V batteries with a DC to AC inverter and transformer requiring only 1 to 2 Watts of power. Other studies being conducted show that the useful lifetime of high value food products such as mackerel and black pork popular in Asia is extended to one week by miniature reactors of the invention. Black pork normally spoils rapidly at room temperature. The cost of cooling this difficult to maintain product throughout shipping and distribution is prohibitive but shipping this and other food products at room temperature in sealed plastic bags incorporating ozone generators of the invention offers the opportunity to dramatically lower shipping costs.

The only electro mechanical component in the above discussed miniature reactor modules is the fan. In additional embodiments the fan is replaced with a microplasma actuator that generates the necessary flow. show a microchannel microplasma array reactor with plasma actuation that creates a slight gas flow through the microchannels . Large scale plasma actuators have been used in the past but the microplasma actuator shown in uses comparatively low voltage microchannel plasmas to draw air through the array without the need for any moving parts. The principle of operation of the actuator begins with the spatial offset inter electrode distance between top and bottom electrodes. When plasmas are ignited in the microchannels. a pressure gradient is produced in the region where the microchannel array overhangs the top electrode . This produces the desired result of drawing air through the array. Although the gas velocity that is produced by the actuator of is not at the level of that produced by the fan laboratory tests have shown that the plasma actuator does serve well as a replacement for the fan in the miniature ozone reactor. Aside from the elimination of moving parts. an additional advantage of the actuator is that it is readily integrated with the microchannel plasma array. Furthermore a module with a plasma actuator is lighter and thinner than the fan.

An encapsulated metal electrode is realized in the prototype with a bottom Al AlOplate. The prototype was fabricated from 500 m thick Al foil. After growing the aluminum oxide the thickness of the plate is about 600 m. Channels are formed in this plate via micromachining processes. Typical channels are between 200 m and 800 m wide and 30 m 250 m in depth. The channels are preferably coated with a dielectric. An example dielectric is a thin layer e.g. 25 m of Silicone. A top encapsulated Al AlOplate electrode is on top of the dielectric of the bottom plate. In the prototype the top plate was essentially square 4 cm 4 cm but a small tab was included that serves as an alignment aid when forming a stack of microchannel arrays to form a reactor modules. In a prototype a top plate was formed from 250 m thick Al foil having a thickness of 300 m 15 m . The top plate leaves a gap to expose the ends of the microchannels. In the prototype 5 mm of microchannel is exposed at each end which allows gas to enter and exit the microchannels in communication with other arrays in a module. Typical microchannels are 5 cm long and typical bottom plate dimensions are 7 cm long and 4 cm wide.

Testing data are shown in . shows testing data for a wafer module. Each experimental wafer was assigned a number e.g. EP163 . Each wafer was tested separately and then tested in a module reactor configuration that was consistent with . In the individual modules 1 5 were found to produce 1.2 1.6 g of ozone per hour. The 5 module reactor produced ozone at a rate of 5.5 7 g hr. The applied voltage during testing was 725 770VRMS 2.8 3.06 kVpp and the waveform was a 20 kHz sinusoid. For these tests the feedstock gas was oxygen at a pressure and flow rate of 5 psi and 4 liters per minute respectively.

Testing also showed that the optimal channel width for ozone production in this embodiment is between 200 m and 800 m. Devices having microchannels with a width of 1 mm had lower production than devices falling within the optimal range. Optimal channel depth is between 30 m and 250 m. Other examples include microchannels are in the range of 200 m to 400 m wide and in the range of 150 m to 250 m deep. However a wide range of channel depths widths and lengths are possible in all of the polymer ceramic glass and metal metal oxide embodiments as supported by prior patents patent applications and publications of the inventors.

Extensive testing of the miniature reactors of the invention has shown them to exhibit efficient ozone production. In other tests ozone modules having 10 12 unit microchannel plasma wafers each of which has 12 microchannels were fabricated. These modules each produced 2 3 grams of ozone hour but increasing the number of microchannels in each chip of the module to 24 increased the ozone production rate to 10 grams per hour. This value fits well the requirements for an 80 lb. washer in a commercial laundry.

While various embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described it should be understood that other modifications substitutions and alternatives are apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Such modifications substitutions and alternatives can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention which should be determined from the appended claims.
