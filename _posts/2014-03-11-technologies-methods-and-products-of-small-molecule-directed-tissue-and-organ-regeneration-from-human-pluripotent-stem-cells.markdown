title: Technologies, methods, and products of small molecule directed tissue and organ regeneration from human pluripotent stem cells
abstract: Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) hold great potential for restoring tissue and organ function, which has been hindered by inefficiency and instability of generating desired cell types through multi-lineage differentiation. This instant invention is based on the discovery that pluripotent hESCs maintained under defined culture conditions can be uniformly converted into a specific lineage by small molecule induction. Retinoic acid induces specification of neuroectoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs and triggers progression to neuronal progenitors and neurons efficiently. Similarly, nicotinamide induces specification of cardiomesoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs and triggers progression to cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes efficiently. This technology provides a large supply of clinically-suitable human neuronal or cardiac therapeutic products for CNS or myocardium repair. This invention enables well-controlled efficient induction of pluripotent hESCs exclusively to a specific clinically-relevant lineage for tissue and organ engineering and regeneration, cell-based therapy, and drug discovery.

This invention was made with government support under Grant No. AG 024496 and HD 056530 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The government has certain rights in this invention.

The present invention relates generally to the fields of human embryonic stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. Specifically this invention provides technologies methods and products for well controlled efficient direct induction of human pluripotent stem cells exclusively to a specific neural or cardiac lineage using small molecules for use in research drug screening tissue and organ engineering tissue and organ regeneration cell based therapy and clinics.

Human embryonic stem cells hESCs have the unconstrained capacity for long term stable undifferentiated growth in culture and the intrinsic potential for differentiation into all somatic cell types in the human body 1 2 . Derivation of hESCs essentially the in vitro representation of the pluripotent inner cell mass ICM or epiblast of the human blastocyst provides not only a powerful in vitro model system for understanding the human embryonic development but also a pluripotent reservoir for in vitro derivation of a large supply of disease targeted human somatic cells that are restricted to the lineage in need of repair 1 2 . However how to channel the wide differentiation potential of human pluripotent cells efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype has been a major challenge for both developmental study and clinical translation. Conventional approaches rely on multi lineage inclination of pluripotent cells through spontaneous germ layer differentiation which yields mixed populations of cell types that may reside in three embryonic germ layers and often makes desired differentiation not only inefficient but uncontrollable and unreliable as well 1 2 . Although such cells can differentiate spontaneously in vitro into cells of all germ layers by going through a multi lineage aggregate or embryoid body stage only a small fraction of cells pursue a given lineage. In those hESC derived multi lineage aggregates or embryoid bodies the simultaneous appearance of a substantial amount of widely divergent undesired cell types that may reside in three embryonic germ layers often makes the emergence of desired phenotypes not only inefficient but uncontrollable and unreliable as well. Following transplantation these pluripotent cell derived grafts tend to display not only a low efficiency in generating the desired cell types necessary for reconstruction of the damaged structure but also phenotypic heterogeneity and instability hence a high risk of tumorigenicity 1 2 . Currently the first generation of hESC derived cellular products contains variable levels of mixed populations of cell types including residual undifferentiated hESCs and partially differentiated cells that retain the capacity to proliferate and differentiate into unwanted cells raising a potential safety concern. In view of growing interest in the use of human pluripotent cells including artificially reprogrammed human induced pluripotent stem cells hiPS cells from non embryonic or adult cell sources teratoma formation and the emergence of inappropriate cell types have become a constant concern following transplantation 1 2 . Without a practical strategy to convert pluripotent cells direct into a specific lineage previous studies and profiling of pluripotent hESCs and their differentiating multi lineage aggregates have provided little implications to molecular controls in human embryonic development. Developing a novel practical approach that permits to channel the wide differentiation potential of human pluripotent cells efficiently and predictably to a desired phenotype is not only vital to harnessing the power of hESC biology for safe and effective cell based therapies but also crucial for unveiling the molecular and cellular cues that direct human embryogenesis.

The hESC lines initially were derived and maintained in co culture with growth arrested mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs 1 . Although several human feeder feeder free and chemically formulated culture systems have been developed for hESCs the elements necessary and sufficient for sustaining the self renewal of human pluripotent cells remain unsolved 1 . These exogenous feeder cells and biological reagents help maintain the long term stable growth of undifferentiated hESCs whereas mask the ability of pluripotent cells to respond to developmental signals. Therefore a defined culture system for maintenance of hESCs might not only render specification of clinically relevant early lineages directly from the pluripotent state without an intervening multi lineage germ layer or embryoid body stage but also allow identify the signaling molecules necessary and sufficient for inducing the cascade of organogenesis in a process that may emulate the human embryonic development 1 .

Current therapeutic approaches for a wide range of neurological diseases and injuries provide symptomatic relief but none of them change the prognosis of disease. Therefore there is a large unfulfilled need for cell based therapies to provide regeneration and replacement options to restore the lost nerve tissue and function. However to date lacking of a clinically suitable source of engraftable human stem progenitor cells with adequate neurogenic potential has been the major setback in developing safe and effective cell based therapies for restoring the damaged or lost central nervous system CNS structure and circuitry in a wide range of neurological disorders. The traditional sources of engraftable human stem cells with neural potential for transplantation therapies have been multipotent human neural stem cells hNSCs isolated directly from the CNS 3 . These CNS derived primary hNSCs are neuroepithelial like cells that are positive for nestin and can spontaneously differentiate into a mixed population of cells containing undifferentiated hNSCs neurons astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro and in vivo 3 . However cell therapy based on CNS tissue derived hNSCs has encountered supply restriction and difficulty to use in the clinical setting due to their declining plasticity with aging and limited expansion ability which makes it difficult to maintain a large scale and prolonged culture and potentially restricts the tissue derived hNSC as an adequate source for graft material in the clinical setting 3 . Despite some beneficial outcomes CNS derived hNSCs appeared to exert their therapeutic effect primarily by their non neuronal progenies through producing trophic and or neuroprotective molecules to rescue endogenous dying host neurons 1 3 . The engrafted tissue derived stem progenitor cells generated a small number of neurons that were insufficient to achieve the anticipated mechanism of neuron replacement in the damaged CNS 1 3 .

The genetically stable pluripotent hESCs proffer cures for a wide range of neurological disorders by supplying the diversity of human neuronal cell types in the developing CNS for regeneration and repair. Therefore they have been regarded as an ideal source to provide an unlimited supply of human neuronal cell types and subtypes for restoring the damaged or lost nerve tissue and function in CNS disorders. However realizing the developmental and therapeutic potential of hESCs has been hindered by the inefficiency and instability of generating desired cell types from pluripotent cells through multi lineage differentiation. Although neural lineages appear at a relatively early stage in differentiation 

To date the lack of a suitable human cardiac cell source has been the major setback in regenerating the damaged human myocardium either by endogenous cells or by cell based transplantation or cardiac tissue engineering 1 2 . In the adult heart the mature contracting cardiac muscle cells cardiomyocytes are terminally differentiated and unable to regenerate. Damaged or diseased cardiomyocytes are removed largely by macrophages and replaced by non functional cells or scar tissue. Although cell populations expressing stem progenitor cell markers have been identified in postnatal hearts the minuscule quantities and growing evidences indicating that they are not genuine heart cells and that they differentiate predominately to smooth muscle cells rather than functional contractile cardiomyocytes have caused skepticism if can potentially be harnessed for cardiac repair 1 2 . There is no evidence that stem precursor progenitor cells derived from other sources such as mesenchymal stem cells bone marrow cells umbilical cord stem cells cord blood cells patients heart tissue placenta or fat tissue are able to give rise to the contractile heart muscle cells following transplantation into the heart 1 2 . Therefore the need to regenerate or repair the damaged heart muscle myocardium has not been met by adult stem cell therapy either endogenous or via cell delivery in today s healthcare industry. Pluripotent hESCs proffer unique revenue to generate a large supply of cardiac lineage committed cells as human myocardial grafts for cell based therapy. Due to the prevalence of cardiovascular disease worldwide and acute shortage of donor organs or adequate human myocardial grafts there is intense interest in developing hESC based therapy for heart disease and failure 1 2 . The hESCs and their derivatives are considerably less immunogenic than adult tissues 1 2 . It is also possible to bank large numbers of human leukocyte antigen isotyped hESC lines so as to improve the likelihood of a close match 1 2 .

However realizing the therapeutic potential of hESCs has been hindered by the inefficiency and instability of generating cardiac cells from pluripotent cells through multi lineage differentiation. In hESC differentiating multi lineage aggregates embryoid body only a very small fraction of cells 1 4 spontaneously differentiate into cardiomyocytes 1 2 . Following mechanical isolation and immuno selection the small quantity of enriched cardiomyocytes could rescue the function of a damaged myocardium as a biological pacemaker following injection into the heart of animal models 1 2 . Although such hESC derived cardiomyocytes can attenuate the progression of heart failure in rodent models of acute myocardial infraction they are insufficient to restore heart function or to alter adverse remodeling of a chronic myocardial infarction model following transplantation 1 2 .

It can therefore be seen that there is a need to develop new techniques for well controlled efficiently channeling the wide differentiation potential of pluripotent hESCs exclusively and predictably to a large scale of neuronal lineage committed cells which is vital to providing a large supply of clinically suitable human neuronal therapeutic products across the spectrum of developmental stages in high purity and efficiency and with adequate neurogenic potential for neuronal repair against neurological diseases or injuries.

The present invention provides the techniques on direct conversion of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells hESCs uniformly into a specific clinically relevant lineage by small molecule induction.

The present invention provides the technique for efficient production of human neuronal progenitors and human neuronal cell types and subtypes in the developing CNS from pluripotent hESCs for neuronal regeneration and replacement therapies against a wide range of neurological disorders.

The present invention provides the technique for efficient production of human cardiac precursors and human cardiomyocytes from pluripotent hESCs for myocardium regeneration and replacement therapies against heart disease and failure.

Accordingly one embodiment of the invention is provided a method of identifying conditions for well controlled efficient induction of pluripotent hESCs maintained under a defined culture system that is capable of insuring the proliferation of undifferentiated hESCs exclusively to a specific clinically relevant lineage by small molecule induction.

Another preferred embodiment of the invention is provided a method of lineage specific differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to specialized functional cells by small molecule induction.

A particular embodiment of the invention is provided a method of using retinoic acid RA to induce the specification of neuroectoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs in a defined culture platform by promoting nuclear translocation of the neuronal specific transcription factor Nurr 1 and trigger the progression to human neuronal progenitors and human neurons in high efficiency purity and neuronal lineage specificity.

Another particular embodiment of the invention is provided a method of using nicotinamide NAM to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs in a defined culture platform by promoting the expression of the earliest cardiac specific transcription factor Csx Nkx2.5 and trigger the progression to cardiac precursors and beating cardiomyocytes in high efficiency purity and cardiac lineage specificity.

Pluripotent human embryonic stem cells hESCs hold great promise for restoring cell tissue and organ function. However realizing the developmental and therapeutic potential of hESCs has been hindered by the inefficiency and instability of generating desired cell types from pluripotent cells through multi lineage differentiation. This instant invention is based on the discovery that pluripotent hESCs maintained under the defined culture conditions i.e. feeder serum and conditioned medium free can be uniformly converted into a neural lineage or a cardiac lineage by simple provision of small molecules 1 2 4 11 . In particular retinoic acid RA was identified sufficient to induce the specification of neuroectoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs in a defined platform by promoting nuclear translocation of the neuronal specific transcription factor Nurr 1 and trigger the progression to human neuronal progenitors and human neurons of the developing CNS in high efficiency purity and neuronal lineage specificity 1 2 6 11 . Similarly nicotinamide NAM was identified sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs in a defined platform by promoting the expression of the earliest cardiac specific transcription factor Csx Nkx2.5 and trigger the progression to cardiac precursors and beating cardiomyocytes in high efficiency purity and cardiac lineage specificity 1 2 4 6 8 . This invention not only provides a large supply of clinical suitable human neuronal therapeutic products for neuron regeneration and replacement therapy against a wide range of neurological disorders and a large supply of clinical suitable human cardiac therapeutic products for myocardium regeneration and replacement therapy against heart disease and failure but also offers means for small molecule mediated direct control and modulation of the pluripotent fate of hESCs to a specific lineage when deriving an unlimited supply of clinically relevant lineages for regenerative medicine.

The hESCs were initially derived and maintained in co culture with growth arrested mouse embryonic fibroblasts MEFs that compromise the therapeutic potential of these cells because of the risk of transmitting pathogens altering genetic background and promoting the expression of immunogenic proteins 1 . Although several human feeder feeder free and artificially formulated defined culture systems have been suggested for hESCs the elements for sustaining undifferentiated growth remain unsolved 1 . These exogenous feeder cells and molecules help maintain the long term growth of undifferentiated hESCs while mask their ability to respond to differentiation inducing signals molecules. Therefore previously I sought to systematically reduce the needs for the growth of undifferentiated hESCs to minimal essential defined components and identified bFGF insulin ascorbic acid and laminin as the minimal essential components for sustaining the epiblast pluripotence of hESCs in a defined culture system serving as a platform for de novo derivation of clinically suitable hESCs and effectively directing such hESCs uniformly towards functional lineages with small molecule induction see US Patent Application Documents US20050233446 US20070010011 US20080241919 and PCT Patent Application Document WO 2005 065354 for inventions by Parsons Xuejun Huang .

In order to achieve uniformly conversion of pluripotent hESCs to a lineage specific fate I have used the defined culture system to screen the differentiation inducing effect of a variety of small molecules and growth factors on the pluripotent state of hESCs 1 4 5 7 . Although neural lineages appear at a relatively early stage in hESC differentiation treating hESC differentiated EBs with retinoic acid RA only slightly increased the low yield of neurons 1 . RA was not sufficient to induce the neuronal differentiation of undifferentiated hESCs maintained under previously reported conditions containing feeder cells or feeder cell conditioned media 1 . However I found that such defined conditions rendered small molecule RA sufficient to induce the specification of neuroectoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs that further progressed to human neuronal progenitors and neurons in the developing CNS with high efficiency by promoting nuclear translocation of the neuronal specific transcription factor Nurr1. a member of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor super family implicated in ventral neuronal development particularly ventral mesencephalic development and activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase TH gene the rate limiting step in dopaminergic DA neuronal differentiation 1 7 11 . Similarly the defined platform renders NAM sufficient to induce the specification of cardiomesoderm direct from the pluripotent state of hESCs by promoting the expression of the earliest cardiac specific transcription factor Csx Nkx2.5 and triggering progression to cardiac precursors and beating cardiomyocytes efficiently 1 4 5 8 . This compound was not sufficient when applied to hESCs aggregated embryoid bodies EBs or hESCs maintained under previously reported conditions containing feeder cells or feeder cell conditioned media 1 4 7 . This instant invention provides a system for a well controlled efficient approach to specify pluripotent human cells differentiation exclusively to a clinically relevant lineage by small molecule induction as illustrated in .

As illustrated in upon exposure of undifferentiated hESCs maintained in the defined culture to RA 10 M all the cells within the colony underwent morphology changes to large differentiated cells that ceased expressing pluripotence associated markers e.g. Oct 4 and began expressing neuroectoderm associated markers e.g. HNK1 AP2 and TrkC Stage 1 Human Neuroectodermal Cells 1 7 . These large differentiated cells continued to multiply and the colonies increased in size proceeding spontaneously to express the early neuronal marker III tubulin but not markers associated with other lineages including Pdx1 AFP and insulin endoderm Nkx2.5 mesoderm and GFAP glial cells . The more mature neuronal marker Map 2 began to appear in areas of the colonies where cells had piled up . These differentiating hESCs then formed neuroblasts that uniformly positive for III tubulin in suspension Stage 2 Human Neuronal Progenitor Cells hESC I hNuPs 1 7 . Upon removal of bFGF and after permitting the neuroblasts to attach III tubulin and Map 2 expressing exuberantly neurite bearing cells and pigmented cells typical of those in the CNS began to appear with a drastic increase in efficiency when compared to similarly cultured cells derived from untreated embryoid bodies EBs as control Stage 3 Human Neuronal Cells in the developing CNS 1 7 5 . Such preparations could also be dissociated with trypsin and maintained as a monolayer wherein the RA induced cells continued to pursue a neuronal fate as suggested by their III tubulin and Map 2 immunopositivity and the absence of markers associated with other neural cells such as glial lineage as indicated by no cell expressing GFAP and MBP 1 7 . Nurr1 a member of the orphan nuclear hormone receptor super family has been implicated in neuronal development particularly ventral mesencephalic development and activation of the tyrosine hydroxylase TH gene the rate limiting step in catecholaminergic and dopaminergic neuronal differentiation. Interestingly in undifferentiated hESCs Nurr1 localizes to the cell surface and cytoplasm consistent with its being inactive . However upon exposure of the hESCs to RA Nurr1 translocated to the nucleus coincident with the appearance of the neuroectodermal cells and continued to assume its strong expression and nuclear localization at the later process bearing neuronal stages . Accordingly a large proportion of these hESC derived neuronal cells began to express TH consistent with the early stages of acquiring catecholaminergic or dopaminergic potential. Similarly a proportion of Map 2 cells began to express Hb9 and Lim3 markers implicated in the early stages of motor neuron development another ventrally located neuronal population. Sonic hedgehog Shh appeared to promote the proliferation of those ventral neuronal cells .

As illustrated in upon exposure of undifferentiated hESCs maintained in the defined culture to NAM 10 mM all the cells within the colony underwent morphology changes to large differentiated cells that down regulated the expression of pluripotence associated markers e.g. Oct 4 and began expressing the earliest marker for heart precursor Csx Nkx2.5 but not markers associated with other lineages including Pdx1 and AFP endoderm and Map 2 GFAP Pax6 and HNK1 ectoderm Stage 1 Human Cardiomesodermal Cells 1 4 5 . Increased intensity of Nkx2.5 was usually observed in areas of the colonies where cells began to pile up . These differentiating hESCs then formed cardioblasts that uniformly expressed Nkx2.5 in suspension Stage 2 Human Cardiac Precursor Cells 1 4 5 . After permitting the cardioblasts to attach and further treating them with NAM beating cardiomyocytes began to appear after withdrawal of NAM with a drastic increase in efficiency Stage 3 Human Cardiomyocytes and Cardiovascular Cells 1 4 5 . Cells within the beating cardiospheres expressed markers characteristic of cardiomyocytes 1 4 5 . The cardiomyocytes can retain their strong contractility for over 3 months. Electrical profiles of the cardiomyocytes confirmed their contractions to be strong rhythmic impulses reminiscent of the p QRS T complexes seen from body surface electrodes in clinical electrocardiograms 4 . Cardiac specific transcription factor Csx Nkx2.5 is an evolutionally conserved homeobox transcription factor indispensable for normal cardiac development. The onset and pattern of early Nkx2.5 expression roughly coincide with the timing and area of cardiac specification and Nkx2.5 gene continues to be expressed through development in the heart 1 . Expression of Nkx2.5 is the earliest marker for heart precursor cells in all vertebrates so far examined and is essential for proper cardiac septation and formation maturation of electrical conduction system 1 .

Unlike the two prototypical neuroepithelial like Nestin positive human neural stem cells hNSCs either derived from hESCs or CNS this novel human neuronal progenitors hESC I hNuPs which have acquired a neuroectodermal identity through RA induction of pluripotent hESCs in vitro 1 7 do not express Nestin but assume uniformly strong expression and nuclear localization of Nurr 1 9 . Although CNS D hNSCs which have acquired their neurectodermal identity through in vivo developmental processes show moderate expression and nuclear localization of Nurr 1 in hESC D hNSCs Nurr1 localizes to the cell surface and cytoplasm suggesting its being inactive 9 . Upon removal of bFGF and after permitting to attach hESC I hNuPs yielded exclusively neurons that expressed neuronal marker III tubulin and co expressed Map 2 with a drastic increase in efficiency 94 when compared to the yields of III tubulin positive neurons differentiated under similar conditions from hESC D hNSCs 6 or CNS D hNSCs 13 9 . No other neural lineages such as glial cells e.g. GFAP positive astrocytes and MBP positive oligodendrocytes or non neural cells were observed 1 7 . Such neuronal cell preparations could also be dissociated with trypsin and maintained as a monolayer . Accordingly a large proportion of these hESC derived neuronal cells began to express markers associated with ventrally located neuronal populations such as TH DA neurons and Hb9 Lim3 Isl1 motor neurons 1 7 9 .

Under protocols presently employed in the field hESC derived cellular products consist of a heterogeneous population of mixed cell types including fully differentiated cells high levels of various degrees of partially differentiated or uncommitted cells and low levels of undifferentiated hESCs posing a constant safety concern when administered to humans. In contrast hESC I hNuPs consist of a homogeneous population of human neuronal progenitor cells with potential to yield high levels of neuronal cells 94 . Accessory cells e.g. other neural cells and inappropriate cells e.g. undifferentiated hESCs cytotoxic cells and non neural cells are undetectable in the novel hESC derived cellular product. hESC I hNuPs yielded neurons efficiently and exclusively as they did not differentiate into glial cells suggesting that these Nurr 1 positive hESC I hNuPs are a novel more lineage specific neuronal progenitor than the prototypical neuroepithelial like Nestin positive hNSCs. The small molecule direct induction protocol yields nuclear Nurr 1 positive human neuronal progenitors and neurons of the developing CNS direct form the pluripotent state of hESCs in high efficiency purity and neuronal lineage specificity therefore may minimize the risks of teratoma and ectopic tissue formation by eliminating the presence of undifferentiated hESCs and non neural inappropriate cell types. This invention will dramatically increase the clinical efficacy for graft dependent neuron replacement regeneration and safety of hESC derived cellular products for CNS repair. Similarly the small molecule direct induction protocol yields human cardiac precursors and cardiomyocytes in high efficiency purity and cardiac lineage specificity therefore may minimize the risks of teratoma and ectopic tissue formation by eliminating the presence of undifferentiated hESCs and non cardiac inappropriate cell types. This invention will dramatically increase the clinical efficacy for graft dependent myocardium replacement regeneration and safety of hESC derived cellular products for cardiovascular repair.

MicroRNAs miRNAs are emerging as important regulators of stem cell pluripotence and differentiation 8 10 . MiRNAs are small evolutionarily conserved non coding RNAs that modulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and promoting mRNA degradation. MiRNAs act as the governors of gene expression networks thereby modify complex cellular phenotypes in development or disorders. miRNA microarray profile analysis showed that the expression of two most prominent clusters of pluripotence associated miRNAs hsa miR 302 family and hsa miR 371 372 373 was drastically down regulated upon lineage induction by small molecules 8 10 10 . The cluster of hsa miR 302 family which had a profile of the highest expression in pluripotent hESCs was completely silenced in hESC I hNuPs average 550 fold of decrease 8 10 10 suggesting that hESC I hNuPs unlike previous hESC derived cellular products through multi lineage differentiation do not contain any residual pluripotent cells. A novel group of abundant miRNA clusters in pluripotent hESCs including hsa miR 17 20 221 222 1280 1308 3178 3141 and 4298 was found to be significantly down regulated in hESC I hNuPs albeit to a less extent 8 10 10 . The sensitivity specificity robustness and precision of assays to characterize hESC derived cellular products by employing genomic miRNA profiling are sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance of homogeneity and identity of hESC derived cellular products therefore safety and efficacy when administered to humans.

A group of miRNAs displayed an expression pattern of up regulation upon neural induction by RA and down regulation upon cardiac induction by NAM 8 . Among the first group of neural driving miRNAs neural specific miRNA group 1 the clusters of hsa miR 10 family let 7 family let 7a c d e f g 21 100 125b 23 family and 4324 contribute to the highest increased expression profile in RA induced neural differentiation 8 . Notably the expression of hsa miR 10 family was silenced in undifferentiated hESCs and displayed a drastic increase average 95 fold in neuroectoderm induced hESC I hNuPs 8 10 . The miR 10 genes locate within the Hox clusters of developmental regulators and coexpressed with a set of Hox genes to repress the translation of Hox transcripts 8 . The enhancer of the mouse Hoxb 1 gene which controls the RA response and regulates gene expression predominantly in neuroectoderm contains a retinoic acid response element RARE that is not only involved in the ectopic response to RA but is also essential for establishing the early Hoxb 1 expression pattern in embryonic development 8 . The drastic expression increase of hsa miR 10 in hESC I hNuPs suggested that RA might induce the expression of Hox genes and co expression of Hox miRNA hsa miR 10 to silence pluripotence associated genes and hsa miR 302 to drive a neuroectodermal phenotype and a neuronal fate in hESC I hNuPs 8 10 . The let 7 miRNAs down regulate pluripotence associated genes such as myc and lin28 8 10 . These data suggested that hESC I hNuPs have acquired a neuronal identity by silencing pluripotence associated miRNAs and inducing high levels of expression of miRNAs linked to regulating neuronal development and function consistent with their high neurogenic ability. A second group of miRNAs had an expression pattern of up regulation upon neural induction but was not significantly affected upon cardiac induction 8 . Among the second group of neural driving miRNAs the clusters of hsa miR 181 family 9 125a 5p 99 family 26 family 30b and 335 contribute to the highest increased expression profile in RA induced neural differentiation 8 . These data suggested that a distinct set of miRNAs many of which were not previously linked to neural development and function contribute to initiate the neural fate switch and neuronal progression of pluripotent hESCs 8 10 .

A group of miRNAs displayed an expression pattern of up regulation upon cardiac induction by NAM and down regulation upon neural induction by RA 8 . Among the first group of cardiac driving miRNAs the clusters of hsa miR 1268 574 5p and 92 family contribute to the highest increased expression profile in NAM induced cardiac differentiation 8 . A second group of miRNAs had an expression pattern of up regulation upon cardiac induction but was not significantly affected upon neural induction 8 . Among the second group of cardiac driving miRNAs the clusters of hsa miR 320 family 1975 1979 103 and 107 contribute to the highest increased expression profile in NAM induced cardiac differentiation 8 . These data suggested that a novel set of miRNAs many of which were not previously linked to cardiac development and function contribute to initiate the cardiac fate switch and cardiac progression of pluripotent hESCs 8 .

The analysis of genome scale miRNA profiling identified novel sets of development initiating small molecule miRNAs upon small molecule induced cardiac and neural specification of hESCs 8 . A unique set of pluripotence associated miRNAs was down regulated while novel sets of distinct cardiac and neural driving miRNAs were up regulated upon small molecule induced lineage specific differentiation of hESCs including silencing of pluripotence associated hsa miR 302 family and a drastic expression increase of neural driving Hox miRNA hsa miR 10 family upon RA exposure 8 . This invention opens a new dimension of small molecule mediated direct control and modulation of hESC pluripotent fate when deriving an unlimited supply of clinically relevant lineages for regenerative therapies. This invention enables well controlled efficient derivation of a large supply of robust human stem progenitor precursor cells and specialized mature functional cells from pluripotent hESCs that can be used in the clinical setting for tissue and organ regeneration and repair.

To address whether this novel human neuronal progenitors hESC I hNuPs could be safely engrafted in the brain and could migrate and retain their neurogenic ability in vivo hESC I hNuPs were transplanted into the cerebral ventricles of newborn mice. This route allows excellent access to the subventricular zone SVZ a secondary germinal zone from which cells widely migrate and respond to appropriate regional developmental cues. After at least 3 months post grafting the mice were sacrificed and processed for histological and immunocytochemical ICC analysis. Transplanted hESC I hNuPs engrafted and migrated widely and yielded well dispersed and well integrated human neurons exclusively at a high prevalence including nurr1 positive DA neurons within neurogenic regions of the brain demonstrating their potential for neuron regeneration replacement cell therapy 9 10 . No graft overgrowth formation of teratomas or neoplasms or appearance of non neuronal cell types was observed following engraftment.

The invention enables developing human pluripotent stem cell derived therapeutic products and supplies including patient specific human stem precursor progenitor cells disease targeted specialized human cells and cell or bio engineered human tissues and replacement organs that can be used in the clinical setting for repair reconstruction replacement of the damaged human body structure and circuitry as well as developing technologies and methods of human tissue and organ regeneration including high throughput and high content assays analytical and manipulation tools therapeutic strategies and tissue and organ engineering approaches.
