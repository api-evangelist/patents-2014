The following discussion of embodiments of the present technology will begin with a description of the terminology used herein followed by a discussion of the structure of the MCRM and then followed by a description of the operation of the MCRM .

Cellular Phone A mobile phone or mobile also called cell phone or hand phone is an electronic device used for mobile telecommunications mobile telephony messaging or data transmission over a cellular network of specialized base stations known as cell sites. As opposed to a radio telephone a cell phone offers full duplex communication automated calling to and paging from a public land mobile network PLMN and handoff handover during a phone call when the user moves from one cell base station coverage area to another. Cell phones connect to a cellular network consisting of switching points and base stations cell sites owned by a mobile network operator. In addition to the standard voice function current mobile phones may support many additional services and accessories such as Short Message Service SMS for text messaging email packet switching for access to the Internet gaming Bluetooth infrared iRDA camera with video recorder and Multi media Messaging Service MMS for sending and receiving photos and video MP3 player radio and GPS.

Modem A modem is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. Modems meant to access a network of base stations that form a cellular network are cellular modems. Modems that use mobile phone channels GPRS UMTS HSPA EVDO WiMax etc. are known as cellular modems. Cellular modems can be embedded inside a laptop or appliance or they can be external to it. External cellular modems are datacards and cellular routers. Modems that do not use mobile phone spectrum are known as non cellular modems.

Wi Fi Wi Fi is a trademark of the Wi Fi Alliance that may be used with certified products that belong to a class of wireless local area network WLAN devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. Current standards allow for 144 Mb s and 802.16m allows for 1 Gb s. Because of the close relationship with its underlying standard the term Wi Fi is often used as a synonym for IEEE 802.11 technology. Wi Fi is a local area network that uses high frequency radio signals to transmit and receive data over distances of a few hundred feet uses Ethernet protocol.

Wi Max Wi Max is a telecommunications technology that provides wireless transmission of data using a variety of transmission modes from point to multipoint links to portable and fully mobile Internet access. The technology provides up to 10 Mbit s broadband speed without the need for cables. Also Wi Max is a standard of interoperable implementations of IEEE 802.16 wireless networks similar to the way the term Wi Fi is used for interoperable implementations of the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN standard. Wi Max is a long range system covering many kilometers that uses licensed or unlicensed spectrum to deliver a point to point connection to the Internet and uses a mechanism based on connections between the base station and the user device.

LAN A local area network LAN is a computer network covering a small physical area like a home office or small group of buildings such as a school or an airport. The defining characteristics of LANs in contrast to wide area networks WANs include their usually higher data transfer rates smaller geographic area and lack of a need for leased telecommunication lines. In other words data communications network that is geographically limited typically to a 1 km radius allows easy interconnection of terminals microprocessors and computers within adjacent buildings. An Ethernet is an example of a LAN. Because the network is known to cover only a small area optimizations can be made in the network signal protocols that permit data rates up to 100 Mb s. Currently the Ethernet allows for 1 Gb s. 

WLAN A wireless local area network WLAN links devices via a wireless distribution method typically spread spectrum or OFDM radio and usually provides a connection through an access point to the wider Internet. This gives users the mobility to move around within a local coverage area and still be connected to the network.

Ethernet Ethernet is a family of frame based computer networking technologies for local area networks LANs . It defines a number of wiring and signaling standards for the Physical Layer of the OSI networking model through means of network access at the Media Access Control protocol a sub layer of Data Link Layer and a common addressing format. Ethernet is standardized as IEEE 802.3. The combination of the twisted pair versions of Ethernet for connecting end systems to the network along with the fiber optic versions for site backbones is the most wide spread wired LAN technology.

UART A universal asynchronous receiver transmitter UART is a type of asynchronous receiver transmitter a piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with other communication standards such as EIA RS 232. A UART is usually an individual or part of an integrated circuit used for serial communications over a computer or peripheral device serial port.

RIL A Radio Interface Layer RIL is a layer in an operating system which provides an interface to the hardware s radio and modem on for example a mobile phone. A RIL is a key component of a mobile OS. The RIL enables wireless voice or data applications to communicate with one or more modems on a given device. The RIL provides the system interface between the OS and the radio protocol stack used by the wireless modem hardware. The RIL therefore also allows OEMs to integrate a variety of modems into their equipment by providing this interface.

The RIL comprises two separate components a RIL driver which processes device specific AT commands and events and a RIL proxy which manages requests from the multiple clients to the single RIL driver. Except for PPP connections all interaction between the OS and the device radio stack is via the RIL. In an embodiment PPP connections initially use the RIL to establish the connection but then bypass the RIL to connect directly to the virtual serial port assigned to the modem. In essence the RIL accepts and converts all direct service requests from the upper layers e.g. TAPI into commands supported and understood by the modem. Traditionally in a monolithic mobile phone device the RIL is physically wired via a serial channel to the cellular modem.

The RIL of the UAE implements the wireless connection between the UAE device application processor and its ancillary components or processes and the physically separate cellular modem located in the MCRM wearable device. In an embodiment the connection between the UAE devices and the wearable device in the MCRM utilizes standard Bluetooth profiles and bypasses the RIL. In another embodiment the MCRM includes the RIL.

In one embodiment the UAE device is not equipped with a cellular modem.

Further the communications link may be any number of links such as but not limited to WiFi Wi Max and WLAN. Moreover the connection between the MCRM and the UAE Device is accomplished over the Internet or a via PAN circuit. In one embodiment the cellular radio modem includes a software defined radio .

In one embodiment the software defined radio is configured to operate in a mode equivalent to that of a selected cellular service. In another embodiment the software defined radio is reconfigurable in the MCRM to operate in a mode equivalent to that of a selected cellular service provider. In one embodiment a buzzer such as a vibrating element is used to alert that an incoming call has been received by the cellular radio modem via a command from the controller .

In another embodiment of the present technology the information of the MCRM includes user designated phone numbers and look up table shown in . Smart card includes information that includes user designated phone numbers shown in and a look up table shown in . In a further embodiment user designated phone numbers and look up table may exist in Flash Memory and be synchronized via a synchronization agent in controller with cloud services .

In an embodiment Flash Memory may be used in preference to smart card for storing personal information that may not require strong security e.g. phone books preferences etc .

In one embodiment the memory of the MCRM includes rule . While in another embodiment the smart card is configured for accepting and storing rule . Thus rules and other configuration information may be located in the MCRM s internal memory or onboard the smart card . Rule includes but is not limited to at least one of the following making a modem selection based on needs of the service request making a modem selection based on a user selectable Quality of Service QoS metric making a modem selection based on a conservation of spectrum metric making a modem selection based on a user preference making a modem selection based on current throughput making a modem selection based cost to the user or cellular service provider making a modem selection based observed bandwidth usage of the requesting application or service and making a modem selection based on a pre programmed methodology to automate a procedure without user interaction.

In another embodiment the rule includes monitoring a QoS metric available from the selected modem and performing a switching function to automatically reconnect communications service to a selected server from a first selected modem to a second selected modem when the QoS metric passes a specified metric threshold. For example one QoS metric might be bandwidth availability of a given path. In this case while the system may initiate a connection on what is expected to be a well performing path if the actual bandwidth available is actually much lower than the theoretical expected bandwidth the system may choose to switch to a path which while having a lower theoretical maximum bandwidth might in practice be less congested hence offering greater performance to User .

In one embodiment the conservation of spectrum metric includes selecting a non cellular modem whenever possible according to Internet availability of a connection to the service request and Internet availability via the non cellular modem connection.

In another embodiment the conservation of spectrum metric includes selecting non cellular modems for a specific communications service according to a sharing agreement between the specific communications service and a user s selected cellular service.

In another embodiment the connection manager whose rules are contained within Rule is able to create an optimal connection strategy based on the information in Rule and the preferences defined by the user in Data . In absence of distinct user preferences in Data the connection manager creates an optimal connection strategy based on Rule . The connection manager is able to dynamically adjust the connection strategy based on measurements of real time connection performance.

In an embodiment the connection manager is able to determine cost of service from a number of available providers and institute Least Cost Routing. One example of the broadcast of rating information is Network Charge Rate and Advice of Charge.

In another embodiment the connection manager may have a fixed cost for a set of service providers that each of which offer different service levels e.g. GSM EDGE v. UMTS or HSPA . In this case the system is able to maximize performance for User in the execution of Service Request by selecting the best available theoretically performing service given cost is a static factor. Conversely the system may apply Least Cost Routing in this situation on behalf of a service provider whose business is based on specific roaming relationships and hence select a path that respects the partner that service provider has indicated offers more economical terms for roaming.

In another embodiment the connection manager may choose to route an application via given path cellular or non cellular based on observed application bandwidth requirements. That is the connection manager has access to information locally or via a network element for example a rating service on the performance of a given application on the UAE . The connection manager is able to factor this information into the overall connection selection for the Service Request . It is possible also for the connection manager to block access to a given path based on this information. In a further embodiment the MCRM may log and submit observed behavior of applications as it relates to data usage or other factors back to the rating service in order to formulate a more accurate rating. These ratings could be processed and provided in a way so as to inform users of an application s data requirements.

In a situation where User pays for data services in an a la carte fashion e.g. by the amount of data consumed it may be useful for User to be able to select applications they use based on the amount of data consumed. That is in the case where a multitude of applications that provide a given service the User may wish to choose one that does so most efficiently. As such the MCRM and rating service may provide such information to other services that provide these applications for User s consumption.

In another embodiment the MCRM is able to inform the user of the status of an application with respect to use or need of bandwidth and be able to surface recommendations on appropriate path to network based on managing User s bandwidth use limits on accounts associated with the various paths available e.g. cellular and non cellular . Furthermore the connection manager is able to help the user manage to a data service subscription limit and or minimize their subscription costs by routing and or blocking bandwidth intensive applications away from or toward low cost or unrestricted paths.

Identity transfer module allows MCRM to be linked with a second MCRM. Such a linking would allow transfer of a user s personal information suitable for use in commercial transactions physical tap or electronically and communications operations from MCRM to a second MCRM. Identity transfer module may be a physical or logical component of MCRM or may exist in other components of MCRM . For example the functions of identity transfer module may be carried out by controller using smart cards and or in conjunction with communication components of MCRM .

In one embodiment identity transfer module is capable of receiving a request from a second mobile communications resource manager to transfer said user s personal information suitable for use in commercial transactions physical tap or electronically and communication operations stored on the smart cards and or . Alternatively for enhanced security the identity transfer operation may be limited to being initiated by the currently active MCRM . Such information may include user credentials contact information financial account information etc. Upon receiving the request identity transfer module may then transfer the user s personal information suitable for use in commercial transactions physical tap or electronically and communication operations to the second mobile communications resource manager. Such a transfer may take place using the physical communication components of MCRM . The transfer may occur using a wireless connection such as personal area network PAN or for increased security Near Field Communications modem . In one embodiment the transfer does not require a physical element of MCRM to be transferred to the second MCRM. For example a SIM card or smart card may not be required to be physically transferred from MCRM to the second MCRM for the transfer and pairing to take place. In one embodiment both MCRM devices share common information and credentials but only the currently active MCRM has the appropriate security token to enable the proper operation of the MCRM device. In this case the identity transfer would be accomplished by simply transferring the security token from the MCRM to the second MCRM thus enabling the second MCRM and disabling the originally active device. Such disabling may or may not delete information form the originally active device.

In one embodiment the receiving of a request to transfer and the actual transfer will not occur until after MCRM physically contacts the second MCRM. For example simply tapping the two devices together may initiate the identity transfer. A region on the exterior of MCRM may be designated as the point of physical contact to initiate the pairing. An embodiment that requires the two devices to be physically tapped together ensures that both devices are physically proximate to each other thus ensuring that the pairing does not take place with a remote MCRM.

In another embodiment a user may choose to authorize services to transfer their cloud based personal information into a second MCRM . Thus a user might be able to replace a lost or stolen device without having to manually reconfigure a new device. Similarly a user might have more than a single MCRM device and be able to effectively copy or clone their device configuration items into other devices owned by User .

In one embodiment after the transfer of the user s personal information suitable for use in commercial transactions physical tap or electronically and communication operations is complete the user s information is removed from the smart card. This removal ensures that there are not two MCRM devices that are simultaneously storing the same information. In alternate embodiment the two MCRM devices may contain similar User information i.e. configuration information and credentials but their accessibility and ability for them to be utilized to effect communications or transactions may be restricted without the appropriate authentication token it would be this token that could be transferred between MCRMs with the identity transfer module not the actual user data. Thus a user can be confident that the second device is the only active MCRM device able to function with the user s information. Such a pairing and transfer of information may be desirable for various reasons. Different MCRM devices may have different functionality or may have different form factors. MCRM device may be paired so that a user may switch to a second MCRM device for fashion reasons.

MCRM may be employed in a system for tagging operations. Modern technology provides for near field communication tags. For example an RFID tag may be read by a tag reader when the tag reader is in close proximity to an RFID tag. In one embodiment MCRM comprises a tag reader. It should be appreciated that tags and tag readers are not limited to RFID tags but may be other electronic tag elements that require close proximity of the tag element and tag reader to operate.

In one embodiment MCRM is placed into proximity with a passive or active NFC compatible tag element. MCRM may then receive or read data from the tag element. MCRM may then contact a tagging service to receive more data regarding the tag element. For example the data received from the tag element may be a URL that points MCRM to data or a service on the Internet. MCRM may then collect additional data from the user. This additional data may be data related to a context of the tag element and is transmitted to either the tag element or the tagging service. Such additional data may be user generated and may be collected from the user by the user inputting data via an interface located on MCRM or an interface associated with UAE device . In one embodiment MCRM also transmits data related to the user s identity to the tag element.

An example of tagging may be a user visiting a retail establishment such as a restaurant. The user may enter the restaurant complete a dining experience. The restaurant may have a tag element or a plurality of tag elements. At the end of the dining experience the user may decide if the user likes or dislikes the restaurant. The restaurant may have two tag elements one associated with likes and one associated with dislikes. The user may then place MCRM into contact with the appropriate tag element. Data is then transferred from MCRM to a tagging service regarding the user s decision. The user may then be prompted to additional data such as comments or reviews regarding the restaurant. Such information may be added using MCRM or a UAE device.

In the above example the user may also employ a tag element in the restaurant before the user dines in the restaurant. The tag element may automatically direct the MCRM to a tagging service which provides information regarding the restaurant such as user reviews.

In one embodiment the tagging service may be located on the Internet and may host data as part of the tagging service or may refer the MCRM to a third party. For example the tagging service may direct the MCRM to www.yelp.com or a similar website regarding user reviews of retail establishments or the like.

Referring now to a block diagram of an MCRM is shown in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. In one embodiment the circuit assembly includes at least one of the following a USB controller coupled with a USB connection providing power an on board rechargeable battery at least one internal antenna for each distinct radio present and a radio transmission authorization module .

In one embodiment the internal antennas are arranged to facilitate a compact MCRM and avoid interference such that the user can wear or easily secure the MCRM to the user s clothing or accessories.

In an embodiment user controllable buttons or switch gear are provided to facilitate specific functions. These buttons may take the form of any switch like electronics component such as but not limited to thin film fingerprint sensor traditional switchgear or touch button. These functions can be but are not limited to device pairing volume control power switch on off wallet activation and reset device.

In one embodiment the logical authorization to pair device module includes but is not limited to the following physical and logical components a single external user controlled button an internal microcontroller and firmware . The single user controlled button and the associated firmware in the host controller allows the device to be placed into a mode whereby the PAN radio will attempt to locate compatible devices with which to exchange pairing information as master or host . In an alternate embodiment user interface can also be utilized to control the pairing behavior of the MCRM .

In one embodiment a user controllable button shall enable the user to receive or initiate calls using a number of user designated phone numbers registered in the phone book resident on the MCRM and or the smart card or internal Flash Memory . The initiation of calls shall require in a further embodiment a wired headset and the ability of the system to provide voice recognition to facilitate the selection of a called party. Audio communication interface may include a 3.5 mm jack used to accommodate a wired headset which includes both speakers and a microphone. In this sense the MCRM can itself be operated as a phone device by user without the need of an associated user interface provided by a UAE .

In one embodiment a user controllable button shall be provided to allow the user to perform a reset of the internal host controller in the event that the device becomes inoperable.

In an embodiment a user controllable switch or switches for example a rocker switch can be provided to control the volume of the associated wired headset by modifying the output power of the audio module contained in the cellular radio .

In an embodiment the functions of any or all of the user controllable buttons can be duplicated in a graphical user interface that is provided via an associated and connected UAE . In a further embodiment functions may be integrated into few physical buttons that change in relation to the internal state of the device and the context. For example a single user controllable button could be provided to initiate a call from the idle state and end a call from the in call state.

In one embodiment the power connection is configured for drawing power from a power source a peripheral or host power source. In one embodiment the on board rechargeable battery is configured for powering the circuit assembly during the communications operations. In one embodiment the communications operations include commercial transactions or data exchange between MCRM and connected UAE s . Further the internal antennas are configured for providing transmission and reception in the various operating RF frequency bands of the internal radios.

The assembly of components of the present technology has a very small footprint that can be placed into a wearable or small accessory for consumers. A primary operation of the MCRM is to separate the cellular radio and advanced smart card radio modem and associated subscriber module or smart card from the specific UAE device freeing the UAE device from the additional Bill of Materials BOM cost of additional radios and the need to pass stringent FCC device approvals before being able to be marketed and sold.

As stated herein further functional components of the MCRM include a near field communication system including the near field communication modem on chip microcontroller architecture and an audio in out connection to support an externally connected headset.

The near field communication system on chip microcontroller architecture addresses near field communication use cases in conjunction with user specified information and or unique identifiers stored in the non volatile memory within the MCRM or other memory. Near field communication will also be used in device pairing processes to provide for added security or to select a particular UAE for use. For example the user can touch the MCRM to an in car navigation and control screen that supports hands free mobile telephony environment to switch to it or activate a connection to it. NFC device pairing capabilities could be used in lieu of or in conjunction with the single external user controlled button . Radio Frequency ID RFID tags or other similar NFC readable technology may be required on the UAE s to support out of band pairing or UI activation the passing of control from one UAE to another by tapping the MCRM to the new controlling UAE . Furthermore the NFC system may be used to provide support for mobile wallet use cases commercial transactions and or social tagging interacting with active or passive NFC compatible elements and communicating with remote services to publish various forms of information about the User and entities or .

The audio in out connection supports an externally connected headset. A codec microcontroller may be included in the internal assembly to support and or improve audio quality over the wired interface e.g. noise cancellation technology . In addition to or in lieu of an audio in out connection Bluetooth radio in the assembly can simultaneously support a paired wireless headset. The inclusion of an audio in out and or wireless headset connection allows the user to carry on a conversation when moving outside the range of the linked external device used to initiate or receive the call as well as maintain one connection point for audio when moving from one externally linked device to another externally linked device.

The insertion of a wired headset into the audio in out connector shall cause the device to redirect audio to the wired headset from the current wireless connection. This change in audio path shall not affect the control channel used to establish the call and the user interface shall be maintained on the originating appliance until connection that appliance is lost. In any event the user may terminate a call in progress from the user interface on the MCRM .

Further in embodiments of the present technology the primary functional software components of the MCRM includes and is not limited to the following a user controlled as well as operator or manufacturer administrative controlled applications to read and write data to the smart card Memory or second secure element which can be either through over the air methods or through a linked external device applications or abstraction layers that allow access to hardware elements on the MCRM from associated appliances mobile radio controller PAN radio controller connection manager memory manager and user interface controller. The software or firmware of the MCRM shall be updatable via local connection or over the air methods. Additionally the software supports the ability to configure secure and or encrypted credentials and personal information via local connections and or over the air methods.

In embodiments of the present technology the MCRM described herein performs a variety of functions and enables a wide variety of activities from telephone calls to completing financial transactions to the operation of an assortment of electronic devices.

For example in one embodiment the MCRM described herein enables a UAE device in close proximity to the MCRM to contact a remotely located supplier of goods or services and make a purchase. This purchase is charged to a funding source under the control of the user via a wireless modem resident in the UAE Device utilizing credentials resident within the MCRM . The contact may be made via a cellular connection to an Internet service via a non cellular connection to an Internet service or via a direct point to point connection to the Internet service e.g. making a phone call to a person at the other end .

Further in another example the MCRM described herein enables an UAE device in close proximity to the MCRM to contact a remotely located supplier of goods or services and make a purchase. This purchase is charged to a funding source under the control of the user via a wireless modem resident in the UAE device . In yet another alternative the user may activate MCRM s wallet mode via the UAE or the user interface of the MCRM in which case the NFC radio will interact with a merchants compatible POS terminal to complete the transaction.

In another example the user may use the NFC of the MCRM as a reader of passive NFC compatible devices e.g. RFID stickers or active NFC devices e.g. POS terminals or Peer to Peer NFC devices . The MCRM can use one of the wireless connections to communicate information associated with the device to remote service . Remote service would be able to identify the user by the origin of the messaging and the appropriate action or actions to take based on the information contents of the element with which it interacts. The purpose of this could be but not limited to social tagging geo caching providing user feedback on a business or service etc.

Moreover in yet another example the MCRM described herein enables connection management with aim to alleviate spectrum congestion and or maximize service performance on either cellular voice circuits or data circuits used to access the Internet. This conservation spectrum sharing is achieved by implementing a user preference system for seeking non cellular services and using them before making a cellular phone call or before using the 2G 3G 4G cellular networks for access to the Internet. In embodiments of the present technology the user may make choices regarding communications operations such as a default choice or consideration of but not limited to at least one of the following factors high performance to maintain high quality QoS least costly application rating and spectrum conservation.

In one embodiment the default choice is a selection regarding cellular use that the user configures in advance such as always using cellular . In one embodiment in consideration of high performance the MCRM tests signal strength on Bluetooth Wi Fi and Cellular. The service with the strongest signal is chosen. The MCRM regularly monitors the signal strengths and channel performance and performs real time switching of services as needed to maintain a high quality QoS. In one embodiment in consideration of the least costly the MCRM always tries to use Bluetooth or Wi Fi first. The MCRM then tries to use cellular second. The MCRM is continuously checking for availability of free circuit and switches whenever possible. In yet another embodiment in consideration of spectrum conservation and based on the cellular provider s current service needs the MCRM may start with cellular but transition to Wi Fi. Or if there is a way to communicate with the carrier via a common signaling channel the MCRM may receive instructions to just use Wi Fi at a particular time and location. In the alternative the MCRM may try to utilize the primary cellular radio and if the circuits are busy then the MCRM will fallback to the other radios at it s disposal e.g. a second cellular radio Wi Fi etc .

As an overview of the operation potential of the MCRM embodiments of the present technology enable consumers to have an ultra portable wireless device that does not have a high resolution screen or numeric keypad qwerty keyboard but can borrow an interface from an UAE device that is compatible with the MCRM . The interface enables the MCRM to fulfill a large number of functions as has been and will be described herein.

Further one embodiment provides a method of connecting to a mobile communications network for telephony services such as but not limited to voice and short messaging service. Another embodiment provides a method of operating a smart card that can store not only the typically provisioned subscriber information required to access the mobile communications network but also provides a method of storing or securing the user s personal information and credentials and applications preferences.

Another embodiment provides a method of providing device and user specific unique identifiers such as secure tokens passwords and personal identification numbers to authenticate secure wireless transactions to linked external devices and network based services. Yet another embodiment provides a method of providing a user specific application program interface to transfer stored information to a linked external device and network based services.

In another embodiment a secure method of executing or modifying applications servlets or applets when requested or triggered by a user linked external devices or backend servers is provided. Further another embodiment provides a method of supporting user or operator defined over the air OTA updates to the stored information firmware and applications from backend services.

One embodiment provides a method of making a high speed link necessary to transfer the data from the smart card e.g. USB or Bluetooth via USB or Bluetooth e.g. Bluetooth 3.0 to one or more external devices that may have a robust human interface for certain use cases . For example certain use cases may involve only executing secure transactions with MCRMs stored credentials that utilize a near field communication interface e.g. a merchant point of sale POS device or RFID in accordance with existing standards and methods for POS and or tag reading transactions. Certain manufacturers may choose to utilize a keyboard or other gesture based interface instead of or in addition to a touch screen. In one embodiment the user may link the UAE device to an external device that only has a keyboard and mouse interface but is otherwise able to support telephony and Internet applications application processors memory operating systems and other typical computer components.

Another embodiment provides a method utilizing the NFC hardware of the MCRM to interact with active or passive compatible elements e.g. POS Passive device or Active device . The MCRM can receive authorization from User using the UAE or the MCRM user interface to activate the NFC hardware. Once activated the MCRM can interact in the most compatible way with the device to either provide information about User to the active device or to read information from the passive device into the MCRM and process it. In the former case information provided to device might cause device to transact with other services of value to User . In the latter case the MCRM might take information from device and transmit that information to tagging services along with User s identity information .

In one embodiment tagging services will translate that information into specific transactions with other service providers of interest to User via various networks social or otherwise via Internet . Such services might include but not be limited to social tagging geo caching reviews location services couponing etc.

Additionally information relevant to the service provider might also be collected from the user when the MCRM interacts with devices or . This information may be contextual to the intent of the aforementioned devices such as user comments business ratings that could be collected from a simple UI on device or or captured via UI on UAE . As an example User might activate their MCRM to tag mode and tap an instance of device that is located in a Caf to post information about their whereabouts. Another instance might be that of a business with an interactive sign allowing User to rate their experience with said business e.g. like or dislike where once tapped the MCRM would transmit that tag info and information about User to tagging service to be exchanged brokered or otherwise provided to the business perhaps directly or indirectly via other relevant services e.g. OpenTable Zagat Urbanspoon Yelp etc .

Additionally embodiments of the present technology provide a method of supporting telephony service applications and the associated user interfaces equivalent to a typical smart phone. Further embodiments of the present technology provide one or more high speed broadband connection via Wi Fi Wi Max 3G 4G and other mobile broadband or Ethernet.

Another embodiment provides a method of performing near field communications with a merchant point of sale as well as a method of offering data or an application program interface from the user s smart card or secure element with the user s authentication or permission that will fulfill the merchant creditor and or banking institution s requested transaction related information.

In one embodiment a method is provided of either drawing power from a host external device such as USB or utilizing an on board battery. The on board battery may be a typical compact portable device battery or thin film battery material and energy harvesting techniques to support limited use. There may be a time in the future when the technology will allow thin film batteries solar and or energy harvesting techniques to support full functionality of a UAE device .

Another embodiment provides a method of supporting audio out and audio in to a wired or wireless headset attached to the device. Yet another embodiment provides a method of alerting a user to an occurrence of certain use cases when linked or not linked to an external device. For example the embodiments of the technology can use a sound producing or vibrating element buzzer when power is available to alert a user to an incoming call when no device is linked and able to alert the user. Additionally the embodiments of the present technology can use a buzzer to alert the user when power is available that an external device is requesting secure information from the user s smart card. On note and as previously discussed the ultra compact footprint is assembled such that it may be incorporated into or attached to wearable accessories.

Embodiments of the present technology enable the user to use the interface on linked external devices to do but not exclusively one or more of the following perform voice phone calls by for example being paired with an in car display to provide the required hands free phone experience while driving perform SMS services utilize voice services utilize messaging and data services configure a user interface applications and services using their preferences and content stored on their smart cards and or authenticate a secure link with external devices to give the user confidence in sharing sensitive information such as but not limited to personal identification addresses credentials and credit banking account information.

Embodiments of the present technology provide transparently through abstraction a method for providing radio resources to physically disparate but either wired or wirelessly connected and linked UAE devices . These radio resources include but are not limited to the first cellular modem and radio and the first near field communication modem and radio .

Embodiments of the present technology provide a method for allowing the user to read and write to the smart cards and via a backend gateway or application on a linked external device. For example the user can write address book information to the smart card or write an external location where the address book information is stored. In this example the linked external device will then be able to with the user s permission pull address book information from the MCRM or from an external location such as an address for the user s Google Contacts account. In another example the user can write frequently used commerce payment transaction information to the MCRM such as a billing and a shipping address. In a further example the User can authorize payment credentials to be written to the smart card or for use for commercial transactions. Conversely it will be possible for the entity issuing the credentials e.g. the Bank or credit processor transaction services manager TSM or other official entity to modify or revoke said credentials with or without consent of the User via OTA or interaction with a device such as a POS .

In this example when the user is conducting a payment transaction through a linked external device the linked external device can request this information that is stored on the MCRM . Additionally in this example embodiments of the present technology allow the user to define how the user will permit this information to be shared such as by entering a PIN into the linked external device that is requesting the information.

Embodiments of the present technology provide a method for allowing the user to link to multiple external devices individually and simultaneously. For example in an embodiment of the technology a method is provided of allowing the user to define linking to one or more external devices automatically without a password and then require a password to link to others. A security model can determine what information is available to the multitude of paired and linked endpoints or UAEs based on the security of the given connection to each UAE . For example an insecure link to a given UAE may only provide basic incoming call service or otherwise limited services to User on that particular UAE while a UAE with a trusted link may allow access to more secure information such as personal information credentials or other sensitive secure data belonging to User stored on MCRM . For example a method is provided for allowing the user to define specific characteristics of the interaction between the MCRM and the linked devices e.g. whether simultaneously linked devices all ring upon an incoming call or only on a specific device . These types of configuration are possible with the device but may require an external web service or the application on the connected user appliance s to operate.

In an embodiment of the present technology a method is provided of allowing the user to prioritize multiple linked external devices and to differentiate how information on their smart card is shared with multiple external devices. For example one embodiment provides a method for allowing the user to identify some UAE devices to synchronize and store some or all of the user s contacts and other UAE devices to not synchronize or to not store the user s contacts at all. In another example one embodiment provides a method for allowing the user to define whether a specific UAE device has access to the user s bank account information or shipping address found on the MCRM . Another embodiment provides a method of requiring one or more authentication events to access that type of sensitive information.

Embodiments of the present technology give the user control over the information stored on the MCRM and encourage the user to provide that information to multiple UAE devices to increase transaction options utilizing a secure element on the near field communication modem and improve the user interface experience. This method is in contrast to associating a secure element stored on the MCRM with a specific cell phone interface and its applications.

In embodiments of the present technology the MCRM may be connected to a separate UAE device which has one or more of the following five 5 components a touch screen user interface a mobile oriented operating system or operating system designed to support at a minimum voice and data services and contact management a high speed data connectivity via Ethernet Wi Fi WiMax HSPA LTE or other embedded high speed data communication radio chip package a Bluetooth radio for linking audio and data to the MCRM and a microphone speaker and or audio in out jack to support telephony voice sessions in conjunction with the ability to select the audio path for the call from the dialing application on the device which would alert the device to support the path of the user s preference . The UAE device will also optionally be loaded with the application allowing it to control and configure the MCRM .

In one embodiment the link between the UAE and MCRM might utilize a multiplexer or MUX to separate the physical channel into multiple channels each used for specific operations e.g. telephony wallet configuration data etc . In another related embodiment some of these logical channels could be encrypted to provide additional security for sensitive operations. In an alternate embodiment the link between the UAE and MCRM might be used such that all communications are co mingled or simplex communication . In yet another embodiment the MCRM resources i.e. radios and secure elements might appear as virtual hardware to the UAE by creating virtual connections in the OS of the UAE and allow the UAE to treat the resources of the MCRM as if they were physically connected and part of the UAE device.

General consumer electronics i.e. not cell phones which have the first four components above and definitely all five components are capable of providing a mobile smart phone like user experience. These consumer and commercial electronics are able to present a user interface which substitutes for a traditional mobile phone screen and keyboard or touch screen. Dialing applications contact management applications and other subscriber information preferences management applications are presented to the user on the linked external device s screen rather than a traditional mobile phone screen.

In one embodiment mobile phones that run compatible operating systems may load applications similar to those used on basic tablet UAE in order to provide a second line service to the User . In one embodiment separate dialer and messaging applications can be loaded by User onto a compatible mobile phone that would provide access to services on the MCRM . In this way a User could avail of the native cellular communications capabilities using one number e.g. a business number as well as the MCRM communications capabilities both cellular e.g. a personal number and NFC e.g. wallet and tagging .

The user is presented with a browser or application based interface from any terminal connected to a backend gateway so that they can update information stored on the MCRM using Over The Air OTA update tools. In the alternative MCRM updates can be managed from applications presented on the linked external device. Authorized third parties can also conduct OTA updates to the MCRM .

Software available to the operating system OS will provides an interface in order to provide Internet access to either via a wired or wireless link as determined by the connection manager linked external devices and to provide for a method of retrieving information such as an application programming interface API from the MCRM . The linked external device may then retrieve Internet data via its broadband connection. Through this retrieval of Internet data services and applications such as voicemail email SMS MMS purchased content and preferred web content are synchronized and or updated

Software available to the OS will provide an interface in order that the paired device has a method for retrieving information from the device. For example the linked external device uses an API from the MCRM for example in order for the linked external device to display user information stored on the device. More examples are disclosed herein.

Possibly using an API from the MCRM the smart card or smart card software available to the OS will provide an interface allowing the external linked device to retrieve information using with any user operator or manufacturer defined configuration settings defined for the paired UAE device . By using the defined configuration settings its components may be properly utilized in conjunction with functions services and applications requested by the user or UAE device .

Functions of software include the following the ability to control and configure the MCRM the ability to manage a mobile wallet including transaction history prepay balances select card for transaction display inline advertising act as user interface for authentication if needed the ability to read active mode or be read passive mode via the NFC radio and to thus interact with devices or e.g. social tagging rating or other transmission of information to other services of interest directly or via tagging service the ability to perform in call control including selection of audio path mute hold 3 party call waiting dialing from pad PIM recents and the ability to display device history message inbox outbox call logs recent missed .

Current smart card designs using plastic card housing are larger than the footprint of GSM radio access technology. GSM radio access technology will continue to shrink in size and costs. In parallel other short distance radio access technologies on chip are also shrinking in size and power requirements. In an embodiment the package size of the mobile communications resource management system allows it to be incorporated in wearable accessories that users can secure to themselves and do not have to move frequently to use like a cell phone. The ability to reduce the user interface with the device and secure it on their person will increase consumer confidence in maintaining more personal information within the device. One view is the device has a better advantage at replacing personal information that is found in wallets and purses.

Separating multiple radio access technologies from form factors driven by screen and keyboard sizes will encourage consumers to choose new interfaces that meet their personal or commercial needs while retaining one personal radio access point and a single source of their personal information on a device MCRM with smart cards and . For example eReaders Internet tablets personal media players in car displays computer displays and possibly future television displays may all be UAE devices a consumer would like to utilize at any given time without searching for a separate cell phone interface to utilize telephone services. Consumers could choose future public or commercial touch screens such as POS devices public screen kiosks or large touch tabletop surfaces to conduct telephony commerce or information transactions with minimal interface on this device. The distinct advantage of these UAE devices can be a larger screen size than smart phones which are limited to the size of the hand and higher data rates if connected to cable fiber Wi Fi or a dedicated mobile broadband network.

Bundling radio access technology with screen keyboard computer processors and related computer components creates a duplicative consumer electronics costs to consumers who desire other computer and screen technology. Additionally this bundling is a barrier to general consumer electronics manufacturers who must gain approval from mobile network operators MNO for each device with embedded MNO radios. To date MNOs have only offered consumer unbundled radios with data access plans and limited connectivity to specific operating systems and computers.

Currently in the U.S. MNOs are allowing unlocked GSM devices into their network which means this device may be rapidly deployed. Furthermore it is the standard business practice of the industry in to allow unlocked devices on their network. As of November 2009 T Mobile of Bellevue Wash. for example released smart card only full service no contract rate plans and announced an MVNO that asks consumers to purchase a smart card only plan with no contract and supply their own phone.

Thus the MCRM system gives consumers the advantage to purchase low cost radio access from the MNO with no contract and then purchase a competitively priced alternative touch screen ultra portable or other touch screen device from a general consumer electronics manufacturer and use it with the MNOs network.

A related advantage is that without the need for carrier approval of all devices on their network the time and approval process to market for new innovation of smart devices is reduced. Further expanding radio access to all consumer electronics companies with one product will increase competition amongst ultra portable and touch screen technologies and result in increased innovation and lower costs to consumers.

General consumer electronics companies not currently building cell phones or who have only a small number of cell phones in their portfolio will be able to offer consumers a larger number of alternative touch screen computers without an embedded mobile network operator radio access and still configure their device to the consumer s personal preferences.

In one embodiment of the present technology screen size technology and radio access technology are separated. Smart phone screen size is effectively limited to the size of the hand today. Separation will accelerate consumer s ability to choose different screen size and screen type experiences directly from manufacturers innovating in that space. Consumers may choose different screen devices throughout a day depending upon their situational need without disconnecting their mobile telephony services or carrying a second screen and keyboard embodied in a typical cell phone.

Consumers can own multiple touch screen devices and utilize mobile communications and their personal subscriber information without swapping smart cards. As an embodiment of this invention the MCRM allows the user to make and receive phone calls using a single MSISDN phone number from any number of UAE devices or end points that provide a user interface . By using low cost components larger memory smart cards with backend server user control in a device designed to connect with high performing electronics and merchant point of sale systems consumers are able to securely keep personal information related to all sorts of transactions in one object.

The MCRM allows the user to consistently authenticate a plurality of other personal and commercial electronics devices in order to access the user s personal information application preferences and services preferences via the wireless pairing connection to the MCRM . The user then uses those other UAE devices to utilize telephony services via the operating system s radio access software and technology.

Consumers will have more choices in the purchasing of a device that can act as their mobile phone. Consumers will be able to leverage more of the consumer electronics they purchase to give them the mobile phone functionality.

Embodiments of the technology at least partially address the pending spectrum crisis by creating a new mobile device ecosystem that shifts the burden onto licensed spectrum broadband. Firstly it will help shift the burden to Wi Fi only devices. Secondly it will give smaller MNOs and data only networks like Clearwire of Kirkland Wash. the opportunity to look outside the traditional handset ecosystem for highly competitive consumer devices that will attract more mobile broadband users to their spectrum. The problem is that smart phone penetration on mobile operator networks will create data demand that exceeds spectrum capacity. Using Wi Fi and similar wireless networking technologies are critical to avoiding the spectrum crisis.

Embodiments of the technology may lead to modifying how consumers view a smart phone versus a smart device. The MCRM separates in the consumer s mind the already affordable mobile voice services from MNO subsidized smart phones that are sold with bundled data plans. Once separated general consumer electronics and computer manufacturers and smaller operators can better compete with Wi Fi only or data services offered on other networks with available spectrum.

The MCRM allows general consumer manufacturers to compete for a position as the consumer s primary portable device by connecting with a small wearable mobile voice accessory. Whether a student buys a mini PCs a commuter carries an eBook or a hiker wants to just bring their GPS unit the MCRM is a small enough accessory that consumers can choose a device that fit their specific need from a larger number of competing manufacturers while keeping that essential mobile connection when they are away from home. Further manufacturers have an option to adjust any number of their overall SKUs to work with the MCRMs rather than work with the MNO to get approval of one or two SKUs to a year.

From another perspective a smart phones may be described as an ultra portable computers layered on top of radio access technology. The MCRM gives ultra portable computer manufacturers outside the handset manufacturing ecosystem a means to compete for customers that want mobile telephony services on their ultra portable.

Mobile banking growth is stymied by MNO control over the handset ecosystem because MNOs control the mass deployment of NFC technology on mobile phones and the critical smart cards contained inside. MNO are making efforts to determine their revenue model for mobile banking. This device gives a low cost rapid deployment option of NFC that potentially removes the MNO from the equation.

Many services such as Facebook have experimented with deploying NFC compatible devices that allow users to tag into locations and post to their Wall using passive RFID based devices or trinkets. The MCRM could reverse this model by providing the User with ability transmit information to a service directly or via a tagging service that would allow businesses to install low cost RFID tag based infrastructure in many locations that include even the basics of a UI or choices e.g. like or dislike . The User can thus interact with these devices through their day to publish information about themselves their location or business ratings as well as for businesses hosting these devices to receive feedback from users and obtain information about their consumers.

Thus mobile banking tools like Near Field Communications NFC lead to higher conversion rates at the point of sale. Today consumers are asked to enter their account and personal information when making web based or mobile based purchases. Results show that the more information requested the lower the conversion rate at POS. Tools like OneClick where the consumer fills out the information once or NFC connected to a smartcard that transfers the information for the consumer resulting in a higher conversion rate. Placing the smart card in a low cost easy to wear device that gives consumers one place to populate all necessary personal information will increase conversion rates in commercial transactions physical tap or electronically .

In an embodiment the cellular modem resident in the MCRM may consist of a software defined radio SDR in which a generic chip set silicon integrated circuits uses an operating system particular to the cellular provider chosen by the user to operate the silicon chip set in a manner identical to what could be provided by a complete cell phone handset made by that supplier. In addition the software defined radio can be reconfigured to operate in a manner determined by another cellular provider s chipset and operating system. In this manner the SDR resident in the MCRM is reconfigurable without any need to change hardware i.e. to change the chipset.

In various embodiments a radio interface layer resident on the UAE devices shall provide an abstraction layer to open source developers allowing them to utilize the same or similar methods to create manage destroy logical communications resources as in a traditional cellular phone device. This shall allow for the portability of applications targeted to the same Operating System OS as the UAE devices that expect or require radio resources. This applies to all resources of the MCRM i.e. secure elements and radios .

An assembly of radios to access a mobile network connect to other devices via Bluetooth including a high speed Bluetooth 3.0 connection which works with a Wi Fi radio and perform near field communication contactless payments will all fit in a compact footprint of a smart card. Additionally the assembly cost is low comparable or lower than the assembly cost of a basic entry level phone. This will allow the MCRM even with an on board rechargeable battery or USB connection included to be incorporated into wearable forms that consumers can confidently secure to themselves their clothing and or their accessories.

In one embodiment the near field communication modem is controlled by a dataflow firmware . Referring now to with attention directed towards of a system architecture including a dataflow manager is shown in accordance with embodiments of the present technology A dataflow manager includes two major pieces of firmware the bootloader and the dataflow firmware . In one embodiment the bootloader validates any present dataflow firmware image loading a new firmware image if one is present in a flash and booting the dataflow firmware . The bootloader is not capable of any external interaction other than through the console UART which is not available to the end user . All firmware images must be received and stored in flash by the dataflow firmware .

The dataflow manager is the top level of the dataflow firmware and includes several tacks that interact to monitor and control the various hardware devices in the MCRM platform. It includes four tasks that control the near field communication modem as well as the console UART GSM UART and the Bluetooth UART . A fifth task manages connections passing data between the tasks and other supervisory functions. A sixth task manages the external power controller . Three other control modules manage the flash switch inputs and light emitting diode LED .

Referring still to a top level of the dataflow firmware is shown in accordance with embodiments of the present technology. In one embodiment there are at least eight dataflow stores in the top level of the dataflow firmware Flash Mutex Store Consol Messages Store GSM Messages Store Bluetooth Messages Store NFC Messages Store LED Messages Store Power Messages Store and Connection Messages Store . These data stores represent storage locations of information and data that flows between the tasks and control blocks. The details of the format type and size of these data stores are not defined at this level. However all message stores are queue like in nature in that all received messages are processed in the order received.

Of note there is no data store between the dataflow manager task and the flash file system . This is because the flash file system presents itself as an API to the application rather than as a data interface. Similar to the flash file system the access to the flash driver is API based rather than a data interface.

Flash Mutex Store In one embodiment this store is a mutual exclusion store that limits access to the flash . The flash mutex limits access to ensure exclusive access. Note that in order to read the flash the flash mutex need not be locked. However if a flash erase write cycle is in process any reads will be corrupted. Thus this flash mutex should lock whenever flash access is necessary.

Console Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds messages destined for the console task . These messages are typically used only for debugging purposes and include captured data to display status changes and other debug output.

GSM Messages Store In one embodiment this store hold messages destined for the GSM task . These messages are used to request services from the GSM task such as GSM status power control dialing and transmitting SMS MMS messages. It is also used to pass raw GSM messages to the GSM UART such as raw GSM commands from a remote device connected via the SPP profile .

Bluetooth Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds messages destined for the Bluetooth task . These messages are used to request services from the Bluetooth task such as Bluetooth status power control opening closing Bluetooth connections querying available remote devices setting Bluetooth authorization codes and transmitting data.

Near Field Communications Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds messages destined for the NFC task . The types of messages are not yet known as there needs to be investigation into how to handle the NFC UART side of things for POS interactions.

LED Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds LED output requests destined for the LED task . This store holds the LED status on off periodic blink a periodic blink and color for each supported LED .

Power Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds power management requests destined for the power control task for the power controller . These requests include charging status and battery level.

Connection Messages Store In one embodiment this store holds messages destined for the dataflow manager task . All modules communicate with the dataflow manager task via the connection messages store by publishing events and data. From this store the dataflow manager task processes these events and processes.

The discussion will now turn to tasks drivers and control. The term task indicates a separate execution context maintained by uCOS II of Micrium of Weston Fla. The term driver indicates a separate execution context but limited in processing to that of interfacing with a hardware device. The term control indicates code that executes within another task s execution context.

Flash driver In one embodiment this is the interface to the flash for OTA firmware images. This task takes request from flash buffer and performs writes and erases as requested. Before any erase or write operation the flash mutex is locked to prevent conflict with the flash file system . This driver is tuned to the specific flash part and all erases writes occur on sector boundaries.

Flash file system In one embodiment the flash file system is a third party product uC FS from Micrium of Weston Fla. . It is integrated with the uCOS II from Micrium of Weston Fla. operating system. It provides an API for reading writing files to the flash . It comes with a specific driver for the flash . Before all erase write access to the flash the flash file system will lock the flash mutex . This protects against contention with the flash driver .

Console Task In one embodiment the console task provides a user interface and debug output. It takes messages from the dataflow manager task usually debug messages for display to the user . It also manages all data from the console UART sending events to the dataflow manager task . The console task provides the following features command line interface system status e.g. GSM status connection status task information system control e.g. power on power off injection of GSM BT commands system reset OTA firmware image control erase download status bootloader image control erase download status and debug output.

Note that in the case of the OTA firmware and bootloader image control all messages are passed to the dataflow manager task for processing.

Switch Task In one embodiment the switch task monitors and debounces the switch inputs. It identifies which button and type of press press hold double tap etc. . When a press hold etc. is detected it is published to the connection messages store for processing by the dataflow manager task .

LED Task In one embodiment the LED task reads the LED Messages Store and updates and maintains the status of the LEDs . The LED task executes in the context of another task and uses the system time to check for changes in the LED status.

Power Control Task In one embodiment the power control task manages the power controller . It monitors the charging status updates the charging watchdog and reads the battery level. It responds to requests from the dataflow manager task and generates events to the dataflow manager task .

GSM Task In one embodiment the GSM task processes requests from the dataflow manager task generating the appropriate commands to the GSM UART . It also processes data from the GSM UART and generates events to the dataflow manager task . The GSM task supports the following dataflow manager task requests dialing hangup raw AT commands This is used for passthrough mode from the SPP profile on the Bluetooth UART . However the eventual mode of operation would be for the Bluetooth task to process the SPP data and generate the appropriate requests through the dataflow manager task to the GSM task .

The GSM task generates the following events to the dataflow manager task Incoming call Ring hangup incoming phone number raw output any unknown or unexpected results from the GSM UART will be passed back to the dataflow manager task for eventual transport over the SPP connection. However the eventual mode of operation would be for the dataflow manager task to process or ignore such events receive SMS MMS This will only be supported through the raw AT command mechanism in this design. The eventual mode of operation is for the GSM task to recognize a new SMS message then send them to the dataflow manager task for further processing.

Bluetooth Task In one embodiment the Bluetooth task processes requests form the dataflow manager task generating the appropriate commands to the Bluetooth UART . It also processes data from the Bluetooth UART and generates events to the dataflow manager task . The Bluetooth task supports the following dataflow manager task requests remote device discovery Bluetooth authorization code settings pairing with a remote device incoming call Ring via HFP AG Hangup incoming phone number and raw commands The mode of operation is limited to the SPP interface. This is to support the passthrough path to the GSM UART for SMS MMS functionality . The Bluetooth task generates the following events to the dataflow manager task new connection lost connection dialing hangup and raw commands This mode of operation is limited to the SPP interface. This is to support the passthrough path to the GSM UART for SMS MMS functionality .
