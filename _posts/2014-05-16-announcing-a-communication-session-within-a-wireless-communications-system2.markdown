title: Announcing a communication session within a wireless communications system
abstract: An access network (AN) receives a call announcement message for transmission to an access terminal (AT). The AN initiates, in response to the received call announcement message, a physical-layer synchronization procedure for at least one channel between the AN and the AT, the physical-layer synchronization procedure associated with a transition of the access terminal to a dedicated channel state. The AN performs the initiation by sending a message to the AT. In response to the message, the AT monitors a downlink channel for receipt of the call announcement message. The AN then transmits the call announcement message on the downlink channel to the access terminal, and the AT receives the call announcement message due to the monitoring. The call announcement message is transmitted either (i) before the physical layer synchronization procedure completes or (ii) before a transmission of a reconfiguration complete message indicating completion of dedicated channel state transition.

The present application for patent is a Divisional of Non Provisional application Ser. No. 12 782 590 entitled ANNOUNCING A COMMUNICATION SESSION WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM filed May 18 2010 which in turn claims priority to Provisional Application No. 61 180 645 entitled ANNOUNCING A COMMUNICATION SESSION WITHIN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM filed May 22 2009 each of which is assigned to the assignee hereof and each of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Embodiments of the invention relates to announcing a communication session within a wireless communications system.

Wireless communication systems have developed through various generations including a first generation analog wireless phone service 1G a second generation 2G digital wireless phone service including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks and a third generation 3G high speed data Internet capable wireless service. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use including Cellular and Personal Communications Service PCS systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System AMPS and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access CDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access FDMA Time Division Multiple Access TDMA the Global System for Mobile access GSM variation of TDMA and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies.

The method for providing CDMA mobile communications was standardized in the United States by the Telecommunications Industry Association Electronic Industries Association in TIA EIA IS 95 A entitled Mobile Station Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System referred to herein as IS 95. Combined AMPS CDMA systems are described in TIA EIA Standard IS 98. Other communications systems are described in the IMT 2000 UM or International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System standards covering what are referred to as wideband CDMA W CDMA CDMA2000 such as CDMA2000 1xEV DO standards for example or TD SCDMA.

In wireless communication systems mobile stations handsets or access terminals AT receive signals from fixed position base stations also referred to as cell sites or cells that support communication links or service within particular geographic regions adjacent to or surrounding the base stations. Base stations provide entry points to an access network AN radio access network RAN which is generally a packet data network using standard Internet Engineering Task Force IETF based protocols that support methods for differentiating traffic based on Quality of Service QoS requirements. Therefore the base stations generally interact with ATs through an over the air interface and with the AN through Internet Protocol IP network data packets.

In wireless telecommunication systems Push to talk PTT capabilities are becoming popular with service sectors and consumers. PTT can support a dispatch voice service that operates over standard commercial wireless infrastructures such as CDMA FDMA TDMA GSM etc. In a dispatch model communication between endpoints ATs occurs within virtual groups wherein the voice of one talker is transmitted to one or more listeners. A single instance of this type of communication is commonly referred to as a dispatch call or simply a PTT call. A PTT call is an instantiation of a group which defines the characteristics of a call. A group in essence is defined by a member list and associated information such as group name or group identification.

Conventionally data packets within a wireless communication network have been configured to be sent to a single destination or access terminal A transmission of data to a single destination is referred to as unicast . As mobile communications have increased the ability to transmit given data concurrently to multiple access terminals has become more important. Accordingly protocols have been adopted to support concurrent data transmissions of the same packet or message to multiple destinations or target access terminals. A broadcast refers to a transmission of data packets to all destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given cell served by a given service provider etc. while a multicast refers to a transmission of data packets to a given group of destinations or access terminals. In an example the given group of destinations or multicast group may include more than one and less than all of possible destinations or access terminals e.g. within a given group served by a given service provider etc. . However it is at least possible in certain situations that the multicast group comprises only one access terminal similar to a unicast or alternatively that the multicast group comprises all access terminals e.g. within a given cell etc. similar to a broadcast.

Broadcasts and or multicasts may be performed within wireless communication systems in a number of ways such as performing a plurality of sequential unicast operations to accommodate the multicast group allocating a unique broadcast multicast channel BCH for handling multiple data transmissions at the same time and the like. A conventional system using a broadcast channel for push to talk communications is described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2007 0049314 dated Mar. 1 2007 and entitled Push To Talk Group Call System Using CDMA 1x EVDO Cellular Network the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As described in Publication No. 2007 0049314 a broadcast channel can be used for push to talk calls using conventional signaling techniques. Although the use of a broadcast channel may improve bandwidth requirements over conventional unicast techniques the conventional signaling of the broadcast channel can still result in additional overhead and or delay and may degrade system performance.

The 3Generation Partnership Project 2 3GPP2 defines a broadcast multicast service BCMCS specification for supporting multicast communications in CDMA2000 networks. Accordingly a version of 3GPP2 s BCMCS specification entitled CDMA2000 High Rate Broadcast Multicast Packet Data Air Interface Specification dated Feb. 14 2006 Version 1.0 C.S0054 A is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

An access network AN receives a call announcement message for transmission to an access terminal AT . The AN initiates in response to the received call announcement message a physical layer synchronization procedure for at least one channel between the AN and the AT the physical layer synchronization procedure associated with a transition of the access terminal to a dedicated channel state. The AN performs the initiation by sending a message to the AT. In response to the message the AT monitors a downlink channel for receipt of the call announcement message. The AN then transmits the call announcement message on the downlink channel to the access terminal and the AT receives the call announcement message due to the monitoring. The call announcement message is transmitted either i before the physical layer synchronization procedure completes or ii before a transmission of a reconfiguration complete message indicating completion of dedicated channel state transition.

Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following description and related drawings directed to specific embodiments of the invention. Alternate embodiments may be devised without departing from the scope of the invention. Additionally well known elements of the invention will not be described in detail or will be omitted so as not to obscure the relevant details of the invention.

The words exemplary and or example are used herein to mean serving as an example instance or illustration. Any embodiment described herein as exemplary and or example is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. Likewise the term embodiments of the invention does not require that all embodiments of the invention include the discussed feature advantage or mode of operation.

Further many embodiments are described in terms of sequences of actions to be performed by for example elements of a computing device. It will be recognized that various actions described herein can be performed by specific circuits e.g. application specific integrated circuits ASICs by program instructions being executed by one or more processors or by a combination of both. Additionally these sequence of actions described herein can be considered to be embodied entirely within any form of computer readable storage medium having stored therein a corresponding set of computer instructions that upon execution would cause an associated processor to perform the functionality described herein. Thus the various aspects of the invention may be embodied in a number of different forms all of which have been contemplated to be within the scope of the claimed subject matter. In addition for each of the embodiments described herein the corresponding form of any such embodiments may be described herein as for example logic configured to perform the described action.

A High Data Rate HDR subscriber station referred to herein as an access terminal AT or user equipment UE may be mobile or stationary and may communicate with one or more access points APs . For example APs may correspond to HDR base stations and may be referred to herein as modem pool transceivers MPTs or base stations BS Node Bs and other equivalent terms. An access terminal or UE transmits and receives data packets through one or more of the APs to an AP controller. For example the AP controller may correspond to an HDR base station controller and may be referred to as a modem pool controller MPC base station controller BSC Mobile Switching Center MSC a radio network control RNC and other equivalent terms. The APs and AP controllers are parts of a network called a radio access network RAN . A radio access network can transport voice and data packets between multiple access terminals.

The radio access network may be further connected to additional networks outside the radio access network such core network including specific carrier related servers and devices and connectivity to other networks such as a corporate intranet the Internet public switched telephone network PSTN and may transport voice and data packets between each access terminal and such networks. An access terminal that has established an active traffic channel connection with one or more APs may be referred to as an active access terminal and can be referred to as being in a traffic state. An access terminal that is in the process of establishing an active traffic channel TCH connection with one or more APs can be referred to as being in a connection setup state. An access terminal may be any data device that communicates through a wireless channel or through a wired channel. An access terminal may further be any of a number of types of devices including but not limited to PC card compact flash device external or internal modem or wireless or wireline phone. The communication link through which the access terminal sends signals to the AP s is called an uplink channel e.g. a reverse traffic channel a control channel an access channel etc. . The communication link through which APs send signals to an access terminal is called a downlink channel e.g. a paging channel a control channel a broadcast channel a forward traffic channel etc. . As used herein the term traffic channel TCH can refer to either an uplink reverse or downlink forward traffic channel.

Referring back to the components of the wireless communications system and interrelation of the elements of the exemplary embodiments of the invention are not limited to the configuration illustrated. System is merely exemplary and can include any system that allows remote access terminals such as wireless client computing devices to communicate over the air between and among each other and or between and among components connected via the air interface and RAN including without limitation core network the Internet PSTN and or other remote servers.

The RAN controls messages typically sent as data packets sent to an AP controller e.g. a base station controller packet control function BSC PCF in EV DO a RNC in W CDMA etc. . The AP controller is responsible for signaling establishing and tearing down bearer channels i.e. data channels between a packet service node e.g. a Packet Data Service Node PDSN in 1x EV DO a Serving General Packet Radio Services GPRS Support Node SGSN in W CDMA etc. and the access terminals . If link layer encryption is enabled the AP controller also encrypts the content before forwarding it over the air interface . The function of the AP controller is well known in the art and will not be discussed further for the sake of brevity. The core network may communicate with the AP controller by a network the Internet and or a public switched telephone network PSTN . Alternatively the BSC PCF may connect directly to the Internet or external network. Typically the network or Internet connection between the core network and the AP controller transfers data and the PSTN transfers voice information. The AP controller can be connected to multiple APs . In a similar manner to the core network the AP controller is typically connected to the APs by a network the Internet and or PSTN for data transfer and or voice information. The APs can broadcast data messages wirelessly to the access terminals such as cellular telephone . The APs AP controller and other components may form the RAN as is known in the art. However alternate configurations may also be used and the invention is not limited to the configuration illustrated. For example in another embodiment the functionality of the AP controller and one or more of the APs may be collapsed into a single hybrid module having the functionality of both the AP controller and the APs .

Generally GPRS is a protocol used by Global System for Mobile communications GSM phones for transmitting Internet Protocol IP packets. The GPRS Core Network e.g. the GGSN and one or more SGSNs is the centralized part of the GPRS system and also provides support for W CDMA based 3G networks. The GPRS core network is an integrated part of the GSM core network provides mobility management session management and transport for IP packet services in GSM and W CDMA networks.

The GPRS Tunneling Protocol GTP is the defining IP protocol of the GPRS core network. The GTP is the protocol which allows end users e.g. access terminals of a GSM or W CDMA network to move from place to place while continuing to connect to the internet as if from one location at the GGSN . This is achieved transferring the subscriber s data from the subscriber s current SSGN to the GGSN which is handling the subscriber s session.

Three forms of GTP are used by the GPRS core network namely i GTP U ii GTP C and iii GTP GTP Prime . GTP U is used for transfer of user data in separated tunnels for each packet data protocol PDP context. GTP C is used for control signaling e.g. setup and deletion of PDP contexts verification of GSN reach ability updates or modifications such as when a subscriber moves from one SGSN to another etc. . GTP is used for transfer of charging data from GSNs to a charging function.

Referring to the GGSN acts as an interface between the GPRS backbone network not shown and the external packet data network . The GGSN extracts the packet data with associated packet data protocol PDP format e.g. IP or PPP from the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN and sends the packets out on a corresponding packet data network. In the other direction the incoming data packets are directed by the GGSN to the SGSN which manages and controls the Radio Access Bearer RAB of the destination AT served by the RAN . Thereby the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the target AT and his her profile in its location register e.g. within a PDP context . The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected AT. The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.

The SGSN is representative of one of many SGSNs within the core network in an example. Each SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile stations or ATs within an associated geographical service area. The tasks of the SGSN include packet routing and transfer mobility management e.g. attach detach and location management logical link management and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information e.g. current cell current VLR and user profiles e.g. IMSI PDP address es used in the packet data network of all GPRS users registered with the SGSN for example within one or more PDP contexts for each user or AT. Thus SGSNs are responsible for i de tunneling downlink GTP packets from the GGSN ii uplink tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN iii carrying out mobility management as ATs move between SGSN service areas and iv billing mobile subscribers. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art aside from i iv SGSNs configured for GSM EDGE networks have slightly different functionality as compared to SGSNs configured for W CDMA networks.

The RAN e.g. UTRAN in Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS system architecture communicates with the SGSN via an Iu interface with a transmission protocol such as Frame Relay or IP. The SGSN communicates with the GGSN via a Gn interface which is an IP based interface between SGSN and other SGSNs not shown and internal GGSNs and uses the GTP protocol defined above e.g. GTP U GTP C GTP etc. . While not shown in the Gn interface is also used by the Domain Name System DNS . The GGSN is connected to a Public Data Network PDN not shown and in turn to the Internet via a Gi interface with IP protocols either directly or through a Wireless Application Protocol WAP gateway.

The PDP context is a data structure present on both the SGSN and the GGSN which contains a particular AT s communication session information when the AT has an active GPRS session. When an AT wishes to initiate a GPRS communication session the AT must first attach to the SGSN and then activate a PDP context with the GGSN . This allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN serving the AT s access point.

Referring to ATs and . . . N are illustrated as wireless cell phones AT is illustrated as a wireless tablet PC and AT is illustrated as a wired desktop station. However in other embodiments it will be appreciated that the wireless communication system can connect to any type of AT and the examples illustrated in are not intended to limit the types of ATs that may be implemented within the system. Also while the AAA the provisioning server the IMS SIP registration server and the application server are each illustrated as structurally separate servers one or more of these servers may be consolidated in at least one embodiment of the invention.

Further referring to the application server is illustrated as including a plurality of media control complexes MCCs . . . N B and a plurality of regional dispatchers . . . N A. Collectively the regional dispatchers A and MCCs B are included within the application server which in at least one embodiment can correspond to a distributed network of servers that collectively functions to arbitrate communication sessions e.g. half duplex group communication sessions via IP unicasting and or IP multicasting protocols within the wireless communication system . For example because the communication sessions arbitrated by the application server can theoretically take place between ATs located anywhere within the system multiple regional dispatchers A and MCCs are distributed to reduce latency for the arbitrated communication sessions e.g. so that a MCC in North America is not relaying media back and forth between session participants located in China . Thus when reference is made to the application server it will be appreciated that the associated functionality can be enforced by one or more of the regional dispatchers A and or one or more of the MCCs B. The regional dispatchers A are generally responsible for any functionality related to establishing a communication session e.g. handling signaling messages between the ATs scheduling and or sending announce messages etc. whereas the MCCs B are responsible for hosting the communication session for the duration of the call instance including conducting an in call signaling and an actual exchange of media during an arbitrated communication session.

Referring to an access terminal or UE here a wireless device such as a cellular telephone has a platform that can receive and execute software applications data and or commands transmitted from the RAN that may ultimately come from the core network the Internet and or other remote servers and networks. The platform can include a transceiver operably coupled to an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other processor microprocessor logic circuit or other data processing device. The ASIC or other processor executes the application programming interface API layer that interfaces with any resident programs in the memory of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read only or random access memory RAM and ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. The platform also can include a local database that can hold applications not actively used in memory . The local database is typically a flash memory cell but can be any secondary storage device as known in the art such as magnetic media EEPROM optical media tape soft or hard disk or the like. The internal platform components can also be operably coupled to external devices such as antenna display push to talk button and keypad among other components as is known in the art.

Accordingly an embodiment of the invention can include an access terminal including the ability to perform the functions described herein. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the various logic elements can be embodied in discrete elements software modules executed on a processor or any combination of software and hardware to achieve the functionality disclosed herein. For example ASIC memory API and local database may all be used cooperatively to load store and execute the various functions disclosed herein and thus the logic to perform these functions may be distributed over various elements. Alternatively the functionality could be incorporated into one discrete component. Therefore the features of the access terminal in are to be considered merely illustrative and the invention is not limited to the illustrated features or arrangement.

The wireless communication between the access terminal and the RAN can be based on different technologies such as code division multiple access CDMA W CDMA time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM the Global System for Mobile Communications GSM or other protocols that may be used in a wireless communications network or a data communications network. For example in W CDMA the data communication is typically between the client device AP s and the AP controller e.g. RNC . The AP controller or RNC can be connected to multiple data networks such as the core network PSTN the Internet a virtual private network and the like thus allowing the access terminal access to a broader communication network. As discussed in the foregoing and known in the art voice transmission and or data can be transmitted to the access terminals from the RAN using a variety of networks and configurations. Accordingly the illustrations provided herein are not intended to limit the embodiments of the invention and are merely to aid in the description of aspects of embodiments of the invention.

Below embodiments of the invention are generally described in accordance with W CDMA protocols and associated terminology e.g. such as RNC contrasted with BSC in EV DO or Node B contrasted with BS or MPT BS in EV DO etc. . However it will be readily appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art how the embodiments of the invention can be applied in conjunction with wireless communication protocols other than W CDMA.

In a conventional server arbitrated communication session e.g. via half duplex protocols full duplex protocols VoIP a group session over IP unicast a group session over IP multicast a push to talk PTT session a push to transfer PTX session etc. a session or call originator sends a request to initiate a communication session to the application server which then forwards a call announcement message to the RAN for transmission to one or more targets of the call. As will be appreciated for time sensitive applications e.g. PTT calls it is important that the announce message be received by the one or more targets as quickly as possible.

Access terminals or User Equipments UEs in a Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network UTRAN e.g. the RAN may be in either an idle mode or a connected mode. Below reference is made to the RAN and ATs although it is appreciated that when applied to UMTS this terminology may be used to refer to the UTRAN and UEs respectively.

Based on AT mobility and activity while in a radio resource control RRC connected mode the RAN may direct ATs to transition between a number of RRC sub states namely CELL PCH URA PCH CELL FACH and CELL DCH states which may be characterized as follows 

Accordingly URA PCH State or CELL PCH State corresponds to a dormant state where the AT periodically wakes up to check a paging indicator channel PICH and if needed the associated downlink paging channel PCH and it may enter CELL FACH state to send a Cell Update message for the following event cell reselection periodical Cell Update uplink data transmission paging response re entered service area. In CELL FACH State the AT may send messages on the random access channel RACH and may monitor a forward access channel FACH . The FACH carries downlink communication from the RAN and is mapped to a secondary common control physical channel S CCPCH . From CELL FACH State the AT may enter CELL DCH state after a traffic channel TCH has been obtained based on messaging in CELL FACH state.

A process by which a server arbitrated communication session can be set up is described with respect to . In particular illustrate a server arbitrated session set up process wherein the system corresponds to a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS that uses Wideband Code Division Multiple Access W CDMA . However it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art how can be modified to be directed to communication sessions in accordance with protocols other than W CDMA.

Referring to a given AT AT is in a URA PCH state . While AT is in URA PCH state a user of AT requests initiation of a communication session e.g. a PTT session or other time sensitive or delay sensitive communication session . Accordingly AT transitions to CELL FACH state and AT sends a Cell Update message on the RACH that includes AT s UTRAN Radio Network Temporary Identifier RNTI U RNTI . The U RNTI is well known in the art and corresponds to an identification assigned to an AT e.g. during power up or upon transition to a new RNC serving area that uniquely identifies an AT within a particular subnet or set of sectors controlled by a single RNC of the RAN .

In the RAN configures and transmits a Cell Update Confirm message that assigns dedicated physical channels for DPCH and may also assign dedicated physical channels for the E DCH with an E DCH radio network temporary identifier E RNTI if the E DCH is to be used by AT for uplink data transmission.

Next AT and the RAN engage in a L1 synchronization procedure. For example the L1 synchronization procedure can occur on uplink and downlink dedicated physical control channels DPCCH . The DPCCH is a physical channel on which signaling is transmitted both in the uplink direction by AT and in the downlink direction by the RAN . Accordingly during the L1 synchronization procedure the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the RAN . Alternatively the L1 synchronization procedure on downlink may be performed over a Fractional Dedicated Physical Channel F DPCH which was introduced in 3GPP Release 6. The F DPCH allows a Node B of the RAN to time multiplex up to ten 10 users DPCCH signaling using a single Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor OVSF code and thereby improves the utilization of OVSF codes on the downlink. F DPCH can be used when the HS DSCH is configured and the DCH is not configured. Thus when the F DPCH is available the UE or AT will generally attempt to perform the L synchronization procedure over the F DPCH.

When the L1 synchronization procedure is complete AT transitions to CELL DCH state and transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of 416 to the RAN on the uplink DCH or E DCH . Because AT now has access to the E DCH AT also sends a call request message on the DCH or E DCH to the RAN and the RAN forwards the call request message to the application server . The application server processes the call request message generates an announce message for announcing the communication session to a target AT and forwards the announce message to the RAN .

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the RAN cannot simply transmit the announce message to AT immediately after receiving the call announce message from the application server . Rather the RAN waits for a next DRX cycle or paging cycle at which target AT is expected to be monitoring for pages . For convenience of explanation it may be assumed that AT is in URA PCH state at this point . While not shown in if AT already had an active traffic channel TCH the RAN could simply send the announce message on the already allocated TCH.

After the RAN waits for the DRX cycle or paging cycle of AT the RAN transmits a type 1 page message to each of AT . As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art a type 1 page message corresponds to a page sent on a downlink paging channel PCH contrasted with a type 2 page message that corresponds to on a downlink DCH or FACH which is not yet available because AT are assumed to be in URA PCH state . As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art when the UE is in CELL DCH or CELL FACH state the UTRAN RRC Layer of the RAN would page the UE by transmitting a paging type 2 message on the DCH or FACH channel. As with paging type 1 the UE s RRC Layer notifies the upper layers of a core network CN domain and paging cause. Paging type 2 is used to deliver a second call while the UE is already active in another call e.g. simultaneous voice and data .

Upon receiving the page message AT transitions to CELL FACH state and AT sends a Cell Update message on the RACH that includes the U RNTI for AT . In the RAN configures and transmits a Cell Update Confirm message that assigns a dedicated physical channel for DCH and may also assign a dedicated physical channel for the E DCH with an E RNTI if the E DCH is to be used by AT for uplink data transmissions.

Upon receiving the Cell Update Confirm message in AT and the RAN engage in a L1 synchronization procedure on the DPCCH or F DPCH e.g. as in and . Accordingly in an example during the synchronization procedure the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the RAN . For example starting in Release 6 a post verification a.k.a. Fast L Sync feature was introduced to facilitate ATs beginning uplink DPCCH transmissions for uplink L synchronization as soon as the Cell Update Confirm message is decoded. Also as discussed above the L1 synchronization procedure on the downlink may alternatively be performed over the F DPCH to improve OVSF utilization if the AT engaged in the L1 synchronization procedure when the HS DSCH is configured and the DCH is not configured at the AT.

At some point after the Cell Update Confirm message is received in AT transitions to CELL DCH state and AT transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of to the RAN on the uplink E DCH .

At some point after receiving the Cell Update Confirm response message in the RAN sends the announce message to AT on the HS DSCH . In an example in 3GPP Release 6 after the L1 synchronization process AT sends a channel quality indicator CQI that reports measured signal quality measured at AT for a downlink high speed dedicated shared channel HS DSCH on an uplink high speed DPCCH HS DPCCH and the announce message may be sent only after the HS DPCCH CQI and or Cell Update Confirm response message is received. In an alternative example in 3GPP Release 99 the announce message can be sent on a downlink DCH to AT after the transport configuration complete message is received at e.g. without a HS DPCCH CQI .

After receiving the announce message AT can auto accept the announce message e.g. if the announced call is an emergency call can auto reject the announce message e.g. if AT is already engaged in another session or can allow a user of AT to determine whether to accept the announced call. The delay during which AT processes the announce message to determine whether to accept the call corresponds to block in . For convenience of explanation assume that AT determines to accept the announced call and as such AT sends a call accept message on the uplink E DCH to the RAN which then forwards the call accept message to the application server . Upon receiving a call accept message from AT the application server sends a call status message to the RAN and the RAN transmits the call status message to AT on the HS DSCH . Upon receiving the call status message AT plays a floor grant tone that indicates to a user of AT that the communication session can begin .

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art the call announcement message in is sent at only after i the L synchronization procedure completes at and ii the cell update confirm response message arrives at the RAN from AT . Also the process of may undergo a delay between receipt of the Cell Update Confirm message or reconfiguration message at AT in and the receipt of the reconfiguration complete message at the RAN in e.g. with fast L sync . Also an additional delay may occur between transmission of the announce message in and the receipt of the call accept message at the RAN from AT in . Embodiments of the invention are directed to more quickly providing the announce message to AT . A brief discussion of various 3GPP standards will now be provided to aid in the understanding of the embodiments of the invention.

Section 4.3.2.3 of 3GPP Technical Specification TS 25.214 e.g. of Release 5 through Release 8 describes a given Synchronization procedure Synchronization Procedure A . In Section 4.3.2.3 b the 3GPP TS 25.214 states that UTRAN shall start the transmission of the downlink DPCCH and may start the transmission of DPDCH if any data is to be transmitted and in Section 4.3.2.3 d the 3GPP TS 25.214 states that t he transmission of the uplink DPCCH power control preamble shall start Npcp radio frames prior to the start of uplink DPDCH transmission where Nis a higher layer parameter set by UTRAN .

From the above noted sections of 3GPP TS 25.214 it will be appreciated that 3GPP TS 25.214 permits i.e. does not prevent the UTRAN e.g. the RAN to transmit downlink data over the dedicated physical dedicated channel DPDCH while the downlink L1 synchronization i.e. block in is in progress. Thus as will be discussed in more detail below with respect to this means the announce message can be sent on the downlink DCH over DPDCH in accordance with 3GPP Release 99 relatively soon after the downlink L synchronization process begins and need not wait for the downlink L synchronization process to complete as in .

Also from the above noted sections if 3GPP TS 25.214 it will be further appreciated that 3GPP TS 25.214 permits i.e. does not prevent the UTRAN e.g. the RAN to transmit downlink data over a high speed dedicated shared channel HS DSCH while the downlink L1 synchronization i.e. block in is in progress. It will be further appreciated that 3GPP TS 25.214 permits i.e. does not prevent the ATs undergoing synchronization e.g. AT to transmit on a uplink high speed DPCCH HS DPCCH e.g. to send ACKs NAKs and or channel quality indicators CQIs based on downlink HS DSCH transmissions while the DPCCH or F DPCH synchronization procedure for uplink L is still processing i.e. block in . Thus as will be discussed in more detail below with respect to this means the announce message can be sent on the downlink HS DSCH after AT sends a HS DPCCH CQI in accordance with 3GPP Release 99 relatively soon after the downlink L1 synchronization process begins and need not wait for the downlink L1 synchronization process to complete as in . Alternatively as discussed below in more detail with respect to even if the L synchronization process completes the serving Node B can transmit the announce message before receiving a Cell Update Confirm response message or reconfiguration complete message .

Accordingly illustrates a process by which the announce message for the communication session can be transmitted to AT before completion of the uplink and downlink L1 synchronization procedure and or before reception of a cell update confirm response message in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. is a relatively high level flowchart that is broad enough to cover implementations across different 3GPP releases in a W CDMA environment such as Release 6 and or Release 99. Afterwards more specific implementations of are illustrated for Release 6 in and for Release 99 in . However it will be appreciated that the process of is applicable to more releases than Release 6 and Release 99 and the implementation of process within these particular 3GPP releases is given to facilitate understanding of the embodiments of the invention but not to limit the invention. In its entirety the process of can be used to substitute for blocks through of .

Referring to after the application server processes a call request message from a call originator the application server generates an announce message for announcing the communication session e.g. PTT session to a target AT and forwards the announce message to a RNC serving target AT at the RAN . For convenience of explanation it may be assumed that AT is in URA PCH state at this point . While not shown in if AT already had an active traffic channel TCH the RAN could simply send the announce message on the already allocated TCH. The serving RNC at the RAN then waits for a next DRX cycle or paging cycle at which target AT is expected to be monitoring for pages .

After the serving RNC at the RAN waits for the DRX cycle or paging cycle AT the serving RNC forwards a type 1 page message to AT s serving Node B and the serving Node B then transmits the type 1 page message on the downlink PCH to AT . Upon receiving the page message AT transitions to CELL FACH state and AT sends a Cell Update message on the RACH that includes the U RNTI for AT which is then forwarded by the serving Node B to the serving RNC . In the serving RNC at the RAN configures and forwards a Cell Update Confirm message or reconfiguration message to the serving Node B for transmission to AT . The Cell Update Confirm message assigns dedicated physical channels for DCH and may also assign dedicated physical channels for the E DCH with an E RNTI if the E DCH is to be used by AT for uplink data transmission. Blocks through of correspond to blocks through of respectively. In the serving RNC also forwards the announce message to the serving Node B for transmission to AT .

Upon receiving and processing the Cell Update Confirm message in AT immediately transitions to CELL DCH state . Accordingly as soon as AT processes the Cell Update Confirm message e.g. extracts information necessary for DCH decoding such as a channelization code etc. AT can begin to decode or monitor the downlink DPDCH in Release 99. Likewise in Release 6 as soon as AT processes the Cell Update Confirm message AT begins to decode or monitor the downlink HS DSCH and also has the option of transmitting uplink data on the HS DPCCH e.g. HS DPCCH CQIs ACKs NAKs etc. . It will be appreciated that this monitoring and or transmitting is performed concurrently with the L synchronization process over the DPCCH.

In after the Cell Update Confirm message or reconfiguration message is processed the serving Node B of the RAN and AT begin the L synchronization procedure on the DPCCH and or F DPCH e.g. as in and of . For example starting in Release 6 a post verification a.k.a. Fast L Sync feature was introduced to facilitate ATs beginning uplink DPCCH transmissions for L synchronization as soon as the Cell Update Confirm message is decoded. Accordingly during the L1 synchronization procedure of 540 the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the RAN . Also as discussed above the L synchronization procedure may alternatively be performed over the F DPCH to improve OVSF utilization if the AT engaged in the L1 synchronization procedure when the HS DSCH is configured and the DCH is not configured at the AT.

In before the L1 synchronization process completes the serving Node B at the RAN transmits the announce message to at least AT over either the DCH e.g. in accordance with Release 99 or over the HS DSCH e.g. in accordance with Release 6 after a HS DPCCH CQI is received from AT . In an example in Release 6 the announce message transmission of 545 can be triggered by the HS DPCCH CQI. In a further example also in Release 6 AT can be configured to send the HS DPCCH CQI as early as possible e.g. as soon as information for computing the CQI is available . This is described in more detail below with respect to .

Alternatively as shown in the transmission of 545 can occur after the L1 synchronization process completes but before AT sends a Cell Update Confirm response message to the serving Node B. In other words in contrast to in the transmission of 545 can be moved to after block but before receipt of the cell update confirm response message at block . A further description of has been omitted because substantially corresponds to except for the order of blocks and . Also embodiments described below are generally directed to the implementation instead of the implementation whereby the call announcement necessarily occurs prior to L synchronization completion. However it will be readily appreciated how each of the embodiments can be modified such that the call announcement message transmission can occur subsequent to the L1 synchronization complete but prior to reception of the cell update confirm message or reconfiguration complete message at the RAN .

Turning back to the L1 synchronization process continues until the DPCCH and or F DPCH at the serving Node B of the RAN and AT is synchronized . After the L1 synchronization procedure is complete AT transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of on the DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the Cell Update Confirm response message to the serving RNC .

After receiving the announce message in AT can auto accept the announce message e.g. if the announced call is an emergency call can auto reject the announce message e.g. if AT is already engaged in another session or can allow a user of AT to determine whether to accept the announced call. The delay during which AT processes the announce message to determine whether to accept the call corresponds to block in . For convenience of explanation assume that AT determines to accept the announced call and as such AT sends a call accept message on the uplink link DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the call accept message to the serving RNC .

As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art while the process of undergoes a delay between receipt of the Cell Update Confirm message at AT in and the receipt of the Cell Update Confirm response message at the RAN in e.g. with fast L sync delays associated with the processing of the announce message can be reduced because these delays are dealt with concurrently i.e. in parallel with the L1 synchronization process.

In particular in most conventional implementations such as an initial downlink transmission of data e.g. such as an announce message is triggered by reception of the Cell Update Confirm response message at the serving Node B and or serving RNC. In the embodiment of downlink data transmissions are not restricted or delayed until after the Cell Update Confirm response message is transmitted by the target AT but rather can be transmitted before completion of the L1 synchronization procedure. Accordingly it will be appreciated that delay savings in can be found with respect to one or more of i a backhaul delay of the Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete TCRC message between the serving Node B and serving RNC over the Iub ii a processing of the Cell Update Confirm response message by the serving RNC iii a scheduling delay of the transmission of the announce message at the serving Node B and iv the processing delay at the target AT for the announce message received at .

Upon receiving and processing the Cell Update Confirm message in A e.g. after extracting information necessary for HS DSCH decoding such as a channelization code etc. AT immediately transitions to CELL DCH state A. Thus AT begins to decode or monitor the downlink HS DSCH and also has the option of transmitting uplink data on the HS DPCCH e.g. HS DPCCH CQIs ACKs NAKs etc. . It will be appreciated that this monitoring and or transmitting is performed concurrently with the L1 synchronization process e.g. over the DPCCH and or F DPCH .

In A after the Cell Update Confirm message is processed the serving Node B of the RAN and AT begin the synchronization procedure on the DPCCH and or F DPCH e.g. as in of . For example starting in Release 6 a post verification a.k.a. Fast L Sync feature was introduced to facilitate ATs beginning uplink DPCCH transmissions for L1 synchronization as soon as the Cell Update Confirm message is decoded. Accordingly during the L1 synchronization procedure of A the serving Node B of the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the serving Node B of the RAN . Also as discussed above the L synchronization procedure may alternatively be performed over the F DPCH to improve OVSF utilization if the AT engaged in the L1 synchronization procedure when the HS DSCH is configured and the DCH is not configured at the AT.

Before the L1 synchronization completes assume that AT has monitored a sufficient number of messages on the HS DSCH such that AT can derive a CQI that indicates a measured level of channel quality of the HS DSCH messages received at AT . Accordingly AT sends a CQI on the HS DPCCH to the serving Node B of the RAN to report the measured channel quality A. The serving Node B at the RAN can then use the reported CQI to determine a transmission power level and or other transmission criteria by which to send the announce message to AT on the HS DSCH. After evaluating the HS DPCCH CQI the serving Node B of the RAN transmits the call announce message on the downlink HS DSCH to AT A. AT responds to the downlink data on HS DSCH by sending an HARQ ACK on the HS DPCCH A.

Next the L1 synchronization process continues until the DPCCH and or F DPCH at the serving Node B of the RAN and AT is synchronized A. After the L1 synchronization is complete AT transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of A on the uplink DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the Cell Update Confirm response message to the serving RNC A.

After receiving the announce message in A AT can auto accept the announce message e.g. if the announced call is an emergency call can auto reject the announce message e.g. if AT is already engaged in another session or can allow a user of AT to determine whether to accept the announced call. The delay during which AT processes the announce message to determine whether to accept the call corresponds to block A in . For convenience of explanation assume that each of AT determines to accept the announced call and as such AT sends a call accept message on the uplink DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the call accept message to the serving RNC A.

In B after receiving and processing the Cell Update message from AT in B in addition to sending the Cell Update Confirm message over the FACH in B the serving Node B of the RAN also starts a timer for AT B. In an example the expiration period of the timer may correspond to a delay that permits AT 2 time to properly decode the Cell Update Confirm message from B and to tune to one or more channels indicated by the Cell Update Confirm message. In other words the decoding of the Cell Update Confirm message of B at AT is not instantaneous so the serving Node B of the RAN permits each of AT a given amount of time e.g. corresponding to the timer period or expiration period of the timer of B to decode the Cell Update Confirm message before transmitting the announce message received from the serving Node B at B.

Upon receiving and processing the Cell Update Confirm message in B e.g. after extracting information necessary for dedicated channel DCH decoding such as a channelization code etc. AT immediately transitions to CELL DCH state B. Thus AT begins to decode or monitor their respective downlink DCH. It will be appreciated that this monitoring of the DCHs of AT is performed concurrently with the L1 synchronization process over the DPCCH.

In B after the Cell Update Confirm message is processed the serving Node B of the RAN and AT begin the synchronization procedure on the DPCCH e.g. as in of of . For example starting in Release 6 a post verification a.k.a. Fast L Sync feature was introduced to facilitate ATs beginning uplink DPCCH transmissions for L1 synchronization as soon as the Cell Update Confirm message is decoded. Accordingly during the L synchronization procedure of B the serving Node B of the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the RAN .

During the L1 synchronization process the serving Node B of the RAN periodically checks whether the timer started in B has expired B. If the timer has not expired the serving Node B of the RAN refrains from sending the announce message to AT . Otherwise if the serving Node B of the RAN determines that the timer has expired in B the serving Node B of the RAN sends the call announce message on the downlink DCH to AT B.

Next the L1 synchronization process continues until the DPCCH at the serving Node B of the RAN and AT is synchronized B. After the L synchronization is complete AT transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of B on the DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the Cell Update Confirm response message to the serving RNC B. Also it will be appreciated that if the serving Node B of the RAN receives the Cell Update Confirm response message in B before expiration of the timer from B the serving Node B of the RAN sends the announce message despite the timer not yet having expired because the timer in B is to grant AT 2 time to decode the Cell Update Confirm message and the Cell Update Confirm response message is an actual indication that the Cell Update Confirm message has been decoded e.g. although the delay before AT can send the Cell Update Confirm response message makes it unlikely for this scenario to occur at least if the timer is set relatively aggressively .

After receiving the announce message in B AT can auto accept the announce message e.g. if the announced call is an emergency call can auto reject the announce message e.g. if AT is already engaged in another session or can allow a user of AT to determine whether to accept the announced call. The delay during which AT processes the announce message to determine whether to accept the call corresponds to block B in . For convenience of explanation assume that each of AT determines to accept the announced call and as such AT sends a call accept message on the uplink DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B of the RAN which forwards the call accept message to the serving RNC B.

While illustrates an embodiment by which transmission of an announce message is delayed to improve the chances that AT will properly receive the announce message another embodiment can improve the decoding success rate of the announce message by sending multiple repetitions of the announce message as will be described below with respect to .

In C after receiving and processing the Cell Update message from AT in C in addition to sending the Cell Update Confirm message over the FACH in C the serving Node B of the RAN also starts a timer for AT C. In an example the expiration period of the timer of C may correspond to an announce repetition window and can be established such that AT is expected to have the capability to decode an announce message at some point within the announce repetition window. Thus unlike the timer from B of the timer of C in establishes a point after which no further announce messages are sent and not a delay before an initial announce message is sent. In an embodiment the start of the timer in C can be delayed by a given amount of time e.g. an expected propagation time of the Cell Update Confirm message of C plus a minimal expected decoding processing time which can in an example be less than the expiration period of the timer from B of .

Upon receiving and processing the Cell Update Confirm message in C e.g. after extracting information necessary for dedicated channel DCH decoding such as a channelization code etc. AT immediately transitions to CELL DCH state C. Thus AT begins to decode or monitor its downlink DCH. It will be appreciated that this monitoring of the DCH is performed concurrently with the L synchronization process over the DPCCH. In C after the Cell Update Confirm message is processed the serving Node B RAN and AT begin the L synchronization procedure on the DPCCH e.g. as in of FIG. SA and or A of of . For example starting in Release 6 a post verification a.k.a. Fast L Sync feature was introduced to facilitate ATs beginning uplink DPCCH transmissions for L1 synchronization as soon as the Cell Update Confirm message is decoded. Accordingly during the L1 synchronization procedure of C the serving Node B of the RAN sends signaling messages on the downlink DPCCH to AT and AT sends signaling messages on the uplink DPCCH to the serving Node B of the RAN .

During the L1 synchronization process the serving Node B of the RAN periodically sends the call announce message on the downlink DCH to AT at a given interval C. For example the intervals between announce message transmissions at C may correspond to a FACH Transmission Time Interval TTI which is the time unit for physical layer transmissions of MAC packets on the FACH. While the L synchronization process of C continues and the periodic announce messages are sent in C the serving Node B of the RAN tracks the timer started in C and determine whether the timer has expired. If the timer has not expired the L synchronization process on the uplink and downlink of the DPCCH continues and the serving Node B of the RAN continues to send periodic announce messages C C and C. When the serving Node B of the RAN determines that the timer has expired in C the L DPCCH synchronization process continues and the serving Node B of the RAN stops sending periodic announce messages. While not shown in when AT decodes a first announce message of the multiple announce messages AT will ignore further announce messages for the same session.

Next the L1 synchronization process continues until the DPCCH at the serving Node B of the RAN and AT is synchronized C. After the L synchronization is complete AT transmits a Cell Update Confirm response message e.g. a Radio Bearer Reconfiguration Complete message a Transport Channel Reconfiguration Complete message and or a Physical Channel Reconfiguration Complete message based on whether the Radio Bearer Transport Channel or Physical Channel is the higher layer to be reconfigured in the Cell Update Confirm message of B on the uplink DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B at the RAN which forwards the Cell Update Confirm response message to the serving RNC C.

After receiving the announce message s AT can auto accept the announce message e.g. if the announced call is an emergency call can auto reject the announce message e.g. if AT is already engaged in another session or can allow a user of AT to determine whether to accept the announced call. The delay during which AT processes the announce message to determine whether to accept the call corresponds to block C in . For convenience of explanation assume that each of AT determines to accept the announced call and as such AT sends a call accept message on the uplink DCH or E DCH to the serving Node B of the RAN which forwards the call accept message to the serving RNC C.
