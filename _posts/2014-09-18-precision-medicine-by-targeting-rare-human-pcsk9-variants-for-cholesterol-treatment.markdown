It is recognized that individual humans differ in their sequence and recently several individuals have had their genomes sequenced for instance James Watson and Craig Venter. Comparison of the genome sequence of individuals has revealed differences in their sequences in both coding and non coding parts of the genome. Some of these variations in humans are significant and contribute to phenotypic differences between individuals. In extreme cases these will result in genetic disease. The 1000 Genomes Project has the objective of cataloguing sequences in the human genome involving sequencing the genomes of a very large sampling of individuals from diverse art recognized human ethnic populations.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 PCSK9 is a serine protease involved in regulating the levels of the low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR protein Horton et al. 2007 Seidah and Prat 2007 . In vitro experiments have shown that adding PCSK9 to HepG2 cells lowers the levels of cell surface LDLR Benjannet et al. 2004 Lagace et al. 2006 Maxwell et al. 2005 Park et al. 2004 . Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDLR protein in the liver Benjannet et al. 2004 Lagace et al. 2006 Maxwell et al. 2005 Park et al. 2004 while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDLR in the liver Rashid et al. 2005 . Additionally various human PCSK9 mutations that result in either increased or decreased levels of plasma LDL have been identified Kotowski et al. 2006 Zhao et al. 2006 . PCSK9 has been shown to directly interact with the LDLR protein be endocytosed along with the LDLR and co immunofluoresce with the LDLR throughout the endosomal pathway Lagace et al. 2006 .

PCSK9 is a prohormone proprotein convertase in the subtilisin S8 family of serine proteases Seidah et al. 2003 . Humans have nine prohormone proprotein convertases that can be divided between the S8A and S8B subfamilies Rawlings et al. 2006 . Furin PC1 PC3 PC2 PACE4 PC4 PC5 PC6 and PC7 PC8 LPC SPC7 are classified in subfamily S8B. Crystal and NMR structures of different domains from mouse furin and PC1 reveal subtilisin like pro and catalytic domains and a P domain directly C terminal to the catalytic domain Henrich et al. 2003 Tangrea et al. 2002 . Based on the amino acid sequence similarity within this subfamily all seven members are predicted to have similar structures Henrich et al. 2005 . SKI 1 S1P and PCSK9 are classified in subfamily S8A. Sequence comparisons with these proteins also suggest the presence of subtilisin like pro and catalytic domains Sakai et al. 1998 Seidah et al. 2003 Seidah et al. 1999 . In these proteins the amino acid sequence C terminal to the catalytic domain is more variable and does not suggest the presence of a P domain.

Prohormone proprotein convertases are expressed as zymogens and they mature through a multi step process. The function of the pro domain in this process is two fold. The pro domain first acts as a chaperone and is required for proper folding of the catalytic domain Ikemura et al. 1987 . Once the catalytic domain is folded autocatalysis occurs between the pro domain and catalytic domain. Following this initial cleavage reaction the pro domain remains bound to the catalytic domain where it then acts as an inhibitor of catalytic activity Fu et al. 2000 . When conditions are correct maturation proceeds with a second autocatalytic event at a site within the pro domain Anderson et al. 1997 . After this second cleavage event occurs the pro domain and catalytic domain dissociate giving rise to an active protease.

Autocatalysis of the PCSK9 zymogen occurs between Gln152 and Ser153 VFAQ S1P Naureckiene et al. 2003 and has been shown to be required for its secretion from cells Seidah et al. 2003 . A second autocatalytic event at a site within PCSK9 s pro domain has not been observed. Purified PCSK9 is made up of two species that can be separated by non reducing SDS PAGE the pro domain at 17 Kd and the catalytic plus C terminal domains at 65 Kd. PCSK9 has not been isolated without its inhibitory pro domain and measurements of PCSK9 s catalytic activity have been variable Naureckiene et al. 2003 Seidah et al. 2003 .

In certain embodiments a PCSK9 polypeptide includes terminal residues such as but not limited to leader sequence residues targeting residues amino terminal methionine residues lysine residues tag residues and or fusion protein residues. PCSK9 has also been referred to as FH3 NARC1 HCHOLA3 proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 and neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1. The PCSK9 gene encodes a proprotein convertase protein that belongs to the proteinase K subfamily of the secretory subtilase family. The term PCSK9 denotes both the proprotein and the product generated following autocatalysis of the proprotein. When only the autocatalyzed product is being referred to such as for an antigen binding protein or ligand that binds to the cleaved PCSK9 the protein can be referred to as the mature cleaved processed or active PCSK9. When only the inactive form is being referred to the protein can be referred to as the inactive pro form or unprocessed form of PCSK9. The term PCSK9 also encompasses PCSK9 molecules incorporating post translational modifications of the PCSK9 amino acid sequence such as PCSK9 sequences that have been glycosylated PCSK9 sequences from which its signal sequence has been cleaved PCSK9 sequence from which its pro domain has been cleaved from the catalytic domain but not separated from the catalytic domain see e.g. FIGS. 1A and 1B of US20120093818A1 .

Through the application of human genetic variation analysis and rationally designed sequence selection the present invention provides for improved human patient diagnosis and therapy based on human PCSK9 variation. Importantly the invention enables tailored medicines that address individual human patient genotypes or phenotypes.

The inventor s analysis of large numbers of naturally occurring genomic human PCSK9 sequences reveals that there is significant variation across diverse human populations and provides for the ability for correlation between individual human patients and tailored medical and diagnostic approaches addressing the target. The technical applications of these findings as per the present invention thus contribute to better treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans and provides for patient benefit by enabling personalized medicines and therapies. This provides advantages of better prescribing less wastage of medications and improved chances of drug efficacy and better diagnosis in patients.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that some rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention and better serving patients in those populations.

Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in conformation or activity of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients more effectively. The present invention provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer variant forms of a human target of interest TOI that target being human PCSK9.

As sources of genomic sequence variation data the skilled person will be aware of the available databases and resources including updates thereof provided by the following 

The present invention involves the identification and cataloguing of naturally occurring human genomic target sequence variants including those found to be relatively low frequency or rare variants that segregate with specific human ethnic populations and in many individual humans.

An aspect of the invention is based on rational design of sequence selection addressing the desirability to tailor medicaments and diagnostics to rarer but yet still significant groups of human individuals that suffer from or have the potential to suffer from ie who are at risk of a disease or condition mediated or associated with the target of interest. In devising this rational design of the present aspect of the invention the inventor included considerations of the spread of prevalence of naturally occurring target variant sequences across multiple diverse human ethnic populations as well as the importance of addressing such populations where many individuals are likely to display a genotype and or phenotype of one or more of the variants being analysed. As part of this design the inventor saw the importance of adopting the art recognised classifications of human ethnic populations and in this respect the inventor based the analysis and design on the recognised human ethnic populations adopted by the 1000 Genomes Project since this is a resource that is and will continue to be widely adopted by the scientific and medical community.

Thus in this aspect of the invention the inventor designed the following variant sequence selection criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population.

The inventor s selection included as a consideration selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding PCSK9 forms ie non synonymous variations as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.

Optionally further sequence analysis and 3D in silico modelling eg see can also be used as an additional selection criterion variants whose variant amino acid residues versus the most common form of human PCSK9 are surface exposed on the target are desirable for selection since the inventor saw these as contributing to determining the topography of the target and potentially contributing to how and where ligand binding on the target occurs.

The invention provides useful anti target ligands for addressing humans suffering from or likely to suffer from a disease or condition mediated or associated with PCSK9. For example the ligand specifically binds to a PCSK9 variant as per the invention. The ligand may inhibit or antagonise the activity of the PCSK9 target eg the ligand neutralises the target. The skilled person will be familiar with neutralising ligands in general such as antibodies or antibody fragments and can readily test suitable ligands for specific binding and or neutralisation of a target in vitro or in an in vivo assay.

In an example the ligand is or has been determined as a neutraliser of the PCSK9. In an example determination is carried out in a human eg in a clinical trial . In an example determination is carried out in a non human eg in a mouse rat rabbit pig dog sheep or non human primate eg Cynomolgous monkey rhesus monkey or baboon .

An antibody fragment comprises a portion of an intact antibody preferably the antigen binding and or the variable region of the intact antibody. Examples of antibody fragments include dAb Fab Fab F ab 2 and Fv fragments diabodies linear antibodies single chain antibody molecules and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.

In an embodiment the ligand of the invention is or comprises an antibody or antibody fragment for example an antibody or fragment comprising human variable regions and optionally also human constant regions . Anti PCSK9 or PCSK9 binding or targeting antibodies and fragments can be prepared according to any known method eg using transgenic mice eg the Kymouse or Velocimouse or Omnimouse Xenomouse HuMab Mouse or MeMo Mouse rats eg the Omnirat camelids sharks rabbits chickens or other non human animals immunised with the PCSK9 followed optionally by humanisation of the constant regions and or variable regions to produce human or humanised antibodies. In an example display technologies can be used such as yeast phage or ribosome display as will be apparent to the skilled person. Standard affinity maturation eg using a display technology can be performed in a further step after isolation of an antibody lead from a transgenic animal phage display library or other library. Representative examples of suitable technologies are described in US20120093818 Amgen Inc which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety eg the methods set out in paragraphs 0309 to 0346 .

Generally a VELOCIMMUNE or other mouse or rat can be challenged with the antigen of interest and lymphatic cells such as B cells are recovered from the mice that express antibodies. The lymphatic cells may be fused with a myeloma cell line to prepare immortal hybridoma cell lines and such hybridoma cell lines are screened and selected to identify hybridoma cell lines that produce antibodies specific to the antigen of interest. DNA encoding the variable regions of the heavy chain and light chain may be isolated and linked to desirable isotypic constant regions of the heavy chain and light chain. Such an antibody protein may be produced in a cell such as a CHO cell. Alternatively DNA encoding the antigen specific chimaeric antibodies or the variable domains of the light and heavy chains may be isolated directly from antigen specific lymphocytes.

Initially high affinity chimaeric antibodies are isolated having a human variable region and a mouse constant region. As described below the antibodies are characterized and selected for desirable characteristics including affinity selectivity epitope etc. The mouse constant regions are replaced with a desired human constant region to generate the fully human antibody of the invention for example wild type or modified IgG1 or IgG4 for example SEQ ID NO 751 752 753 in US2011 0065902 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety which sequences are incorporated herein by reference for use in the ligands of the present invention . While the constant region selected may vary according to specific use high affinity antigen binding and target specificity characteristics reside in the variable region.

In an example the ligand of the invention is or comprises a nucleic acid eg RNA eg siRNA that hybridises under stringent condition to the PCSK9 variant sequence eg hybridises a nucleotide sequence comprising one or more nucleotides that are variant versus the most common PCSK9 sequence eg with reference to the 1000 Genomes Project database .

For example the nucleic acid hybridises to a region immediately flanking a nucleotide that is variant compared to the corresponding nucleotide of the PCSK9 nucleotide sequence having the highest cumulative human allele frequency and or the highest total human genotype frequency. In an example the nucleic acid hybridises to at two or more such variant nucleotides.

Specific hybridisation is under stringent conditions as will be apparent to the skilled person eg conditions of 5 SSC 5 Denhardt s reagent and 0.5 SDS at 65 C.

Target binding ability specificity and affinity Kd Kand or K can be determined by any routine method in the art eg by surface plasmon resonance SPR . The term Kd as used herein is intended to refer to the equilibrium dissociation constant of a particular antibody antigen interaction.

In one embodiment the surface plasmon resonance SPR is carried out at 25 C. In another embodiment the SPR is carried out at 37 C.

In one embodiment the SPR is carried out at physiological pH such as about pH7 or at pH7.6 eg using Hepes buffered saline at pH7.6 also referred to as HBS EP .

In one embodiment the SPR is carried out at a detergent level of no greater than 0.05 by volume eg in the presence of P20 polysorbate 20 eg Tween 20 at 0.05 and EDTA at 3 mM.

In one example the SPR is carried out at 25 C. or 37 C. in a buffer at pH7.6 150 mM NaCl 0.05 detergent eg P20 and 3 mM EDTA. The buffer can contain 10 mM Hepes. In one example the SPR is carried out at 25 C. or 37 C. in HBS EP. HBS EP is available from Teknova Inc California catalogue number H8022 .

Regeneration of the capture surface can be carried out with 10 mM glycine at pH1.7. This removes the captured antibody and allows the surface to be used for another interaction. The binding data can be fitted to 1 1 model inherent using standard techniques eg using a model inherent to the ProteOn XPR36 analysis software.

In an example the ligand of the invention is contained in a medical container eg a vial syringe IV container or an injection device eg an intraocular or intravitreal injection device . In an example the ligand is in vitro eg in a sterile container. In an example the invention provides a kit comprising the ligand of the invention packaging and instructions for use in treating or preventing or diagnosing in a human a disease or condition mediated by the PCSK9. In an example the instructions indicate that the human should be genotyped for a PCSK9 variant sequence of the invention before administering the ligand to the human. In an example the instructions indicate that the human should be phenotyped for a PCSK9 variant of the invention before administering the ligand to the human. In an example the human is of Chinese eg Han or CHS ethnicity and the instructions are in Chinese eg Mandarin . In an example the instructions comprise directions to administer alirocumab or evolocumab to said human.

The invention addresses the need to treat humans having naturally occurring rarer natural PCSK9 alleles genotypes and phenotypes rarer protein forms . In this respect the invention provides the following aspects.

In an example the nucleotide sequence is selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 29 35 and 37 or selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 29 32 and 34 37 or selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NOs 29 32 34 35 and 37. These are naturally occurring allele haplotype sequences that do not encode 46L and which meet the criteria set out above. These groups comprise variants that are associated with elevated LDL C.

In an example of any aspect the ligand binds or has been determined to bind two three four or more human PCSK9 selected from the group consisting forms f c r p m e h aj and q.

In an example of any aspect the ligand comprises a protein domain that specifically binds to PCSK9 eg a human PCSK9 selected from the group consisting forms f c r p m e h aj and q.

Specific binding can be characterized by an equilibrium dissociation constant of at least about 1 10M or less e.g. a smaller KD denotes a tighter binding . Methods for determining whether two molecules specifically bind are well known in the art and include for example equilibrium dialysis surface plasmon resonance and the like. An isolated antibody that specifically binds a human PCSK9 may however exhibit cross reactivity to other antigens such as a PCSK9 molecule from another species. Moreover multi specific antibodies e.g. bispecifics that bind to human PCSK9 and one or more additional antigens are nonetheless considered antibodies that specifically bind PCSK9 as used herein.

Ordinarily however an isolated polypeptide or antibody will be prepared by at least one purification step.

The invention encompasses the ligand eg antibody conjugated to a therapeutic moiety immunoconjugate such as a cytotoxin a chemotherapeutic drug an immunosuppressant or a radioisotope. Cytotoxin agents include any agent that is detrimental to cells. Examples of suitable cytotoxin agents and chemotherapeutic agents for forming immunoconjugates are known in the art see for example WO 05 103081 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

The antibodies of the present invention may be monospecific bispecific or multispecific. Multispecific mAbs may be specific for different epitopes of one target polypeptide or may contain antigen binding domains specific for more than one target polypeptide. See e.g. Tutt et al. 1991 J. Immunol. 147 60 69. The human anti PCSK9 eg anti PCSK9 mAbs can be linked to or co expressed with another functional molecule e.g. another peptide or protein. For example an antibody or fragment thereof can be functionally linked e.g. by chemical coupling genetic fusion noncovalent association or otherwise to one or more other molecular entities such as another antibody or antibody fragment to produce a bispecific or a multispecific antibody with a second binding specificity.

An exemplary bi specific antibody format that can be used in the context of the present invention involves the use of a first immunoglobulin Ig CH3 domain and a second Ig CH3 domain wherein the first and second Ig CH3 domains differ from one another by at least one amino acid and wherein at least one amino acid difference reduces binding of the bispecific antibody to Protein A as compared to a bi specific antibody lacking the amino acid difference. In one embodiment the first Ig CH3 domain binds Protein A and the second Ig CH3 domain contains a mutation that reduces or abolishes Protein A binding such as an H95R modification by IMGT exon numbering H435R by EU numbering . The second CH3 may further comprise a Y96F modification by IMGT Y436F by EU . Further modifications that may be found within the second CH3 include D16E L18M N44S K52N V57M and V821 by IMGT D356E L358M N384S K392N V397M and V422I by EU in the case of IgG1 antibodies N44S K52N and V82I IMGT N384S K392N and V422I by EU in the case of IgG2 antibodies and Q15R N44S K52N V57M R69K E79Q and V82I by IMGT Q355R N3845 K392N V397M R409K E419Q and V422I by EU in the case of IgG4 antibodies. Variations on the bi specific antibody format described above are contemplated within the scope of the present invention.

The invention provides therapeutic methods for treating a human patient in need of a composition or ligand of the invention. While modifications in lifestyle and conventional drug treatment are often successful in reducing cholesterol levels not all patients are able to achieve the recommended target cholesterol levels with such approaches. Various conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia FH appear to be resistant to lowering of LDL C levels in spite of aggressive use of conventional therapy. Homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hoFH heFH is a condition associated with premature atherosclerotic vascular disease. However patients diagnosed with hoFH are largely unresponsive to conventional drug therapy and have limited treatment options. Specifically treatment with statins which reduce LDL C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor may have little effect in patients whose LDL receptors are non existent or defective. A mean LDL C reduction of only less than about 20 has been recently reported in patients with genotype confirmed hoFH treated with the maximal dose of statins. The addition of ezetimibe 10 mg day to this regimen resulted in a total reduction of LDL C levels of 27 which is still far from optimal. Likewise many patients are statin non responsive poorly controlled with statin therapy or cannot tolerate statin therapy in general these patients are unable to achieve cholesterol control with alternative treatments. There is a large unmet medical need for new treatments that can address the short comings of current treatment options.

Specific populations treatable by the therapeutic methods of the invention include patients indicated for LDL apheresis subjects with PCSK9 activating GOF mutations heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia heFH subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia who are statin intolerant or statin uncontrolled and subjects at risk for developing hypercholesterolemia who may be preventably treated.

The invention provides therapeutic compositions comprising the anti PCSK9 ligands antibodies or antigen binding fragments thereof of the present invention. The administration of therapeutic compositions in accordance with the invention will be administered with suitable carriers excipients and other agents that are incorporated into formulations to provide improved transfer delivery tolerance and the like. A multitude of appropriate formulations can be found in the formulary known to all pharmaceutical chemists Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mack Publishing Company Easton Pa. These formulations include for example powders pastes ointments jellies waxes oils lipids lipid cationic or anionic containing vesicles such as LIPOFECTINT DNA conjugates anhydrous absorption pastes oil in water and water in oil emulsions emulsions carbowax polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights semi solid gels and semi solid mixtures containing carbowax. See also Powell et al. Compendium of excipients for parenteral formulations PDA 1998 J Pharm Sci Technol 52 238 311.

The dose may vary depending upon the age and the size of a subject to be administered target disease conditions route of administration and the like. When the ligand eg antibody of the present invention is used for treating various conditions and diseases associated with PCSK9 including hypercholesterolemia disorders associated with LDL and apolipoprotein B and lipid metabolism disorders and the like in an adult patient it is advantageous to intravenously administer the ligand or antibody of the present invention normally at a single dose of about 0.01 to about 20 mg kg body weight more preferably about 0.02 to about 7 about 0.03 to about 5 or about 0.05 to about 3 mg kg body weight. Depending on the severity of the condition the frequency and the duration of the treatment can be adjusted.

Various delivery systems are known and can be used to administer the pharmaceutical composition of the invention thus the composition invention provides the ligand by e.g. encapsulation in liposomes microparticles microcapsules recombinant cells capable of expressing the mutant viruses receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu et al. 1987 J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 . Methods of introduction include but are not limited to intradermal intramuscular intraperitoneal intravenous subcutaneous intranasal epidural and oral routes. The composition may be administered by any convenient route for example by infusion or bolus injection by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings e.g. oral mucosa rectal and intestinal mucosa etc. and may be administered together with other biologically active agents. Administration can be systemic or local.

The pharmaceutical composition can be also delivered in a vesicle in particular a liposome see Langer 1990 Science 249 1527 1533 Treat et al. 1989 in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer Lopez Berestein and Fidler eds.

In certain situations the pharmaceutical composition can be delivered in a controlled release system. In one embodiment a pump may be used see Langer supra Sefton 1987 CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14 201 . In another embodiment polymeric materials can be used see Medical Applications of Controlled Release Langer and Wise eds. CRC Pres. Boca Raton Fla. 1974 . In yet another embodiment a controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the composition s target thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose see e.g. Goodson in Medical Applications of Controlled Release supra vol. 2 pp. 115 138 1984 .

The injectable preparations may include dosage forms for intravenous subcutaneous intracutaneous and intramuscular injections drip infusions etc. These injectable preparations may be prepared by methods publicly known. For example the injectable preparations may be prepared e.g. by dissolving suspending or emulsifying the antibody or its salt described above in a sterile aqueous medium or an oily medium conventionally used for injections. As the aqueous medium for injections there are for example physiological saline an isotonic solution containing glucose and other auxiliary agents etc. which may be used in combination with an appropriate solubilizing agent such as an alcohol e.g. ethanol a polyalcohol e.g. propylene glycol polyethylene glycol a nonionic surfactant e.g. polysorbate 80 HCO 50 polyoxyethylene 50 mol adduct of hydrogenated castor oil etc. As the oily medium there are employed e.g. sesame oil soybean oil etc. which may be used in combination with a solubilizing agent such as benzyl benzoate benzyl alcohol etc. The injection thus prepared is preferably filled in an appropriate ampoule. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be delivered subcutaneously or intravenously with a standard needle and syringe. In addition with respect to subcutaneous delivery a pen delivery device readily has applications in delivering a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Such a pen delivery device can be reusable or disposable. A reusable pen delivery device generally utilizes a replaceable cartridge that contains a pharmaceutical composition. Once all of the pharmaceutical composition within the cartridge has been administered and the cartridge is empty the empty cartridge can readily be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge that contains the pharmaceutical composition. The pen delivery device can then be reused. In a disposable pen delivery device there is no replaceable cartridge. Rather the disposable pen delivery device comes prefilled with the pharmaceutical composition held in a reservoir within the device. Once the reservoir is emptied of the pharmaceutical composition the entire device is discarded.

Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to a congnate human receptor or protein or inhibiting PCSK9 mediated activities.

The invention encompasses anti PCSK9 eg PCSK9 antibody ligands having a modified glycosylation pattern. In some applications modification to remove undesirable glycosylation sites may be useful or e.g. removal of a fucose moiety to increase antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ADCC function see Shield et al. 2002 JBC 277 26733 . In other applications modification of galactosylation can be made in order to modify complement dependent cytotoxicity CDC .

In an example the invention features a pharmaceutical composition comprising a ligand of the invention wherein the ligand is or comprises a recombinant human antibody or fragment thereof which specifically binds the PCSK9 eg a rare variant as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In one embodiment the invention features a composition which is a combination of an antibody ligand or antigen binding fragment of an antibody of the invention and a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be any of an anti inflammatory agent an anti angiogenesis agent a painkiller a diuretic a chemotherapeutic agent an anti neoplastic agent a vasodilator a vasoconstrictor a statin a beta blocker a nutrient an adjuvant an anti obesity agent and an anti diabetes agent.

 Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the USA Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals including humans. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier excipient or adjuvant refers to an carrier excipient or adjuvant that can be administered to a subject together with an agent e.g. any antibody or antibody chain described herein and which does not destroy the pharmacological activity thereof and is nontoxic when administered in doses sufficient to deliver a therapeutic amount of the agent.

The disorder treated is any disease or condition which is improved ameliorated inhibited or prevented by removal inhibition or reduction of PCSK9 activity.

By the phrase therapeutically effective amount is meant an amount that produces the desired effect for which it is administered. The exact amount will depend on the purpose of the treatment and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques see for example Lloyd 1999 The Art Science and Technology of Pharmaceutical Compounding .

The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate genotyping and application to the invention. These include the following.

Reference is also made to GB2444410A and the genotyping method disclosed therein which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Miniaturized assays such as microarrays with oligonucleotide reagents immobilized on small surfaces are frequently proposed for large scale mutation analysis and high throughput genotyping Large scale identification mapping and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human genome Wang D G Fan J B Siao C J Berno A Young P Sapolsky R Ghandour G Perkins N Winchester E Spencer J Kruglyak L Stein L Hsie L Topaloglou T Hubbell E Robinson E Mittmann M Morris M S Shen N Kilburn D Rioux J Nusbaum C Rozen S Hudson T J Lipshutz R Chee M Lander E S Science. 1998 May 15 280 5366 1077 82 .

An approach for a fully automated large scale SNP analysis is the homogeneous assay i.e. a single phase assay without separation steps permitting continual monitoring during amplification. The TaqMan assay Applied Biosystems originally designed for quantitative real time PCR is a homogeneous single step assay also used in determination of mutation status of DNA see eg A. A. Komar ed. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Methods in Molecular Biology 578 DOI 10.1007 978 1 60327 411 119 Humana Press a part of Springer Science Business Media LLC and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Methods in Molecular Biology Volume 578 2009 pp 293 306 The TaqMan Method for SNP Genotyping Gong Qing Shen et al . The TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay exploits the 5 exonuclease activity of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase to cleave a doubly labeled probe hybridized to the SNP containing sequence of ssDNA. Cleavage separates a 5 fluorophore from a 3 quencher leading to detectable fluorescent signal. The use of two allele specific probes carrying different fluorophores permits SNP determination in the same tube without any post PCR processing. Genotype is determined from the ratio of intensities of the two fluorescent probes at the end of amplification. Thus rather than taking advantage of the full set of real time PCR data as in quantitative studies only end point data are used.

TaqMan SNP genotyping in a high throughput automated manner is facilitated by the use of validated Pre made TaqMan Genotyping assays but Custom TaqMan Assays may also be used High throughput genotyping with single nucleotide polymorphisms Ranade K Chang M S Ting C T Pei D Hsiao C F Olivier M Pesich R Hebert J Chen Y D Dzau V J Curb D Olshen R Risch N Cox D R Botstein D Genome Res. 2001 July 11 7 1262 8 Assessment of two flexible and compatible SNP genotyping platforms TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays and the SNPlex Genotyping System De la Vega F M Lazaruk K D Rhodes M D Wenz M H Mutat Res. 2005 Jun. 3 573 1 2 111 35 . The results of the assay can be automatically determined by genotyping software provided with real time thermal cyclers e.g. IQ software of Bio Rad Sequence Detection Software of Applied Biosystems .

Single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs can be determined using TaqMan real time PCR assays Applied Biosystems and commercial software that assigns genotypes based on reporter probe signals at the end of amplification. An algorithm for automatic genotype calling of SNPs using the full course of TaqMan real time data is available for use A. Callegaro et al Nucleic Acids Res. 2006 34 7 e56 Published online 2006 April 14. doi 10.1093 nar gk1185 PMCID PMC1440877 . The algorithm is unique in that it classifies samples according to the behavior of blanks no DNA samples which cluster with heterozygous samples. This method of classification eliminates the need for positive controls and permits accurate genotyping even in the absence of a genotype class for example when one allele is rare.

The skilled person will be familiar with techniques that can be used for accurate phenotyping and application to the invention. These include the use of amino acid sequencing of isolated target protein and comparison of sequences from different variants eg with the most common variant . An antibody that specifically and selectively binds in the area of a SNP under stringent conditions can also be used to identify a particular variant. In another method the genotype is determined and a corresponding amino acid sequence phenotype determined eg by in silico translation.

Polynucleotide changes can result in amino acid substitutions additions deletions fusions and truncations in the polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence. Some aspects use include insertion variants deletion variants or substituted variants with substitutions of amino acids including insertions and substitutions of amino acids and other molecules that do not normally occur in the peptide sequence that is the basis of the variant for example but not limited to insertion of ornithine which do not normally occur in human proteins. The term conservative substitution when describing a polypeptide refers to a change in the amino acid composition of the polypeptide that does not substantially alter the polypeptide s activity. For example a conservative substitution refers to substituting an amino acid residue for a different amino acid residue that has similar chemical properties. Conservative amino acid substitutions include replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate or a threonine with a serine.

 Conservative amino acid substitutions result from replacing one amino acid with another having similar structural and or chemical properties such as the replacement of a leucine with an isoleucine or valine an aspartate with a glutamate or a threonine with a serine. Thus a conservative substitution of a particular amino acid sequence refers to substitution of those amino acids that are not critical for polypeptide activity or substitution of amino acids with other amino acids having similar properties e.g. acidic basic positively or negatively charged polar or non polar etc. such that the substitution of even critical amino acids does not reduce the activity of the peptide i.e. the ability of the peptide to penetrate the blood brain barrier BBB . Conservative substitution tables providing functionally similar amino acids are well known in the art. For example the following six groups each contain amino acids that are conservative substitutions for one another 1 Alanine A Serine S Threonine T 2 Aspartic acid D Glutamic acid E 3 Asparagine N Glutamine Q 4 Arginine R Lysine K 5 Isoleucine I Leucine L Methionine M Valine V and 6 Phenylalanine F Tyrosine Y Tryptophan W . See also Creighton Proteins W. H. Freeman and Company 1984 incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments individual substitutions deletions or additions that alter add or delete a single amino acid or a small percentage of amino acids can also be considered conservative substitutions if the change does not reduce the activity of the peptide. Insertions or deletions are typically in the range of about 1 to 5 amino acids. The choice of conservative amino acids may be selected based on the location of the amino acid to be substituted in the peptide for example if the amino acid is on the exterior of the peptide and expose to solvents or on the interior and not exposed to solvents.

In alternative embodiments one can select the amino acid which will substitute an existing amino acid based on the location of the existing amino acid i.e. its exposure to solvents i.e. if the amino acid is exposed to solvents or is present on the outer surface of the peptide or polypeptide as compared to internally localized amino acids not exposed to solvents . Selection of such conservative amino acid substitutions are well known in the art for example as disclosed in Dordo et al J. MoI Biol 1999 217 721 739 and Taylor et al J. Theor. Biol. 119 1986 205 218 and S. French and B. Robson J. MoI. Evol. 19 1983 171. Accordingly one can select conservative amino acid substitutions suitable for amino acids on the exterior of a protein or peptide i.e. amino acids exposed to a solvent for example but not limited to the following substitutions can be used substitution of Y with F T with S or K P with A E with D or Q N with D or G R with K G with N or A T with S or K D with N or E I with L or V F with Y S with T or A R with K G with N or A K with R A with S K or P.

In alternative embodiments one can also select conservative amino acid substitutions encompassed suitable for amino acids on the interior of a protein or peptide for example one can use suitable conservative substitutions for amino acids is on the interior of a protein or peptide i.e. the amino acids are not exposed to a solvent for example but not limited to one can use the following conservative substitutions where Y is substituted with F T with A or S I with L or V W with Y M with L N with D G with A T with A or S D with N I with L or V F with Y or L S with A or T and A with S G T or V. In some embodiments non conservative amino acid substitutions are also encompassed within the term of variants.

Some embodiments of the technology described herein can be defined according to any of the following numbered paragraphs 

The present invention provides anti PCSK9 ligands and PCSK9 binding or targeting ligands as described herein. The ligands have a variety of utilities. Some of the ligands for instance are useful in specific binding assays for genotyping or phenotyping humans affinity purification of PCSK9 in particular human PCSK9 or its ligands and in screening assays to identify other antagonists of PCSK9 activity. Some of the ligands of the invention are useful for inhibiting binding of PCSK9 to LDLR or inhibiting PCSK9 mediated activities.

Anti PCSK9 ligands eg antibodies and anti sense RNA have been developed based on targeting and neutralising so called wild type human PCSK9 which is a commonly occurring form see eg US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 . While such therapies are useful for human patients harbouring this form of human PCSK9 the inventor considered it useful to investigate the possibility of targeting much rarer but still naturally occurring forms of PCSK9 amongst human populations. In this way the inventor arrived at insight into the natural occurrences and distributions of rarer human PCSK9 forms that can serve as useful targets at the protein or nucleic acid level for human treatment prophylaxis and diagnosis pertinent to diseases and conditions mediated or associated with PCSK9 activity. This particularly provides for tailored therapies prophylaxis and diagnosis in humans that are devoid of the common PCSK9 gene or protein ie the form a or a as used in US20120093818A1 and US20110065902A1 to generate antibodies .

The skilled person will know that SNPs or other changes that translate into amino acid variation can cause variability in activity and or conformation of human targets to be addressed. This has spawned great interest in personalized medicine where genotyping and knowledge of protein and nucleotide variability is used to more effectively tailor medicines and diagnosis of patients. The invention therefore provides for tailored pharmaceuticals and testing that specifically addresses rarer PCSK9 polymorphic variant forms. Such forms or alleles at the nucleotide level in many of the examples determined by the inventor comprise multiple changes at the nucleotide and amino acid levels from the corresponding common form nucleotide and amino acids sequences ie there are multiple non synonymous changes at the nucleotide level that translate into multiple corresponding changes in the protein target in humans.

Furthermore the inventor surprisingly realised that the rarer natural forms although present in humans at much lower frequencies than the common form nevertheless are represented in multiple and ethnically diverse human populations and usually with many human examples per represented ethnic population. Thus the inventor realised that targeting such rarer forms would provide for effective treatment prophylaxis or diagnosis across many human ethnic populations thereby extending the utility of the present invention.

With this realisation the inventor realised that there is significant industrial and medical application for the invention in terms of guiding the choice of anti PCSK9 ligand for administration to human patients for therapy and or prophylaxis of PCSK9 mediated or associated diseases or conditions. In this way the patient receives drugs and ligands that are tailored to their needs as determined by the patient s genetic or phenotypic makeup. Hand in hand with this the invention provides for the genotyping and or phenotyping of patients in connection with such treatment thereby allowing a proper match of drug to patient. This increases the chances of medical efficacy reduces the likelihood of inferior treatment using drugs or ligands that are not matched to the patient eg poor efficacy and or side effects and avoids pharmaceutical mis prescription and waste.

In developing this thinking in this non limiting example the present inventor decided to determine a set of human PCSK9 variants on the basis of the following criteria these being criteria that the inventor realised would provide for useful medical drugs and diagnostics to tailored need in the human population. The inventor selected variants having at least 3 of the 4 following criteria 

On the basis of these criteria the inventor identified the variants listed in Table 1 below excluding form a .

The inventor s selection included as a consideration selection for nucleotide variation that produced amino acid variation in corresponding PCSK9 forms ie non synonymous variations as opposed to silent variations that do not alter amino acid residues in the target protein.

Further sequence analysis and 3D in silico modelling see revealed that selected variants also fulfilled the following additional selection criteria 

As shown in identified positions 425 443 474 619 and 670 found in the selected variants of the invention are all surface exposed and outside of the pro domain. Variant positions 425 and 443 are surface exposed on the catalytic domain while variant positions 474 619 and 670 are surface exposed on the C terminal domain.

The inventor thus applied the novel selection criteria to determine rare variant forms of human PCSK9 realising the utility of their nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the various configurations aspects clauses embodiments and example of the invention herein and thereby providing for novel personalized medical and diagnostic applications as described above.

The invention includes the possibility to tailor treatment of humans further by selecting antibody based ligands with variable domains based on gene segments commonly found in humans of the ethnic populations where the variant PCSK9 forms are found to meet the selection criteria of the invention. An example is provided below for ligands comprising antibody VH domains derived from recombination of human VH3 23.

The inventor analysed the frequencies and distribution of various human VH3 23 alleles and realised the desirability of using ligands based on human VH3 23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819. This SNP corresponds to a change from leucine at position 24 in the encoded protein sequence to a valine at that position L24V change and the SNP is at coordinate 106268889 on human chromosome 14.

Notably human VH3 23 alleles comprising SNP rs56069819 were found in the CEU population at a frequency that is almost double the frequency of 11 for all populations. For the ASW and YRI populations the frequency was over a quarter of the population. Thus the invention advantageously enables one to select a ligand comprising an antibody or antibody fragment wherein the antibody or fragment comprises a VH domain derived from the recombination of a human VH gene segment a human D gene segment and a human JH gene segment the VH gene segment comprising a nucleotide sequence that comprises SNP rs56069819 dbSNP numbering build number as recited above .

In an example one can tailor the treatment further by selecting such a ligand that specifically binds to a human PCSK9 selected from forms f c m e h p q and aj such forms being those appearing in human populations ASW LWK YRI CEU and GBR.

In an example the VH gene segment is VH3 23 04 which is a commonly found variant that comprises SNP rs56069819 in human populations ASW LWK YRI CEU and GBR.

In an example the ligand is for treating and or preventing a PCSK9 mediated disease or condition in a human that expresses a human PCSK9 selected from forms f c m e h p q and aj.
