Adrenoreceptor receptors ARs belong to the family of the G protein coupled receptors. They bind to the pertussis toxin sensitive inhibitory G protein Gand Gand reduce adenylate cyclase activity. They are involved in the mediation of diverse physiological effects in various tissues following stimulation by endogenous catecholamines adrenaline noradrenaline which are either released by synapses or reach the site of action via the blood. AR play an important physiological role mainly for the cardiovascular system but also in the central nervous system. Biochemical physiological and pharmacological studies have shown that in addition to various al AR subtypes there are three AR subtypes and in many target cells and tissues of cardiovascular relevance which makes them attractive target proteins for therapeutic interventions. However the elucidation of the precise physiological task of the receptor subtypes remains difficult because of a lack of highly selective ligands and or antagonists of the respective AR Gyires et al. Adrenoceptor subtypes mediated physiological pharmacological actions Neurochemistry International 55 447 453 2009 Tan and Limbird The Adrenergic Receptors Adrenergic Receptors in the 21st Century Receptors 2005 241 265 .

Cardiovascular changes such as for example the regulation of the contractility of the heart are regulated firstly by the central modulation of the sympathetic efferent nerves. Furthermore the sympathetic efferent system also regulates direct effects on smooth muscle cells and the endothelial cells of the vessels. Thus the sympathetic system is involved in the regulation of the output performance of the heart but also in the control of local perfusion of various vascular beds. This is also controlled via ARs involved in the regulation of the peripheral resistance. Thus blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres which run in the adventitia and whose endings are provided with varicosities for the release of noradrenaline. Released noradrenaline modulates via the AR in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells the respective local vascular tone.

In addition to the effects on the sympathetic efferent nerves the peripheral cardiovascular function is also regulated by pre and postsynaptic AR. Smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells express different AR subtypes. The activation of and receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to contraction with resulting vasoconstriction Kanagy Clinical Science 109 431 437 2005 . However the distribution of the respective receptor subtypes varies in the different vascular beds between the species and between different vessel sizes. Thus AR appear to be expressed virtually exclusively in large arteries whereas AR contribute more to the vascular tone in small arteries and veins. AR appears to play a role in salt induced hypertension Gyires et al. Adrenoceptor subtypes mediated physiological pharmacological actions Neurochemistry International 55 447 453 2009 . The role of AR on haemodynamics is not yet completely understood however AR receptors appear to mediate venous vasoconstriction. They are also involved in cold induced enhancement of adrenoceptor induced vasoconstriction Chotani et al. Silent adrenergic receptors enable cold induced vasoconstriction in cutaneous arteries. Am J Physiol 278 H1075 H1083 2000 Gyires et al. Adrenoceptor subtypes mediated physiological pharmacological actions Neurochemistry International 55 447 453 2009 . Cold and other factors e.g. tissue proteins oestrogen regulate the functional coupling of AR to intracellular signal pathways Chotani et al. Distinct cAMP signaling pathways differentially regulate adrenenoxceptor expression role in serum induction in human arteriolar smooth muscle cells. Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 288 H69 H76 2005 . For this reason it makes sense to investigate selective inhibitors of AR subtypes for their perfusion modulating effect on different vascular beds under different pathophysiological conditions.

Under pathophysiological conditions the adrenergic system may be activated which can lead for example to hypertension heart failure increased platelet activation endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis angina pectoris myocardial infarction thromboses peripheral circulatory disturbances stroke and sexual dysfunction. Thus for example the pathophysiology of Raynaud s syndrome and scleroderma is substantially unclear but is associated with a changed adrenergic activity. Thus patients suffering from spastic Raynaud s syndrome show for example a significantly elevated expression of AR receptoren on their platelets. This may be connected with the vasospastic attacks observed in these patients Keenan and Porter Adrenergic receptors in platelets from patients with Raynaud s syndrome Surgery V94 2 1983 .

By virtue of the expected high efficiency and low level of side effects a possible treatment for such disorders targeting the modulation of the activated adrenergic system in organisms is a promising approach. In particular in diabetics who frequently have elevated catecholamine levels peripheral circulatory disturbances microangiopathies such as diabetic retinopathy nephropathy or else pronounced wound healing disorders diabetic foot ulcers play a large role. In peripheral occlusive disease diabetes mellitus is one of the most important comorbidities and also plays a crucial role in the progression of the disease micro and macroangiopathy . Higher expression of the adrenoreceptor receptors associated with elevated catecholamine levels may be involved in these pathophysiological processes in diabetics.

In 2011 there were 350 million diabetics world wide 6.6 of the population and this number is expected to double by 2028. Diabetic foot ulcers are the most frequent cause of hospitalizations of diabetics. The risk of a diabetic developing a diabetic foot ulcer in his or her lifetime is 15 25 15 of all diabetic foot ulcers lead to amputation. World wide 40 70 of all non traumatic amputations are carried out on diabetics. Risk factors for diabetic foot ulcers are traumata poor metabolic control sensory motoric and autonomous polyneuropathy inappropriate footwear infections and peripheral arterial disorders. The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers requires interdisciplinary teams and employs a multifactor approach weight loss revascularization in the case of peripheral arterial occlusive disease PAOD improvements in metabolic control wound excision dressings dalteparin Regranex PDGF and amputation. The treatment costs per diabetic foot ulcer without amputation are 7000 10 000 USD. 33 of all diabetic foot ulcers do not heal within 2 years and there is a high relapse rate 34 within the first year 61 over 3 years .

Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to provide novel selective adrenoreceptor receptor antagonists for the treatment and or prophylaxis of diseases such as for example cardiovascular disorders in humans and animals.

Wistar rats Hsd Cpb Wu of a weight of 250 350 g or ZDF rats ZDF Crl Lepr fa fa of a weight of 330 520 g are anaesthetized using 2.5 isoflurane in an oxygen laughing gas mixture 40 60 . To determine the blood flow in the carotid artery and the femoral artery the anaesthetized rat is brought into a supine position and the left carotid artery and the right femoral artery are then carefully exposed. Blood flow is measured by placing flow probes Transonic Flowprobe at the vessels. By introducing a PE50 artery catheter into the left femoral artery blood pressure and heart rate are determined Transducer Ref. 5203660 from Braun CH . The substances are administered as a bole injection or a continuous infusion via a venous catheter in the left femoral vein.

Following the preparation of the animals there is a 5 min baseline interval. Infusion of the AR alpha2C antagonist is then started. In the steady state 32 min after the start of the experiment the femoral flow is determined in relation difference to the initial flow.

To reduce perfusion the right external iliac artery in anaesthetized for example anaesthesia by inhalating isoflurane enflurane rats for example ZDF Crl Lepr fa fa is ligated under sterile conditions. Depending on the degree of collateralization of the animals it is additionally necessary to ligate the femoral artery to reduce perfusion. After the operation or else preventatively the test animals are treated orally intragastrically uptake by stomach tube or through feed or drinking water intraperitoneally intravenously intraarterially intramuscularly inhalatively or subcutaneously with the test substances. The test substances are administered enterally or parenterally once or more than once per day over a period of up to 50 weeks or administration is continuous via subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pumps for example Alzet pumps . During the experiment microperfusion and temperature of the lower extremities are documented. Here under anaesthesia a temperature sensitive laser doppler probe Periflux is fastened with adhesive to the paws of the rats allowing the measurement of microperfusion and skin temperature. Depending on the test protocol samples such as blood interim diagnostics and other bodily fluids urine or organs are removed to carry out further in vitro examinations or to document haemodynamics blood pressure and heart rate are measured via a catheter in the carotid artery. At the end of the experiment the animals are painlessly sacrificed.

In diabetic ZDFfa fa and healthy rats Wistar a laser doppler probe was fastened under anaesthesia conditions isoflurane anaesthesia at the sole of the paw for measuring cutaneous microcirculation. The test animals were once treated orally with the test substances. During the experiment microperfusion and temperature of the lower extremities were documented continuously. Here a temperature sensitive laser doppler probe Periflux 02C was fastened with adhesive to the paws of the animals allowing the measurement of microperfusion and skin temperature. The microcirculation measurement values were measured on both paws 30 min after oral administration of the test substance. From these data means were calculated and compared to those of placebo treated animals. What is shown are the minimum effective doses MED where the test substances showed a significantly improved microcirculation compared with placebo vehicle 10 EtOH 30 PEG400 60 water for injection 1 ml kg and the factor by which microcirculation is improved at this dose compared to placebo. Also stated is the MED for the significant increase of skin temperature ttest .

Over the entire duration of the test plasma and urine parameters are determined.

Healthy Mongrel dogs Marshall BioResources Marshall Farms Inc Clyde N.Y. USA or Mongrel dogs suffering from heart failure of both sexes and having a weight of 25 35 kg are used. Anaesthesia is initiated by slow i.v. administration of 25 mg kg sodium thiopental Trapanal and 0.15 mg kg alcuronium chloride Alloferin and maintained during the experiment by means of a continuous infusion of 0.04 mg kg h fentanyl Fentanyl 0.25 mg kg h droperidol Dihydrobenzperidol and 15 g kg h alcuronium chloride Alloferin . After intubation the animals are ventilated by the ventilator at a constant respiratory volume such that an end tidal COconcentration of about 5 is achieved. Ventilation is performed with room air enriched with about 30 oxygen normoxia . To measure the haemodynamic parameters a liquid filled catheter is implanted into the femoral artery for measuring blood pressure. A Swan Ganz catheter having two lumens is introduced in a flow directed manner via the jugular vein into the pulmonary artery distal lumen for measuring the pressure in the pulmonary artery proximal lumen for measuring the central vein pressure . Using a temperature sensor at the tip of the catheter the continuous cardiac output CCO is determined. Blood flow is measured at various vascular beds such as the coronary artery the carotid artery or the femoral artery by placing flow probes Transonic Flowprobe at the vessels in question. The pressure in the left ventricle is measured after introduction of a microtip catheter Millar Instruments via the carotid artery into the left ventricle and the dP dt ratio as a measure of contractility is derived therefrom. Substances are administered i.v. via the femoral vein or intraduodenally as cumulative dose activity curve bolus or continuous infusion . The haemodynamic signals are recorded and evaluated by means of pressure transducers amplifiers and PONEMAH as data aquisition software.

To induce heart failure a pacemaker is implanted into the dogs under sterile conditions. After induction of anaesthesia with pentobarbital Na 15 to 30 mg kgi.v. followed by intubation and subsequent ventilation room air Sulla 808 Dr ger Germany anaesthesia is maintained by continuous infusion of pentobarbital 1 5 mg kgh and fentanyl 10 40 g kgh . A pacemaker cable Setrox S60 Biotronik Germany is implanted via an incision of the left jugular vein and placed in the right ventricle. The cable is connected to the pacemaker Logos Biotronik Germany which is positioned in a small subcutaneous pocket between the shoulder blades. Ventricular pacing is started only 7 days after the surgical intervention to obtain heart failure at a frequency of 220 beats min over a period of 10 28 days.

Rats which are forced to swim in a narrow room from which there is no escape adapt after an initial phase of increased activity by adopting a characteristic rigid posture and only carry out those movements which are absolutely required to keep the head above the water. This immobility can be reduced by a number of clinically active antidepressants e.g. Cryan J F Markou A Lucki I. Assessing antidepressant activity in rodents recent developments and future needs. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002 23 238 245 . The method used here is based on the protocol of Porsolt et al. Porsolt R D Anton G Blavet N Jalfre M. Behavioural despair in rats a new model sensitive to antidepressant treatments. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1978 47379 91 and Porsolt R D Brossard G Hautbois C Roux S. Rodent models of depression forced swimming and tail suspension behavioral despair tests in rats and mice. Curr. Protoc. Neurosci. 2001 Chapter 8 Unit 8.10A 1 10 and De Vry et al. De Vry J Maurel S Schreiber R de Beun R Jentzsch K R. Comparison of hypericum extracts with imipramine and fluoxetine in animal models of depression and alcoholism. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacology 1999 9 461 468 . In two sessions training and test at an interval of 24 h the rats are forced to swim in a narrow cylinder filled with water from which there is no escape. The training session duration 15 min is carried out before the treatment with substance without recording the behaviour in order to familiarize the rats with the 5 minute test session 24 h later. During both sessions the rats are individually placed into the cylinders filled with water which are optically separated from one another. After the session the rats are removed from the water and dried. About 24 5 and 1 h prior to the test session the rats are treated with test substance or vehicle solution the first administration takes place immediately after the training session. 3 substance administrations prior to the test session lead to more stable pharmacological results than a single administration. The test sessions are recorded electronically using a surveillance video camera and after storage analysed off line using a computer. For each animal the behaviour is analysed by 3 4 independent observers who score the total time of immobility in seconds over the 5 minute test session.

Passive behaviour or immobility is defined as a rat which drifts in the water in an upright position and makes only small movements to keep the head above the water or to maintain its body in a balanced stable position. In contrast active behaviour is characterized by active swimming movements e.g. forceful movements of front or hind legs and or tail climbing or diving.

For each animal and treatment group the mean of the duration of immobility determined by the observers is calculated. Differences in the duration of immobility between the groups are examined statistically by ANOVA or a suitable non parametric test with p

A commercially available telemetry system from Data Sciences International DSI USA is employed for the measurements on conscious rats described below. The system consists of 3 main components 1 implantable transmitters Physiotel telemetry transmitter 2 receivers Physiotel receiver which are linked via a multiplexer DSI Data Exchange Matrix to a 3 data acquisition computer. The telemetry system makes it possible to continuously record blood pressure heart rate and body motion of conscious animals in their usual habitat.

The studies are conducted on adult female Wistar rats with a body weight of 200 g. After transmitter implantation the experimental animals are housed singly in type III Makrolon cages. They have free access to standard feed and water. The day night rhythm in the test laboratory is set by changing the illumination of the room.

The telemetry transmitters used PA C40 DSI are surgically implanted under aseptic conditions in the experimental animals at least 14 days before the first experimental use.

For the implantation the fasted animals are anaesthetized with isoflurane IsoFlo Abbott initiation 5 maintenance 2 and shaved and disinfected over a large area of their abdomens. After the abdominal cavity has been opened along the linea alba the liquid filled measuring catheter of the system is inserted into the descending aorta in the cranial direction above the bifurcation and fixed with tissue glue Vetbond 3M . The transmitter housing is fixed intraperitoneally to the abdominal wall muscle and the wound is closed layer by layer. Post operatively an antibiotic Ursocyclin 10 60 mg kg s.c. 0.06 ml 100 g body weight Serumwerk Bernburg AG Germany for infection prophylaxis and an analgesic Rimadyl 4 mg kg s.c. Pfizer Germany are administered.

Unless stated otherwise the substances to be studied are administered orally to a group of animals in each case n 6 . In accordance with an administration volume of 2 ml kg of body weight the test substances are dissolved in suitable solvent mixtures. A solvent treated group of animals is used as control.

Each of the instrumented rats living in the system is assigned a separate receiving antenna RPC 1 Receiver DSI . The implanted senders can be activated externally via an installed magnetic switch and are switched to transmission during the pre run of the experiment. The signals emitted can be detected online by a data acquisition system Dataquest A.R.T. for Windows DSI and processed accordingly.

In the standard procedure the following are measured for 10 second periods in each case 1 systolic blood pressure SBP 2 diastolic blood pressure DBP 3 mean arterial pressure MAP 4 heart rate HR and 5 activity ACT . These parameters are measured over 24 hours after administration.

The acquisition of measurements is repeated under computer control at 5 minute intervals. The source data obtained as absolute values are corrected in the diagram with the currently measured barometric pressure Ambient Pressure Reference Monitor APR 1 DSI .

After the end of the experiment the acquired individual data are sorted using the analysis software Dataquest A.R.T. 4.1 Analysis . The blank value is taken to be the mean of the pre run i.e. before substance administration 4 absolute values and this is compared to the absolute value of the measurement giving the deviation in . The data are smoothed over a presettable period by determination of the means 15 minute mean .
