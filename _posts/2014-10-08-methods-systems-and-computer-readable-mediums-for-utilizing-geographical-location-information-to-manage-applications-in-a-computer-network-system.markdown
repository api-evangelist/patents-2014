The subject matter described herein relates to the monitoring and management of software applications in a computer network system. More specifically the subject matter relates to methods systems and computer readable mediums for utilizing geographical location information to manage applications in a computer network system.

A significant number of software applications for any number of reasons presently include geographical restrictions that specify permissible or impermissible physical locations in which these applications and their associated software constructs e.g. databases or data containers may be executed stored and or hosted. For example some existing U.S. regulations and laws presently mandate that software applications associated with specified encryption algorithms cannot be used in certain designated countries i.e. for security reasons . Similarly some software applications may be licensed in such a manner that permits the operation of the application to occur in a single or limited number of physical locations. Another exemplary scenario includes the restricting of citizens personal healthcare data to be stored in data centers located in a home country. In order to comply with such restrictions geographical data specific to the application location can be coded directly into the applications and or supporting components upon release or installation. However in many cases this geographical location information is only registered and or established once and is very rarely updated. Moreover software applications are also frequently transferred or reassigned to different host servers in order to benefit from the efficiencies afforded by cloud computing networks. Consequently the management of these applications from a geographical and physical location standpoint has become a largely difficult task for system administrators.

Methods systems and computer readable mediums for utilizing geographical location information to manage applications in a computer network system are disclosed. According to one embodiment a method includes receiving by a global positioning system GPS service entity a request for geographical location information associated with an infrastructure enclosure device from a location request entity wherein the location request entity is hosted by the infrastructure enclosure device. The method further includes acquiring by the GPS service entity the geographical location information from a location enablement device included in the infrastructure enclosure device and sending by the GPS service module the acquired geographical location information to the location request entity wherein the location request entity enforces a policy based on the acquired geographical location information.

The subject matter described herein discloses methods systems and computer readable mediums for utilizing geographical location information to manage applications in a computer network system. Notably the disclosed subject matter includes a location enablement device that is configured to determine the physical location of an infrastructure enclosure device which may be hosting applications subject to geographical restrictions in response to a geographical location request sent from a location request entity e.g. a software application or a data container hosted by the infrastructure enclosure device . In some embodiments the location enablement device may include a global positioning system GPS receiver device configured to receive from GPS satellites GPS signal data that may subsequently be processed to yield the physical location e.g. a city state country etc. of the infrastructure enclosure device. Similarly the location enablement device may be equipped with a network communications module that is configured to connect to an API based GPS service module that is configured to receive the geographical location information e.g. GPS signal data or derived GPS coordinates from the location enablement device. Once obtained the geographical location information may be provided to the original location request entity e.g. a software application by the GPS service module. The location request entity may subsequently utilize the geographical location information to enforce a policy. Notably the disclosed subject matter provides an effective solution for managing geographically sensitive software applications hosted by mobile infrastructure enclosure devices.

Reference will now be made in detail to exemplary embodiments of the subject matter described herein examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.

In some embodiments the disclosed subject matter can be utilized within a computer network system that is distributed among a plurality of discrete network segments such as a single computer network system location or geographically separated computer network system. For example one exemplary network system may include an integrated infrastructure system and or device such as a converged infrastructure CI . Although the following disclosure describes the use of a CI any integrated infrastructure device may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present subject matter. As used herein a CI such as a Vblock System from VCE Company LLC can include multiple converged infrastructure components in a preconfigured pretested and or prepackaged computing platform that may be customized to the requirements of a user. For example a CI can include a single computing platform unit associated with racks of physical CI components and related software for performing virtualization and or other information technology IT functions. In some embodiments each CI component associated with a CI may include a compute component a software component a networking component a hardware component or a firmware component. For example a CI can contain one or more data storage devices compute devices e.g. a unified computing system device networking equipment e.g. switch devices and software for managing physical resources and or virtualized resources e.g. virtual servers .

In some embodiments infrastructure enclosure device may be utilized to host and support the execution of at least one software application . As used herein an application may include an entire software program or any portion thereof that utilizes a plurality of processes e.g. subprograms workload services software algorithms etc. to perform an activity or service that may be beneficial to a user. In some embodiments application may comprise a software data container construct configured to hold sensitive information such as financial record data personal health record data or the like. Notably application may also be configured to include a data field that contains a geographical restriction parameter. The geographical restriction parameter may either define a permissible geographical location in which application may be stored and or operated or a prohibited geographical location in which application may not be stored and or operated. Exemplary applications include but are not limited to a health provider account application a web based banking application a gambling application and the like.

In some embodiments infrastructure enclosure device may include at least one processor and at least one memory . In some embodiments processor that may include a microprocessor a central processing unit CPU or any other like hardware based processor unit. Likewise memory may include random access memory RAM read only memory ROM optical read write memory cache memory magnetic read write memory flash memory or any other non transitory computer readable storage medium. Notably processor and memory may be used to execute and manage a location management module and in some embodiments network communication module and GPS service entity if located on or within device . In some embodiments infrastructure enclosure device may comprise a CI wherein processor s and memory are embodied as one or more CI compute components as described below in the description of . For example each CI compute component includes one or more processors and memory similar to processor and memory in form and function that may be used to support and or execute location management module and other software programs and module residing on the CI. In some embodiments infrastructure enclosure device may be configured with an advanced management pod AMP that similar to a compute component includes a processor s and memory that are configured to manage and execute the aforementioned software components.

In some embodiments GPS service entity may be configured to receive a request for geographical location information from a location request entity that resided in infrastructure enclosure device . For example a location request entity may include an application e.g. application and or an associated software data container that is hosted by infrastructure enclosure device . Notably application may include any software construct that may be configured to update its own geographical location information and or enforce policies based on that geographical location information. In other embodiments the location request entity may comprise a CI or component residing therein e.g. a management platform module MPM or a compute component which requests geographical location information for the use and benefit of applications supported by one or more of the compute components hosted by the CI.

The manner in which GPS service entity may receive the request for geographical location information largely depends on whether the location request entity is presently aware of the network location of GPS service entity . In some embodiments application may be coded or programmed to include the network address information of GPS service entity . In such scenarios application may send a request directly to GPS service entity as needed. However in other embodiments application may not be aware e.g. not coded or programmed with address information of the network location of GPS service entity . In such situations application may send a DNS SRV record request message to DNS provider entity that requests network location information associated with network elements providing GPS service. In response to receiving the SRV record request DNS provider may respond with DNS SRV record response that indicates the network location e.g. the hostname and port number of one or more GPS service provider servers such as GPS service entity . Specifically DNS provider entity may include a configuration file that includes a DNS line entry that identifies GPS service entity as a GPS service provider. An exemplary DNS line entry may be formatted as 

Specifically this DNS line entry points to TCP port 5060 of GPS service entity which may be contacted at gps.network.abc.com . Accordingly DNS provider entity may extract this information from the DNS configuration file and include it in the DNS SRV response message to be sent to application . Upon receiving the DNS SRV record response application may utilize the provided DNS information to send a request for GPS service to GPS service entity . For example application may be configured to send a geographical location service request message that comprises an API call configured to communicate with GPS service entity .

In some embodiments GPS service entity may be configured to obtain one or more authentication certificates associated with the location request entity i.e. application . For example GPS service entity may communicate with a certificate authority CA entity in order to obtain a digital certificate corresponding to application . Obtaining such a certificate establishes GPS service entity as a trusted third party service entity to application . Through the utilization of public and private keys derived from the digital certificate GPS service entity may be enabled to successfully receive and fulfill geographical location service requests made by the location request entity e.g. application . In some embodiments application may also need to obtain a digital certificate associated with GPS service entity from the CA entity for the same reasons indicated above. After utilizing the digital certificate s to establish a proper communication channel GPS service entity may be configured to process the received geographical location service request message. For example GPS service entity may then be configured to contact location enablement device via network communication module to request the acquisition of the requested geographical location information i.e. GPS signal data . In some embodiments GPS service entity may communicate with location enablement device via a plurality of communication methods including but not limited to a secured and encrypted communications path utilizing Transport Layer Security over IP along with any other protocols used by the API s of GPS service entity .

In some embodiments location enablement device may be equipped with a network communication module that comprises a network enablement component and an API enablement component not shown both of which permit location enablement device to communicate with other network entities e.g. DNS provider entity and GPS service entity via communication network . In some embodiments network communication module may comprise a component separate from location enablement device . In such an embodiment module may be coupled to location enablement device via a USB serial Ethernet or any like cable connection. Depending on the embodiment location enablement device may be positioned and or physically attached on or integrated within infrastructure enclosure device . Similarly location enablement device may comprise either a single device as shown in or several devices functioning together to obtain and provide GPS data.

Upon receiving a geographical location information request from GPS service entity location enablement device may be configured to acquire the requested geographical location information. For example location enablement device may send a location data request message to a GPS receiver device . In response GPS receiver device may utilize antenna and GPS chipset not shown to receive GPS signal data from a plurality of GPS satellites e.g. Block series satellites implemented in the Navstar GPS or like satellite systems . Depending on the embodiment antenna may be embodied as an external antenna or be integrated within location enablement device . In some embodiments after receiving the GPS signal data from GPS satellites GPS receiver device may be configured to process the GPS signal data in order to derive GPS coordinate data e.g. latitude and longitude coordinate data . Once the GPS coordinate data is determined location enablement device may be configured to provide the geographical location information to GPS service entity . In other embodiments location enablement device simply forwards the GPS signal data to GPS service entity .

After receiving the geographical location information e.g. GPS coordinates or GPS signal data from location enablement device GPS service entity may forward the information to the location request entity. Notably upon receiving the requested geographical location information the location request entity may perform a number of actions. For example application may be configured to utilize the GPS signal data or the derived GPS coordinates to determine the geographical location of infrastructure enclosure device i.e. the location of application . For example application may include or have access to a database that maps GPS coordinates to geographical locations e.g. street addresses zip code regions area code regions counties states countries etc. . Notably the geographical location information provided to application may include the GPS coordinate data that can be used to determine a specified geographical location. Once the geographical location of hosting infrastructure enclosure device is determined application may be configured to determine if application is located in a compliant or non compliant area.

In some embodiments application may be configured to record the geographical location information i.e. GPS coordinate data and or corresponding city state country etc. in a data container or data field associated with application . Moreover application or a location management module may be configured e.g. via execution of a subprogram or subroutine to compare the recently derived geographical location information with a geographical restriction parameter previously defined by application . For example application may include a separate parameter data field or container configured to store permissible and or impermissible geographical locations in which an infrastructure enclosure device hosting application may or may not be physically located. This geographical restriction data may then be compared with the determined geographical location data in order to make the assessment. For example application may be configured to compare a permissible zip code address state and or country with an area identified by the recently obtained derived GPS coordinates.

In the event the geographical location information matches the geographical restriction designated by application e.g. the GPS coordinates correspond to a location associated with a non compliant country then application may be configured to perform one or more remediation actions in accordance to one or more established policies. Depending on the embodiment the policies may be stored in application itself or in separate software application or database maintained by infrastructure enclosure device . In some embodiments a policy may specify that a notification message or an alert signal be sent to a system administrator if the geographical restriction parameter corresponds to or matches the GPS coordinates. For example the notification message e.g. an email message a text message a system based message etc. may provide a system administrator with an indication that application should be transferred to another host system e.g. a CI located in a geographically compliant area. In other embodiments a policy may direct application to delete or disable e.g. discontinue its service itself immediately or after an elapsed period of time. In some embodiments an established policy may be configured to instruct application to notify a designated service that is configured to relocate and or transfer applications of an impermissible location status. In such a scenario application may be transferred to a geographically compliant host system or server by the aforementioned service. In some embodiments application may be further configured to differentiate between a number of risk profiles that are established based on a predefined distance existing between the current location of the location request entity and a geographical location designated as non compliant. More specifically application may be configured with different protocols that are respectively mapped to varying geolocation ranges e.g. proximity of device to a defined non compliant location . For example if application determines that device is physically located within a first predefined range e.g. between 1 and 10 miles with respect to a prohibited area application may be configured to perform a first remediation action e.g. send a notification message . Likewise if application determines that device is physically located within a second predefined range e.g. within 1 mile with respect to the prohibited area application may be configured to execute a second remediation action e.g. an application location transfer that differs from the first remediation action or alternatively execute both the first and second remediation actions .

In some embodiments location management module in infrastructure enclosure device may be configured to perform these remediation measures in lieu of application upon request by application . In addition location management module may also be configured to perform a policing function that effectively monitors the operation and implementation of all applications residing within infrastructure enclosure device . For example location management module may be configured to detect events involving the improper and or unusual use of designated ports by any of the hosted applications . Similarly location management module may be provisioned with a whitelist of permissible application locations and or a blacklist of applications non compliant locations that can be periodically compared to recently obtained geographical location information. In such a scenario location management module would function as a location request entity proxy for each of the applications residing in infrastructure enclosure device . For example location management module may be configured to facilitate the interworking and or interfacing of application with GPS service entity .

In some embodiments virtualized infrastructure can comprise a virtualization environment configured to simulate components of a computing device e.g. a processor system memory and a storage device for executing one or more virtual machines VMs managed by virtualization manager . For example each of VM VM and VM may be configured to perform various functions and or services such as web server functions or cloud application services and may interact with various nodes components and or users. In some embodiments virtualized infrastructure may be associated with one or more virtual entities. Each virtual entity can comprise one or more CI or portions therein such as infrastructure elements from one or more CIs. In some embodiments virtualization manager may allow logical entities to be created deleted or modified using an API a GUI or a CLI. Virtualization manager may be any suitable entity e.g. software executing in a virtual machine for managing aspects associated with virtualized infrastructure . In some embodiments virtualization manager may be configured to provide management functionality through one or more communications interfaces. For example virtualization manager may communicate with location management module using one or more APIs.

Likewise physical infrastructure can comprise hardware resources such as network components compute components sometimes referred to as hosts compute devices and or compute servers storage component which may comprise a storage area network SAN that includes a plurality of data storage elements that are managed by hardware resource manager . In some embodiments hardware resource manager may be configured to provision hardware resources via one or more communications interfaces. For example hardware resource manager may provision hardware resources in order to implement one or more virtual entities in virtualized infrastructure . In some embodiments hardware resource manager can configure compute components and storage component s to be cooperatively utilized for implementing and supporting VM and virtualization manager . For example compute component and storage component may be used in implementing VM and VM and compute component and storage component may be used in implementing VM and virtualization manager . Similarly hardware resources may also include network components e.g. network switches which can be configured to enable communication between the resources within the CI.

With respect to the disclosed subject matter any one of CI components may be configured to host a location request entity. For example in the embodiment illustrated in compute component is depicted as hosting an application e.g. a location request entity . Moreover further depicts compute component hosting a DNS service module i.e. not unlike DNS provider entity in and compute component hosting a GPS service module i.e. not unlike GPS service entity in . In some embodiments application may act a location request entity and send a geographical location service request message to GPS service module via hardware resource manager . In alternate embodiments location management module in MPM may send the geographical location service request message by serving as a location request entity proxy for application .

The manner in which GPS service module receives the request for geographical location information largely depends on whether the location request entity is presently aware of the network location of GPS service module . In some embodiments application may be coded or programmed to include the network address information of GPS service entity . In such scenarios application may send a geographical location service request message directly to GPS service module as needed. However in other embodiments application may not be aware e.g. not coded or programmed with address information of the CI network location of GPS service module . In such scenarios application may send a DNS SRV record request message to DNS service module that requests network location information associated with GPS service providers hosted by CI . In response to receiving the SRV record request DNS service module may respond with DNS SRV record response that indicates the location e.g. the hostname and port number of one or more local GPS service providers such as GPS service module . In some embodiments DNS service module includes a configuration file containing a DNS line entry that identifies GPS service module and may be formatted as 

Specifically this DNS line entry points to TCP port 5060 of compute component which is hosting GPS service module which may be contacted at gps.xblock.abc.com . In some embodiments DNS service module may extract this information from the DNS configuration file and include it in the DNS SRV response message directed to application . Upon receiving the DNS SRV record response application may utilize the provided DNS information to send a request for GPS service to GPS service module . For example application may be configured to send a geographical location service request message that comprises an API call configured to communicate with GPS service module .

In some embodiments GPS service module may be configured to authenticate itself to application or any other location request entity. For example GPS service module may be configured to obtain authentication certificates associated with applications e.g. application executed by and or residing on CI components from a CA entity not shown The obtained authentication certificate s may be utilized by GPS service module to establish and maintain communications between GPS service module and the location request entity e.g. application . In some embodiments location management module may be configured to utilize the authentication certificates to facilitate the communication between GPS service module and application . Notably in both scenarios the utilization of the authentication certificates enables GPS service module to be recognized as a trusted third party service provider by application . Through the utilization of public and private keys derived from the digital certificate GPS service module may be enabled to successfully receive and fulfill geographical location service requests made by application . In some embodiments application may also need to obtain a digital certificate associated with GPS service module from the CA entity for the same reasons indicated above. After utilizing the digital certificate s to establish a proper communication channel GPS service module may be configured to process the received geographical location service request message. For example GPS service module may then be configured to contact location enablement device via a network communication module to request the acquisition of the requested geographical location information i.e. GPS signal data .

In some embodiments location enablement device may receive a geographical location information request from a GPS service module . In response location enablement device may be configured to acquire the requested geographical location information by sending a message instructing GPS receiver device to acquire GPS signal data. GPS receiver device may then utilize antenna and a GPS chipset to receive GPS signal data from GPS satellites e.g. GPS satellites in . After receiving the GPS signal data from the GPS satellites GPS receiver device can derive GPS coordinate data. For example location enablement device may utilize the GPS coordinate data to determine the corresponding GPS coordinates of CI . Upon determining the GPS coordinate data or alternatively acquiring GPS signal data location enablement device may then be configured to forward the geographical location information to GPS service entity . GPS service entity may then in turn provide the geographical location information to the original location request entity e.g. application or location management module .

After receiving the geographical location information e.g. GPS coordinates or GPS signal data from location enablement device GPS service module may forward the information to the location request entity e.g. application or location management module . Notably upon receiving the requested geographical location information the location request entity may perform a number of actions. For example application may be configured to utilize the GPS signal data or the derived GPS coordinates to determine the geographical location of CI i.e. the location of application . For example application may include or have access to a database that maps GPS coordinates to geographical locations e.g. street addresses zip code regions area code regions counties states countries etc. . Notably the geographical location information provided to application may include the GPS coordinate data that can be used to determine a specified geographical location. Once the geographical location of host CI is determined application or location management module may be configured to determine if application is located in a compliant or non compliant area.

In the event a location request entity e.g. application or location management module determines that the obtained and or derived geographical location information matches or corresponds to a geographical restriction parameter e.g. the GPS coordinates corresponding to a location in a restricted country designated by supported application the location request entity may be configured to perform one or more remediation actions in accordance to one or more established policies. Depending on the embodiment the policies may be stored in the supported application or in separate software application or database e.g. storage component or memory elements in compute components maintained by CI . In some embodiments a policy may specify that a notification message or an alert signal is to be sent to a system administrator if the geographical restriction parameter corresponds to or matches recently determined GPS coordinates. For example the notification message e.g. an email message a text message a system based message etc. may provide a system administrator with an indication that application should be transferred to another CI or host system that is physically located in a geographically compliant area. In other embodiments a policy may specify that message etc. may provide a system administrator with an indication that application delete or disable itself after a predetermined time period. In some embodiments application may be configured to notify a designated service or location management module which can relocate and or transfer applications currently positioned in an impermissible location. In such a scenario application may be transferred to a geographically compliant CI or host system by the aforementioned service.

In some embodiments MPM and or location management module may be configured to perform the aforementioned remediation measures in lieu of supported application on CI . For example location management module may be configured to function as a geographical compliance check entity for CI instead of the application itself . Notably location management module and or MPM may be configured to communicate with hardware resource manager in order to obtain information identifying applications residing on and or supported by CI components that include a geographical restriction parameter value that does not comply with the determined geographical location of CI . For example upon receiving the present geographical location information associated with CI from location enablement device location management module may be configured to compare the geographical restriction parameter of the location request entity e.g. application residing on compute component with the determined location of CI on a periodic basis.
