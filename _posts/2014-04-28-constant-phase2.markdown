title: Constant phase
abstract: Various embodiments are described that relate to a loop with a constant phase. The loop can function as an antenna and be used in object detection. A current source can be used to power the loop such that the loop produces a magnetic field and electric field. The magnetic field can be powerful enough to detect a dielectric while the electric field is so small that it does not interfere with nearby communication equipment. Thus, detection can occur without disruption of other important devices.

A powered loop antenna can be used to detect a hidden object. For example a person on vacation can use a powered loop antenna functioning as an anomaly detector in an attempt to locate buried objects at a beach. In addition to using the anomaly detector the person can employ a communication device such as a two way radio with a child also participating in the same activity. Thus a person may want to use a detector device and a communication device concurrently.

In one embodiment a system comprises a set of wire sections and a set of reactive compensation elements. The set of wire sections and the set of reactive compensation elements are configured to form a loop powered by a current provided by a current source operating at about 1 megahertz or above with a source impedance of about 25 ohms or less. The individual reactive compensation elements and the individual wire sections of the set of wire sections alternate with one another. The set of reactive compensation elements function to keep a magnitude and a phase of the current substantially uniform throughout the loop. The loop when powered by the current produces a magnetic field that is substantially greater than an electric field along a longitudinal axis of the loop.

In one embodiment a singular loop antenna comprises a first wire section a second wire section that is distinct from the first wire section and a third wire section that is distinct from the first wire section and distinct from the second wire section where the first wire section and the third wire section are not contiguous. The singular loop antenna also comprises a first reactive compensation element that divides the first wire section from the second wire section and a second reactive compensation element that divides the second wire section from the third wire section and that is distinct from the first reactive compensation element. The first wire section the second wire section the third wire section the first reactive compensation element and the second reactive compensation element form at least part of a loop powered by a current of at least two amps supplied from a low impedance current source. The singular loop antenna when supplied with the current produces a magnetic field that is substantially greater than the electric field along a longitudinal axis of the singular loop antenna. The first reactive compensation element offsets an impedance of the first wire section and the second reactive compensation element offsets an impedance of the second wire section. A magnitude is keep substantially constant throughout the loop such that the magnitude change is not greater than that which is produced by no more than one of the wire sections. A phase is keep substantially constant throughout the loop such that the phase change is not greater than that which is produced by no more than one of the wire sections.

In one embodiment a system comprises a current source that functions at under about one ohm with a frequency between about 1 megahertz and 1 gigahertz and a singular small loop antenna that is powered by the current. The singular small loop antenna comprises a set of wire segments that are individually divided by a set of reactive compensation elements such that two individual reactive compensation elements are separated by a segment of wire and two individual reactive compensation elements are separated by a reactive compensation element. Also the singular small loop antenna produces an electric field and a magnetic field such that the magnetic field that extends substantially normal to a plane of the singular small loop antenna is substantially greater than the electric field and the electric field is of a level that does not substantially interfere with communication equipment.

A powered loop antenna e.g. a singular loop or multiple loops can be employed that operates from 1 megahertz to 1 gigahertz. In particular powered small loop antennas can be employed where the antenna size is less than a wavelength in size in which the currents along a conductor of the antenna are mostly in phase. Symmetry of the loop antenna can be such that a propagating electromagnetic EM field e.g. a transverse EM field is not produced normal to the loop. Instead a radiation pattern can peak in directions in the plane of the loop. Since cancellation may not be complete e.g. due to the phase difference between the arrival of the wave at the near and far sides of the loop a similar argument may not apply to signals received in that plane e.g. that voltages induced by an impinging radio wave would cancel along the loop . A small e.g. 

Aspects disclosed herein can be used to optimize an antenna design to produce an antenna with very strong magnetic near fields. A small loop antenna can be divided into k sections with k as an integer and can include a reactive compensation element for controlling generation of a local magnetic field between sections. The reactive compensation element can be coupled to one of the k sections and have a reactance that substantially cancels the series reactance of a section at an operating frequency.

A powered loop antenna can be constructed and deployed that combines a low impedance current source e.g. a source impedance of about 1 ohm with a low real impedance reactively compensated loop antenna designed to operate at a frequency or set of frequencies between 1 megahertz and 1 gigahertz. Operation of a sensor e.g. powered loop antenna can be dependent on a magnetic field that is projected and that in turn is directly related to the current in the magnetic current loop. In one example a 50 ohm amplifier can benefit from matching resulting in a narrow bandwidth and excessive operational sensitivity. A radio frequency RF current source can provide a bandwidth of greater than 10 . This can allow for greater flexibility of mounting configurations. Using a 50 ohm power amplifier with the powered loop antenna can benefit from a matching network to transform from 50 ohms to approx. 1 j3 ohms. Thus a voltage controlled current source can feed to a 50 ohm power amplifier which is then impedance matched to 1 j3 ohms. This process can provide for a maximum bandwidth of about 1 and results in relatively poor efficiency. Use of an RF current source and or an RF power amplifier that drives a low impedance magnetic sensor can result in a minimum of a 10 increase in bandwidth and approximately a 5 10 reduction in power with the sensor operating at approx. 1 j3 ohms. This type of sensor can penetrate the ground to detect deeply buried threats such as landmines etc. while its design reduces unwanted electromagnetic EM interference. Applications of such a sensor e.g. powered loop antenna can include metal anomaly sensors induction charging e.g. wireless charging systems communication with active or passive tags etc.

A large magnetic field can be transmitted while minimizing generation of a propagating EM wave can be done by use of a current loop in which the current around the loop has a constant magnitude and a constant phase. A conventional current loop sensor can have the current phase change around the loop and this phase change generates a propagating EM signal. By keeping both the magnitude and phase constant little EM signal is projected but a strong magnetic signal is produced that extends normal to the plane of the loop creating a large magnetic field in the near field. This field can penetrate conducting dielectrics such as ground which have little effect on the magnetic field but substantially terminate the electric field and thus propagate an EM wave. In one embodiment an in phase current loop is created using multiple small loops. In one embodiment an in phase current loop design can be built in which reactive compensation is used. Periodic series capacitors can be placed around the loop to compensate for time of flight phase change along a segment of the loop. Thus a magnetic current loop can be used in a magnetic current loop based communication system. In one embodiment the loop can be divided into small segments and a reactive compensation element can be added to the segments. Adding reactive compensation to the segments of the loop cancels series reactance of the segment of the loop and provides for current magnitude and phase uniformity along the loop at a given instant in time. Therefore a loop can be created with impedance at 13.56 megahertz that is around 1 j3 ohms.

Therefore as with the standard small loop antenna in which the current is mostly in phase around the loop a design implementing aspects disclosed herein can force the current to be even more in phase. Current loop antennas can provide for narrowband operation due to the use of the impedance tuner to transform from the low real impedance of the loop around a few ohms to the 50 ohm impedance of an RF generator. This transformation process can reduce the bandwidth of a system. A high power detector can be used to locate objects underground whether these objects are metal or are of a dielectric material. To achieve this level of detection a relatively strong current source can be used such as a source producing about an amp or greater of current. This strong current source can produce a relatively strong magnetic field that can be used to facilitate the detection. However this strong current source can also produce a relatively strong electric field. The relatively large electric field can disrupt nearby equipment such as communication devices.

Therefore it can be desirable in at least some circumstances to have a detector that produces a relatively strong magnetic field with a relatively weak electric field. In other words it can be desirable to employ a detector capable of detecting metal and or a dielectric while not substantially impacting a communication device or other nearby devices. In order to do this the detector can include a set of wire segments separated by a set of capacitors configured as a loop. This configuration can enable the phase to be constant throughout the loop. The capacitors can be set at values to reduce and or minimize the electric field.

The magnetic field can be of a sufficient strength to detect a metal and or to detect a dielectric. The magnetic field extends about one wavelength from the loop such as a wavelength that is about twenty two meters e.g. a wavelength that corresponds to a frequency of about 13.56 megahertz MHz . In one embodiment the loop can perform transmission and or reception functions. The loop can be a small loop antenna.

Aspects disclosed herein can be used to improve and or optimize antenna design such that the antenna produces a strongest magnetic near to mid field as possible for forward detection of metal objects or other objects. Further the antenna can be used to transfer power and information between microelectronic devices. The H Field associated with the antenna can be relatively high and a drop off can be about 1 r e.g. r radius . In one example the frequency of operation for the system can be from about 1 MHz to about 1 Gigahertz e.g. about 13.56 MHz . To keep the size of the system relatively small the small loop antenna configuration can be employed.

Currents along a conductor of the system can be mostly in phase. Symmetry of the system can allow for a propagating electromagnetic EM field e.g. a transverse EM field that is not produced normal to the loop. Instead a radiation pattern can peak in directions in the plane of the loop. For signals received in that plane e.g. voltages induced by an impinging radio wave would cancel along the loop this may not occur since cancellation may not be complete due to the phase difference between an arrival of the wave at the near and far sides of the loop. A conventional small 

Aspects disclosed herein can be used to optimize antenna design to produce very strong magnetic near fields. The small loop antenna can be divided into k sections where k is an integer and a reactive compensation element set e.g. capacitors a h can be employed for controlling generation of the local magnetic field between the wire sections . The reactive compensation element can be coupled to one of the k sections and have a reactance that substantially cancels the series reactance of each section of the wire sections at an operating frequency. Therefore as with the standard small loop antenna in which the current is mostly in phase around the loop the system can force the current to be even more in phase.

The system can have the current with a constant magnitude and constant phase. This current can cause the system to produce a large magnetic field while minimizing a generation of a propagating EM wave. Absent the set of capacitors a h the current changes phase around the loop and this phase change generates a propagating EM signal. By keeping both the magnitude and phase constant relatively little EM signal is projected but a strong magnetic signal is produced that extends normal to the plane of the loop creating a large magnetic field in the near field. This large magnetic field can penetrate conducting dielectrics such as ground which have little effect on the magnetic field but substantially terminate the electric field and thus a propagating EM wave. Periodic series capacitors placed around the loop compensate for the time of flight phase change along a segment of the loop. As the phase changes while the current passes through an individual wire section of the system an individual capacitor of the system undoes the phase change.

In one embodiment the system can be used in a magnetic current loop based communication system. The system is divided into small segments and reactive compensation is added to each segment such as by an individual capacitor. Adding reactive compensation to segments of the loop cancels the series reactance of the wire section and provides for current magnitude and phase uniformity along the loop at an instant in time.

The large magnetic field can be transmitted while minimizing the generation of the propagating EM by using the loop such that the current around the loop has a constant magnitude and a constant phase. Without the set of capacitors a h current of a capacitor less loop would change phase around the capacitor less loop and this phase change would generate a propagating EM signal that could interfere with communication equipment. By keeping both the magnitude and phase constant in the loop as the system relatively little EM signal can be projected but a strong magnetic signal can be produced that extends normal to a plane of the loop creating a large magnetic field in the near field. This field can penetrate conducting dielectrics such as ground which have little effect on the magnetic field but substantially terminate the electric field and thus a propagating EM wave. An in phase current loop can be created using multiple loops or a singular loop.

Aspects disclosed herein can have applicability in various industries and or products. In one example devices that respond to a magnetic wave e.g. change state become jammed etc. can be triggered by practice of aspects disclosed herein. In one example hobbyists can use a detector built in accordance with aspects disclosed herein for artifact collection. In one example a detector can be built in accordance with aspects disclosed herein and used in construction to detect objects underground before digging.

In one embodiment unique phase characteristics can appear in the response from an interrogated object e.g. a target excited with the magnetic wave during exposure to the magnetic field and or after magnetic field is removed. Altering a pulse shape can force leading and middle sections of the pulse to induce unique phase information. This alteration can be done by the interrogated object either passively semi passively or actively. In one embodiment the interrogated object can be a passive object e.g. an asset management tag or landmine that can have a prescribed response e.g. landmine detonation imparting a prescribed phase characteristic in a trailing response. In a semi passive example the tag e.g. a tag powered by a battery can rectify an applied magnetic field pulse and impart digital information in the falling phase response by for example superimposing information on a trailing edge by opening and closing a loop antenna or other antenna. In an active example the tag can be self powered and can actively alter its characteristics in the trailing edge of the magnetic pulse to impose digital information in the phase response. In one embodiment the tag can be powered by a battery.

In one embodiment a tuner component can be employed to select the values of the individual capacitors of the set of capacitors a h of such that the electric field is minimized. The individual capacitors of the set of capacitors a h of can be uniform in value or not uniform in value e.g. each capacitor has distinct value and or at least one capacitor has a value different from another capacitor . In one embodiment the tuner component can select values of individual capacitors of the tag such that the tag is an identifiable barcode. In one example arrangement e.g. number and spacing of the individual capacitors as well as the values of the individual capacitors can be part of the identifiable barcode.

In one embodiment the trial and error can be used to create a database of optimal capacitor values e.g. to create strongest magnetic field to create smallest electric field for barcode usage etc. . Selection can comprise identifying a desired characteristic of the loop e.g. smallest electric field along a longitudinal axis of the loop and reading the database values. This can be compared with available capacitor values and values can be selected and implemented. In one embodiment the tuner component can select a frequency for the loop e.g. a frequency between 1 MHz and 1 gigahertz such that the electric field is minimized. In one embodiment the tuner component can read an instruction for capacitor values for the individual capacitors of the tag and set the values accordingly.

Various items can be associated with the system that facilitates performance of the system as a successful detector. The reception loop can be associated with a loop tuner and a spectrum analyzer . The spectrum analyzer can interpret results from a loop such as the transmission loop or the loop of . In one embodiment the spectrum analyzer can be configured to identify a presence of an object e.g. metal or dielectric between the reception loop and the transmission loop . The presence can be determined through interference of the magnetic field from the transmission loop to the reception loop . Thus how the magnetic field differs from leaving the transmission loop to being received by the reception loop can be used by the spectrum analyzer to determine detection. The spectrum analyzer can be configured to identify a presence of an object near one of the loops e.g. on the side of the reception loop that does not face the transmission loop by way of magnetic field observance. The spectrum analyzer can also be configured to cause an output indicative of the presence e.g. cause a light to flash send a communication etc. . The spectrum analyzer can function at a set value such as at 50 ohms. Since the transmission loop or the loop of can function at lower resistance levels the loop tuner can be employed to match output of the reception loop to 50 ohms. Therefore the loop tuner can function to match impedance. In one embodiment the reception loop matches the transmission loop e.g. is identically structured . The reception loop can receive the magnetic field. Thus the transmission loop and reception loop can form a detector. A detectable object such as a metal or dielectric penetrates the magnetic field such that the magnetic field becomes modified. Modification of this field can be identified by the spectrum analyzer and be used to identify existence of the object.

While the system is shown with one transmission loop and one reception loop other configurations can be implemented. In one example two reception loops can be used one loop on one side of the transmission loop and one loop on the other side. Data from the reception loops can be merged by a differential amplifier and then fed to the loop tuner and or the spectrum analyzer e.g. the differential amplifier can be part of a device that includes the loop tuner the differential amplifier can be part of the loop tuner the differential amplifier functions on output of the reception loop after the loop tuner functions on the output etc. . The digital amplifier can merge data e.g. output from the multiple loops so the spectrum analyzer can treat the data as one set of data.

In one embodiment the loop antenna can form a loop that is powered by the current source with a current of at least two amps. When supplied with the current the loop antenna produces a magnetic field that is substantially greater than the electric field. Throughout the loop antenna the magnitude and phase can be kept substantially constant. In one example the magnitude is kept substantially constant throughout the loop such that the magnitude change is not greater than that which is produced by no more than one of the wire sections and a phase is kept substantially constant throughout the loop such that the phase change is not greater than that which is produced by no more than one of the wire sections. Thus when a phase and or magnitude change is impacted by a wire section e.g. a largest wire section the capacitor offsets the change before the next wire section is impacted.

The loop antenna can comprise a first wire section e.g. wire section of a second wire section e.g. wire section of and a third wire section e.g. wire section of . These wire sections can be distinct from one another e.g. not the same wire section and be in series with one another e.g. the first wire section and the third wire section are not contiguous . The loop antenna can also comprise a first capacitor e.g. capacitor b of that divides the first wire section from the second wire section as well as a second capacitor e.g. capacitor c of distinct from the first capacitor that divides the second wire section from the third wire section and that is distinct from the first capacitor. The first capacitor can have a value that causes the electric field to be minimized and the second capacitor can have a value that causes the electric field to be minimized. The first capacitor can offset an impedance of the first wire section while the second capacitor can offset an impedance of the second wire section. Thus impedances of the wire sections can quickly be offset by the capacitors throughout the loop antenna .

In one embodiment the magnetic field extends about one wavelength from the loop antenna . In one example the loop antenna can function with a frequency of about 13.56 MHz and as such the wavelength can be about 22 meters. The loop antenna can be a singular small loop antenna that performs transmission and reception functions. The magnetic field from the loop antenna can be of a sufficient strength to detect a metal beneath a dielectric e.g. beneath ground while the electric field is low enough as to not substantially impact a communication device.

The current source can be converted into a power amplifier and then the power amplifier can be converted back into the current source . In one embodiment the current source can comprise a 1 kilowatt RF Generator Module and the loop tuner of . The RF Generator Module can be modified to match low input impedance of the loop antenna . The RF Generator Module can comprise a set of transistors that function as a voltage controlled current source. In addition the RF Generator Module can comprise an oscillator e.g. 13.56 MHz oscillator or oscillator can be removed and the current source can be connected to a signal generator that facilitates use of different pulsing waveforms. In one embodiment the current source employs a swept signal.

An observation can be made on how the loop is ultimately constructed at and values for the capacitors can be selected at . In one example based on physical characteristics of the loop specific default capacitor values can be selected from a database. With the values selected the loop can be tested at and a determination can be made at if results are acceptable such as if the magnetic field is strong enough if the electric field is weak enough if the loop is identifiable as a barcode etc. If results are acceptable from the selected values then the selected values can become the values for the loop at .

If results are not acceptable then the values can be reselected and the method can return to action . In one example a series of selections can be made at and ultimately a selection that produces a best result e.g. highest magnetic field with the lowest electric field can be selected. This best resulting selection can be implemented for the loop at .

The loop can be built at with the parts chosen at in accordance with the configuration selected at . Values for the capacitors can be selected at with the goal of producing a specific barcode in view of the parts and configuration. The values can be set at and the loop can be deployed. Actions of methods disclosed herein can be practiced in a different order than disclosed when practical such as the values being selected and set before construction of the loop.
