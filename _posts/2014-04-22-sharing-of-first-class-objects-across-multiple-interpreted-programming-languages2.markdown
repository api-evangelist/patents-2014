title: Sharing of first class objects across multiple interpreted programming languages
abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for enabling users to write scripting code in a first scripting language, and then use a second scripting language to call language constructs written in that first scripting language. Functions, Class Definitions, Class Instances, Modules and other language constructs are treated as first-class objects that can be shared across the different scripting languages. The techniques disclosed herein are also applicable to domain-specific languages. As part of the methodology, a respective underlying representation of each of these object types is designed as an interface and then that interface is implemented in each scripting language. In addition, code is written in each scripting language implementation to allow the latter to use the interface to represent a Function, Class, or other language construct.
