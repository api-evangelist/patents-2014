The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for sensory stimulation. The invention is particularly applicable for stimulating the sense of touch.

Manual input devices such as joysticks and mice are frequently complemented by means for providing tactile sensations such that the manual input devices provide tactile feedback to their users. There are hundreds of US patents for tactile feedback devices. In most or all of the prior art devices the tactile stimulation is generated by means of moving or vibrating mechanical members. A problem shared by most such devices is that such moving mechanical members tend to be bulky unreliable and or difficult to control.

An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for alleviating at least one of the problems identified above.

The object of the invention is achieved by features which are disclosed in the attached independent claims. The dependent claims and the present patent specification disclosed additional specific embodiments and nonessential features of the invention.

The invention is based on the surprising discovery that subcutaneous Pacinian corpuscles can be stimulated by means of a capacitive electrical coupling and an appropriately dimensioned control voltage either without any mechanical stimulation of the Pacinian corpuscles or as an additional stimulation separate from such mechanical stimulation. An appropriately dimensioned high voltage is used as the control voltage. In the present context a high voltage means such a voltage that direct galvanic contact must be prevented for reasons of safety and or user comfort. This results in a capacitive coupling between the Pacinian corpuscles and the apparatus causing the stimulation wherein one side of the capacitive coupling is formed by at least one galvanically isolated electrode connected to the stimulating apparatus while the other side in close proximity to the electrode is formed by the body member preferably a finger of the stimulation target such as the user of the apparatus and more specifically the subcutaneous Pacinian corpuscles.

Without committing themselves to any particular theory the inventors find it likely that the invention is based on a controlled formation of an electric field between an active surface of the apparatus and the body member such as a finger approaching or touching it. The electric field tends to give rise to an opposite charge on the proximate finger. A local electric field and a capacitive coupling can be formed between the charges. The electric field directs a force on the charge of the finger tissue. By appropriately altering the electric field a force capable of moving the tissue may arise whereby the sensory receptors sense such movement as vibration.

A benefit of the invention is independence from mechanical vibration and its associated problems in the prior art.

An aspect of the invention is an apparatus for generating an electrosensory stimulus to at least one body member. The apparatus comprises one or more conducting electrodes each of which is provided with an insulator. When the body member is proximate to the conducting electrode the insulator prevents flow of direct current from the conducting electrode to the body member. A capacitive coupling over the insulator is formed between the conducting electrode and the body member. The apparatus also comprises a high voltage source for applying an electrical input to the one or more conducting electrodes wherein the electrical input comprises a low frequency component in a frequency range between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz. The capacitive coupling and electrical input are dimensioned to produce an electrosensory sensation which is produced independently of any mechanical vibration of the one or more conducting electrodes or insulators.

Another aspect of the invention is a method for causing an electrosensory sensation to a body member. The method comprises providing one or more conducting electrodes. Each conducting electrode is provided with an insulator wherein when the body member is proximate to the conducting electrode the insulator prevents flow of direct current from the conducting electrode to the body member. A capacitive coupling over the insulator is formed between the conducting electrode and the body member. A high voltage source is provided for applying an electrical input to the one or more conducting electrodes. The electrical input comprises a low frequency component in a frequency range between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz while the capacitive coupling and electrical input are dimensioned to produce an electrosensory sensation. The electrosensory sensation is produced independently of any mechanical vibration of the one or more conducting electrode s or insulator s .

It is beneficial to vary the capacitive coupling such that the variation comprises one or more frequency components in a range wherein the Pacinian corpuscles exhibit their maximal sensitivity. This frequency range is roughly 10 to 1000 Hz and in most humans 100 to 500 Hz. The capacitive coupling can be varied by varying the control voltage and or parameters of the capacitive coupling.

By way of example the high voltage charge applied to the electrode can have a voltage of at least 750 1000 1500 or 2000 V and at most 20 50 or 100 kV no load measurements . In the present context voltage values may refer to voltage in direct current or effective RMS voltages in alternating current. The high voltage current applied may be direct current or alternating current. When alternating current is being used the frequency of the current may be high such as at least 1 kHz 10 kHz 20 kHz or 30 kHz and at most 100 kHz 500 kHz tai 1 MHz provided that the signal also exhibits a low frequency component for example such that high frequency signal has an envelope whose frequency stimulates the desired sensory cells. The high frequency alternating current can be modulated by means of a control signal having a low frequency component for example.

When high voltage direct current is being used the electrode may be embodied as a MEMS component micro electromechanical system which comprises a set of rotating preferably individually controllable tiny electrodes. The strength of the capacitive coupling formed by the electrode can be adjusted by adjusting these tiny electrodes. In this case the strongest coupling is achieved when the tiny electrodes are oriented such that they collectively form a plane. In the inventive technique by measuring the characteristics of the capacitive coupling for example the capacitance of its variation it may be possible to measure the distance of the body member from the surface of the apparatus for example. Additionally it may possible to detect separately the touching of the surface by the body member. The inventive technique may be further enhanced by power control functionality of the electric field being formed for example. Utilization of some embodiments of the invention in the implementation of a proximity sensor may require a weaker electric field than what is required by causing the inventive sensory stimulus. Accordingly it may be beneficial to be able to vary the strength of the electric field depending on the currently needed functionality. Such variation may for instance involve strengthening the electric field such that a sense of touch or vibration is caused in the body member when it is brought sufficiently close to the electrode or insulator.

By way of example the low frequency component of the control signal being used in the inventive technique may be generated by modulating a high frequency alternating current. The modulation signal may be continuous or pulsed for example. The duration of individual pulses may be 0.01 0.5 or 4 ms and the pause between pulses can be at least 1 10 or 100 ms.

The low frequency component of the control signal may have a frequency of at least 10 50 or 100 Hz and at most 300 500 or 1000 Hz. In one specific embodiment the control signal has an exemplary frequency of 120 Hz. In the inventive technique the alternating electric field which causes the stimulus to be provided may exhibit an intensity peak of at least 100 V mm 200 V mm or 500 V mm and at most 10 kV mm 30 kV mm or 100 kV mm. The field strength may be measured for example by means of a grounded electrode with a surface area of eg 1 cmpositioned 0.05 to 5 mm preferably about 1 mm from the surface of the insulated electrode.

By way of example the electric field generated by the electrode can be controlled according to a processing logic being executed in a computer or other electronic data processing apparatus. For example the control logic can be used to control the variation frequency and or intensity of the electric field generated by an individual electrode. Furthermore the control logic can be used to pulse the varying electric field for example. The control logic can also receive control information via a data network from a another apparatus such as another computer or data processing apparatus.

An inventive apparatus for sensory stimulation comprises at least one insulated electrode wherein the apparatus is operable to apply a charge to the electrode such that the charge causes a stimulation of the Pacinian corpuscles. For humans this normally requires a voltage of at least 750 V. The apparatus further comprises means for varying the intensity of the charge generated capacitively coupled electric field by utilizing a signal having a component with a frequency of at least 10 Hz and at most 1000 Hz.

Some embodiments of the inventive apparatus can be implemented when so desired without mechanically moving parts and such embodiments do not pose similar restrictions on the mechanical characteristics of the materials as do actuators based on mechanical movement of the surface. Accordingly some embodiments of the invention are applicable to a wide variety of surfaces of different shapes. For instance the surface shape of the electrode and or insulator attached to it may be planar rounded spherical or concave. Likewise the insulator material can be selected from a variety of materials having characteristics particularly suitable for the chosen application. As regards mechanical characteristics the surface material can be hard soft stiff bending transparent or flexible. The surface as well as the material being used as the conductor can also be transparent.

An individual electrode of the apparatus and or the insulator attached to the electrode can have a surface area of 0.1 1 10 or 100 cmor more. The apparatus can comprise multiple insulated electrodes which can be arranged in an array forming an X Y coordinate system. Each electrode of such a system can when so desired be controlled by a control logic according to some embodiments of the invention for example. The electrodes can be fixedly mounted or movable.

The apparatus may comprise means for varying the variation frequency of the electric field for example by modulating the high voltage alternating current or by moving the electrodes of the MEMS device according to the control signal.

The insulator to be arranged between the electrode of the apparatus and the body member can have a thickness of at least 0.01 mm 0.05 mm 0.1 mm or 0.5 mm and at most 10 mm 20 mm or 50 mm. The insulator material can be selected according to the intended use and or voltage to be used for example.

In some embodiments the insulator comprises multiple layers. For instance the inventors have discovered that the bulk of the insulator layer between the electrode and the body part approaching or toughing it may comprise glass but glass is not optimal as the insulator s surface material. In the present context optimal means an insulator material which best supports the creation of the electrosensory sensation. A glass insulator works much better if covered with a plastic film.

The inventive apparatus can be implemented such that its power consumption is low. For example the power required to cause a sensory stimulus may be 1 mW 5 mW or 10 mW or more. Power consumption can be measured on the basis of the electric power applied to the electrode when a human touches the apparatus surface or when a capacitively grounded 50 pF capacitor is connected to the apparatus surface.

The apparatus may comprise means for measuring the capacitance of the capacitive coupling being formed. The apparatus may further comprise means for adjusting the characteristics of the electric field such as intensity or variation frequency based on the obtained measurement information.

The inventive apparatus for sensory stimulation can be integrated as a part of some other apparatus or system. For instance a prior art touch display can be complemented by apparatuses according to some embodiments of the present invention. This way it is possible to provide a touch display which produces a sensation of touch even if the display is not physically touched. Control components of the feedback system can be combined or they may be arranged to exchange information with one another. An advantageous embodiment of the presently disclosed method and apparatus is a control device based on touch or proximity such as a touch display that produces a feedback which can be sensed via the sense of touch.

In some embodiments of the invention the local charge field can be controlled by means of capacitive grounding. In various embodiments of the invention it is possible to into account the fact that the dependence of the electric coupling on the insulated electrode ie capacitance depends on several factors. The capacitance value affects the potential difference between the finger and electrode if the apparatus or subject such as human is not grounded and their ground potential is determined via stray capacitances. Prior art implementations ignore control and processing of the distribution of capacitances and voltages and some embodiments of the present invention aim at alleviating this separate problem.

For example the invention differs from prior art solutions in that no touching or mechanical movement or vibration is required to generate the stimulus. Accordingly the invention provides advantages over solutions which are based on say stroking the finger over the electrodes and on locally varying friction caused by the electric field. Furthermore the various embodiments of the invention support solutions which are based not only on alternating current but also on direct current. Yet further the inventive solution can be provided with a functionality to detect proximity and touch whereby the same component can be used for input and output functions. In addition various embodiments of the invention may utilize thick insulators for example which are mechanically stronger than thin insulators. Moreover it has been discovered in connection with several embodiments of the invention that it is beneficial to use particular variation frequencies for the electric field as they will enable smaller energy consumption in the generation of the stimulus.

In one embodiment the electrical input also comprises a high frequency component having a frequency which is higher than the frequency of the low frequency component and lower than 500 kHz. This embodiment may also comprise a modulator or other means for modulating the high frequency component by the low frequency component.

The electrical input to the one or more conducting electrodes has a peak to peak voltage of 750 to 100 000 Volts and the insulator should be dimensioned accordingly. In practical implementations with currently available materials the insulator thickness is typically between 0.1 mm and 50 mm.

In order to convey time variant information as opposed to a steady state sensation the apparatus may comprise means for modulating the electrical input according to the time variant information.

A simple but effective implementation of the invention comprises precisely one conducting electrode for each spatially distinct area of the body member. There may be more than one conducting electrode such that each conducting electrode stimulates a spatially distinct area of one or more body members. The apparatus may comprise an enclosure which contains the high voltage source which is common to all the several conducting electrodes and wherein the enclosure also contains means for conveying the electrical input to zero or more of the several conducting electrodes simultaneously. The inventive apparatus and or the one or more conducting electrodes may be positioned such that that the body member most likely to be affected is part of a human hand. For example five conducting electrodes under control of a common controller may stimulate at different times zero to five fingertips in parallel. The five conducting electrodes thus convey five bits of information in parallel. The apparatus may be implemented as part of an input output peripheral device connectable to a data processing equipment.

The high voltage amplifier is driven by an input signal IN which results in a substantial portion of the energy content of the resulting Coulomb forces to reside in a frequency range to which the Pacinian corpuscles are sensitive. For humans this frequency range is between 10 Hz and 1000 Hz preferably between 50 Hz and 500 Hz and optimally between 100 Hz and 300 Hz such as about 240 Hz. The frequency response of the Pacinian corpuscles is further discussed in connection with .

It should be understood that while tactile is frequently defined as relating to a sensation of touch or pressure the electrosensory interface according to the present CEI when properly dimensioned is capable of creating a sensation of vibration to a body member even when the body member does not actually touch the insulator overlaying the electrode . This means that unless the electrode and or insulator are very rigid the pulsating Coulomb forces between the electrode and body member particularly the Pacinian corpuscles may cause some slight mechanical vibration of the electrode and or insulator but the method and apparatus according to the CEI are capable of producing the electrosensory sensation independently of such mechanical vibration.

The high voltage amplifier and the capacitive coupling over the insulator are dimensioned such that the Pacinian corpuscles or other mechanoreceptors are stimulated and an electrosensory sensation a sensation of apparent vibration is produced. For this the high voltage amplifier must be capable of generating an output of several hundred volts or even several kilo volts. In practice the alternating current driven into the body member has a very small magnitude and can be further reduced by using a low frequency alternating current.

A benefit of the capacitive coupling between the electrode and the electrically conductive tissue underneath the skin surface which is known as the Corneus Layer and which contains the Pacinian corpuscles is that the capacitive coupling eliminates high local current densities to finger tissue which would result from contact that is conductive at direct current.

It is beneficial although not strictly necessary to provide a grounding connection which helps to bring the subject to be stimulated such as the user of the apparatus closer to a well defined non floating potential with respect to the high voltage section of the apparatus. In the embodiment shown in the grounding connection denoted by reference numeral connects a reference point REF of the high voltage section to a body part which is different from the body part s to be stimulated. In the embodiment shown in the reference point REF is at one end of the secondary winding of the transformer while the drive voltage for the electrode s A B C is obtained from the opposite end of the secondary winding.

In an illustrative implementation the apparatus is a hand held device which comprises a touch display activated by finger s . The grounding connection terminates at a grounding electrode . An illustrative implementation of the grounding electrode is one or more ground plates which are arranged such that they are conveniently touched one hand of the user while the apparatus is manipulated by the other hand. The ground plate s may be positioned on the same side of the apparatus with the touch display and next to the touch display or it they may be positioned on adjacent or opposite side s from the side which comprises the touch display depending on ergonomic considerations for example.

In real world apparatuses the coupling between the reference point REF and the non stimulated body part may be electrically complex. In addition hand held apparatuses typically lack a solid reference potential with respect to the surroundings. Accordingly the term grounding connection does not require a connection to a solid earth ground. Instead the grounding connection means any connection which helps to decrease the potential difference between the reference potential of the apparatus and a second body member distinct from the body member s to be stimulated. This definition does not rule out any capacitive parallel or stray elements so long as the grounding connection helps bring the user of the apparatus along with the non stimulated body part to a potential which is reasonably well defined with respect to the high voltage section of the apparatus. A capacitive grounding connection will be discussed in connection with . In the present context the reasonably well defined potential should be understood in view of the voltage OUT which drives the electrode s A B C. If the electrode drive voltage OUT is say 1000 V a potential difference of say 100 V between the user s body and the reference point REF may not be significant.

The non capacitive coupling between the reference point REF of the high voltage section and the non stimulated body part greatly enhances the electrosensory stimulus experienced by the stimulated body part . Conversely an equivalent electrosensory stimulus can be achieved with a much lower voltage and or over a thicker insulator when the non capacitive coupling is being used.

The amplifier is driven with a high frequency signal which is modulated by a low frequency signal in a modulator . The frequency of the low frequency signal is such that the Pacinian corpuscles which reside in the electrically conductive tissue underneath the skin surface are responsive to that frequency. The frequency of the high frequency signal is preferably slightly above the hearing ability of humans such as 18 to 25 kHz more preferably between about 19 and 22 kHz. If the frequency of the signal is within the audible range of humans the apparatus and or its drive circuit may produce distracting sounds. On the other hand if the frequency of the signal is far above the audible range of humans the apparatus drives more current into the member . A frequency of about 20 kHz is advantageous in the sense that components designed for audio circuits can generally be used while the 20 kHz frequency is inaudible to most humans. Experiments carried out by the inventors suggest that such modulation is not essential for the CEI. Use of a high frequency signal with low frequency modulation such as the one schematically shown in as opposed to a system which relies on the low frequency signal alone provides the benefit that the relatively high alternating voltage a few hundred volts or a few kilovolts can be generated with a relatively small transformer .

Terms like frequency or kHz should not be understood such that the high or low frequency signals are restricted to sinusoidal signals and many other waveforms can be used including square waves. The electrical components such as the modulator amplifier and or transformer can be dimensioned such that harmonic overtones are suppressed. The inventors have discovered that pulses with durations of 4 ms approximately one half cycle of the low frequency signal or longer can be readily detected and with a practical insulator thickness the peak to peak voltage in the electrode needs to be at least about 750 V. Unloaded peak to peak voltage measured in the electrode should be in the range of approximately 750 V 100 kV. Near the lower limit of this voltage range the insulator thickness may be 0.05 1 mm for example. As material technology and nanotechnology develop even thinner durable insulating surfaces may become available. This may also permit a reduction of the voltages used.

The elements of described so far produce a steady state electrosensory sensation as long as the body member such as the finger is in the vicinity of the electrode . In order to convey useful information the electrosensory sensation must be modulated. In some simple embodiments such modulation can be implemented by positioning the electrode such that useful information is conveyed by the fact that the finger can sense the presence of the electrode . For example the electrode can be positioned over a switch or in the vicinity of it such that the switch can be detected without having to see it.

In other embodiments such information carrying modulation can be provided by electronically controlling one or more operating parameters of the inventive apparatus. The information carrying modulation should not be confused with the modulation of the high frequency signal by the low frequency signal the purpose of which is to reduce the size of the transformer . In the schematic drawing shown in such information carrying modulation is provided by controller which controls one or more of the operating parameters of the inventive apparatus. For instance the controller may enable disable or alter the frequency or amplitude of the high or low frequency signals the gain of the amplifier or it may controllably enable or disable the power supply not shown separately or controllably break the circuit at any point.

A benefit of the embodiment shown in is that virtually all the drive circuitry including the high voltage amplifier controller and switch matrix can be integrated into a common enclosure which is denoted by reference numeral . In this embodiment only the electrodes A B and C and a single connecting wire for each electrode are outside the enclosure . As stated earlier the electrodes need to be nothing more than simple conducting or semi conducting plates covered by appropriate insulators. Therefore the enclosure can be positioned in virtually any convenient position because the only elements external to it are very simple electrodes and connecting wires and in some implementations a power supply not shown separately .

Some prior art systems provide direct stimulation of nerves via galvanic current conduction to the outermost layer of the skin. Because of the galvanic current conduction such systems require two electrodes to stimulate an area of skin. In contrast to such prior art systems the embodiment described in connection with involves multiple electrodes A B and C but each electrode alone stimulates a distinct area of skin or more precisely the mechanoreceptors including the Pacinian corpuscles underlying the outermost layers of skin. Therefore a configuration of n electrodes conveys n bits of information in parallel.

The relative sensitivity at various frequencies is remarkably similar to the one published in section 2.3.1 FIG. 2.2 of Reference document 1. Reference document 1 relates to vibrotactile mechanical stimulation of skin but the similarity of the frequency response shown in to the one published in Reference 1 suggests that the present CEI operates such that the electrode and the sensitive member see form a capacitor over the insulator and in that capacitor the oscillating Coulomb forces are converted to mechanical vibrations which are sensed by mechanoreceptors including the Pacinian corpuscles. The inventors have also studied an alternative hypothesis wherein the Pacinian corpuscles are stimulated by current flowing through them but this hypothesis does not explain the observations as well as the one which is based on Coulomb forces acting on the Pacinian corpuscles. However the technical CEI described herein does not depend on the correctness of any particular hypothesis attempting to explain why the CEI operates the way it does.

Reference numerals and denote the resulting Coulomb forces in the capacitive coupling between the electrode and the body member over the insulator . Because the two sides of the capacitive coupling have opposite charges the Coulomb force between the two sides is always attractive and proportional to the square of the voltage. Reference numeral denotes the actual Coulomb force while reference numeral denotes its envelope. The envelope is within the range of frequencies to which the Pacinian corpuscles are sensitive but because the Coulomb force is always attractive the envelope has two peaks for each cycle of the modulator output signal whereby a frequency doubling effect is produced. Because the Coulomb force is proportional to the square of the voltage any exemplary voltages disclosed herein should be interpreted as effective RMS values in case the voltages are not sinusoidal.

The statement that the two sides of the capacitive coupling have opposite charges whereby the Coulomb force is always attractive holds for a case in which the apparatus and the body member to be stimulated are at or near the same potential. High static charges can cause deviations from this ideal state of affairs which is why some form of grounding connection between a reference potential of the high voltage source and the body element other than the one s to be stimulated is recommended as the grounding connection helps to lower the potential differences between the apparatus and its user.

The CEI can be implemented as part of an input output peripheral device which is connectable to a data processing equipment. In such a configuration the data processing equipment can provide prompting and or feedback via electrically controllable electrosensory sensation.

The matrix of electrodes through and the switch array provide a spatial variation of the electrosensory stimulation. In other words the sensory stimulation provided to the user depends on the location of the user s body member such as a finger proximate to the CEI apparatus which is integrated to the inventive touch screen. The spatially varying sensory stimulation provides the user with an indication of the layout of the touch sensitive areas of the touch screen interface.

In addition to the spatially varying sensory stimulation the controller may direct the switch array to produce a temporally varying time dependent electrosensory stimulation which can be used for a wide variety of useful effects. For instance the temporally varying electrosensory stimulation can be used to indicate a detected activation of a touch sensitive area key press . This embodiment address a common problem associated with prior art touch screen devices namely the fact that a detection of a key press produces no tactile feedback. Prior art application level programs used via touch screen devices may provide visual or aural feedback but such types of feedback exhibit the various problems described earlier. In addition production of the visual or aural feedback from the application level program causes a burden on the programming and execution of those programs. In some implementations of the invention an interface level or driver level program provides a tactile feedback from a detected activation of a touch sensitive area by using the temporally and spatially variant electrosensory stimulation and such interface level or driver level programs can be used by any application level programs. For example the application level programs can be coupled to the inventive touch screen interface via an application programming interface API whose set of available functions includes the feedback generation described above.

The temporally and spatially variant electrosensory stimulation can also be used to change the layout of the touch sensitive areas on the fly . In hindsight this operation may be considered roughly analogous to changing the keyboard or keypad layout depending on the application program or user interface screen currently executed. However when prior art touch screen devices change keyboard or keypad layout on the fly the new layout must be somehow indicated to the user and this normally requires that the user sees the touch screen device.

Some embodiments of the inventive touch screen device eliminate the need to see the touch screen device assuming that the layout of the touch sensitive areas is sufficiently simple. For instance up to about two dozen different key legends can be indicated to the user by providing different patterns for the temporally and spatially variant electrosensory stimulation. As used herein the expression key legend refers to the fact that prior art touch screen devices which produce no tactile feedback normally produce visual cues and these are commonly called legends . In some embodiments of the present invention the function of the key legends can be provided via different patterns. For instance the following patterns can be identified with one fingertip pulses with low medium or high repetition rate sweeps to left right up or down each with a few different repetition rates rotations clockwise or anti clockwise each with a few different repetition rates.

From the above it is evident that the inventive electrosensory interface can produce a large number of different touch sensitive areas each with a distinct feel technically a different pattern for the temporal and spatial variation of the electrosensory stimulus . Hence the screen section of a conventional touch screen is not absolutely needed in connection with the present invention and the term touch device interface should be interpreted as an interface device which among other things is suitable for applications commonly associated with touch screen devices although the presence of the screen is not mandatory.

Moreover the strength of the capacitive coupling between the inventive CEI and a body member of its user or the capacitive coupling between an individual electrode or a group of electrodes and the user s body member can be determined by direct or indirect measurements. This measurement information can be utilized in various ways. For instance the strength of the capacitive coupling can indicate the body member s proximity to the electrode or it can indicate touching the electrode by the body member. Such measurement functionality can be provided by a dedicated measurement unit not shown or it can be integrated into one of the blocks described earlier such as the switch matrix . The switch matrix or the optional dedicated measurement unit can send the measurement information to the controller which can utilize it to vary the electric fields generated by the electrodes by varying the voltage or frequency. In addition or alternatively the controller may forward the measurement information or some information processed from it to a data processing equipment such as the personal computer PC shown in .

Yet further two or more inventive touch device interfaces can be interconnected via some communication network s and data processing equipment. In such an arrangement the electrosensory stimulation provided to the users of the touch screen devices may be based on some function of all users contribution to the proximity to their respective devices. In one illustrative example such an interconnection of two or more touch screen devices can provide their users with tactile feedback whose strength depends on the sum of the areas of hands touch the touch sensitive areas. This technique simulates a handshake whose strength reflects the sum of hand pressure exerted by both or all users. In another illustrative example a music teacher might sense how a remotely located student presses the keys of a simulated piano keyboard.

This voltage is lower than the drive voltage e from the voltage source. In a general case the reference potential of the apparatus may be floating as will be shown in . This arrangement further decreases the electric field directed to the body member such as finger.

For these reasons some embodiments of the invention aim at keeping the capacitance C low in comparison to that of C. At least capacitance C should not be significantly higher than C. Some embodiments aim at adjusting or controlling C for instance by coupling the reference potential of the apparatus back to the user as shown in .

Further analysis of the actual value of capacitance C shows that it can be treated as a capacitance consisting of three series coupled partial capacitances Cof the insulator material Cof the air gap between insulator and finger and Cformed by the outmost skin layer that is electrically insulating the inner conducting tissue from the environment. Each partial capacitance is given by 

Herein is the permittivity dielectric constant of the insulating material S is the effective surface area and d is the distance between the surfaces of the capacitor. In a series arrangement of capacitances the smallest one of the individual capacitances dominates the overall value of the total capacitance C. When the body member does not touch the surface of the insulated electrode but only approaches it the capacitive coupling is weak. Thus the value of C is small and mainly determined by the air gap C. When the body member touches the surface the effective air gap is small approximately the height ridges of the fingerprint profile on the skin surface . As capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance of the conducting surfaces forming the capacitor corresponding Cobtains a high value and the value of C is determined by Cand C. Thus the effectiveness of the electrosensory stimulus generation can be enhanced by appropriate selection of insulator material particularly in terms of thickness and dielectric properties. For instance selecting a material with a relatively high dielectric constant for the insulator reduces the electric field in the material but increases the electric field strength in the air gap and skin.

Furthermore in applications where the surface is likely to be touched while the electrosensory stimulation or response is given the effectiveness of the electrosensory stimulus generation can be enhanced by optimal selection of the material that will be touched by the body member. This is particularly significant in connection with insulators which are good volume insulators insulators in the direction of the surface s normal but less so in the direction along the surface.

An insulator s insulation capability along the surface may be negatively affected by surface impurities or moisture which have a negative effect on the apparent strength of the sensation felt by the body member to be stimulated. For instance glass is generally considered a good insulator but its surface tends to collect a thin sheet of moisture from the air. If the electrode of the CEI is insulated with glass the electrosensory effect is felt in close proximity when there is still an air gap between body member and the glass surface . However when the glass surface is touched even lightly the electrosensory tends to weaken or disappear altogether. Coating the outer insulating surface with a material having a low surface conductance remedies such problems. The inventors speculate that if the surface having some surface conductivity is touched it is the conductive layer on the surface that experiences the coulomb force rather than the body member touching the surface. Instead the touching body member acts as a kind of grounding for the conductive surface layer for example via the stray capacitance of the body.

Instead of the measures described in connection with or in addition to such measures stray capacitances can be controlled by arrangements in which several electrodes are used to generate potential differences among different areas of the touch screen surface. By way of example this technique can be implemented by arranging the touch sensitive surface of a hand held device eg the top side of the device to a first potential while the opposite side is arranged to a second potential wherein the two different potentials can be the positive and negative poles of the device. Alternatively a first surface area can be the electric ground reference potential while a second surface area is charged to a high potential.

Moreover within the constraints imposed by the insulator layer s it is possible to form minuscule areas of different potentials such as potentials with opposite signs or widely different magnitudes wherein the areas are small enough that the user s body member such as finger is simultaneously subjected to the electric fields from several areas with different potentials.

In one implementation the apparatus is arranged to utilize such indication of the touching or approaching body member such that the apparatus uses a first lower voltage to detect the touching or approaching by the body member and a second higher voltage to provide feedback to the user. For instance such feedback can indicate any of the following the outline of the each touch sensitive area a detection of the touching or approaching body member by the apparatus the significance of the act to be initiated by the touch sensitive area or any other information processed by the application program and which is potentially useful to the user.

According to an embodiment of the invention a conventional touch sensitive screen can be complemented by an interface device according to the invention. Reference numeral denotes an electrode which is an implementation of the electrodes described in connection with previously described embodiments such as the electrode described in connection with . A supplemental insulator may be positioned between the touch sensitive screen and the inventive electrode in case the touch sensitive screen itself fails to provide sufficient insulation.

In addition to conventional touch screen functionality namely detection of approaching or touching by the touch sensitive areas by the user s finger the controller uses information of the position of the finger to temporally vary the intensity of the electrosensory stimulation invoked by the electrode on the finger . Although the intensity of the electrosensory stimulation is varied over time time is not an independent variable in the present embodiment. Instead timing of the temporal variations is a function of the position of the finger relative to the touch sensitive areas here A Aand A . Thus it is more accurate to say that the present embodiment is operable to cause variations in the intensity of the electrosensory stimulation invoked by the electrode on the finger wherein the variations are based on the position of the finger relative to the touch sensitive areas.

The bottom side of illustrates this functionality. The three touch sensitive area A Aand Aare demarcated by respective x coordinate pairs x x x x and x x. Processing in the y direction is analogous and a detailed description is omitted. The controller does not sense the presence of the finger or senses the finger as inactive as long as the finger is to the left of any of the touch sensitive areas A Aand A. In this example the controller responds by applying a low intensity signal to the electrode . As soon as the finger crosses the x coordinate value x the controller detects the finger over the first touch sensitive area Aand starts to apply a medium intensity signal to the electrode . Between the areas Aand A between x coordinates xand x the controller again applies a low intensity signal to the electrode . The second touch sensitive area Ais processed similarly to the first touch sensitive area A but the third touch sensitive area Ais processed somewhat differently. As soon as the controller detects the finger above or in close proximity to the area A it begins to apply the medium intensity signal to the electrode similarly to areas Aand A. But the user decides to press the touch screen at a point xwithin the third area A. The controller detects the finger press activation of the function assigned to the area A and responds by applying a high intensity signal to the electrode .

Thus the embodiment shown in can provide the user with a tactile feedback which creates an illusion of a textures surface although only a single electrode was used to create the electrosensory stimulus. A residual problem is however that the user has to memorize the significance of the several touch sensitive areas or obtain visual or aural information on their significance.

The operation of the embodiment shown in differs from the one described in connection with in that the controller here denoted by reference numeral applies different temporal variations to the intensity of the signal to the electrode . In this example the first touch sensitive area Ais processed similarly to the preceding embodiment or in other words the intensity of the electrosensory stimulus depends only on the presence of the finger in close proximity to the area A. But in close proximity to areas Aand A the controller also applies temporal variations to the intensity of the electrosensory stimulus. For example the significance coarsely analogous with a displayed legend of area Ais indicated by a pulsed electrosensory stimulus at a first low repetition rate while the significance of area Ais indicated by a pulsed electrosensory stimulus at a second higher repetition rate. In an illustrative example the three touch sensitive areas A Aand Acan invoke the three functions in a yes no cancel type user interface wherein the user can sense the positions of the user interface keys here the three touch sensitive areas and the indication of an accepted input only via tactile feedback. In other words the user needs no visual or aural information on the positions of the touch sensitive areas or on the selected function. The embodiment described in connection with is particularly attractive in car navigators or the like which should not require visual attention from their users.

In the embodiments shown in when the user s finger has selected the function assigned to area Aand the controller CTRL generates the high intensity electrosensory stimulus via the electrode the high intensity stimulus is sensed via any of the areas A Aand A. In other words if one finger of the user presses the area A other finger s in close proximity to the other areas Aand or Awill also sense the high intensity stimulus. In cases where this is not desirable the embodiments shown in can be combined with the multi electrode embodiment disclosed in connection with such that the signal to each of several electrodes shown in as items through is controlled individually.

It is readily apparent to a person skilled in the art that as the technology advances the inventive concept can be implemented in various ways. The invention and its embodiments are not limited to the examples described above but may vary within the scope of the claims.
