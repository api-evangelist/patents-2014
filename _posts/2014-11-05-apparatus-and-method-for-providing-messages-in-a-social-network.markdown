The present disclosure relates generally to media content communication and more specifically to an apparatus and method for providing messages in a social network.

Social networks implemented through websites continue to grow in popularity. The social networks typically allow users to selectively share their experiences with other members of the social network through posting of information by a poster.

The social networks often allow the poster to control which members have access to the posted information. The posted information often contains a description of a life experience of the poster and select members can comment on the experience which generates a discussion forum for the poster as well as the select members.

One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a server including a controller to receive audio signals and content identification information from a gateway. The audio signals can represent a voice message inputted into a remote control device in communication with the gateway. The voice message can be inputted into the remote control device when media content is being presented by a display device in communication with the gateway. The content identification information can be associated with the media content. The controller of the server is operable to generate text representing the voice message based on the audio signals and determine an identity of the media content based on the content identification information. The controller of the server is also operable to generate an enhanced message including the text and additional content where the additional content is obtained by the server s controller based on the identity of the media content. The controller of the server is further operable to transmit the enhanced message to the gateway for presentation on the display device where the enhanced message is accessible by one or more communication devices that are associated with a social network and remote from the gateway.

One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a computing device including a controller to wirelessly receive a voice message from a remote communication device where the voice message is an input into the remote communication device and transmit the voice message to a server for generating text based on the voice message. The controller is also configured to transmit content identification information associated with media content to the server where an identity of the media content being presented at the time of receiving the voice message is determined by the server based on the content identification information where an enhanced message comprising the text and additional content is generated by the server and wherein the additional content is obtained by the server based on the identity of the media content. The controller is further configured to receive the enhanced message from the server and provide the enhanced message for presentation on a display device in communication with the computing device where the enhanced message is accessible by one or more other communication devices that are associated with a social network and remote from the computing device.

One embodiment of the present disclosure can entail a method including receiving a voice message at a server where the voice message is received from a media processor and is associated with media content presented by the media processor. The method can also include determining a context of the voice message using the server and obtaining additional content using the server where the additional content is obtained based on an identity of the media content and a context of the voice message. The method can further include generating an enhanced message using the server where the enhanced message includes the additional content and text representing the voice message.

The VHS can distribute multimedia broadcast programs via an access network to commercial and or residential buildings housing a gateway such as a residential or commercial gateway . The access network can represent a group of digital subscriber line access multiplexers DSLAMs located in a central office or a service area interface that provides broadband services over optical links or copper twisted pairs to buildings . The gateway can use common communication technology to distribute broadcast signals to media devices such as computers television sets managed in some instances by a media controller such as an infrared or RF remote control gaming controller etc. . In one embodiment the gateway can deliver the media content to media processors such as Set Top Boxes STBs or gaming consoles which in turn present broadcast channels to the media devices .

In one embodiment the gateway can deliver the media content to the display devices without using an intermediary media processor such as an STB. For instance the gateway can selectively bypass the set top box and deliver the media content directly to the display device . The gateway can determine a type or format of media content that is being received and can determine if the media content is compatible with a set top box connected with a particular display device . If there is an incompatibility determined then the gateway can bypass the set top box and deliver the media content directly to the display device . In another example the gateway can determine the compatibility issue and can reformat the media content for delivery based on the compatibility determination.

In another embodiment the gateway can utilize a common format or protocol for delivery of data to a plurality of communication devices e.g. television desktop computer video gaming console mobile cellular phone camera media player and so forth throughout the residence or other building . For example Digital Living Network Alliance DLNA technology can be utilized by the gateway as well as other communication devices in the residence or building to enable PC Internet mobile and consumer electronics devices to find each other communicate share and display multimedia content while adhering to digital rights management associated with the media content. In this embodiment the gateway can communicate directly with one or more of the display devices without using an STB.

The gateway the media processors and or media devices can utilize tethered interface technologies such as coaxial phone line or power line wiring or can operate over a common wireless access protocol such as Wireless Fidelity WiFi . With these interfaces unicast communications can be invoked by the gateway and or the media processors from the subsystems of the IPTV media system for services such as video on demand VoD browsing an electronic programming guide EPG or other infrastructure services.

Some of the network elements of the IPTV media system can be coupled to one or more computing devices . The computing devices or a portion thereof can operate as a web server for providing portal services over an Internet Service Provider ISP network to wireline media devices or wireless communication devices e.g. cellular phone laptop computer etc. by way of a wireless access base station . The base station can operate according to common wireless access protocols such as WiFi or cellular communication technologies such as GSM CDMA UMTS WiMAX Software Defined Radio or SDR and so on .

In one embodiment a satellite broadcast television system can be used in place of or in addition to the IPTV media system . In this embodiment signals transmitted by a satellite carrying media content can be intercepted by a common satellite dish receiver coupled to the building . Modulated signals intercepted by the satellite dish receiver can be transferred to the media processors for decoding and distributing broadcast channels to the media devices . The media processors can be equipped with a broadband port to the IP network to enable services such as VoD and EPG described above.

In yet another embodiment an analog or digital broadcast distribution system such as cable TV system can be used in place of or in addition to the IPTV media system described above. In this embodiment the cable TV system can provide Internet telephony and interactive media services.

It is contemplated that the present disclosure can apply to any present or next generation over the air and or landline media content services system. In one embodiment an IP Multimedia Subsystem IMS network architecture can be utilized to facilitate the combined services of circuit switched and packet switched systems in delivering the media content to one or more viewers.

The computing devices can include a controller for performing message enhancement associated with a social network . The social network can be a website maintained by a plurality of servers that is accessible by users for providing messages and other information to each other such as Facebook MySpace Twitter and so forth.

The controller can receive an audio message and can convert it into text. The controller can also enhance the text based on media content that was being viewed e.g. movies or otherwise consumed e.g. songs or video games at the time that a request for the message was made by the user. In one embodiment the message request can include information associated with an identification of the media content that was being viewed or consumed. For example the information can be metadata that includes a title of the media content. In another embodiment the information can be channel identification and a time stamp or other indicator of time. Based on this information the media content can then be identified.

The controller can then use the identification of the media content to generate an enhancement for the message. The enhancement can be media content embedded in the message such as one or more images taken from the media content for presentation at the social network . In one embodiment the enhancement can be additional text that is generated based on the media content and based on the text that was converted from the audio message. For instance the controller can generate one or more questions based on the text and the media content such as have you seen movies A B and C which starred actress X where the media content was a movie starring actress X and the text positively described actress X s performance in the movie. As another example the controller can generate one or more questions based on the text and the media content such as have you heard songs B C and D which are sung by singer Y where the media content was song A sung by singer X and the text negatively described singer X s performance of the song. Songs X and Y can be in the same genre which is determined from the identity of the media content i.e. song X . In one embodiment the controller can generate the enhancement text based on a context of the voice message where the controller determines the context.

In one embodiment the enhancement can be generated based on one or more rules or policies associated with the user the recipient s and or the social network . For instance the enhancement can be generated based on user profiles associated with the sender and or the recipient s . The user profiles can indicate a type or category of associated information that is to be included in the enhancement. For example the user profile can indicate questions to be included in the enhancement such as whether anyone desires to see a singer in concert where the audio message was associated with a singer and the media content being consumed was a song performed by the singer.

The enhancement can also be generated based on rules or polices of the social network independent of any user profiles. For example a sender and one or more recipients can be subscribed to a particular service of the social network such as a video game. The enhancement can be information associated with the particular video game e.g. an available software update which is also associated with the audio message and the media content being consumed.

In one embodiment the message request and the audio message can be transmitted from the controller to the computing devices such as through the gateway and or through the STB . In one embodiment the controller is a Voice Activated Remote Control VARC that can capture voice messages from the sender and can control operation of one or more display devices such as through use of the STB s . In another embodiment the controller can capture the audio message and can send control signals associated with the display device but the controller is not operable to engage in voice communication with other communication devices. In another embodiment the audio message and the message request can be transmitted from a communication device e.g. a cell phone which is configured for voice communication with other devices. In this example the communication device can be a multi mode communication device which can transmit the audio message and or the message request in a first mode of communication e.g. WiFi and can engage in voice communication in a second mode of communication e.g. cellular communication . Other modes of communications are also contemplated by the exemplary embodiments.

The exemplary embodiments also contemplate the controller determining the media content without use of identification information in the message request or based upon partial identification information. For instance the controller can record a portion of a song and can include it in the message request along with the audio message. The recorded portion can be analyzed and compared to a library of songs for a match. In one embodiment channel information and or time information can be provided with the message request to facilitate determining a matching song. For instance the channel and or time information can narrow the determination to selecting among a subset of songs from the library based on a genre of music. The determination of the media content can be based on other media content formats such as movies or video games. For instance the controller can include a camera for capturing one or more images from the movie or video game which can then be analyzed by the controller to determine the media content based on a library of movies and or video games. The library of songs movies video games and so forth can be a database maintained by the computing devices and or can be a remote depository of media content that is accessible by the controller .

The UI can include a depressible or touch sensitive keypad with a navigation mechanism such as a roller ball joystick mouse or navigation disk for manipulating operations of the communication device . The keypad can be an integral part of a housing assembly of the communication device or an independent device operably coupled thereto by a tethered wireline interface such as a USB cable or a wireless interface supporting for example Bluetooth. The keypad can represent a numeric dialing keypad commonly used by phones and or a QWERTY keypad with alphanumeric keys. The UI can further include a display such as monochrome or color LCD Liquid Crystal Display OLED Organic Light Emitting Diode or other suitable display technology for conveying images to an end user of the communication device . In an embodiment where the display is touch sensitive a portion or all of the keypad can be presented by way of the display .

The UI can also include an audio system that utilizes common audio technology for conveying low volume audio such as audio heard only in the proximity of a human ear and high volume audio for hands free operation. The audio system can further include a microphone for receiving audible signals from an end user. The audio system can also be used for voice recognition applications. The UI can further include an image sensor such as a charged coupled device CCD camera for capturing still or moving images.

The power supply can utilize common power management technologies such as replaceable and rechargeable batteries supply regulation technologies and charging system technologies for supplying energy to the components of the communication device to facilitate long range or short range portable applications. The location detector can utilize common location technology such as a global positioning system GPS receiver for identifying a location of the communication device based on signals generated by a constellation of GPS satellites thereby facilitating common location services such as navigation.

The communication device can use the transceiver to also determine a proximity to a cellular WiFi or Bluetooth access point by common power sensing techniques such as utilizing a received signal strength indicator RSSI and or a signal time of arrival TOA or time of flight TOF . The controller can utilize computing technologies such as a microprocessor a digital signal processor DSP and or a video processor with associated storage memory such as Flash ROM RAM SRAM DRAM or other storage technologies.

The communication device can be adapted to perform the functions of the media processor the media devices or the portable communication devices of as well as IMS Communication Devices and PSTN Communication Devices. It will be appreciated that the communication device can also represent other common devices that can operate in communication system of such as a gaming console and a media player.

In one embodiment the WAP can be accessed by a controller of the STB such as VARC and can utilize the WiFi communication for receipt of signals from the VARC. In another embodiment the VARC can be a multi mode device such that the voice message can be transmitted using a first mode of communication e.g. WiFi communication and control signals associated with presentation of media content can be transmitted using a second mode of communication e.g. IR communication . The WAP can receive a voice input via the VARC . In one embodiment the VARC can include a dedicated button for interacting with the VARC server such as via WiFi communication with the gateway that communicates over the access network with the server.

In another embodiment a message sender can depress a button on the VARC to initiate the voice message service. Once the button is depressed a message request is transmitted from the VARC to the VARC server in order to access the social network. The social network can be a third party network such as network having its own servers to maintain a social website or can be a network established by the service provider.

The VARC can also capture a voice message and begin streaming audio signals representing the voice message to the VARC server such as through the gateway . The gateway can transmit content identification information to the VARC server for determining an identity of the media content being presented at the time of the voice message. In one embodiment the STB state at the time of the voice message can be transmitted to the VARC server by the gateway or another device such as the STB . For example the STB state can include an identification of a channel being viewed at the time of the voice message.

In another embodiment the VARC can be used to capture a portion of the media content that is being viewed at the time of the voice message. In one embodiment the portion of the media content is captured by transmitting record signals to the STB so that the portion of the media content is recorded by the STB. In another embodiment the portion of the media content is captured by the VARC such as recording a song or capturing images of a movie or video game via a camera or other recording device incorporated into the controller. The portion of the media content can then be transmitted to the VARC server to facilitate identification of the media content.

In one embodiment to tie the state information of the STB with a specific VARC the VARC can maintain the identity information of a specific STB for which it communicates with at any given time. Every time that a VARC sends the captured audio input from the user to the VARC server it can also send the identity of the STB to the VARC server in a header file associated with the audio stream. Thus the VARC server can know the identity of the STB and can then use that information along with a timestamp associated with each VTM Voice Twitter Message request to determine the identity of the media content being viewed at the time of the VTM generation. Of course the VTM could be a message associated with any social network and is only used as an example.

In another embodiment the device utilized for interfacing with the WAP can be a mobile device that is configured for voice communication such as a cellular phone. For example a multi mode mobile device can utilize WiFi communication to communicate with the gateway for using the voice message service while using cellular communication for providing voice communications with other communication devices such as devices . In one embodiment the mobile device is not associated with the gateway or the STB . For example a sender who desires to send a voice message to the social network can access the network via another user s gateway or STB .

The VARC server can receive the audio signals representing the voice message and can convert the voice message into text such as through use of an automatic speech recognition engine. In one embodiment the conversion of the voice message to text can be performed by the VARC server in real time. The VARC server can also apply one or more rules or policies from the VTM rules which can be stored in a database maintained by the server or which can be otherwise accessible by the server from another source. The VTM rules can establish a procedure for processing particular message requests such as identifying recipients based on a user profile associated with the sender of the request authenticating the sender to the social network and so forth.

The VARC server can also determine an identity of the media content based on one or both of the content identification information and the captured portion of the media content. For example the content identification information can include the channel being viewed which can be correlated with the time of the voice message such as through a time stamp accompanying the message request . This information can then be used to identify the media content based on an EPG Content library which includes scheduling information for various media content. In one embodiment the captured portion of the media content can be matched with media content stored in the library to determine the identity of the media content such as through voice audio and or image recognition. In another embodiment the channel being viewed and or the time information can be utilized to determine a genre of the music or TV program being viewed or other type of media content. The genre can be utilized for narrowing the group of media content in the library to be analyzed for a match with the media content. In one embodiment the conversion of the voice message to text can be facilitated by the identification of the media content. For instance the media content can be identified in order to establish a context of the voice message and the context can be utilized for assisting in voice recognition. As an example a voice message may have a word that is difficult to identify. The VARC server can identify the media content associated with the voice message and can determine a context of the voice message such as the message sender discussing a movie. The VARC server can then reduce the possible identities of the word based on the context such as through a word list associated with the context e.g. the words actor action actress and act being associated with the context of a movie . In one embodiment speech recognition can be optimized since different speech recognition grammars can be created depending on the context such as music genre or TV channel or TV program . This can increase the likelihood of identifying words that are difficult to recognize since those words would be included in the appropriate separate grammars. For example a country music speech recognition grammar could be used for recognizing voice messages when the TV is tuned to a country music channel. The same could apply for TV or movie channels when the content falls generally into a category or genre. For example the movie channel AMC American Movie Classics shows lots of classic movies so a classic movie speech recognition grammar could be created to make it more likely that words from that kind of content actor names character names words related to the specific movie etc. would be recognized in the voice message. The same could apply for specific news channels. If it is possible to identify the media content based on an EPG Content library speech recognition grammars could be customized or otherwise built for that identified media content and could include words that are specific to the identified media content. These customized speech recognition grammars could then be applied to other identified media content that is similar to or otherwise associated with the previous identified media content such as media content falling within a category of Movie Classics as described above.

The VARC server can obtain additional content to enhance the voice message of the sender based on the identity of the media content being viewed or otherwise consumed at the time of the voice message. In one embodiment the additional content can be obtained based on a context of the voice message where the context is determined by the VARC server . In another embodiment the additional content can be obtained based on a user profile associated with the sender and or the recipients. In yet another embodiment the additional content can be obtained based on the social network and independent of the sender and recipients. In one embodiment the additional content can be text generated by the VARC server that is associated with the media content. The text can be in the form of a question regarding the media content such as whether the recipients are familiar with other media content by the same artist where the other media content is identified in the additional content text.

The additional content can be embedded in the enhanced message along with the text representing the voice message such as providing images of the additional content along with the text in a message. In one embodiment the system can include message module which contains for example a Voice Twitter Application on the IPTV platform associated with a channel or application running on STB for generating or otherwise facilitating the generation of the enhanced message. The VARC server can deliver the enhanced message to the STB for presentation on the display device . The enhanced message can also be accessed by other communication devices that are associated with the sender via the social network. For instance the enhanced message can be posted on a social network website and viewed by members who have been granted permission by the sender to view the enhanced message. In one embodiment the social network website can be accessed over the Internet by the STB as well as the communication devices .

In one embodiment the Voice Twitter Application of message module where we are using Twitter as an example of a social network website could access or retrieve the messages from the social network website using APIs Application Programming Interfaces so the user is actually viewing these messages on the STB because the messages are being retrieved by the Voice Twitter Application page as opposed to a scenario where the STB loads the social network website directly. Effectively the Voice Twitter Application can be a page an application or channel on the STB which is the user interface for using this enhanced messaging capability. In one embodiment the Voice Twitter Application can show continuous status while the voice messages are being created the recognized voice message and enhanced message that will be sent out. Thus the Voice Twitter Application is used to compose the enhanced messages but it can also be used to view messages on the social network.

In one embodiment a confirmation message can be transmitted from the VARC server to the STB based on receipt of the message request from the VARC . The confirmation can include the converted text so that the message sender can ensure that the message was accurately converted. The confirmation can also include the additional content so that the message sender can authorize posting of the particular additional content.

The enhanced message can include text that represents the voice message captured by the VARC and additional content such as content which is text generated by the VARC server based on the media content. The exemplary additional content depicts information about media content associated with the same artist and within the context of the voice message e.g. a positive review of a song by Madonna while the exemplary additional content depicts another song by the artist.

In one embodiment the STB and or the gateway can include a controller to wirelessly receive control signals from the VARC and can control presentation of media content on the display device based on the control signals. The controller of the STB and or the gateway can wirelessly receive a voice message from the VARC wherein the voice message is an input into the VARC . The controller of the STB and or the gateway can transmit the voice message to the VARC server shown in for generating text based on the voice message and can transmit content identification information associated with the media content to the server. An identity of the media content presented at the time of receiving the voice message can be determined by the VARC server based on the content identification information where an enhanced message comprising the text and additional content is generated by the server. The additional content can be obtained by the VARC server based on the identity of the media content. The controller of the STB and or the gateway can receive the enhanced message from the VARC server and can present the enhanced message on the display device where the enhanced message is accessible by the one or more communication devices shown in that are associated with a social network and are remote from the STB and or gateway.

The enhanced message can include text that represents the voice message captured by the VARC controller and additional content such as content which is text generated by the VARC server based on the media content. The exemplary additional content depicts a question posed to the message recipient s while the exemplary additional content depicts one or more still or moving images associated with the media content e.g. a highlight of a catch from earlier in the football game .

In step the VARC server can determine if information has been provided such as metadata including a title of the media content from which the media content can be identified. In one embodiment the message request can include content identification information from which the identity of the media content can be determined such as a state of the STB at the time of the voice message which includes the channel being viewed and time information. If sufficient information for identifying the media content is not included in the message request then the VARC server can attempt to recognize the media content in step based on an analysis of a portion of the media content received from the gateway and or the STB . The portion of the media content can be received with the message request and or can be received in response to a query by the VARC server for additional identification information.

In step text can be generated by the VARC server that represents the voice message. In one embodiment the identification of the media content can be utilized to facilitate conversion of the voice message to text. For example the VARC server can determine a context of the voice message based on the media content and can determine or otherwise recognize words in the voice message based in part on that context.

Once the identity of the media content is determined then in step the VARC server can obtain additional content based on the identity of the media content. The additional content can be obtained by the VARC server either from another source or by generating it. In one embodiment the VARC server applies VTM rules from database to generate the additional content. The additional content can be in a number of different formats including text audio and images.

In another embodiment the additional content is based on the identity of the media content and a context of the voice message as determined by the VARC server . For example the voice message can include a positive review of a particular actor in a movie. The VARC server can determine the context of the voice message is the positive review of the particular actor performing in the identified media content. The VARC server can then generate additional content such as a description of other movies in which the actor received positive reviews. The context of the voice message allows the VARC server to include other movies in which the actor also received positive reviews as opposed to performing a keyword search for the actor which would provide a list of all movies including movies in which a negative review was received in which the actor performed. In one embodiment the additional content can be text in the form of a question associated with the media content. The additional content can be obtained using other factors including user preferences associated with either or both of the message sender and recipients monitored viewing behavior associated with either or both of the message sender and recipients and so forth.

In step the VARC server can compose the enhanced message based on the text and the additional content such as through use of message module . In one embodiment the additional content and the text can be aggregated into a single message without attachments although the exemplary embodiments contemplate utilizing attachments for all or a portion of the additional content. The enhanced message can then be delivered by the VARC server to the social network in step . In one embodiment the enhanced message can be delivered to the display device of the STB so that the message sender can view the enhanced message. In another embodiment the enhanced message can be presented first to the message sender for review and approval and then delivered to the social network where it is accessible by one or more other communication devices that have been provided permission by the message sender to view the enhanced message. In another embodiment the sender can be provided the opportunity to edit or otherwise alter the additional content included in the enhanced message. In yet another embodiment the enhanced message or the information that makes up the enhanced message can be provided to one or more servers of a third party that maintains the social network so that the third party can post the enhanced message.

Upon reviewing the aforementioned embodiments it would be evident to an artisan with ordinary skill in the art that said embodiments can be modified reduced or enhanced without departing from the scope and spirit of the claims described below. The embodiments described above can be adapted to operate with any device capable of performing in whole or in part the steps described for method . For example a PDA can be adapted to capture voice messages and initiate the voice message service.

In one embodiment the message can be sent so that the recipient s can click on a button or a link so the recipient s STB goes to the channel or location within the content. If the content was recorded locally the local DVR could queue up to that point. The exemplary embodiments also contemplate utilizing a network DVR for delivering the media content or a portion thereof to the recipients.

In another embodiment a first user can voice browse an EPG to find a programming that is desired. The first user can create a voice message for a second user by speaking a few words into the VARC and can continue to watch the programming. The VARC server can send an SMS to a second user. The voice message can indicate to the second user to tune to the VTM channel or application. The channel being viewed by the first user can then be displayed in a PIP window for the second user. The second user will also see the voice message spoken by the first user. In one embodiment the second user can receive the media content in the PIP window for a limited duration where the second user is not subscribed to receive the content.

In yet another embodiment the VTM rules can dynamically compose EPG related questions or assertions that are based on the media content. Subject matters such as TV metadata including plot rating information genre actors directors and so forth can be explored using the dynamic composition of questions.

Other suitable modifications can be applied to the present disclosure without departing from the scope of the claims below. Accordingly the reader is directed to the claims section for a fuller understanding of the breadth and scope of the present disclosure.

The instructions may further be transmitted or received over a network via the network interface device .

While the machine readable medium is shown in an example embodiment to be a single medium the term machine readable medium should be taken to include a single medium or multiple media e.g. a centralized or distributed database and or associated caches and servers that store the one or more sets of instructions. The term machine readable medium shall also be taken to include any medium that is capable of storing encoding or carrying a set of instructions for execution by the machine and that cause the machine to perform any one or more of the methodologies of the present disclosure.

The term machine readable medium shall accordingly be taken to include but not be limited to solid state memories such as a memory card or other package that houses one or more read only non volatile memories random access memories or other re writable volatile memories magneto optical or optical medium such as a disk or tape and or a digital file attachment to e mail or other self contained information archive or set of archives is considered a distribution medium equivalent to a tangible storage medium. Accordingly the disclosure is considered to include any one or more of a machine readable medium or a distribution medium as listed herein and including art recognized equivalents and successor media in which the software implementations herein are stored.

Although the present specification describes components and functions implemented in the embodiments with reference to particular standards and protocols the disclosure is not limited to such standards and protocols. Each of the standards for Internet and other packet switched network transmission e.g. TCP IP UDP IP HTML HTTP represent examples of the state of the art. Such standards are periodically superseded by faster or more efficient equivalents having essentially the same functions. Accordingly replacement standards and protocols having the same functions are considered equivalents.

This disclosure is intended to cover any and all adaptations or variations of various embodiments. Combinations of the above embodiments and other embodiments not specifically described herein will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description.

The Abstract of the Disclosure is provided with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In addition in the foregoing Detailed Description it can be seen that various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather as the following claims reflect inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus the following claims are hereby incorporated into the Detailed Description with each claim standing on its own as a separately claimed subject matter.
