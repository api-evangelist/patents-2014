The present invention relates to crop development profiling in precision agriculture. Specifically the present invention relates to a system and method of augmenting growing degree day models with dynamical extended range weather forecasts and routine remotely sensed validation imagery for developing profiles of crop growth throughout a crop growing season.

The relationship between weather and plant growth has been recognized for many centuries. For example the importance of inter annual variations of weather conditions for resulting differences in plant development levels is well known. The understanding of the relationship of weather to plant and animal growth known as phenology has become an important process in annual estimation of crop stages pest emergence and disease development. Modern phenology began with recordings of plant and insect development in relation to climate conditions and over the past fifty years the development of phenological models has accelerated to provide crop specific models and even crop variety specific models. The models which are commonly referred as growing degree day GDD models have been developed to understand the timing between accumulated growing degrees and stages of crop development. Combined with pest and disease emergence which are also phenological processes the growing degree day models permit producers and crop advisors to make critical decisions on crop protection and enhancement.

Growing degree day models whether specifically for issues such as insects or diseases planning or more generally for plant growth were derived with the understanding that sensible heat derived from atmospheric temperatures drives metabolic processes affecting the rate of growth and development. In simple terms a growing degree day is an index of the amount of heat accumulated in a day to drive the metabolic process related to growth or development. Research in the past half century has led to the establishment of mathematical equations that predict the rate of development at different temperatures for a large selection of crops and for crop varieties. These mathematical equations are used to predict the rate of insect disease or plant development as temperatures fluctuate over time and provide guidance on upcoming stages of growth and measures to respond to impacts of such growth.

Throughout the duration of a growing season the speculation of final crop development maturity and the rate of crop development is an important consideration for a grower. From the time of planting and continuing through until the end of a growing season the uncertainty of how a crop will mature along with when and with what yield are considerations of farmers when estimating final cash flows and determining the timing of inputs and actions to support crop development and farm business profitability. Traditional use of crop growth models such as accumulated growing degree models utilize accumulated weather conditions that have occurred from crop planting to the current date to provide a historical profile of development. Short term weather forecasts are also used but this provides only limited additional insight into crop development for near term crop management decisions and does not provide a longer range view of risks and expectations.

Therefore presently used and known methods in modeling crop growth and development do not provide an adequate estimation of how a crop will develop over a longer range such as through a remainder of the growing season. The application of climatological data for the crop s geographical region fails to provide anything more than a loose approximation as to development for the remainder of the growing season since climatological data does not reliably represent a given year s daily conditions.

It is one objective of the present invention a system and method of estimating crop growth and development over an entire growing season using long range climatological and or meteorological prediction and forecasting. It is another objective of the present invention to apply a paradigm of long range weather prediction that is responsive to global weather anomalies and tuned for anticipated regional weather trends during the entire growing season to provide a realistic estimation of a crop growth profile from planting date to full crop maturity.

It is another objective of the present invention to augment growing degree day modeling for crop growth development and profiling with long term weather forecast and prediction together with routine remotely sensed crop validation imagery. It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a system and method of crop development profiling which generates output data that serves as a valuable decision support tool for projecting future activities in crop management.

The present invention is a system and method of estimating crop growth and development over the course of an entire growing season. The present invention utilizes dynamical extended range weather forecasts spanning the entire duration of the remaining growing season to improve crop growth and development estimation. Using crop growth models based primarily upon growing degree days the present invention generates a profile of crop development until the end of a growing season. The present invention contemplates that in one embodiment these crop growth models may be executed on a periodic or frequent basis such as a weekly basis using an update to the dynamical extended range weather forecasts that consider the ongoing evolution of the region s seasonal weather conditions. Such a generation of a new crop growth and development profile each week may include the growth model output to date using the analyzed and or observed weather conditions along with the forecasted weather through the remainder of the growing season. Output from the crop growth and development profile generates a combination of data for use in auxiliary farm management applications. This output may be presented in many ways such as for example as a graphical display of the crop development attributes as it correlates to observed and predicted weather.

The present invention also utilizes remotely sensed measurements such as imagery of crop vitality as depicted from plant spectral analyses alongside the dynamical extended range weather forecasts. This may be accomplished using techniques such as for example normalized difference vegetation indices NDVI which are generated periodically for crop fields supported by growth modeling. Combining spectral analyses of crop vitality with the weather driven crop growth model results provide a visual reference to the spatial variability across the field of the crop growth model output. As such remotely sensed imagery permits extension of crop growth model results beyond the single point represented by the model s execution. This provides both a validation of the crop growth model and serves as a benchmark for evaluation of the forward looking estimation of crop growth and development using the weekly weather forecast updates of the crop growth model.

Other objects embodiments features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the embodiments taken together with the accompanying drawings which illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.

In the following description of the present invention reference is made to the exemplary embodiments illustrating the principles of the present invention and how it is practiced. Other embodiments will be utilized to practice the present invention and structural and functional changes will be made thereto without departing from the scope of the present invention.

The execution of the augmented crop growth model prior to planting at the beginning of a growing season addresses multiple factors in planning production activities for the year. It addresses a serious challenge for example of knowing whether there will be sufficient length to a growing season for a crop to reach its full maturity. Simulating a full growing season before planting provides a projection of the expected timeline of crop growth stages and anticipated date for crop maturity and harvest. This advanced planning increases the likelihood of success during the growing season.

Such advanced planning also has a number of other advantageous uses to the producer or grower. For example the anticipated date for crop maturity and harvest can be used to determine whether a crop will accumulate sufficient growing degree days for crop completion. Where this is not expected the producer may make changes to crop selection change to a shorter season variety of the original crop type or alter the date of crop planting to permit adequate time for crop maturity to occur. A timeline of crop growth provided prior to planting also gives insight on critical dates for potential pests and disease supporting planning decisions for herbicide and pesticide requirements during the upcoming growing season. This also provides support for anticipating when fertilizer applications are needed or addition of nutrients to finish the crop development.

The augmented crop growth model ingests input data that includes crop specifications such as for example the type and variety of crop and other planting data such as for example the date that a field was planted with seed. The input data also includes remotely sensed imagery data such as for example those captured from orbiting satellites that when processed provide details at a field level resolution. The input data further includes meteorological data which includes both dynamical extended range weather forecast information through to the completion of a growing season as well as observed weather data that has occurred during the current growing season and current field level weather data . All of this input data is ingested into the augmented crop growth model via a data ingest module as shown in the system diagram of .

The augmented crop growth model ingests these inputs to generate a crop development profile such as for example in a growing degree day model by describing the heat accumulated to support growth and development. This is used to generate instances of an accumulated growing degree day estimate in an estimation module for time periods throughout a growing season such as daily or weekly. The augmented crop growth model also ingests field level remotely sensed image data and performs a crop growth validation using such imagery in a validation module . The augmented crop growth model may also ingest as noted above meteorological information in the form of dynamical extended range weather forecast data which is used to perform additional instances of generating an accumulated growing degree day estimates in the estimation module to continue building the crop development profile . The augmented crop growth model then performs a projection of accumulated growing degree days to crop maturity in a projection module which contributes to a progression of the crop development profile to the end of the growing season.

The crop development profile is therefore output data of the augmented crop growth model . Once the augmented crop growth model has completed this projection phase the present invention determines whether a crop has reached maturity . This determines a form of one type of output data . Where a crop has reached maturity at step the model generates crop summary reports . If crop maturity has not been reached at step and therefore the growing season is still underway the model generates crop growth and action reports . Output data may further be used for generation of advisory services in one or more application programming interface API modules as described in more detail herein.

System components of the augmented crop growth model include one or more data processing modules within a computing environment that also includes one or more processors and a plurality of software and hardware components. The one or more processors and plurality of software and hardware components are configured to execute program instructions to perform the functions of the augmented crop growth model described herein and embodied in the one or more data processing modules .

The crop specifications and the planting data provide various aspects of the crop information that form a basis for the configuration of the phenological processes analyzed in the augmented crop growth model of the present invention. The crop specifications provide two general categories of information which are the type of crop to be planted and the variety or cultivar of that crop type. For example a crop type could be corn and the variety of corn could be standard sugary enhanced or super sweet. The type of crop determines a set of generally defined growth characteristics of the crop such as occurrence of various leave stages and produce development stages for the crop type. Specifying the variety fine tunes these growth characteristics to specify the timing to each stage nutrient requirements per stage pest disease susceptibility per stage and the temperature thresholds for grow no growth of the crop. These variety characteristics are established as a particular crop variety is genetically developed by researchers and are often associated with a particular seed product name. Crop specifications may further include crop practices such as whether the crop is organic genetically modified non genetically modified irrigated and non irrigated. Together the type of crop and its variety informs the generation of the crop development profile for the crop and establishes a basis for analyzing related factors such as pests and diseases. This information on pests and disease provides information on required weather conditions that lead to the emergence of pests and disease and includes information on eradication measures should they occur. The presence of factors such as these is important at particular times during specific growth stages and throughout the growth cycle and becomes a significant part of notification processes within one or more advisory services within the present invention.

Other crop specifications such as the precise location of crop field provide a basis for determining weather conditions during the growing season. These locations can be expressed either in positional coordinates such as latitude and longitude and may also be expressed in terms of platting data representing boundaries and location within a township area range or section. Regardless the present invention may incorporate appropriate algorithms to extract data such as the positional coordinates and platting data.

Planting information such as the planting date may be provided as either an anticipated date or an actual date. The anticipated planting date may be used for example where activity is being modeled in the augmented crop growth model prior to the growing season. Otherwise the actual date of planting is used. It should be noted in the case of modeling for pre growing season activity that the augmented crop growth model may be reset when the crop is planted and the actual planting date becomes known. Other planting information includes soil information such as the soil type current and or forecasted soil conditions overall soil profile levels of vegetative debris existing at the time of planting nutrient levels present at planting and the soil moisture history since the previous crop. Still other planting information may include plant depth plant population and row width. Planting information becomes a significant part of notification processes within one or more advisory services within the present invention

Meteorological data is collected for the specified geographical area which a crop is located using either temperature sensors in the crop field or from fine resolution analyses of weather derived from sensors across a region that includes the crop field or both since the presence of temperature sensors within crop fields for all possible instantiations of the augmented crop growth model may not be feasible . For the purpose of the phenological processes modeled in the present invention these temperature sensors may be configured to continuously monitor maximum and minimum temperatures over 24 hour periods. The spatial analysis of observed sensible air temperatures may employ a Barnes objective analytical scheme that permits exponential weighting functions to maximize the information of closer observations to the location of interest. This interpolation is a multi pass method given by the equation 

The value of controls the smoothing of data while is an expression of the minimum wavelength of disturbances resolved in the analysis. The weighting function w is specified at each m data points as an exponentially decreasing function of the distance r away from the grid point by the equation 

Using a climatological average temperature for a given location the accumulated growing degree day at that location can be used to express the thirty year average for the number of days elapsed since planting. Most crops exhibit a physiological growth limit when exposed to large amounts of heat. Thus Eq. 1 above is often modified to place limits on growing degree day accumulation during periods where temperatures exceed an upper threshold value. The same is true where either Tor Tfall below the base temperature threshold for plant growth. The present invention may use the diurnal maximum and minimum single values of sensible air temperature gathered either by direct field observations by spatial analysis of surrounding observed sensible air temperatures or through prediction of daily maximum and minimum sensible air temperature from numerical weather prediction models described below. Other methods of determining daily average sensible air temperatures may also be utilized such as summing all hourly values to derive a twenty four hour average.

Regardless of the method used multiple instances of the accumulated growing degree day estimation are contemplated by the present invention. Initial and ongoing instances involve the use of historical and current sensible air temperatures gathered and or analyzed since crop planting. This may be represented by the observed weather data that has occurred during the current growing season and the currently experienced field level weather data . The resulting accumulated growing degree day estimate represents the phenological activity of the crop designated during the initial and ongoing phases of the augmented crop growth model . An initial growing degree day calculation for the crop serves as the first marker on the crop development profile along the path to the crop maturity date. Each subsequent calendar day or other time interval as specified by a user of the present invention provides an additional marker on the crop development profile and serves as a reference point for assessing factors such as potential insect and disease hazards in the short term growth the crop.

The use of field level processed remotely sensed imagery provides additional support for an assessment of current crop state and growth stage in the crop growth validation phase of the augmented crop growth model . One source of image data representing this remotely sensed imagery is satellite systems such as fine temporal resolution low earth orbit satellites that provide a minimum of three spectral bands. Other sources are also contemplated such as for example unmanned aerial systems manned aerial reconnaissance lower temporal frequency earth resources satellite such as LANDSAT and MODIS ground based robots and sensors mounted on field and farm equipment. Regardless of the source this imagery is field navigated to provide users with the most recent high resolution depiction of the crop field. Imagery in the form of image data may be delivered on a web or application based tool configured within the augmented crop growth model and additional tools may be provided for spatially navigating the image data and overlaying a variety of weather data elements.

The field level remotely sensed imagery is used to map the crop field and generate a time series profile of crop development and vitality. Both direct provision of field level processed remotely sensed imagery and imagery that has been analyzed may be provided. Imagery is analyzed using a normalized difference vegetative index NDVI that provides the user with an evaluation of plant health biomass and nutrient content. Other approaches may also be employed for such analysis such as Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index OSAVI Triangular Chlorophyll Index OSAVI Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index Improved Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index MSAVI and Red Edge Model MSAVI. Regardless analysis of imagery provides a meaningful further input to the augmented crop growth model because plants absorb short wave radiation from the sun between wavelengths of 400 nm and 750 nm which is their photo synthetically active spectral region. Thus healthy plants appear darker at these wavelengths. The addition of leaves on healthy plants results in strong reflection in the near infrared spectrum. These features provide the basis for categorizing plant species as well as monitoring vitality of plants using the NDVI analysis. The NDVI relationship is given for the red and green spectral bands in this application as

where NIR Red and Greendenote magnitudes of reflected light in the near infrared red and green bands and NIR Red and Greendenote magnitudes of incident in the same three bands as the reflected.

Routine ingest of the remotely sensed imagery for the crop field provides the time series data needed to denote change in the crop and is correlated with the crop growth stage estimated by the amount of accumulated growing degree days. This enables a comparison that allows growers to calibrate the accumulated growing degree day estimates to ensure that appropriate decisions are made in relation to the crop growth actions suggested by the output data particularly in the crop summary report discussed further herein.

In one embodiment of the present invention the validation module may be configured to generate notifications to users of the augmented crop growth model when a validation identifies a change in a crop s growth. Such notifications ensure that appropriate decisions are made in relation to the crop growth actions and they may be provided to users at times and to devices at the direction of the user. For example when the validation phase of the augmented crop growth model generates a change in crop growth a tactile notification may be provided to the user s mobile device such as in a haptic vibration. Mobile devices may include any device capable of being used to view or manipulate data generated by the present invention whether it be a desktop laptop tablet or notebook computer or another mobile device such as data enabled telephone.

Further instances of the accumulated growing degree day estimation occur sequentially with and following prior initial instances to perform the projection of accumulated growing degree days to crop maturity. These latter instances apply a dynamical extended range weather forecast to provide daily maximum and minimum temperatures for the crop location for a period extending to the crop maturity date projected by the accumulated growing degree day estimation . In a manner similar to the daily accumulation of field level sensible air temperatures gridded dynamical extended range weather forecasts of sensible air temperature are used to determine the predicted values using the crop field s latitude and longitude. Daily projection of accumulated growing degree day estimation are made for each subsequent date beyond the current crop date and until the total accumulated growing degree day estimation exceeds the crop maturity value specified for the crop at issue. Each day serves as a marker on the crop development profile in a manner similar to the accumulated growing degree days using observed analyzed sensible air temperatures from the first instance of the crop growth model run. Thus the combined instances of the accumulated growing degree day estimations provide an entire season of daily growing degree days for use in crop growth interpretation.

As noted above the use of phenological crop growth models such as growing degree day models to provide future expectations on growth have previously been limited by the scope of predicted weather information included for estimating future growing degree days. Use of climatological normal values assumes that the current year will be equivalent to the average of the previous climate period that spanned thirty years. Unfortunately the likelihood of matching this thirty year average condition particularly summed over an entire growing season is very low and unrealistic. The present invention modifies this climatological average to account for annual and seasonal variations to enable a more realistic profile for projection of sensible air temperatures and also precipitation for an entire growing season.

The augmented crop growth model applies known methods for inter seasonal to inter annual climate prediction which have evolved into a combination of deterministic and statistical modeling schemes that permit the capture of long term low frequency features. Such modeling schemes are known as dynamical extend range weather forecast models. Dynamical extended range weather forecasting is one of the most complex and challenging forecasting problems as it requires global analyses for the specification of observed initial and boundary conditions the use of sophisticated numerical weather prediction models a statistical treatment of the model results and a verification of the forecast results as a feedback into forecast refinement.

The use of dynamical extend range weather forecasting in the augmented crop growth model of the present invention involves accounting for the future low frequency variability within the atmosphere to modify the climatological expectations during the span of the growing season. In one embodiment of the present invention the modeling process involves the use of two data assimilation systems and two forecasting systems. The two data assimilation systems are used to provide historic and current atmospheric and land surface initial conditions and also global ocean temperatures. The two forecast systems incorporate the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Predictions NCEP Global Forecast System GFS for atmospheric predictions and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Modular Ocean Model to provide sea surface temperature predictions. To provide computational efficiencies the GFS is run at a horizontal grid resolution of approximately 100 kilometers using a spectral triangular truncation of 126 waves. To maintain consistency between the data assimilation and atmospheric forecasting systems the same horizontal grid resolution is used for each. Software and data supporting the above are publicly available from the NCEP.

In the present invention the dynamical extend range weather forecast models are executed daily to provide a complete global dataset for use in initializing the subsequent model run and to be used to supply localized values for the growing degree day projections for individual crop locations. Given the 100 kilometer grid spacing of the dynamical extend range forecast DERF models the data is downscaled to map predicted values to each crop field location. This downscaling is accomplished with a linear regression using the predicted values along with both observed conditions and error corrected previous forecasts for the desired location.

It should be noted that in the present invention additional sources of meteorological data may be utilized to provide one or more of the observed weather data that has occurred during the current growing season the current field level weather data and the dynamical extended range weather forecasts for example as data that is complementary to the two data assimilation systems and two forecasting systems noted above. Such additional sources of weather data may include data from both in situ and remotely sensed observation platforms. For example numerical weather models NWP and or surface networks may be combined with data from weather radars and satellites to reconstruct the current weather conditions on any particular area to be analyzed. There are numerous industry NWP models available and any such models may be used as sources of meteorological data in the present invention. Examples of NWP models at least include RUC Rapid Update Cycle WRF Weather Research and Forecasting Model GFS Global Forecast System as noted above and GEM Global Environmental Model . Meteorological data is received in real time and may come from several different NWP sources such as from Meteorological Services of Canada s MSC Canadian Meteorological Centre CMC as well as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration s NOAA Environmental Modeling Center EMC and many others. Additionally internally or privately generated mesoscale NWP models developed from data collected from real time feeds to global observation resources may also be utilized. Such mesoscale numerical weather prediction models may be specialized in forecasting weather with more local detail than the models operated at government centers and therefore contain smaller scale data collections than other NWP models used. These mesoscale models are very useful in characterizing how weather conditions may vary over small distances and over small increments of time. The present invention may be configured to ingest data from all types of NWP models regardless of whether publicly privately or internally provided or developed.

Other sources of data ingested into the augmented crop growth model may include image based data from systems such as video cameras and data generated from one or more vehicle based sensing systems including those systems coupled to computing systems configured on farm equipment or those systems configured to gather weather data from mobile devices present within vehicles such as the mobile telephony devices and tablet computers as noted above. Crowd sourced observational data may also be provided from farmers using mobile telephony devices or tablet computers using software tools such as mobile applications and from other sources such as social media feeds. Meteorologist input may be still a further source of data.

The integration of crop growth status with projected sensible air temperatures for the remainder of the growing season provide the grower or crop consultant a valuable decision support tool for projecting future activities in crop management. Before the commencement of the growing season such estimations for the growing season identify variations in the thirty year average climate for the upcoming growing season that can lead to refined determination of crop selection seed variety and planting decisions. After planting this information provides guidance on fertilizer management irrigation and application of herbicide and pesticide during the growing season.

Periodic crop growth action reports provided at user defined intervals such as daily weekly or bi weekly present the user with three primary categories of information. First it provides an updated development profile of accumulated growing degree days since planting and identifies the transition of plant stages that have occurred and that are presently occurring. Next it provides a validation of the plant growth stages using remotely sensed imagery that includes a full NDVI analysis of the crop field. Combined these two parts provide a short term roadmap on actions needed in crop management. The third part provides a detailed daily accounting of future accumulated growing degree day up to crop maturity. This latter includes future physiological stages and their timing. It also provides a summary of remaining threats to the crop including pests potential diseases and threats of drought and excessive moisture. The time to maturity includes a specification of a calendar date when crop maturity is expected and for harvest timing.

At the end of the crop growing season and with the last of the routinely generated crop growth action reports a crop summary report is generated. This summary report provides an accumulation of crop growth prediction statistics along with a validation summary. This summary report provides growers with a snapshot of the growing season indicating how the growing season progress compared to the long term average expectations for a growing season of the specific crop planted at that location.

The present invention also contemplates that output data may be generated for visual representation of the information contained for example on a graphical user interface. For example users may be able to configure settings for and view various aspects of the augmented crop growth model using a display on such a graphical user interfaces and or via web based or application based modules. Tools and pull down menus on such a display or in web based or application based modules may also be provided to customize the estimation validation and projection phases of the model as well as the output data . Examples of this include the tactile notifications of changes in crop growth discussed above. Other types of notifications may include those provided via applications resident on mobile telephony tablet or wearable devices are also possible such as for example a voice based output generated to verbally notify farmers of possible disease or pest risk.

As noted above the output data of the augmented crop growth model may be used to generate a plurality of advisory services in one or more application programming interface API modules . These advisory services provide enhanced decision making support to precision agricultural production within the present invention.

These advisory services are driven by the generation of the crop development profile that results in the crop growth and action reporting and crop summary reporting aspects of the output data . Each of these advisory services enriches the utilization and application of the augmented crop growth model .

One such advisory service is a current and historical weather reporting service . Site specific weather information is an important element of field recordkeeping in agricultural production. Using the field position information provided for the accumulated growing degree day calculations current and historical weather for the field location may be provided as an advisory service for specific geographical locations. Accordingly this information has a dual utility in the present invention as it is also utilized as a routine input data observed weather data and current field level weather data to the accumulated growing degree day estimation to provide the needed maximum and minimum temperatures for computing actual growing degree days. The present invention therefore contemplates using this information as both as input to the augmented crop growth model and together with geo positional information as a form of output data as an advisory service .

Another advisory service is an hourly and daily climatology reporting service . Although the output data is generally related to dynamical computation of growing degree days for a specific field and crop type users of the present invention are capable of contrasting the dynamical growing degree days with expected growing degree days relative to the thirty year climatology. This enables one to contrast the difference experienced in a given year relative to the long term average derived from climatology data provided on an hourly or daily basis. Accordingly hour by hour and daily climatological averages for specified location s and time period s can be provided as a reporting service . In addition this reporting service provides a probability distribution of various weather related metrics including the number of remaining growing degrees based upon climatology.

Another advisory service is an hourly and daily weather forecasting service . The use of routine weather forecast information is a staple of agricultural production support operations and planning and this advisory service provides such weather forecast information to augment the routine generation and reporting of accumulated growing degree days. Accordingly the present invention can be configured to generate a weather forecast in conjunction with the accumulated growing degrees day estimation in the output data . The weather forecast service is available in multiple data formats ranging from text site specific graphics or as a map based display on a graphical user interface.

A soil modeling service is another advisory service contemplated within the scope of the present invention. One API module applies the crop development profile and output data to a sophisticated soil model to generate information that provides a better understanding of current and future soil conditions relative to historical soil conditions. Such a soil model support the use of existing soil properties e.g. organic matter soil type etc. tillage practices presence of tile drainage and irrigation history along with the advanced long range weather forecasting. This coupling of modeled soil characteristics with advanced weather forecasting information from the dynamical extended range forecast for an entire growing season provides a valuable tool for indicating crop potential. The output of an API module generating this soil modeling service may be further configured to provide a detailed past through future analysis of soil temperature and moisture assessments including freeze and thaw information the amount of water throughput runoff or ponding of soils and an important interpretation of workability of the soils. Soil models contemplated for use in the present invention may include models such as the EPIC APEX and ICBM soil models.

A planting prediction reporting service may also be provided as an advisory service . When utilized prior to the growing season using the season long dynamic extended range weather forecasting capabilities the augmented crop growth model of the present invention can be configured to simulate an entire growing season before it occurs. Applying this to assess the timeline of accumulated growing degree days throughout the growing season when planted at differing times is an inherent benefit to optimizing successful completion of a selected crop and or making an informed decision as to what type of crop or its cultivar to select. When coupled with an entire growing season s growing degreed days estimation and the weather output from the dynamical extended range weather forecast a planting prediction reporting service provides multi faceted information regarding planting operations such as near term field conditions soil moisture and temperature and expected seasonal growth metrics. This planting prediction reporting service provides likely periods of suitability of weather and soil conditions including soil workability soil temperatures potential adverse post planting weather conditions and the likelihood that the crop will reach maturity. The planting prediction reporting service may also utilize the output data in the hourly and daily climatology reporting service to provide a further comparison of the dynamical extended range weather forecast driven growing degree days planting predictions to one based upon climatology.

Another advisory service is soil conditions forecasting service . The soil modeling service can be used with predicted weather to provide an estimate of future soil conditions in this advisory service . Using the dynamical extended range forecast data a forecast of soil temperature and moisture conditions for the specified field location can generated. Such a forecast in this service enables anticipation of periods of suitable soil conditions for field operations including workability particularly those after periods of rainfall.

Yet another advisory service as an output of the augmented crop growth model is a fertilizer forecasting service . Knowledge of expected growing degree days provides a timeline for the various stages of crop growth and each of these stages has differing nutrient needs. The fertilizer forecasting service uses timing of these stages predicted by the accumulated growing degree day timeline along with the soil modeling data from the soil modeling service to identify periods of suitability of soil conditions for continued satisfactory crop growth and anticipates the impact of soil saturation on the loss of available nutrients via leaching denitrification and other soil and water related crop growth factors. The fertilizer forecasting service may also provide a recommendation of how much fertilizer should be applied and an estimate of how much of the fertilizer applied at the crop s location may be leached away by excessive moisture and soil saturation. The fertilizer forecasting service may also be used retrospectively to evaluate fertilizer effectiveness loss due to soil and rain conditions that have recently occurred.

Another advisory service as an output of the augmented crop growth model is a pest prediction service . The presence of pests has differing impacts depending upon the stage of a crop. Similarly the variability of the weather can give rise to potential crop disease conditions that also have differing impacts depending upon crop stage. The timeline identification of the various crop stages in the accumulated growing degree day estimation is a valuable tool for deciding the best course for integrated pest management activities. This information when incorporated in the pest prediction service provides assessments of the conduciveness of weather conditions to various disease and pest pressures at the current time through the end of the growing season. The pest prediction information from this advisory service helps in assessing the relative risk vs. reward i.e. cost vs. benefit of potential pesticide applications to prevent crop damage due to factors such as disease or insects.

Another advisory service as an output of the augmented crop growth model is a harvest helper reporting service . The routinely updated accumulated growing degree day estimation of the present invention provides an important metric for determining when a crop will reach maturity. However it should be noted that the harvest of a crop involves factors such as appropriate weather conditions at the time of maturity to permit a successful harvest. The harvest helper reporting service estimates the timing of harvest operations and weighing the relative costs of fuel based forced air drying vs. the risks associated with loss of standing crop to adverse weather conditions. The harvest helper reporting service also provides information on possible loss of field workability due to the formation of frost in the soils prior to post harvest tillage. This reporting service may be further used to develop tools that include estimating standing crop dry down rates anticipated harvest dates and suitability fuel consumption optimizers for forced air drying and indicators of plant toughness for anticipating harvest windows.

Another advisory service as an output of the augmented crop growth model is a ClearPathAlerts service . The importance of information provided to production agriculture in the present invention dictates a necessity for an effective and direct method of conveying information. The ClearPathAlerts service may utilize a push technology for immediate and direct dissemination of information provided as output data from the augmented crop growth model . The API module that generates this service may be configured to so that users may receive alerts of important combinations of weather conditions risk factors and decision support aides for the purposes of managing and timing field operations. This is supported by user specified elements including alert parameters location s lead time s time s of day and the particular device s to receive the alerts.

The systems and methods of the present invention may be implemented in many different computing environments . For example they may be implemented in conjunction with a special purpose computer a programmed microprocessor or microcontroller and peripheral integrated circuit element s an ASIC or other integrated circuit a digital signal processor electronic or logic circuitry such as discrete element circuit a programmable logic device or gate array such as a PLD PLA FPGA PAL and any comparable means. In general any means of implementing the methodology illustrated herein can be used to implement the various aspects of the present invention.
