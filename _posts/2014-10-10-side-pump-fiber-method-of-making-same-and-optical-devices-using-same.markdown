This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 365 841 filed on Feb. 3 2012 which claims the benefit under 35 USC 119 e of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61 439 124 filed Feb. 3 2011 entitled SIDE PUMP FIBER METHOD OF MAKING SAME AND OPTICAL DEVICES USING SAME the contents of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present inventive concepts relate to the field of fiber optics and more particularly to the field of cladding pumped fibers.

A typical cladding pumped fiber device comprises a single mode core and a plurality of cladding layers. The inner cladding surrounding the core is typically a silica cladding of large cross sectional area as compared to the core and high numerical aperture NA . It is usually non circular e.g. rectangular or star shaped to ensure that the modes of the inner cladding will have good overlap with the core. The outer cladding is commonly composed of a low refractive index polymer. The index of the core is greater than that of the inner cladding which in turn is greater than the outer cladding.

A major advantage of the cladding pumped fiber is that it can convert light from low brightness sources into light of high brightness in a single mode fiber. Light from low brightness sources such as diode arrays can be coupled into the inner cladding due to its large cross sectional area and high NA. In a cladding pumped laser or amplifier the core is doped with a rare earth such as Er. The light in the cladding interacts with the core and is absorbed by the rare earth dopant. If an optical signal is passed through the pumped core it will be amplified. Or if optical feedback is provided as by providing a Bragg grating optical cavity the cladding pumped fiber will act as a laser oscillator at the feedback wavelength.

U.S. Pat. No. 5 864 644 to DiGiovanni et al. teaches that light is coupled from a plurality of semiconductor emitters to a cladding pumped fiber via a tapered fiber bundles fusion spliced to the cladding pumped fiber. Individual semiconductor broad stripe emitters can be coupled to individual multimode fibers. The individual fibers can be bundled together in a close packed formation heated to melting temperature drawn into a taper and then fusion spliced to the cladding pumped fiber. The taper is then over coated with cladding material such as low index polymer. In addition a fiber containing a single mode core can be included in the fiber bundle. This single mode core can be used to couple light into or out of the single mode core of the cladding pumped fiber.

In the polished ends of the nine fibers A are spliced to a fused silica capillary tube D. The capillary tube is hollow and has an inner diameter of 405 m and an outer diameter of 900 m. In the capillary tube is tapered with hydrofluoric acid until the inner and outer diameters are about the same. Prior to this step a plug can be inserted in the center of the hollow capillary tube D such that the taper goes from the outer diameter to the inner diameter at the plug E. The capillary tube D can then be used as a combiner.

In the plug E is removed and a 400 m signal fiber F is inserted through the hollow center of the capillary tube D and through the nine outer fibers A. As a result the nine outer fibers A surround the center signal fiber F. Pump laser light from the outer fibers A is side pumped into the signal fiber F within the capillary tube or combiner D. Optically this can work well. However for each pump fiber A two 2 junctions exist at the combiner D the pump fiber A to the combiner D and the combiner D to the signal fiber F. Each junction experiences some optical loss and generates heat. Since light from nine different source fibers A is pumped into the signal fiber F at the combiner D there are many junctions at the combiner D all generating heat. This can cause a hotspot at the combiner D. Also this approach in not particularly scalable since only a fixed number of pump fibers A can be used with such combiners D.

Hereinafter aspects of the present invention will be described by explaining illustrative embodiments in accordance therewith with reference to the attached drawings. While describing these embodiments detailed descriptions of well known items functions or configurations are typically omitted for conciseness.

It will be understood that although the terms first second etc. are be used herein to describe various elements these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are used to distinguish one element from another but not to imply a required sequence of elements. For example a first element can be termed a second element and similarly a second element can be termed a first element without departing from the scope of the present invention. As used herein the term and or includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.

It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being on or connected or coupled to another element it can be directly on or connected or coupled to the other element or intervening elements can be present. In contrast when an element is referred to as being directly on or directly connected or directly coupled to another element there are no intervening elements present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion e.g. between versus directly between adjacent versus directly adjacent etc. .

The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein the singular forms a an and the are intended to include the plural forms as well unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms comprises comprising includes and or including when used herein specify the presence of stated features steps operations elements and or components but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features steps operations elements components and or groups thereof.

Spatially relative terms such as beneath below lower above upper and the like may be used to describe an element and or feature s relationship to another element s and or feature s as for example illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use and or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example if the device in the figures is turned over elements described as below and or beneath other elements or features would then be oriented above the other elements or features. The device may be otherwise oriented e.g. rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.

A side pump fiber a method of making a side pump fiber and optical devices using same are provided. A plurality of pump fibers can be joined to a side of a signal fiber at various locations along the signal fiber. The method includes creating or making a lengthwise tapered concave pocket cut in a pump or side pump fiber inserting the signal fiber into the pocket cut and then coupling the side pump fiber to the signal fiber at the pocket cut. The coupling can occur by fusing the pump fiber to the signal fiber.

A fiber laser is a laser in which the active gain medium is an optical fiber doped with rare earth elements such as erbium ytterbium neodymium dysprosium praseodymium and thulium. They are related to doped fiber amplifiers which provide light amplification without lasing. A doped fiber amplifier includes a center signal fiber that is doped as described above where light from the side pump fibers excites photons within the center fiber to increase their energy level.

A prior art combiner is not needed with the present invention since a plurality of side pump fibers having the subject pocket cut can be directly fusion spliced to the cladding of the center signal fiber. Prior art combiners have a predetermined input fiber to output fiber ratio e.g. 9 1 in . However no such limitation exists in accordance with the present invention. As many or as few pocket cut side pump fibers as desired can be coupled to a center signal fiber.

Also using the present invention a junction problems such as heat and loss described with respect to the coupler of the prior art are eliminated or at least substantially eliminated. This is an important advancement over the prior art. Since each junction between fibers presents an opportunity for loss and resulting heat generation elimination of junctions provides significant and tangible benefits. For instance using the present invention there is only 1 junction between a side pump fiber and a signal fiber which is where they are fusion spliced. But using a prior art combiner there are two junctions for each pump fiber one between the pump fiber and the combiner and one between the combiner and the signal fiber. As a result the prior art combiner creates a hotspot at the combiner because not only does it have 2 junctions per pump fiber all of the junctions happen in the same place at the combiner with each junction resulting in heat generation.

In contrast the present invention couples pump fibers to the signal fiber at different places and with fewer junctions. Since the couplings are spaced out as opposed to being located all together using a combiner whatever heat that is generated between a pump fiber and signal fiber in the present invention is widely distributed over a length of the center fiber. Thus hotspots can be avoided in accordance with the present invention.

Each of the plurality of pump fibers can be fused to an innermost cladding of the center fiber e.g. in the case of double clad fibers. The center signal fiber here is a single mode fiber and its diameter is not reduced at or near the point of coupling with the side pump fiber in accordance with aspects of the present invention. This in an improvement for example over the approach in U.S. Pat. No. 5 864 644 which does reduce the diameter of the signal fiber. Single mode fiber can be doped as described above e.g. with a rare earth dopant such as Er.

The pocket cut is a concave cut that can be slightly off axis e.g. less than about 10 . In this embodiment the pocket diameter has an inner diameter of 200 m and an outer diameter of 220 m. In this embodiment center signal fiber has an outer diameter 130 m. A length of the pocket cut can be about several millimeters. In this embodiment the length of pocket is about 4.66 mm. The fibers and can be heated at pocket to splice the two together using know splicing systems and methods.

Pocket can be formed in different ways. In a first embodiment pocket cut can be formed by cutting the pump fiber using a COlaser. Here the pump fiber must be stably positioned a desired angle between the laser beam and the fiber must be established and then the laser can contact the fiber to precisely make the cut at the desired angle and dimension e.g. diameter . For these purposes the fiber can be secured in a fiber holder with fiber holding clamps.

Alternatively the pocket cut can be formed using a diamond wire saw that is applied in a sawing motion to the pump fiber at a predetermined angle. The diamond wire saw can include a steel wire coated with diamond dust. A diameter of the diamond saw can be about 80 mm as an example for making pocket cut in fiber discussed as an example above. In this embodiment the fiber can also be secured in a fiber holder having fiber holding clamps.

While the foregoing has described what are considered to be the best mode and or other preferred embodiments it is understood that various modifications can be made therein and that the invention or inventions may be implemented in various forms and embodiments and that they may be applied in numerous applications only some of which have been described herein. It is intended by the following claims to claim that which is literally described and all equivalents thereto including all modifications and variations that fall within the scope of each claim.
