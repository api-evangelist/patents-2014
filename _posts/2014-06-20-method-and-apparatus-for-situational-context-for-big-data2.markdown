For a contextual geohash code level 0 of the contextual geohash code identifies the hemisphere in which the square quadrangle is located with an ASCII character such as 0 for the western hemisphere and 1 for the eastern hemisphere. Starting with level 1 of a contextual geohash code the prior region for example the hemisphere of level 0 is subdivided into four square quadrangles following a Z ordered pattern of the same four ASCII characters such as A B C and D in which the first ASCII character A in this example is the northwest component the second ASCII character B in this example is the northeast component the third ASCII character C in this example is the southwest component and the fourth ASCII character D in this example is the southeast component. Following this scheme any contextual square quadrangle can be subdivided into four square quadrangles to define a new level. There are four exception cases used with contextual geohash codes to describe the poles to describe the whole Earth and to describe an unspecified location a a single ASCII character such as indicates the North Pole b a single ASCII character such as indicates the South Pole 3 a single ASCII character such as indicates the whole Earth including both poles and 4 a single ASCII character such as indicates an unspecified location which is used in conjunction with other types of hash codes such as temporal hash codes.

However non contiguous or disjointed sets of quadrangles can also be used to describe places such as Alaska and Hawaii included with the set of contiguous state boundaries.

For purposes of the present invention the term continuous time refers to an unbroken span of time comprised of time instants. In the time domain the value of a signal or function is known for all real numbers. Within a time granule a time instant is described as a singular point in time with an associated precision.

Situational context is a mechanism for characterizing information from data. Using the situational context associated with information in one embodiment the present invention can dynamically build relationships between disparate sources of information describing common topics to compile knowledge on these topics.

In one embodiment the present invention employs a number of techniques to discover multidimensional relationships between disparate sources of data and or information. One of these techniques is called hashing. In one embodiment the present invention includes hashing techniques for geohashing linking sources based on location temporal hashing linking sources based on temporal alignment elevation hashing linking sources based on the height above a reference surface such as mean sea level motion hashing linking sources along a path of motion in 4D space based on location elevation and time and celestial hashing linking sources with a common view of the same location on the celestial sphere at the same time as entities move into and out of that view among others. Many of these techniques build upon other techniques such as celestial hashing which can be used to describe the weather and environmental state solar radiation lunar radiation that moves over a specific location and timeframe.

In one embodiment the present invention provides a method for describing situational context i.e. what where and when information for Big Data using multidimensional hashing techniques to dynamically build content level relationships between disparate sources. In this sense situational context is a mechanism used to transform data into information and then conflate that information into knowledge. The pedigree of these processes frequently includes model based inferences drawn from different perspectives including socio cultural sensors or scale hence knowledge inherits the situational context of the perspectives information and data used to compile and dynamically sustain that knowledge. Challenges for Big Data include capture storage search transform analysis and visualization of this data.

One significant type of Big Data is social media which refers to a group of Web 2.0 mobile apps and web based Internet applications that enable the creation and exchange of global multi lingual user generated content. Social media technologies include a variety of forms including magazines Internet forums blogs microblogs wilds and social networks among others. Social media is created in all languages dialects and many different orthographies as a streaming source of Big Data.

As data volumes grow massive measured in zettabytes or more the capability for systems to dynamically discover characterize and sustain knowledge drawn from data is becoming an imperative for global commerce businesses and especially the US Government. Situational context describes the information state about something real described in data perspectives in information and inferred relationships in knowledge. Examples of data include an event like the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing a blog story a map satellite image or a published report from an authoritative source. A related example of information perspectives is the social media opinion of an event like the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing which can include sentiments ranging from outrage to support for limiting personal liberties. Finally a small example of knowledge related to this same event could include logistical plans for the Marathon live data feeds describing reactions to the event and predictions of likely outcomes related to an evolving event.

Every source of data contains some type of content and some type of meta information that describes the source of that content. While situational context is much more than traditional metadata it does encompass any available metadata for a source. Essentially situational context is used to describe the spatial temporal and thematic contexts of data as information to facilitate the conflation of related content drawn from multiple perspectives into knowledge. Knowledge that is managed and sustained to maintain currency provides the best means to affect decision making or provide actionable situational intelligence. Since GEOINT describes data information and knowledge that includes geospatial spatial and temporal dimensions a supposition can be made that all data is GEOINT thus Big Data is synonymous with GEOINT described for multiple domains and from multiple perspectives including both historic and predictive ones supporting a diverse set of communities of interest COI globally.

Microdata is a new Web 3.0 Semantic Web compatible GEOINT content specification implemented in XML that supports the management of all types of data with associated situational context information. Microdata is capable of managing and characterizing everything found in all types of data using Unicode encodings all content and meta content indexing everything for standards based discovery and versioning everything from a bi temporal valid time and transaction time perspective. An example of a new type of GEOINT content is streaming multi lingual social media data.

Emerging Microdata stores such as MarkLogic can store descriptive or contextual information about GEOINT content n dimensionally using various XML based languages such as Resource Description Framework RDF . Traditional relational data models such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets or Oracle database tables store data following a structured data model of cells or fields defined by columns and rows within a table. The resulting structured data can be efficiently managed by modern relational database management systems RDBMS . However data that does not fit within a defined relational structure cannot be efficiently stored by these types of systems and is generally lost.

Unstructured information refers to that data that does fit well into a relational table including text heavy content but may include dates numbers or facts as well. XML and its various languages such as RDF provide a robust means n dimensional graph based solution for describing and then managing unstructured content such as situational context information. A significant discriminator between Microdata and more tradition relational data stores is that Microdata is specifically designed to store everything about everything in context. Thus by using Microdata to manage GEOINT content any aspect of that content can be associated with any number of esoteric or unique facts perspectives or versions.

As a Web 3.0 Semantic Web capability Microdata is specifically designed to accommodate the massive content volumes associated with Big Data contextually aligned in space time and thematic content. Within Microdata everything is indexed and versioned using Unicode encodings supporting all languages. Unlike traditional RDF which employs N Triple structures to describe RDF graphs Microdata employs N Quads which associates context with each N Triple. From an Industry perspective this type of context is used to name an RDF graph.

The context value within each N Quad is a Uniform Resource Identifier URI that describes a context resource within an Open Geospatial Consortium OGC Catalog Service for the Web CSW ebRIM profile CSW ebRIM discovery framework. Within this standards based framework global conflation business logic is included to dynamically build relationships between disparate GEOINT sources at the content level sub feature sub pixel attribute . In one embodiment the present invention may be used to describe these situational contexts.

Once situational context has been described very large and complex RDF graphs can be defined as N Quads managed within a Hadoop File System HDFS which supports Big Data analytic operations in MapReduce. This very large distributed management structure supported by a robust context aware content discovery framework CSW ebRIM provides the means for the dynamic selection of context specific sub graphs to be extracted from HDFS and visualized or further analyzed efficiently. Thus situational context described within Microdata represents an extensible standards based domain specific description that can include multiple perspectives and versions as well conflation relationships between disparate sources.

CSW ebRIM is an OGC standard for exposing a catalog of geospatial records on the Internet via HTTP. CSW is analogous to a card catalog in a library and defines common interfaces to discover browse and query metadata about data services and other resources. CSW is comprised of multiple profiles including ebRIM which is extensible and contains both a Registry and a Repository. The Registry objects point to the associated Repository items. Each repository item e.g. an HTML document has a Uniform Resource Name URN which is a URI that uses the URN scheme. The URN allows the repository item to be readily retrieved from the Registry using a simple GET request e.g. issued from a web mapping client such as a browser .

The ebRIM provides a standards based extensible content discovery framework that can be tailored to the specific needs of a COI while retaining more generic cataloging attributes to facilities domain specific content discoveries from a broader audience. In one embodiment of the present invention new situational context extensions based on the contextual geohashing method of the present invention can be defined with ebRIM from multiple perspectives and tailored to serve specific COIs. These contexts would be referenced from a URI that could support a RESTful interface to override aspects of the defined situational context. This means that any given situational context associated with content can be independently discovered and repeatedly referenced by multiple resources via a standards based web service.

In one embodiment of the present invention additional discovery frameworks are included within the contextual geohashing method of the present invention including an absolute dimensional referencing system that cross references entities described via a UUID and contextual codes. Conflation is a mechanism that relates or links descriptions of the same thing entity found in distinct and separate sources. For instance a lighthouse can be represented differently in three distinct data sources as an icon on a map a detailed floor plan of the lighthouse and a report describing the history of that lighthouse. Because all three sources are describing the same real entity conflation can be used to build relationships between each of these data sources at the content level to build a more comprehensive knowledge based description of the lighthouse entity itself. Dynamic conflation is a Big Data analytics method that leverages situational context to automatically build through inferences conflated relationships with corresponding confidence values contexts for each of these relationships. These automatically built relationships can be validated and or enhanced by humans to create additional contextual versions for these relationships. All of the data that is linked is captured and described as evidence to support the rationale for establishing each link or relationship.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention enables the dynamic conflation of disparate sources at the content level sub feature sub pixel attribute by building relationships between data with situational context information using various Big Data analytic methods. One of these methods utilizes multidimensional hashing techniques that quantize a dimension of situational context information. A hashing technique is a method that uses a hash function to map a specific type of data of variable length into a set of fixed length data. From a relationship building methodology hashing provides a dynamic means for linking building relationships disparate data content. Some of the hashing techniques supported by one embodiment of the contextual geohashing method of the present invention include geohashing temporal hashing elevation hashing motion hashing and celestial hashing.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention provides an extensible framework for describing and characterizing situational contexts that can be encoded and decoded into Microdata. In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention may define situational context using a number of location based time based and thematic based schemes. Each scheme quantizes the data dimensions of that scheme at a specified precision or resolution. For instance in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention may provide a conflation surface for all high resolution orthorectified commercial imagery globally at a specified precision e.g. 0.3 m 5 mm 1 ym sequenced in time by vendor and sensor. This means that every sub pixel in every commercial image is quantized and related to every other corresponding sub pixel in all overlapping images.

Just to describe the pixels in this surface at 0.3 meter precisions requires 9 007 199 254 740 990 nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety nine billion two hundred fifty four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety geospatial hashing codes. In one embodiment of the present invention this seemingly impossibly large number can be addressed via the contextual geohashing method of the present invention by scalable compression techniques executing within a Big Data distributed computing environment using the Hadoop File System HDFS distributed across a large number of systems. Thus in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention can dynamically conflate high resolution global imagery at the sub pixel level regardless of the type full motion video hyper spectral or volume of imagery as well as any other type of data.

Situational context can be defined in multiple dimensions including both geospatial and temporal dimensions among many others. Hashing is a technique designed to take complex data and relate it to similar data with the same dimensionality. Geohashing is a hierarchical latitude longitude geocoding system that is used to index or address geospatial locations anywhere on the Earth. There are several geohashing solutions available most of which merely describe a single point or a single quadrangle.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention provides an infinitely scalable areal notation scheme that scales in multiple dimensions including temporal ones. This includes geohashing for any type of GEOINT content including imagery pixels points polylines polygons and complex areas. Hence in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention can describe any feature on the Earth at millimeter precision or finer as necessary.

Temporal hashing is a method that quantizes date and time values into defined spans of time or intervals. This method replaces the continuous concept of an instant into a potentially infinitesimal interval. Sophisticated temporal hashing solutions such as the contextual geohashing method of the present invention can employ temporal interval comparisons to determine if multiple temporal representations can hash from multiple perspectives. Table 1 of shows temporal interval comparisons for examples of the temporal conflation rules included within one embodiment of the contextual geohashing method of the present invention.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention may use perspectives of dimensional situational context to describe fuzzy content or content that includes ambiguities such as geospatial or temporal. An example of a fuzzy feature might be the area controlled by a gang. Rival gang members local police and tourists may all have different perceptions of what and where this boundary is as it evolves through time. An example of fuzzy temporal data is the effect highway congestion can have on commuting times.

Using multiple dimensional hashing techniques in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention provides the basis for implementing a global conflation model that utilizes the situational context of the data to conflate at the content level sub feature sub pixel attribute . Given the potential volume of computation required for this type of activity in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention employs hashing methods to support the Hadoop File Systems HDFS and MapReduce operations for Big Data analytics.

The terms data information and knowledge represent three overlapping abstract concepts. Data are qualitative and or quantitative values that typically result from some type of measurement. Data without any context is difficult to interpret. Information results from the association of context applying meaning with data generally from a defined set of perspectives. Knowledge is the collective assembly of related information drawn from across multiple perspectives. In this sense information describes what data is and where and when it is relevant. Knowledge can then be thought of why and how the information is useful.

A situational context describes a framework for interpreting data applying meaning as information from a defined perspective and then relating disparate information into codified knowledge. Data is transformed into information through the association of multidimensional contexts such as where the data is located when it is relevant and what it represents. The normalization of these contexts is one aspect of the framework that can be used to define situational context. Another aspect of this framework is the relating or conflation of disparate information using context.

A situational context is comprised of a number of multidimensional contexts. Many of these contexts are described as continuous phenomena. In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention provides a structured means to discretize various types of context utilizing a quantizing method that always associates a degree of precision with any contextual value. In this sense in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention describes the geospatial context of an entity using a raster based analogy rather than a vector one where raster based depictions are comprised of regions of discrete pixels that fill a continuous space and the vector based depictions are comprised of infinite geometries such as points lines and polygons.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention employs various hashing schemes as the quantizing method for each dimensional context. Hashing is a deterministic method of mapping a complex representation into a simpler one. The hashing function is defined by an algorithm. By its very nature most hashing functions are lossy i.e. some details are sacrificed or lost in exchange for new functionality whereas a lossless process loses no details.

There are a number of different types of dimensions that can be used to characterize data into information just as there are many different perspectives that can be identified to interpret data as information. Two of the fundamental and broadly defined dimensions of data are space and time. These dimensions can be further describes as location timeframe elevation and movement which describes real entities that occupy space and move through time. Additional contexts can distinguish between relative and absolute frames of reference environmental conditions gravity radiation weather and composition for instance. Each of these contexts is also described historically presently and predictively through time.

Contextual geohashing schemes according to one embodiment of the present invention are described as codes and are broadly defined within two format classes text and binary. Text formats are named IDs and are designed to be human readable but are less efficient to process in volume. IDs are concise since additional attributes can be associated with the hash codes externally. Binary formats are named tags and are specifically tuned for Big Data analysis operations such as MapReduce. In one embodiment of the present invention tags follow a standard hash code template that includes the following components a magic number to identify the object as a subclass of a contextual geohashing scheme of the present invention a hash code class that corresponds to hashing schemes a hash code class type that provides numerous profiles for each hashing scheme a size of object in 64 bit words.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention includes the following foundational multidimensional hashing schemes contextual geohash codes for geohashing contextual temporal hash codes for temporal hashing contextual elevation hash codes for elevation hashing contextual motion hash codes for hashing motion contextual celestial hash codes for hashing the view of astronomical objects against a celestial sphere. Contextual geohash codes hash latitude and longitude locations on the Earth. Contextual temporal hash codes hash dates and times. Contextual elevation hash codes uniquely hash elevations altitudes or heights both above and below a defined datum. Motion context hash codes describe the movement of an object with a defined location elevation and timeframe to a new location elevation and timeframe. Contextual celestial hash codes enable the description of celestial bodies or other objects such as weather over a specified location and timeframe including motion of those celestial bodies or other objects.

In one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention includes other contextual geohashing schemes associated with other foundational schemes. Some of these schemes are used to describe reference surfaces for gravity pressure various types of radiation weather including climate and weather predictions and surface subsurface and super surface composition air water soil rock geology among others.

A contextual geohash code technique for hashing geospatial coordinates described in latitude longitude and a defined datum such WGS84 at a specified precision 1 m . Traditional geohashing techniques such as Geohash from www.geohash.org hash a single geospatial point. Contextual geohashing is designed to hash any type of geospatial feature including points lines polygons and complex areas as sets of contextual geohash codes. A contextual geohash code is also infinitely scalable which means that a contextual geohash code can support user defined precisions such as 1 km 5 mm or 1 10m 1 yoctometer the smallest limit for SI defined standard units in meters .

Contextual geohash codes are defined as square quadrangles sequenced following a Z order Morton code curve within a modified quadtree structure. A quadrangle is a region on the Earth bounded by the graticule of lines of latitude and longitude as parallels and meridians. Meridians are defined as great circles and parallels are defined as small circles except at the Equator or the poles. Due to convergence the quadrangle parallel edge away from the Equator is slightly smaller than the parallel edge closer to the Equator whereas the meridional edges are both the same. A square quadrangle is one where the size in angular units such as degrees is the same for all edges of a quadrangle. shows a contextual square quadrangle extruded from a graticule . The length of each edge in a square quadrangle measured in angular units such as degrees is identical hence a square quadrangle. However the length of an edge in a square quadrangle measured in length units such as meters is only the same for the two meridional edges and is different for each of the parallel edges. Meridional edges are great circle arcs and are measured as great circle distances which represent the shortest distance between any two points on the Earth assuming a spherical datum defining the figure of the Earth . Geodesics describe the shortest distance on the Earth when a more accurate ellipsoidal or geodetic datum is used as the figure of the Earth. Parallel edges follow rhumb lines loxodromes or lines of constant East or West bearing which are not great circle arcs.

A contextual geospatial quadrangle is described by a contextual geohash code ID which is anchored to the southwest corner of the quadrangle with an assumed datum of WGS84. Contextual geohash codes are described by a variety of notations. A contextual geohash code ID is an ASCII string human readable of variable length where the length of the ID string is proportional to the depth level of the quadtree comprised of square quadrangles used to describe that quadrangle. shows contextual geohash for level 0 through level 2 according to one embodiment of the present invention. Levels beyond level 2 continue with this hierarchical pattern. Contextual geohash codes for level 0 are shown in diagram contextual geohash codes for level 1 are shown in diagram and contextual geohash codes for level 2 are shown in diagram .

A contextual geohash code ID has a standard form with four exceptions. The first character in the ASCII standard form must be either 0 for the western hemisphere or 1 for the eastern hemisphere. This denotes level 0 where levels describe both the quadtree depth and the corresponding precision of the described quadrangle. Starting with level 1 the prior region in this case a hemisphere is subdivided into four square quadrangles following a Z order pattern labeled A B C or D . Quadrangle A is always the northwest component Quadrangle B is always the northeast component Quadrangle C is always the southwest component and Quadrangle D is always the southeast component. Following this scheme any contextual square quadrangle can be subdivided into four square quadrangles to define a new level.

By design quadtree structures are spatially hierarchical and therefore highly compressible. These features enable a contextual geohash code ID to support an infinite quadtree depth and corresponding precision but a practical limit can be drawn from the International System of Units SI used by the metric system. The SI unit of length is the meter m and the smallest defined meter is the yoctometer which is defined as 1 10 24 m. Thus a contextual geohash code ID describes a lettered pattern A D repeatedly until the appropriate depth level is reached to describe the precision for the contextual geohash code ID. For example if a level 4 contextual geohash code ID is described for 0 N 0 E is would be labeled as 1ACCC . To reduce the precision of this ID to level 3 the last character is truncated producing 1ACC .

Table 2 of shows contextual geohash code IDs at 10 meter precision for 0 N 0 E according to one embodiment of the present invention.

In some cases a higher level quadrangle may need to be represented at a lower level precision. When the extra precision is warranted subsequent levels for precision are labeled with E . If this same quadrangle 0 N 0 E needed to be described with level 7 precision 1.4063 or 156 262.5 m in meridional distance it would be labeled as 1ACCCEEE .

In one embodiment of the present invention in which alphanumeric codes are used for contextual geohash code IDs there are four exception cases used with the contextual geohash code IDs to describe the poles to describe the whole Earth and to describe an unspecified location. The labels for these exceptions are as follows 1 a single character of indicates the North Pole 2 a single character of indicates the South Pole 3 a single character of indicates the whole Earth including both poles and 4 a single character of indicates an unspecified location which is used in conjunction with other types of hash codes such as temporal hash codes.

In one embodiment of the present invention anchor point for the southernmost contextual geohash code quadrangles is slightly greater than the South Pole by an imperceptible distance and does not include the South Pole. The northernmost contextual geohash code ID quadrangles do not include the North Pole but fall just short of it by an imperceptible distance.

Similar to contextual geohash codes a contextual geohash tag is a binary object that describes a contextual geohash code specifically designed for use in Big Data operations such as MapReduce. Contextual geohash tags are numbered sequentially as they are defined starting with contextual geohash tag 1. Because there are a number of different computing architectures many with different optimization requirements contextual geohash tags may be implemented in a number of different types where each type is uniquely named and described via a specification. Because contextual geohash codes are optimized for Big Data analytics tag specifications are described at the octet or bit level within a specified word size which is frequently tailored to 64 bits.

Whenever defining binary objects specifications the details for how information is encoded byte ordering or endianness . A big endian machine stores the most significant byte first and a little endian machine stores the least significant byte first. In one embodiment the method and apparatus of the present invention can support any type of binary architecture with the definition of different types. shows 64 bit endian examples to illustrate the differences between these byte ordering methods.

In one embodiment of the present invention all contextual geohash tags include the same header which comprises the first word or 64 bits of the type. There are three components to the type header 1 magic number which corresponds to GZ in ASCII 2 type number there are 65 535 possible types and 3 the size which describes the number of 64 bit words in the type. shows the logical layout of a contextual geohash tag header .

In one embodiment of the present invention contextual geohash tag 1 describes the binary type for a contextual geohash tag code that is based upon the WGS84 datum and includes up to 110 levels. The specific precision for level 110 is 154.087 ym one hundred fifty four thousand eighty seven hundred octillionths of a meter . The logical type layout for a contextual geohash tag 1 according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown in .

Unlike traditional geohashing schemes in one embodiment the contextual geohashing method of the present invention uses a set of contextual geohash codes to describe and delimit a region with an explicit precision. This means that contextual geohash codes can be used to describe any type of feature ranging from a point to a complex area including islands and or disjointed regions anywhere on the Earth. Contextual geohash code sets can include extremely large numbers of contextual geohash codes especially if a complex region is described with a high level of precision.

Compression occurs once the set has been sorted MapReduce operation on large sets and identical adjacent codes are thinned a quad exists A D codes for the same level can be compressed to the level above or a superset exists. A superset is a higher level that encompasses a lower level.

Fuzzy features are geospatial objects that are described with some degree of ambiguity for the spatial extents of those objects. illustrates this concept through concentric colored rings shown as different fill patterns in within a feature extent i.e. geographic entity England and Wales . This type of fuzzy feature can be implemented within one embodiment of the present invention by defining a set for each of the colored sub regions. Each set would also be associated with a description of the confidence value and method used to estimate or infer the likelihood of that sub region being part of the actual feature. By combining contextual geohash code sets into larger geohash code sets any time of geospatial ambiguity can be characterized and described.

Because each contextual geohash set can be filtered from any other set of sub feature sets multiple perspectives can be supported for how fuzziness is defined for any given feature. In one embodiment fuzziness may be applied to all other dimensional codes of the contextual geohashing method of the present invention.

A contextual temporal geohash code of the present invention is a technique for hashing descriptions of time in temporal units such as seconds or years. The contextual geohashing method of the present invention may be used with several depictions of time. In one embodiment of the present invention contextual temporal geohash codes may be aligned with the ISO 8601 specification for data and time.

For example in one embodiment of the present invention contextual temporal geohash tag 1 defines an extended time format based on ISO 8601 that spans from a trillion years ago to a trillion years in the future with a precision measured in yoctoseconds 10s . shows a contextual temporal geohash tag time span range 1102 for a detailed description of the date layout for this tag. As shown in contextual temporal geohash tag 1 extends ISO 8601 to address a trillion years in the past and future at the precision of a yoctosecond 10s . Time spans that span year zero must be split into a negative tag followed by a positive tag.

Confidence is used to describe the likelihood that something occurs at the place described by contextual geohash codes. One embodiment of confidence is fuzzy geography or places. In each of these examples some level of uncertainty is associated with the description of place. Any given description of place can be represented from differring perspectives including differing extents and associated confidence values. For instance The U.S. State Department may define a given international boundary authoritatively from the U.S. perspective. A local tribesman living near the border of that international boundary may define this same border differently from his local cultural perspective.

A boundary is used to delineate a place described using contextual geohash tags. Boundaries are associated with confidence values and may be distinct or fuzzy. Implemented as sets of contextual geohash codes boundaries can describe any place with a multitude of confidences asscoaited withinn a variety of perspectives that are valid with defined time spans which can also be defined with ambiguity or fuzziness.

Within Big Data the discovery of distinct data is challenging given the overall volume of data as well as the distributed fashion in which that data is stored and or managed. Contextual geohash codes represent meta information that can be associated with data to provide a fast and scalable means to deterministacally identify relevant data given a sepcified set of seach criteria. In this sense disparate data can be dynamically conflated or related to other data during a search process.

Confidence provides a means of characterizing ambiguity associated with the delineation of a place. This ambiguity may arise from scalar differences in the use of data inaccuracies associated with the delineation or measurement of data and or differences in perspective drawn from a group of individuals about where a place exists.

In one embodiment of the present invention boundaries are described by the outside edge of a set of contextual geohash codes included in a boundary set. The boundary set may be further described by confidence subsets which characterize the likelihood that the subregion is included in the boundary as defined by a source or perspective. For example in the United States a major metropolitan area is generally described by an urban center surrounded by suburbs. Exactly which suburbs are included may change by perspective and may evolve over time as a metropolitan area grows or declines.

Various types of geospatial boundaries can be described using the contextual geohash code of the present inveniton including boundaries such as points lines polygons complex polygons including holes and or distint collections of non continguos polygons as well as volumes extending both above and or below the surface of the Earth or other reference body.

Although one precision level is shown in any precision level may be used to describe a boundary such as the state boundary shown in . For example for any precision level contextual square quadrangles that are known to includes the state boundary are coded with a 100 confidence value and each interior contextual square quadrangle are coded with the appropriate confidence level. A first confidence set can be formed from the contextual square quadrangles that have a 100 confidence value. A a second confidence set can then be formed of interior contextual square confidence quadrangles that each have at confidence value of at least a particular threshold confidence value such as at least 95 . The state boundary can then be defined as a geohash set including the first and second confidence sets.

Because geohash code IDs are globally unique code matching schemes can be efficiently employed to compare a corpus of data described with geohash IDs with a set of search IDs. If any corpus ID matches any search ID then the corresponding data describe a common place or an aspect of a place depending upon the confidence associated with the match IDs.

Contextual temporal hashing characterizes the temporal extent occurrence and duration and potential periodicity of an event. Similar to geohash codes temporal hash codes may include confidence which is used to character temporal ambiguity associated with an event from a defined perspective. For instance a temporal hash code might be defined as Monday 19 May 2014 as a standard business day which has the definition of a non holiday or weekend day from 9 AM local to 5 PM local. This temporal hash code include a confidence value of 12 PM 1 PM as a likely non working lunch hour.

Because geohash code IDs are explicity defined as a volume from the center of the Earth extending out to intercept the cestial sphere at a specified time these volumes can be segregated into various subvolumes. When a subvolume is bounded by the surface of the Earth within a defined range of height above a datum such as mean sea level then the hashing scheme describes elevation hashing. Biomes or physiographic regions that are associated with specific elevation ranges can be hashed this way. Another example is elevation hashing of data by the contour ranges defined by topographic maps.

Contextual motion hashing can describe the motion of objects relative to the Earth such as a car traveling down a road or a thunder storm moving across a region.

Celestial hashing describes the orbit and or rotation of the Earth with respect to another celestial body such as the sun moon stars or other planets. The likely occurrence of sunlight twilight night or moonlight at a defined location and time is the aspect that is hashed.
