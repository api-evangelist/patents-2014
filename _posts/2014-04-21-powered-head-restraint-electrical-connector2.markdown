To provide an appropriate contact surface for the seated occupant s head in some instances these head restraints may be configured to linearly adjust upward and downward by sliding notched support posts within apertures on the associated seatback. However head restraints frequently lack adequate adjustment features for different sized occupants and various seating positions in the respective seating assembly making powered articulating head restraints beneficial.

According to one aspect of the present disclosure an articulating head restraint for a vehicle seatback includes front and rear links that are configured to pivotally couple with an upper portion of the vehicle seatback. A member is pivotally coupled with the front and rear links to define a four bar linkage and is movable between fore and aft positions. A cushion is slidably coupled with a face portion of the member and movable between upper and lower positions.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure a vehicle head restraint includes a base bracket configured to engage a seatback. Front and rear links have lower ends pivotally coupled with respective forward and rearward portions of the base bracket. A member is pivotally coupled with upper ends of the front and rear links and movable with the front and rear links between fore and aft positions. A cushion is slidably coupled with the member and is adjustable between upper and lower positions.

According to yet another aspect of the present disclosure a vehicle head restraint includes a four bar linkage that has a bottom link that is configured to engage a seatback. A head support member is coupled with a top link of the four bar linkage. A cushion is slidably coupled with the head support member and is slidable between upper and lower positions. An actuator is coupled between two links of the four bar linkage. The actuator is adjustable between first and second lengths for moving the cushion between fore and aft positions.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure a powered articulating head restraint includes a base bracket with support posts that are configured to easily engage a seatback during vehicle assembly and to provide an electrical connection for adjustment actuation. Front and rear links have lower ends pivotally coupled with respective forward and rearward portions of the base bracket. A member is pivotally coupled with upper ends of the front and rear links and movable with the front and rear links between fore and aft positions. A cushion is slidably coupled with the member and is adjustable between upper and lower positions. First and second actuators are contained within the head restraint and may be operated independently to adjust the cushion between various combinations of the fore and aft positions and the upper and lower positions to provide placement of the cushion in an orientation that accommodates the seated occupant.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure a vehicle seating assembly includes a head restraint having an elongate support operably connected to the support guide of the seatback. A bracket connects to the elongate support and defines an aperture there through. A first electrical connector disposed in the aperture. A sleeve operably connects with the support guide and defines a receiving slot. A second electrical connector is disposed in the receiving slot and operably couples to the first electrical connector wherein engagement of the elongate support with the support guide occurs simultaneously with engagement of the first electrical connector with the second electrical connector.

According to another aspect of the present disclosure a vehicle seating assembly includes a head restraint having an elongate support operably connected to the support guide of the seatback. A bracket externally connects to the elongate support and a first electrical connector couples to the bracket. A sleeve is externally connected with the support guide and a second electrical connector couples to the sleeve wherein the first and second electrical connectors contain multiple terminals.

These and other aspects objects and features of the present disclosure will be understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art upon studying the following specification claims and appended drawings.

For purposes of description herein the terms upper lower right left rear front vertical horizontal and derivatives thereof shall relate to the disclosure as oriented in . However it is to be understood that the disclosure may assume various alternative orientations except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting unless the claims expressly state otherwise.

Referring to reference numeral generally designates a head restraint that engages a vehicle seatback . The head restraint includes a front link and a rear link that pivotally couple with an upper portion of the seatback . A head support member is pivotally coupled with the front and rear links to define a four bar linkage . The head support member is moveable between fore and aft positions via the front and rear links . A cushion is slidably coupled with a face portion of the head support member and is thereby moveable between upper and lower positions.

Referring now to one embodiment of the head restraint is shown coupled with the seatback of a vehicle seating assembly . The vehicle seating assembly is positioned in a front driver side location of a vehicle . It is understood that the vehicle seating assembly may be positioned in various positions throughout the vehicle other than the illustrated position such as the passenger side location a mid row location and a rear seat location. The vehicle seating assembly includes the seatback that is pivotally coupled with a seat base to provide reclining functionality to the seating assembly . The seat base is slidably coupled with a floor of the vehicle about a track system to permit forward and rearward linear adjustment of the vehicle seating assembly relative to the floor of the vehicle . It is also conceivable that the seat base may not include the track system and alternatively may be fixedly coupled with the floor of the vehicle .

As illustrated in the seatback of the vehicle seating assembly has a frame that includes a first side support and a second side support that each extends upward from the seat base to couple with a top support which extends generally orthogonally between the first and second side supports . A back support cushion is disposed between the first and second side supports to define a back support surface that extends between the seat base and the top support . In the illustrated embodiment the back support cushion is divided into a lower cushion part and an upper cushion part which in some embodiments may pivot forward relative to the lower cushion part to adjust the contour of the back support surface . It is contemplated that the back support cushion and other portions of the seatback may be alternatively configured in additional embodiments such as incorporating or further separating the back support cushion or portions thereof from the seatback frame or alternatively arranging the back support cushions thereon.

As also shown in the head restraint couples with the upper portion of the vehicle seatback to securely support the head restraint with respect to the vehicle seating assembly . More specifically the seatback includes a pair of apertures that extend downward in a tubular shape into the top support of the frame for receiving and securing the support posts of the powered articulating head restraint as explained in more detail below. The powered articulating head restraint is orientated on the seatback to extend substantially upright from the upper portion of the seatback . A trim enclosure is provided on the rear area of the head restraint to substantially conceal the four bar linkage electrical actuation motors and other components of the head restraint . It is generally understood that the head restraint in additional embodiments may couple differently with the upper portion of the seatback including portions of the back support cushion to provide adequate support of the powered articulating head restraint .

With reference to the pair of support posts are shown extending down from a base bracket to slidably and removably engage the apertures in the seatback and thereby provide easier installation of the head restraint onto the seatback such as after assembly installation of the seatback into the vehicle . The slidable installation also allows for the seatback to be fitted with either the powered articulating head restraint described herein or a traditional non powered articulating head restraint as generally understood by one having ordinary skill in the art. The base bracket in the illustrated embodiment extends along in abutting contact with a top surface of the seatback between the pair of support posts . The support posts are thereby fixedly coupled the base bracket to thereby secure the base bracket with the upper portion of the seatback . Accordingly it is conceivable that in additional embodiments the base bracket may be alternatively attached to the upper portion of the seatback or integrally formed with the top surface thereof although customization and installation advantages of the easily removable support posts may be compromised with such integration of the base bracket . The base bracket in the illustrated embodiment furthermore defines a bottom link of the four bar linkage that is configured to engage the top surface of the seatback . As shown the base bracket is attached to the seatback to centrally position the head restraint on the seatback and to generally align a head support surface of the cushion in generally parallel alignment with the back support surface of the seatback as also illustrated in .

As further illustrated in the support posts are shown as a single integral tube that includes a horizontal portion extending beneath a rearward portion of the base bracket and across the top surface of the seatback . However it is understood that the support posts in additional embodiments may be individual pieces that separately attach to the base bracket . The lower ends of the front and rear links are pivotally coupled respectively with a forward portion and the rearward portion of the base bracket . More specifically the base bracket includes outer flanges that extend upward proximate the lateral ends of the base bracket . The forward portion of the base bracket includes a forward rotational axis that extends laterally across the base bracket and through the outwardly extending flanges proximate the connection with the front link for pivoting the front link relative to the base bracket . Similarly the outwardly extending flanges include a rearward rotational axis proximate the connection with the rear link for pivoting the rear link relative to the base bracket . The upper ends of the front and rear links similarly attach to the head support member at separately located pivotal connections on a lower portion the head support member to define the four bar linkage . In the illustrated embodiment the front and rear links each are single pieces that span laterally across the base bracket to couple between the outwardly extending flanges . However it is contemplated that the front and rear links may be separated into additional pieces such that a separate link may couple with each outwardly extending flange or other portion of the base bracket and the head support member while maintaining a four bar linkage arrangement.

As illustrated in the face portion of the head support member is generally perpendicular to the lower portion that couples with the front and rear links . The face portion slidably couples with the cushion of the head restraint . In the illustrated embodiment a track assembly is coupled between the face portion of the head support member and a rear portion of the cushion to provide the slidable movement of the cushion relative to the head support member . The track assembly includes a pair of vertical tracks that extend between the head support member and the cushion on opposing sides of an opening on the face portion of the head support member that is configured to receive an articulation arm which projects rearward from the cushion and is vertically slidable in the opening . A first actuator is coupled between the base bracket and the rear link for moving the head support member between the fore and aft positions . Also a second actuator is coupled between the articulation arm of the cushion and the head support member for moving the cushion between the upper and lower positions .

As shown in the head support member has generally L shaped rear flanges that extend rearward from the lateral edges of the face portion of the head support member . The bottom ends of the rear flanges define the lower portion of the head support member that pivotally couple with the front and rear links . More specifically the lower portion of the head support member includes a front rotational axis that extends laterally through the rear flanges proximate the connection with the front link for pivoting the front link relative to the head support member . Likewise the rear flanges include a rear rotational axis that extends laterally through the rear flanges proximate the connection with the rear link for pivoting the rear link . Accordingly in the illustrated embodiment the rear flanges align with the outer flanges of the base bracket such that the front and rear links each couple with an inside surface of both the outer flanges and the rear flanges . It is conceivable that the front or rear link may couple with an outside surface of the rear flanges or the outer flanges to provide a comparable four bar linkage arrangement.

Referring now to the support posts include guide members that generally surround the vertical portions of the support posts and are fitted into the apertures on the seatback . In additional embodiments the support posts or guide members may include a male or female connector and the top support of the seatback may include a female or male connector that engages the corresponding connector on at least one of the support posts upon attachment of the head restraint to provide an electrical connection to supply electrical power and data communication from the seatback to the first and second actuators of the head restraint . The base bracket includes a bottom part and a top part that interconnect to provide the connection between the horizontal portion of the support posts and the front and rear links . The bottom part is formed to include retention features that secure to the horizontal portion of the support posts whereby the retention features have a curved shaped that corresponds to the outer surface of the tubular shaped support posts . The top part of the base bracket has a substantially planar body portion with the outer flanges extending vertically at the lateral ends thereof. In addition the top part of the base bracket includes a central tab that similarly extends upright in general alignment with the outer flanges . In the illustrated embodiment the central tab is formed from cutting a U shape into the horizontal surface of the body portion and bending the U shape tab upright to a generally vertical orientation.

As also illustrated in a motor mount is pivotally coupled between the central tab and one of the outer flanges in coaxial alignment with the forward rotational axis . The motor mount includes attachment holes on a platform thereof for attachment fasteners to secure the first actuator thereto. The first actuator is coupled between the motor mount and the upper end of the rear link . More specifically the upper end of the rear link includes an attachment tab that extends forward from a central portion of the rear link . The central portion of the rear link extends laterally between linkage members of the rear link that similarly extend forward from outer ends of the central portion in vertical and longitudinal alignment with the outer flanges of the base bracket for pivotally coupling therewith. The front link has a similar construction to the rear link in that a central portion of the front link extends laterally between linkage members that extend rearward from outer ends thereof. The central portions of the front link and the rear link substantially enclose the first actuator and define a powered articulating neck of the head restraint . It is also conceivable that the first actuator may be configured to extend between the rearward rotational axis and the upper end of the front link to provide similar actuation of the four bar linkage between fore and aft positions .

Still referring to the second linear actuator couples between the cushion and the head support member to move the cushion between the upper and lower positions . The cushion generally includes a pair of fasteners that extend rearward for coupling with the articulation arm of the second linear actuator . The articulation arm threadably engages a rotatable shaft of the second actuator that has threads on an outer surface thereof for operably engaging a threaded aperture of the articulation arm . The rotatable shaft extends upward from an electric motor of the second actuator to engage an upper mounting flange that extends rearward from a top end of the face portion of the head support member . The electric motor of the second actuator mounts to a lower mounting flange that extends rearward from a bottom end of the face portion of the head support member . It is conceivable that the second actuator may be alternatively arranged between the cushion and the head support member to provide similar vertical adjustment of the cushion between the upper and lower positions .

As shown in more detail in the cushion includes a rigid backing panel that retains a first layered cushion part a second layered cushion part and a third layered cushion part that may each be made of a foam material a resilient woven material or other flexible cushion materials and combinations thereof as generally understood by one having ordinary skill in the art. It is contemplated that the layered cushion parts may be integrated in fewer parts or a single cushion part or may also include additional or alternatively configured cushion parts. A pair of apertures extend coaxially through the first second and third layered cushion parts and are sized with a diameter greater than heads of the pair of fasteners that extend rearward from the cushion . The heads are retained by the forward facing surface of the backing panel as shown in and the threaded portion of the attachment fasteners extend through the backing panel to engage the articulation arm of the second actuator . The pair of tracks of the track assembly couple with a rearward surface of the backing panel on opposing sides of the pair of fasteners . The pair of tracks slidably couple with sliding elements of the track assembly that are fixedly coupled with the face portion of head support member on opposing sides of the opening . In the illustrated embodiment four separate sliding elements with a generally T shape cross section are included however more fewer and alternatively shaped sliding elements may be included in additional embodiments of the track assembly . Furthermore the track assembly may be alternatively configured with the tracks fixedly coupled with the head support member and the sliding elements fixedly coupled with the backing panel of the cushion . In addition the track assembly may otherwise be integrated in additional embodiments with portions of the cushion such as the backing panel or portions of the head support member .

As shown in the head restraint is oriented in a neutral position . More specifically in the neutral position the head support surface of the cushion is generally aligned longitudinally with the back support surface of the seatback . The head support surface is generally defined by an exterior surface of a cover stock material that surrounds the layered cushion parts of the cushion and is comprised of a durable fabric material such as leather woven fabric vinyl or other upholstery materials as generally understood by one having ordinary skill in the art. The longitudinal position of the cushion is generally controlled by the first actuator which is positioned at a first length with the head restraint in the neutral position . The vertical position of the cushion is generally controlled by the second actuator having the articulation arm in a central position relative to the rotatable shaft of the second actuator when the head restraint is in the neutral position .

Referring now to operation of the head restraint between various fore and aft positions are controlled by linear adjustment of the first actuator . The first actuator also includes an electric motor that is interfaced with a worm gear that extends upward from the electric motor to pivotally couple with the attachment tab of the rear link . Actuation of the electric motor rotates a drive that linearly adjusts the worm gear from the first length to a second length and to a shorter third length and any intermediate position therebetween. It is also understood that in additional embodiments the first actuator may be configured to move to a length shorter than the third length and longer than the first length. The first second and third lengths of the first actuator are defined between the rotational axis of the drive of the electric motor and the pivotal axis formed between the end of the worm gear that is rotatably coupled with the attachment tab of the rear link . Upon movement of the first actuator from the first length to the shorter second length the four bar linkage pivots forward to position the cushion forward to a first fore position relative to the aft position when the head restraint is in the neutral position . Similarly when the first actuator moves from the second length to the shorter third length the four bar linkage pivots forward causing the cushion to move further forward from the first fore position to a second fore position . The front and rear links in the illustrated embodiment have a generally equivalent length and attach at generally equal distances from each other at the head support member and the base bracket resulting in a parallelogram arrangement that causes the cushion to move from the aft position to the first and second fore positions while substantially maintaining the angle and vertical orientation of the cushion . It is conceivable that the lengths and attachment spacing of the front and rear links may be adjusted in additional embodiments to otherwise alter the angle of the cushion upon movement between the fore and aft positions .

As illustrated in operation of the head restraint in moving the cushion between the upper and lower positions is controlled by adjustment of the second actuator . More specifically the second actuator is operated to move the articulation arm from the central position to a lower position an upper position and any intermediate positions therebetween. The second actuator includes the electric motor that rotates a gear drive that interfaces with a first threaded portion of the rotatable shaft whereby upon actuation of the electric motor the gear drive is rotated on a generally horizontal axis and interfaces with the first threaded portion of the rotatable shaft to rotate the rotatable shaft along a generally vertical axis. Rotation of the rotatable shaft moves a second threaded portion of the rotatable shaft which is in operable engagement with the articulation arm to move the articulation arm upward and downward relative to the rotatable shaft and the electric motor . Accordingly actuation of the electric motor in a first direction causes the articulation arm to move downward to a lower distance from the rotation axis of the gear drive to place the cushion in the lower position as illustrated in . Likewise rotation of the electric motor in a second direction causes the articulation arm to move upward relative to the rotatable shaft to a higher distance from the rotational axis of the gear drive to place the cushion in the upper position similarly displacing the head support surface of the cushion . Again it is contemplated that the cushion may be moved by the second actuator to a higher elevated position than the upper position shown in the illustrated embodiment and lower than the lower position shown in the illustrated embodiment. Furthermore the rotational direction of the electric motor may be reversed in additional embodiments to provide the corresponding movements of the cushion . With the various positions illustrated herein it is conceivable that the first actuator and the second actuator may be operated independently to move the cushion between various combinations of fore and aft positions and upper and lower positions to provide placement of the cushion and the associated head support surface in an orientation that accommodates the occupant seated and the vehicle seating assembly .

Referring to another embodiment of the disclosure is shown wherein the powered articulating head restraint includes an electrical connector assembly . The support posts or elongate supports extend down from the head restraint to slidably and removably engage with guide members located within the apertures shown in in the seatback for installation of the head restraint . The elongate supports can be of any suitable material and provide support for the head restraint . The elongate supports in the illustrated embodiment include an electrical connector bracket which is disposed orthogonal to one of the elongate supports . The electrical connector bracket may be made of metal polypropylene acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS or any other suitable material. The electrical connector bracket may define an aperture within the electrical connector bracket . In a first electrical connector is disposed in aperture . In other embodiments the first electrical connector may attach to the electrical connector bracket by other means not utilizing an aperture or the connector bracket may be integrated with the first electrical connector . The first electrical connector is shown having a generally cubic shape however it is understood that the first electrical connector in additional embodiments may be of any practicable shape. The first electrical connector contains one or more conductive terminals for power and data communication between the head restraint and the seatback .

Still referring to the elongate supports include guide members that generally surround or receive the downwardly vertical portions of the elongate supports when the head restraint is attached to the seatback . Accordingly the guide members are fitted into the apertures on the seatback . The guide members include a sleeve operably connected thereto in close proximity to the upper portion of the seatback . The sleeve may be made of any suitable material including but not limited to metal polypropylene and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene ABS . The sleeve in the illustrated embodiment includes ribs for support and it is contemplated that any other structural support may be integrally formed on the sleeve or later attached to the sleeve . In the illustrated embodiment the sleeve defines an aperture or receiving slot within an upper surface that is substantially parallel to the electrical connector bracket in the assembled position. A second electrical connector is disposed within the receiving slot . During assembly engagement of the elongate supports with the support guides simultaneously engages the first electrical connector with the second electrical connector .

Referring to the first electrical connector couples to at least one of the elongate supports of the head restraint . The coupling may occur through the use of an electrical connector bracket . The electrical connector bracket may be attached to the elongate support through welding or any other appropriate attachment means. The second electrical connector is attached to the sleeve which is coupled to the guide member located on the upper portion of the seatback . The sleeve may be integrally formed with the guide member . A brace is attached under the sleeve and it is contemplated that the brace may be integrally formed with the second electrical connector . The first and second electrical connectors include engagement assemblies for attaching the first electrical connector to the electrical connector bracket and the second electrical connector to the sleeve as explained in more detail below. The engagement assemblies limit vertical movement of the first and second electrical connectors once each electrical connector is attached to its corresponding attachment point. It is further contemplated that a clip may be added to the embodiment shown in for attaching the first electrical connector wire to a point on the elongate support .

Referring now to the first and second electrical connectors in the illustrated embodiment are male and female connectors respectively. The first and second electrical connectors may be fabricated from any suitable material including but not limited to a nylon material or any low dielectric material such as a plastic material. The first electrical connector is a male connector made up of a first connector insulative substrate and at least one conductive terminal . The at least one conductive terminal of the first electrical connector is mounted within the first connector insulative substrate . The exterior surface of the first connector insulative substrate contains a flange on at least one exterior wall to substantially inhibit movement of the first electrical connector as received in aperture . The first connector insulative substrate further includes an engagement projection for removably attaching the first electrical connector to the electrical connector bracket . The engagement projection is flexibly resilient thereby allowing the first electrical connector to pass through aperture in the electrical connector bracket . After the engagement projection passes the aperture the engagement projection resiliently returns to its initial position thereby coupling the first electrical connector in a substantially fixed location in a clip like manner.

As further illustrated in the second electrical connector is a female type connector. The second electrical connector has a second connector insulative substrate and at least one mating conductive terminal on a mating surface which is configured in a complementary manner relative to the first electrical connector and conductive terminal . The mating surface is a surface of the second connector insulative substrate having a predetermined height and shape for coupling to the first electrical connector . The mating conductive terminal of the second electrical connector is disposed substantially below the mating surface within the second connector insulative substrate . The exterior surface of the second connector insulative substrate contains a flange on at least one side wall to substantially inhibit movement of the second electrical connector as received in receiving slot . The second connector insulative substrate also possesses an engagement projection for removably attaching the second electrical connector to the sleeve . The engagement projection is flexibly resilient thereby allowing the second electrical connector to pass through receiving slot in the sleeve . After the engagement projection passes through the receiving slot the engagement projection resiliently returns to its initial position thereby coupling the second electrical connector in a substantially fixed location. A brace may surround a portion of the second electrical connector and in the illustrated embodiments is disposed below the aperture in the sleeve . In alternate embodiments the electrical connector may connect to the brace prior to attaching to the sleeve . In this situation the upper surface of the brace may limit movement of the second electrical connector when the second electrical connector is attached to the sleeve . If the upper surface of the brace is utilized for limiting movement of the second electrical connector a flange may not be present the second electrical connector .

Referring to during assembly of the powered head restraint assembly in the illustrated embodiment the electrical connector bracket is attached to at least one of the elongate supports . The first electrical connector is then removably attached to the electrical connector bracket by attaching the first electrical connector to the aperture within the electrical connector bracket . Once the engagement projection has passed through the aperture and the engagement projection has returned to its neutral position the first electrical connector is attached to the electrical connector bracket . A sleeve is attached to the guide member located on the upper portion of the seatback or the sleeve is integrally formed as part of the guide member . The second electrical connector is attached to a brace or integrally formed therewith. A second electrical connector attaches through an aperture in the sleeve . For final assembly of the vehicle seatback the powered head restraint is coupled to the seatback by sliding the elongate supports into the guide members . The engagement of the elongate supports with the guide members simultaneously engages the first electrical connector with the second electrical connector as best shown in causing the first and second electrical connectors to electrically couple.

Referring to an electrical connector assembly constructed according to another embodiment of the disclosure is shown. The electrical connector assembly includes male and female connectors described above to establish an electrical connection between the powered head restraint and the vehicle seatback . The electrical connector assembly further includes a slide attachment assembly formed with attachment features that are operative for mounting the second electrical connector to adjacent support structures such as a sleeve or a guide member located on the upper portion of the seatback . The attachment features can be molded as one piece with the sleeve or guide member and are configured to accommodate the particular mounting requirements for each application. As an example the illustrated embodiment shows the attachment feature as a rail on the guide member and a corresponding channel on the second electrical connector . This is but one example and it is to be understood that other attachment configurations are contemplated by the disclosure.

As also illustrated in the channel is formed on the exposed portion of the second connector insulative substrate adjacent the overlap region . The channel is generally defined by laterally spaced hook members having upstanding side wall portions that project outwardly from the substrate of the second connector insulative substrate and downwardly extending portions . The channel has an open end for receiving the rail into the channel and a longitudinally opposite interfering end that inhibits further movement beyond the interfering end . By external channel it is meant that the rail attaches to the outside region of the second electrical connector rather than extending into the internal cavities of the male or female connector members in which the terminals are housed.

As shown in more detail in the rail includes a molded plastic member or any other suitable material. The rail has a generally flat longitudinally extending main body on which the attachment features are formed to correspond with the channel . The main body includes side portions provided on the laterally opposite side edges of the main body thereby defining grooves that correspond closely to the spacing between laterally inward edges of the hook members defining the channel .

Referring to the rail is connected to the second electrical connector by extending the rail into the open end of the channel . The side portions of the rail straddle the opposite sides of the upper wall portions of the channel such that the inward edges of the upper wall portions are received in the grooves defined by side portions of the rail . Further the inward reaction surfaces of the side portions engage the outer and inner surfaces respectively of the hook members . Such coupling enables the rail to slide freely in the longitudinal direction but secures the rail laterally in the channel . It is further contemplated that the rail and channel may include features which can interlock when the rail is fully assembled with the channel to secure the second electrical connector against removal in the reverse longitudinal direction.
