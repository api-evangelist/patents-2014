title: Applications login using a mechanism relating sub-tokens to the quality of a master token
abstract: Methods and systems allow a user to log in to a device so that a number of apps become accessible on the device without the user repeatedly logging in to each different app as the user launches multiple apps. A mechanism of providing a master token with a quality score and providing sub-tokens for each app that can use the sub-token and the score quality to evaluate the level of security provided by the initial login allows each app to skip its own login process and provides a level of enhanced efficiency and convenience for the user. A method includes authenticating a user; creating a master token on the user device; creating a sub-token of the master token for an app launched on the device; the app skipping the login process of the app in response to the sub-token so that the app proceeds directly to validating a transaction.

This application is a continuation of co pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13 340 521 filed Dec. 29 2011 which is incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure generally relates to security for communications conducted over a network using a handheld mobile or other consumer electronic device and more particularly to a security mechanism for logging in to apps executing on the device that provides user convenience through either fast login or avoiding repetitive logging in when using multiple apps on the device.

Many compact handheld consumer electronic devices such as mobile phones with mobile web browsers smart phones and electronic note pads allow the use of various applications programs or apps for a great variety of types of communications including for example texting social networking email and electronic commerce which generally refers to the buying and selling of products or services over electronic networks such as the Internet and other computer networks using electronic devices. Apps used for these various types of communication may benefit from and even rely on some form of security in terms of not allowing unauthorized access to use of the app and thus may require some form of login. For example a bank or other financial service provider may provide an app for use on a mobile device that allows access to the device user s account at the financial service provider. Similarly in the case of email and social networking for example it can be desirable and important to prevent impersonation of the owner of the email account or the owner s social networking page. Thus many of the apps on a user s device may require some form of secure login to authenticate the user of the app. When many apps are being used at one time on a single device the user may encounter some inconvenience e.g. delay in accomplishing desired tasks from multiple or repetitive logins when switching from one app to another or when returning to a previously used app that has already logged the user out.

According to one or more embodiments of the present invention methods and systems are provided for allowing a user to log in to a device in such a way that a number of apps become accessible on the device without the user having to repeatedly log in to each different app as the user launches multiple apps. A mechanism is disclosed of providing a master token with a quality score and providing sub tokens for each app that can use the sub token and the score quality to evaluate the level of security provided by the initial login allowing the app to shorten or skip its own login process and providing a level of enhanced efficiency and convenience for the user.

In one or more embodiments a system includes a processor and a computer readable medium having computer readable code for instructing the processor to perform a method the method comprising authenticating a user via a user device communicating over a network with a service provider creating a master token on the user device checking if the master token is present on the device creating a sub token of the master token for an app on the device launched by the user launching the app includes jumping over the login process by the app in response to the sub token so that the app proceeds directly to validating a transaction and validating the transaction based on information included in the sub token.

These and other aspects of the present disclosure will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

Embodiments of the invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows.

According to one or more embodiments of the present invention methods and systems are provided for securely logging in to a device and communicating over a network in such a way that login to the device provides authentication that can be used to facilitate subsequent logins e.g. to one or more apps that can significantly improve the user experience. In other words a secure device binding may provide user convenience through avoiding repetitive logging in when changing apps application programs . In one embodiment a user and a device may be strongly authenticated at an initial login e.g. using biometric technology. As a result of the strong authentication a temporary master token may be generated that other applications can leverage by the use of sub tokens to provide log in security to the app without the app requiring its own login from the user. Thus the user may be allowed to log in to a device in such a way that a number of apps become accessible on the device without the user having to repeatedly log in to each different app as the user launches multiple apps. Avoiding multiple logins or even login for just one app according to some embodiments may allow reducing time latency when checking out from online shopping service provider payments at a point of sale POS and also may help solve off the grid transactions. In one embodiment biometrics may thus be used not so much only to secure the user but also to provide the user time saving convenience.

In one or more embodiments a mechanism is disclosed of providing a master token with a quality score and providing sub tokens for one or more apps e.g. each app has its own sub token that can use the sub token and the score quality to evaluate the level of security provided by the initial login allowing the app to securely shorten or skip its own login process and providing a level of enhanced efficiency and convenience for the user. In one embodiment the same app which generates the master token may also generate the sub token for any other app interfacing with the app via an application programming interface API. of the app. In another embodiment each app may generate its own sub token accessing the master token via an API. In one embodiment the master token may be a root token of a tree data structure of tokens including the sub tokens linked to the root token. As a result when the user accesses one or more apps on the mobile device there may be no need to go through a login process in the app. A login may nevertheless be required in certain situations such as a high dollar amount purchase based on risk parameters pre determined by the service provider.

In one embodiment a mobile device is bound or undergoes binding to an account for example with a service provider merchant bank or other commercial entity to enable a security features of apps on the device so that customers do not always have to enter their password when going through a shopping checkout or other financial transaction process with an app on a known mobile device. This device binding can serve as the basis for functionality such as skipping redundant login in various payment flows risk management processes and models and other device based logic. In one embodiment a device may be bound during an initial login for example through device interrogation to get a device identification ID which may include one or more device identifiers.

Device binding may be based on biometric technology e.g. finger print swipe retinal scan voiceprint and either alternatively or in addition on a unique device identifier which is present on the device e.g. international mobile equipment IMEI number name of device various date modified checks e.g. a firmware new version with a different time stamp from the previously installed version and other variables or a combination of identifiers . Use of such a device unique identifier may enable the service provider to remember a user across apps on a device if the user wants to skip subsequent logins on the device. Multiple mobile devices may be bound to a single account.

Mobile device may be for example a laptop smart phone tablet or other mobile computing or communication devices televisions with internet connection set top boxes or other network connected devices. Mobile device which may function as a client and may also be referred to as client device may be implemented using any appropriate combination of hardware and software configured for wired or wireless communication over network . For example mobile device may be implemented as a personal computer of user e.g. a client or customer in communication with network . Also for example mobile device may be implemented as a wireless telephone e.g. cell phone personal digital assistant PDA or notebook computer.

As seen in a browser app may run on mobile device and may be used to provide a user interface to permit user to browse information available over network . For example browser app may be implemented as a web browser to view information available over network . In one implementation browser app may comprise a software program such as a graphical user interface GUI executable by a processor that is configured to interface and communicate with merchant and service provider via network . For example user may access merchant websites via merchant to find and purchase items. User through client mobile device may also communicate with service provider server to create an account and make a payment to the merchant via service provider . Mobile device may include other apps as may be desired to make additional features available to user including making quick payments with service provider server . For example apps may include interfaces and communication protocols that allow the user to receive and transmit information through online sites via network . Apps may also include security applications for implementing client side security features programmatic client applications for interfacing with appropriate application programming interfaces APIs over network and various other types of generally known programs and applications.

Mobile device may also include applications for enrollment and authentication of the user. For example application may provide for establishing an account and a secure identity with service provider . Application may for example establish a biometric identity for the user that connects user with device so that when the user swipes his finger across a fingerprint reader for example on the device the user s fingerprint is established as an ID for the device and as an ID for an account with service provider so that application may provide enrollment with SP . The handset maker e.g. manufacturer of device may be provide this functionality but it could also be provided by an operating system OS provider or a service provider such as SP or a trusted service manager TSM . The enrollment process may include a number of various aspects that allow for future risk management by SP . Many of the parameters needed to create or allow the master token may be pre determined e.g. at enrollment and each SP can then use all or most of these shared parameters to be included into the generation of their sub token. The parameters pre determined at enrollment may be used like a checklist or shopping list for preset parameters in the master token. When the user makes a subsequent purchase for example a decision whether or not to require extra security could be triggered by parameters available from the master token or sub token and based on risk parameters pre determined by the service provider. 

Application may for example provide authentication for the user and device by verifying the user s fingerprint for example when the user subsequently logs in to device .

Merchant may be a service provider for example a merchant site an auction site a marketplace or a social networking site including P2P money transfer or any other P2P like information transfer offering various items such as products or services through their website. Merchant which could be any representative or employee of the merchant may process online transactions from consumers making purchases through the merchant site from mobile devices. Merchant also may operate a merchant server capable of handling various on line transactions automatically for example by communicating over network with client mobile device and service provider server . Merchant server may run a purchase app for offering products or services for purchase. Merchant server may also run a browser app and other applications . Browser app and other applications may enable the merchant to access a service provider web site and communicate with service provider server for example to convey and receive information to allow a quick payment through the service provider . In accordance with one or more embodiments consumers e.g. user may access apps for making transactions e.g. payments with a merchant through a service provider without having to log in which may enable quicker service e.g. completing payment processing with service provider server .

Service provider may be an online payments provider for example providing processing for online financial and information transactions with a merchant on behalf of a user . Service provider server may include one or more identity apps which may be adapted to interact with the client mobile device as well as merchant server over network to facilitate the purchase of items products and services by user . Service provider server may be configured to maintain multiple user and merchant accounts in an account database each merchant account may include or be separate from account information associated with individual users including user and one or more merchants . For example account information may include identity information of user and merchants such as one or more full names business names street addresses email addresses and phone numbers website addresses or other types of financial information which may be used to facilitate online transactions between user and merchants . Account information or identity app may also include device identifiers e.g. unique device identifier present on the device as described above such as IMEI number for user devices such as mobile device . Thus identity app may be configured to interact with a merchant server a user mobile device or other payee to process obtain and store information for allowing quick payments.

Email service provider may provide email service for entities connected to the network such as merchant service provider and individuals such as user . Email service provider also may operate an email server capable of providing email service automatically for example by communicating over network with client mobile device service provider server merchant server and social networking server . Email server may run an email app for providing email service. Email server may also run other applications .

Social networking service may provide social network for individuals and possibly other entities connected to the network such as user . Social networking service also may operate a server on which may run a networking app which could for example provide a social networking website for access to various subscribers such as user connected to network . Server may also run other applications for providing social networking services and website access.

In response to the biometric input a master token may be generated at response with some control parameters e.g. parameters for time scope field of applicability settings . When the master token is generated using the parameters a score may be derived that may be associated with the master token . For example knowing the device ID the user fingerprint read quality the number of times the fingerprint has been recognized the location e.g. from GPS geographical positioning system on the device and so forth the quality of the master token may be higher or lower and could generate a quality score in the range of 0 100 . For example an initial score could be 90 but a bad read unknown device or an unusual location could however generate a master token to which only a 40 score is attributed. Based on the score various service providers via their application e.g. apps could decide if a login is required or can be bypassed. The score may be available on a sub token corresponding to each app e.g. sub tokens respectively to apps .

With the master token and its associated score a service provider or other entity e.g. commercial entity service provider email service provider social networking service could allow their applications e.g. commercial entity app service provider app email service provider app social networking app respectively running on the OS of the device e.g. device that has been validated to leverage the authenticated e.g. now known user and the master token to generate a sub token to automatically launch some of the functions in the apps flow based on the score or quality of the master token . The quality score associated to a master token may also allow processing in a manner that lightens the processing load at the OS level and may speed up the login and sub token generation.

The master token may be stored on device and may have provisions for linking it into a tree data structure as shown in which may also be stored in memory on device . The master token may be stored in a trusted or secure area on device for example using a tamper resistant component cryptographic protection or other similar secure technology. The tree data structure and sub tokens may be similarly protected.

As shown in master token may be stored as a root token of tree and subsequently generated sub tokens e.g. sub tokens may be linked to the master token forming tree . As seen in sub tokens appear as leaves but tree may also have intermediate e.g. non leaf nodes in some embodiments.

As shown in each sub token may be created for a particular app on device and may be used only by the app for which the sub token has been created. For example sub token belongs to commercial entity app running on device and which may be used to interact with commercial entity by communicating with purchase app . Similarly sub token belongs to financial service provider app and so forth as seen in . Each sub token may be created for its particular app by a service provider app e.g. app or app which may be running on device and which may be the same app which generates the master token . Alternatively each app may create its own sub token using permissions and access granted to the master token . For example app may create sub token app may create sub token app may create sub token and app may create sub token . Creation of sub tokens may be facilitated by the use of an API for each app e.g. apps including the master service provider app e.g. apps .

A sub token may be endowed with special features such as countdown timer associated with sub token for financial service provider app . In such an instance it may be desirable for the master service provider app rather than the sub token s own app to create the sub token to ensure that special features cannot overstep the boundaries provided by the master token. For example the countdown timer for the sub token would not be allowed to have a total time greater than the expiration time for the master token and that could be enforced by allowing only the master service provider app e.g. apps to create sub token and not allowing the app to create its own sub token.

At step an application master token e.g. master token may be generated on the device with some control parameters e.g. expiration time scope field of applicability settings for various parameters .

At step a score of the quality of the master token may be derived for the master token based on quality of various parameters e.g. device ID the user fingerprint read quality the number of times this fingerprint has been recognized the device location and historical data kept by the SP for example.

At step when the user launches an app the app may make a call in the background to check for presence on the device of the master token the score associated with the master token and to find the master token and its quality score. Alternatively these steps may be performed as described above by a master service provider app e.g. enrollment app or authentication app .

At step a sub token e.g. sub token may be created for the app e.g. when the app is launched with parameters in line with the SP risk policy e.g. timed expiration period active mode period .

At step when the user launches apps e.g. any of apps the user may be NOT asked to enter credentials e.g. phone number and PIN or email and password as the user has already been verified if the quality score from the master token is in line with the policy developed and accepted by the SP. For example financial service provider app may require a 99 score while social networking app may require only an 80 score.

At step the app may jump over the login process and go directly to validating a transaction. The transaction may be a purchase in the case for example of shopping at merchant entity e.g. using commercial entity app . Moreover if a shopping checkout process using the service provider comes from another application e.g. social networking app that has also been validated with a sub token the user may just click to pay using the service provider and to verify the amount click for confirmation.

At step different applications e.g. apps may have sub tokens e.g. sub tokens respectively that can live remain valid for different lengths of time and for lengths of time different than that for the master token . For example a longer time may be allowed because of lesser security requirement or less privacy concerns from one app to another and such a decision could be based on a lower score from the master token. For example if the master token currently has a lower score than previously apps may opt for their sub tokens to remain valid for a shorter period of time to offset a greater perceived risk of the lower master token quality score.

At step the master token can be revoked for example if there is a discrepancy with a user biometric input versus the user biometric enrollment the device has been off grid for too long or an update was done to an application. Revoking the master token can result in canceling or erasing all existing sub tokens. When the user and the device are again strongly bound together e.g. the user has logged back in to the device with a satisfactory biometric input the master token may be generated and the sub tokens reissued.
