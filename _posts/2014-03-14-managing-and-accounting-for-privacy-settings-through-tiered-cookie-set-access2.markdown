title: Managing and accounting for privacy settings through tiered cookie set access
abstract: Tiered management of privacy settings is disclosed. In one example, such management entails defining privacy tiers respectively corresponding to privacy levels. Cookies are then associated to the privacy tiers to accommodate the management of browsing activity according to the relevant tier. Additionally, different sets of private information are respectively associated to the privacy tiers. This provides for the management of browsing activity using the privacy tiers, the cookies and the different sets of private information. In this fashion, the association of a given cookie to a given privacy tier dictates a given set of private information to be provided to another party in connection with a given browsing activity.

This application claims priority to provisional App. Ser. No. 61 791 633 filed on Mar. 15 2013 and entitled Managing and Accounting for Privacy Settings through Tiered Cookie Set Access the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

The present disclosure relates to management of private information and more particularly to managing and accounting for privacy settings through tiered cookie set access.

In conventional online activity users have virtually no control over the provision of private information to other parties. This private information may be as simple as the browsing activity itself e.g. tracking online activity . It may also involve additional information such as a user s credit card information banking information and personal information such as birthdates relationship status social security numbers etc.

What is needed is a greater ability to manage private information in connection with Internet browsing activity. The ability to observe and manage privacy settings in connection with various private information is also needed.

Tiered management of privacy settings is disclosed. In one example such management entails defining privacy tiers respectively corresponding to privacy levels. Cookies are then associated to the privacy tiers to accommodate the management of browsing activity according to the relevant tier. Additionally different sets of private information are respectively associated to the privacy tiers. This provides for the management of browsing activity using the privacy tiers the cookies and the different sets of private information. In this fashion the association of a given cookie to a given privacy tier dictates a given set of private information to be provided to another party in connection with a given browsing activity.

The present invention can be embodied in various forms including business processes computer implemented methods computer program products computer systems and networks user interfaces application programming interfaces and the like.

In the following description for purposes of explanation numerous details are set forth such as flowcharts and system configurations in order to provide an understanding of one or more embodiments of the present invention. However it is and will be apparent to one skilled in the art that these specific details are not required in order to practice the present invention.

The memory is illustrated to use a conventional browsing application . The browsing application is used to browse Internet resources via access to various websites. In conventional browsing cookies are used to allow the browser computer system to communicate information to websites which provides authentication and identification of the browser pursuant to various efficiencies and conveniences such as the provision of customized pages avoidance of duplicate data entry preferred presentation of materials etc.

While these efficiencies and conveniences are beneficial to the user and the website various privacy concerns can also arise through the pervasive use of cookie technology. For example adware and spyware often use cookies to track web browsing activity which may later be used to distribute information about the user s browsing activity. This and the related use of this information whether for hacking targeted advertising data mining or other reasons presents significant privacy exposure.

Traditionally an all or nothing approach has generally been used with respect to cookies. That is the browser may be set to enable or disable cookies so they are always accepted or always rejected. Additionally the cookies that have been accumulated may be viewed by the user and managed individually such as by deleting cookies that are not recognized. This provides some flexibility but clearly has disadvantages. First most users are not aware of this capability as it requires navigation among arcane browser features. Secondly cookies are not always easy to identify. Sometimes a valuable cookie may have an unfamiliar name and sometimes an undesirable cookie may have an innocent or misleading name. Thirdly it is difficult and cumbersome to manage cookies in this fashion since an abundance of cookies tend to accumulate with regular browsing.

The privacy management application provides convenient flexible and value added cookie and privacy management.

The privacy management application maintains privacy settings and facilitates the restriction of information according to tiered browsing. To accommodate this the privacy management application implements a tier cookie management module and a cookie management module that respectively manage and provide tiered levels of cookie sets e.g. Tier 1 Tier 2 Tier 3 and Tier 4 as shown in .

In a basic sense this may be undertaken by restricting access to and generation of different sets of cookies as segregated by the tiers . For example if Tier 1 is representative of the most private browsing setting other than total disable which may be provided as Tier 0 in some embodiments cookies may only be accessed and originated in connection with the set of cookies segregated as Tier 1.

Operation and access to cookie sets may be incremental. For example a second level of browsing privacy may implement an additional set of cookies segregated as Tier 2 a third level of browsing activity may implement still another set of cookies segregated as Tier 3 and so on.

Alternatively the cookie set may be managed in segregated fashion. That is the selection of Tier 2 may limit access to only those cookies resident in Tier 2. This allows browsing to be managed such that the user represents as Tier 1 when that tier is selected for browsing activities but represents as Tier 2 when that tier is selected for browsing activities.

The current level of privacy may be clearly conveyed to the user via a simple user interface and may optionally be persistently displayed on the browser so that the user is clearly aware of the current level of the privacy settings. The interface is also configured to allow the user to easily change the current level of privacy settings. This provides a significant convenience and enhancement over the hodgepodge hit or miss approach to current cookie management.

In addition to the convenience of cookie set management capabilities an embodiment of the present invention may be used to manage access to cookie sets as well as privacy data potentially in exchange for value.

A privacy settings module stores user information and allows the user to separate and protect various data with respect to various levels of privacy settings. A privacy exchange module manages and tracks access to various levels of access preferably correlated with the same tier levels adopted for the cookie set management. A value accounting module stores accumulated value resulting from the exchange of levels of privacy.

To explain Tier 0 total cookie disable Tier 1 first set of cookies accessible Tier 2 second set of cookies also accessible etc. may be correlated in discrete and convenient fashion to different levels of privacy. The privacy exchange module may adopt this in conjunction with managing browsing activity and identifying opportunities for the user to select different privacy levels in exchange for value. For example some websites may have an incentive to provide user compensation to users that agree to browse the website under low privacy settings. Thus for example if a user agrees to allow Tier 4 browsing the website may compensate the user with coupons credits or other value. The incentive to the website may come from other parties. For example marketing companies may compensate websites based upon the number of users that they develop under a desired tier e.g. Tier 3 or higher . A Tier 3 or 4 user may be more valuable to the marketing company since more rich information is presumably available for that user. Alternatively the website itself may have an incentive to encourage lower level tiers of privacy if such information is independently valuable to the website.

In contrast to existing systems where the user is mostly unaware about the collection of information embodiments of the present invention allow the user to be fully aware and appreciative of the level of privacy as well as the corresponding value that can be accorded to that level of privacy. In connection with this the current level of browsing activity is displayed for example in the peripheral region of a browsing window. For example text of graphics denoting Tier X are depicted in the peripheral region.

Finally consistent with the management of privacy tiers as provided above the display ad model of free Internet browsing may be avoided while also resolving DRM issues of copyright management. For example the management of the privacy tiers may incorporate a seeking consent process that gives acknowledgement to an artist who filed for copyright protection. Another example includes giving payment or other value to copyright holder s with batch DRM clearinghouse functionality per performance or by some flat rate arrangement .

Firstly instead of website owners and or their agents e.g. targeted traffic ad providers secretly recording a surfer s private information and surfing behavior preferences and purchasing history etc. through the use of cookies to manifest said data created in association with that surfer then reselling said info for value accruing to the thief or split among those thieves on that surfer s clickstream as evidenced by the cookies that session the improvement described herein is to make transparent that cookie based data recording activity give its rightful owner control over it then remunerate the surfer for intentionally allowing the cookie keeper aka appointed guardian of private info to re sell said info in exchange for some value accruing back to the surfer.

Secondly one type of value could be the privilege to view proprietary content like watch normally pay per view sports for free or allow the surfer to download a new hit song that normally would have to be purchased from iTunes. In order to give as consideration some content that is copyrighted to the surfer as a reward another improvement is to incorporate into a business process a method of pre established seeking of consent in order to make LEGAL the retransmission of that copyrighted content.

Thus by some preferred method between cookie keeper privacy tiers operator and content provider e.g. the artists or the copyright clearinghouse or the sponsor team of NFL etc. or the agent network etc. which acts as distributor of the commercially valuable content the application described herein provides for a monetization paying for the costs of running a website plus delivery of some content to value of the website and its activities including the normally paid for content by the exchange of the privacy tiers surfer s information rather than by the traditional display ad model.

Accordingly the surfer gets remunerated for allowing the cookie keeper to sell his private information. That reward could be normally paid for online content coupons virtual currency cash in some redeemable form etc.

Thirdly by dint of social media as the hi tech method of spreading traditional word of mouth recommendations also can create an income reward etc. stream to the surfer. In this case the cookie keeper is not directly benefiting by receiving monetary or other valuable consideration from those who buy the surfers but indirectly that is if surfers referrals generate leads that result in completed financial transactions the cookie keeper business as a whole grows logarithmically as the volume of referrals increase as well as an additional reward opportunity for surfer creating a positive feedback of increasing business activity for the benefit of all parties.

In so doing the entire global industry of display ads to support creative content is no longer necessary.

A user interface is displayed to convey the various privacy tiers. For example the interface may include respective rectangular regions for each of the privacy tiers being managed. The interface is configured to receive input that is used to manage the delineation of the privacy tiers i.e. how many tiers what they are named . The interface is also configured to manage the membership of the respective privacy tiers. Such membership management may correspond to the cookies that should belong to corresponding privacy tiers as well the information sets that belong to the corresponding privacy tiers.

In one example of the association of cookies the interface may display the regions respectively corresponding to each privacy tier and within the respective regions indicators text or graphics indicative of the cookies that reside within the given privacy tier. The interface is configured so that the user may drag and drop a cookie into a desired privacy tier. Cookies may also be made members of multiple tiers if desired. In that example a copy mode is activated in connection with the drag and drop operation. In this fashion the user may visually inspect which browsing activity will be associated to which tier. In addition to cookies URL information may be used to organize the association of websites to corresponding privacy tiers. This similarly allows the user to control which websites should be correlated to which privacy tiers.

In an example of the association of different sets of private information there is a set of interfaces corresponding to the sets of private information. These interfaces may similar include regions e.g. rectangular circular etc. that respectively correspond to the privacy tiers. Within the regions graphical and textual displays accommodate the identification of the sets of information. For example the highest privacy tier e.g. Tier 1 may show within the relevant Tier 1 region an indication that social security number date of birth home address are members of that privacy tier. A next highest privacy tier Tier 2 might show within the relevant region items such as business address relationship status etc. A still lower privacy tier Tier 3 might be populated with information such as name recent purchase information fantasy league memberships etc. and yet another lower privacy tier Tier 4 might be populated with more general information such as browsing activity . The user may similarly manage the membership of the tiers by operations such as drag and drop e.g. to move already defined information among the tiers or through data entry e.g. to create a new class of private information .

In conjunction with these interfaces the application associates cookies respectively to the privacy tiers and associates different sets of private information respectively to the defined privacy tiers.

Thereafter when the user is browsing the Internet the application remains in control of the private information that is made available to the website and or third party sites during such browsing activities. Specifically the application manages the browsing activity using the privacy tiers the cookies and the different sets of private information. In this fashion the association of a given cookie to a given privacy tier dictates that a corresponding given set of private information is potentially accessible by or provided to another party e.g. the website or a third party information recipient in connection with the given browsing activity.

When browsing instructions are received the application manages the corresponding browsing activity according to the browsing instructions and the above described privacy settings tiers cookies and or URLs sets of private information . In conjunction with this an indicator is provided in connection with the browsing activity so that the user is readily made aware of the privacy status of a current browsing activity.

In one example a simple graphic or text is provided in the periphery of the browsing window to indicate the current state e.g. Tier 1 or Tier 2 etc. . The current state may be dictated by the website currently being navigated in the browser. That is if the user has designated Website A as a Tier 3 designated site then Tier 3 appears in the window.

Alternatively the current state may be dictated by the user. For example the user may be in the mood for browsing under total privacy. In this case the user may select the highest available tier and may also indicate that such a tier be used regardless of the existing relationship cookie site to tier settings as described above.

The indicator does not need to be text based. In one alternative the frame of the browsing window may change colors according to the current setting. For example under a relaxed setting where information is being freely provided or is freely accessible the frame may be bright red to indicate the risk to the user. By contrast a strict setting where little or no information is being made available the frame may be green to indicate that the user may proceed freely without concern of losing control of private information. Intermediate states might warrant a yellow frame color.

Browsing may thus continue accordingly. According to another aspect of this disclosure the user may freely make modification of the privacy settings for application to subsequent browsing activity. In this regard the application receives the request to modify a given privacy setting and then updates the tier definition s the association of cookie s to the tier s and or the set s of private information associated to the tiers as described in detail above.

Once the request to update is completed the relevant settings are adjusted and browsing may continue according to the updated settings.

Thus embodiments of the present invention produce and provide managing and accounting for privacy settings through tiered cookie set access. Although the present invention has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain embodiments thereof the invention may be variously embodied without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Therefore the following claims should not be limited to the description of the embodiments contained herein in any way.
