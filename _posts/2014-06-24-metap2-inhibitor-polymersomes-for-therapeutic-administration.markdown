This application is a continuation of U.S. Non Provisional Utility application Ser. No. 12 648 155 filed on Dec. 28 2009 which is a continuation in part of the International Application Serial No. PCT US2008 68367 filed on Jun. 26 2008 which claims benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60 937 198 filed Jun. 26 2007 and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61 054 595 filed May 20 2008 the contents of both of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

The present invention relates generally to methods for the treatment of inflammation and autoimmune diseases and disorders.

Emerging data strongly implicates a ubiquitous eukaryotic enzyme methionine aminopeptidase type 2 MetAP 2 in many diseases Kass 2007 Yeh 2005 Bo 2004 Bringardner 2008 Zhang 2001 Watanabe 2006 . While MetAP 2 s role is not yet fully understood it is clear that expression and activity of MetAP 2 including but not necessarily limited to over expression or over activity of MetAP 2 is correlated with disease progression and stage of disease Salvukumar 2006 . Compounds that inhibit MetAP 2 activity could lead to significant therapeutic benefit across a wide variety of diseases.

It is a widely accepted hypothesis that tumor growth is angiogenesis dependent which is supported by both biological and pharmacological evidence and confirmed by genetic evidence which provides a scientific basis for current clinical trials of angiogenesis inhibitors. Increased tumor angiogenesis and elevated levels of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF VPF basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF and interleukin 8 IL 8 correlate with decreased survival and increased risk of relapse in studies of patients with malignant solid tumors. The importance of angiogenesis is further supported by the observation that antiangiogenic agents inhibit tumor growth in a variety of animal models.

In the U.S. there are currently more than 30 angiogenesis inhibitors in various clinical trials for late stage cancer. One of these angiogenesis inhibitors O chloracetyl carbamoyl fumagillol TNP 470 is a low molecular weight synthetic compound. Fumagillol is the alcohol derived from the hydrolysis of fumagillin a compound secreted by the fungus . TNP 470 is a potent endothelial inhibitor in vitro. Recently TNP 470 has been tested as a potential new anticancer agent. TNP 470 is also referred to as AGM 1470 an analog of fumagillin is among the most potent inhibitors of angiogenesis. The anti angiogenic properties of the TNP 470 were tested on different tumor models in animals and in clinical trials with a variety of malignancies such as prostate breast lung and cervical cancer.

In animal models TNP 470 has the broadest anticancer spectrum of any known agent. TNP 470 inhibited the growth of murine tumors up to 91 human tumors up to 100 and metastatic tumors up to 100 in mice reviewed in ref 31 . In most studies mice were treated at the same optimal dose of 30 mg kg subcutaneously every other day. In clinical trials TNP 470 has shown evidence of antitumor activity when used as a single agent with a number of objective responses reported with relapsed and refractory malignancies. It has also shown promise when used in combination with conventional chemotherapyalthough many patients experience neurotoxicity malaise rare seizures asthenia anxiety and dysphoria at high chemotherapeutic doses where antitumor activity has been seen. In addition to its anti angiogenic activities TNP 470 also inhibits or prevents vascular leakage.

Methionine aminopeptidase 2 MetAP 2 has been identified as the target of anti angiogenic fumagillol derivatives e.g. TNP 470 .The crystal structure of fumagillin complexed with MetAP 2 was reported by Liu et al.

TNP 470 is generally administered via injections for example intramuscular or intravenous delivery systems or by a continuous intravenous infusion given every few days. TNP 470 is also typically administered at high doses for a specific period of time at infrequent time intervals for example TNP 470 is administered at high doses as a chemotherapeutic. TNP 470 is not generally administered orally.

TNP 470 and other fumagillol derivative are known anti angiogenic agents.

In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is a fumagillol derivative that has anti proliferative anti inflammation and or anti angiogenic activity.

In some embodiments described herein are methods of inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation treating inflammation auto immune related diseases and disorders inhibiting graft versus host disease and inhibiting organ transplant rejection the method comprising administering a micelle of conjugated MetAP 2 inhibitor wherein MetAP 2 is conjugated to a diblock copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety wherein micelles are formed therefrom. In these embodiments the MetAP 2 inhibitor is a fumagillol derivative that has anti proliferative anti inflammation and or anti angiogenic activity.

The present invention relates in part to compositions and formulations comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor associated with a block copolymer wherein the block copolymer comprises a hydrophobic and hydrophilic moiety. The present invention relates in part to a composition comprising MetAP 2 inhibitors formulated for oral administration. In some embodiments the composition comprises associating a MetAP 2 inhibitor with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophobic moiety wherein the hydrophobic moiety is part of a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic moiety. In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is covently linked to the hydrophobic moiety is part of a block copolymer. In some embodiments the block copolymer comprising hydrophilic and hydrophobic moiety forms a micelle.

Accordingly the present invention relates to a method to treat a condition in which MetAP 2 activity is involved in or required for the pathology of the condition the method comprising administering a composition comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor formulated as disclosed herein. In one embodiment the composition is formulated for oral administration although other routes including topical and by injection are specifically contemplated. In one embodiment the condition is an autoimmune and or inflammatory disease or disorder and the method comprises orally administering a composition comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor formulated as disclosed herein. Other routes of administration are specifically contemplated as discussed herein below.

Methionine aminopeptidases are essential for removal of the N terminal methionine from nascent proteins. Following this removal a variety of molecules are attached to the unstable open N terminus including myristic acid. This acid changes the hydrophobicity of the nascent protein and causes specific cellular localization and function. In some instances this function may lead to pathological diseases as with the oncogene Src.Recently MetAP 2 one of the 2 major types of aminopeptidases has itself been identified as a possible oncogene.Its importance in cell proliferation is well documented.

As a result of this knowledge numerous classes of therapeutics have been synthesized to target and inhibit MetAP 2 activity including but not necessarily limited to over activity including the fumagillin and ovacillin classes bengamides bestatins pyrimidines sulfonamides among others Bernier 2005 . None have clinically succeeded due partly to the non specific nature of their bio distribution and partly due to a poor PK pharmacokinetic profile such as too rapid clearance short half life unacceptable levels of interaction with the nervous system or crossing the blood brain barrier. These issues are manifested in unwanted toxic side effects.

Many attempts have been made to overcome these issues associated with both the reversible and irreversible MetAP 2 classes of inhibitors largely through small molecule formulation synthesis or high molecular weight 60 kDa polymeric conjugation. However each formulation has shown insurmountable short comings including too short plasma half life a few minutes for the drug and less than 2 hr for the metabolites in the case of the fumagillin class compound TNP 470 weight loss with the sulfonamides and bestatins unpredictable cardiovascular events with the bengamides difficulty in manufacturing questionable stability the inability to dose patients over long periods of time and lack of clearance or too slow clearance as with higher molecular weight polymer conjugated drugs. Again the majority of these failures can be attributed to their non specific biodistribution. It is therefore desirable to administer a MetAP 2 inhibitor to patients in doses and methods that are limited in overall toxicities are stable and can provide multiple routes of administration depending on the presentation of the disease.

Further many MetAP 2 inhibitors particularly those in the fumagillol class are poorly soluble in water 1.9 mg ml see U.S. Pat. No. 5 536 623 and as such have low absorption and bioavailability if given orally.

In order to administer a MetAP 2 inhibitor one must overcome several issues associated with the chemical properties of the small molecule MetAP 2 inhibitors such as their poor solubility in water low absorption non specific bio distribution and poor bioavailability if administered orally topically inhaled or given via eyedrop. Due to these properties the vast majority of MetAP 2 inhibitors are currently formulated for administration exclusively via injections i.e. intramuscularly and intravenously .

As demonstrated herein the inventors have discovered a composition that formulates MetAP 2 inhibitors such as TNP 470 among others for alternative routes of administration other than injections by binding the MetAP 2 inhibitor to a diblock copolymer for example a diblock co polymer comprising PEG PLA. The inventors have discovered that such conjugation of a MetAP 2 inhibitor with block copolymers herein referred to as block copolymer MetAP 2 inhibitor conjugates provides a highly suitable formulation for oral topical inhaled intravitreal eyedrop or intraperitoneal administration. While having advantages for oral or other non injected routes of administration is also contemplated herein that the block copolymer compositions described herein can also be administered by injection e.g. intramuscular subcutaneous etc. .

The inventors demonstrate that a MetAP 2 inhibitor was successfully conjugated to a modified PEG PLA polymer through its amine and formed nano size polymersomes. The inventors also demonstrate using images taken by TEM that spherical micelles were formed and size measurement with DLS showed a low range of size distribution around 10 nanometers. By using confocal microscopy images of fluorescently labeled polymersomes the inventors demonstrate rapid uptake by Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells HUVECs and when the MetAP 2 inhibitor polymersomes were added a significant inhibition of HUVEC proliferation was shown as compared to no effect of the carrier itself .

In vivo studies done on mice showed a significant inhibition of subcutaneous Lewis Lung Carcinoma tumors with C57 BL mice given a daily oral administration of TNP470 micelles. A dose of 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent showed 63 inhibition without any weight loss to the mice data not shown .

Accordingly the inventors have discovered that conjugating a MetAP 2 inhibitor such as TNP 470 to diblock copolymers is useful for formulation as an oral administration formulation and that such a MetAP 2 inhibitor diblock copolymer conjugate is useful in a method to treat conditions that involve or require MetAP 2 activity for their pathologies such as cancer RA viral infection bacterial or fungal infection among others and those associated with abnormal or hyperpermeable vasculature such as edema age related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Evidence is also provided for a surprising effect of oral or topical formulation of MetAP 2 inhibitor particularly fumagillol derivative for the inhibition of autoimmune disease and or inflammation and particularly for example T cell mediated inflammation.

One embodiment is an oral anti inflammatory MetAP 2 inhibitor polymeric drug with potent efficacy in autoimmune disease models named Lodamin. The inventors characterized its physicochemical properties and show that this polymeric pro drug derived from TNP 470 successfully overcomes the limitations of TNP 470 while retaining its anti proliferative and antiangiogenic activities and demonstrate anti inflammatory activity. Lodamin is produced by conjugation of TNP 470 to a di block copolymer PEG PLA. The amphiphilic nature of this polymeric drug enables self assembly of micelles in an aqueous medium. In this structure the TNP 470 is located in the core where it is protected from the acidic environment of the stomach thus enabling oral availability. Furthermore advantage is taken of using biocompatible and well characterized polymers.

Lodamin administered orally is effectively absorbed in the intestine and accumulates in tumor tissue. The drug significantly inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis as demonstrated by inhibition of HUVEC proliferation in the corneal micropocket assay and in mouse tumor models. Lodamin significantly inhibited primary tumor growth as demonstrated in models of melanoma and lung cancer. Notably oral Lodamin successfully prevented liver metastasis of melanoma tumor cells without causing liver toxicity or other side effects and led to prolonged mouse survival see PCT US2008 68367 .

Moreover unlike the neurological impairments caused by free TNP 470 Lodamin does not penetrate the blood brain barrier and accordingly did not cause neurotoxicity in mice. Lodamin and similar fumagillol derivative formulations can therefore realize the benefit of fumagillol derivative with out the well known downside.

Accordingly the inventors have discovered that conjugating MetAP 2 inhibitors to diblock copolymers is useful for formulation for an oral administration formulation.

Subsequent to the development of Lodamin for the treatment of proliferative and angiogenic disorders the inventors have found that Lodamin a polymeric conjugate of TNP 470 has anti inflammatory properties. Lodamin suppressed the pro inflammation cytokines INF and IL 17 production in T cells suppressed T cell proliferation suppressed T cell activation and suppressed T cell differentiation and suppress inflammatory cytokine production see Example 7 . In addition in the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis model EAU oral administration of Lodamin to the mice for 21 days resulted in significantly reduced clinical score for the disease condition . Orally administered Lodamin also suppressed the production of pro inflammation cytokines INF IL 17A and IL 6 in T cells from EAU mice retina and suppressed CD4 T cell proliferation .

Accordingly the invention herein provides a method of inhibiting of the activation and or proliferation of a CD4 T cell in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a MetAP 2 inhibitor formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor having anti inflammation activity associated with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety.

This ability of inhibiting T cells activation and or proliferation represents a significant and clinically relevant avenue for the treatment and intervention of T cell mediated diseases and disorders. T cell mediated diseases and disorders include but are not limited to general inflammation organ specific auto immune diseases such as inflammatory arthritis type I diabetes mellitus multiple sclerosis psoriasis inflammatory bowel diseases vasculitis allergic inflammation such as allergic asthma atopic dermatitis and contact hypersensitivity organ transplant rejection graft versus host disease and T cell lymphomas and leukemia.

In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is covalently linked to the hydrophobic polymer moiety of the block copolymer. In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is a fumagillol derivative. The formulation should at the minimum have anti inflammatory activity or anti autoimmune activity in the assays or model systems described herein.

In another embodiment provided herein is a method of treating inflammation in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a composition comprising a formulation of a fumagillol derivative that has anti inflammation activity and or anti angiogenic activity wherein the formulation comprises the fumagillol derivative associated with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety. In one embodiment the fumagillol derivative is covalently linked to the hydrophobic polymer moiety of the block copolymer.

As used herein treatment of inflammation refers to treatment of inflammation resulting from various causes including the inflammation associated with diseases or conditions of the vascular system inclusive of the heart the brain and the renal system for example inflammation from pathogen infection sunburns physical injury etc. Non limiting examples of inflammation associated diseases or conditions are a gastrointestinal disease or condition other than GI complications of NSAIDs e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn s disease regional enteritis ulcerative colitis diverticulitis pancreatitis a respiratory pulmonary disease or condition e.g. emphysema acute respiratory distress syndrome asthma bronchitis chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a musculoskeletal disease or condition e.g. arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis gouty arthritis juvenile arthritis degenerative joint diseases and spondyloarthropathies muscle or joint strains or sprains osteoporosis loosening of artificial joint implants myositis polymyositis bursitis synovitis ankylosing spondylitis tendonitis a dermal disease or condition e.g. psoriasis eczema scleroderma dermatitis epidermolysis bullosa an allergic disease or condition e.g. allergic reactions allergic contact hypersensitivity ocular inflammatory diseases or conditions e.g. uveitis conjunctivitis scleritis episcleritis optic uveitis keratitis retinal vasculitis ocular cicatricial pemphigoid Mooren s corneal ulcer Birdshot retinochoroidopathy Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome and sympathetic opthalmia a diabetes associated condition e.g. diabetic retinopathy diabetic neuropathy diabetic nephropathy inflammatory conditions associated with type I and type II diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosis inflammation associated with burns an inflammatory disease or condition affecting multiple organs e.g. Sarcoidosis Behcet s syndrome .

In one embodiment the inflammation is acute. In another embodiment the inflammation is chronic. Inflammation is a basic way in which the body reacts to infection irritation foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses or other injury via the body s white blood cells and chemicals. It is the complex biological response of vascular tissues to harmful stimuli such as pathogens damaged cells or irritants. Inflammation occurs as the body s protective attempt to remove the injurious stimuli as well as initiate the healing process for the tissue. Key inflammation feature being redness warmth swelling and pain.

Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes T cells and B cells from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical events propagates and matures the inflammatory response involving the local vascular system the immune system and various cells within the injured tissue.

The process of acute inflammation is initiated by cells already present in all tissues mainly resident macrophages dendritic cells histiocytes Kuppfer cells and mastocytes. At the onset of an infection burn or other injuries these cells undergo activation and release inflammatory mediators e. g. TNF chemokines IL 1 histamine and reactive oxygen species ROS responsible for the clinical signs of inflammation. Vasodilation and its resulting increased blood flow cause the redness rubor and increased heat calor . Increased permeability of the blood vessels results in an exudation leakage of plasma proteins and fluid into the tissue edema which manifests itself as swelling. Some of the released mediators such as brakykinin increase the sensitivity to pain hyperalgesia dolor . The mediator molecules also alter the blood vessels to permit the migration of leukocytes mainly neutrophils outside of the blood vessels extravasation into the tissue. The neutrophils migrate along a chemotactic gradient created by the local cells to reach the site of injury. The loss of function is probably the result of a neurological reflex in response to pain. Release of inflammatory mediators recruits all the types of white blood cell to the site including T cells and B cells. In addition the mediators also activate many of these recruited cells to produce their own mediators of inflammation e. g. IFN LTB4 C5a IL 8 IL17 IL 1 TNF and IL 6.

In addition to cell derived mediators several acellular biochemical cascade systems consisting of preformed plasma proteins act in parallel to initiate and propagate the inflammatory response. These include the complement system activated by bacteria and the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems activated by necrosis e.g. a burn or a trauma.

The acute inflammatory response requires constant stimulation to be sustained. Inflammatory mediators have short half lives and are quickly degraded in the tissue. Hence inflammation ceases once the stimulus has been removed.

Prolonged inflammation known as chronic inflammation leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells which are present at the site of inflammation and is characterized by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process.

In acute inflammation if the injurious agent persists chronic inflammation can ensue. This process marked by inflammation lasting many days months or even years may lead to the formation of a chronic wound. Chronic inflammation is characterised by the dominating presence of macrophages in the injured tissue. Macrophage release toxins including reactive oxygen species that are injurious to the organism s own tissues as well as invading agents. Consequently chronic inflammation is almost always accompanied by tissue destruction.

In some diseases however the immune system inappropriately triggers an inflammatory response when there are no foreign substances to neutralize. In these diseases autoimmune diseases the body s normally protective immune system causes damage to its own tissues.

In one embodiment the invention herein provides a method of treating an auto immune related disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a MetAP 2 inhibitor formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor having anti proliferative activity and or anti inflammation activity associated with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety. In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is a fumagillol derivative. In one embodiment the MetAP 2 is covalently linked to the hydrophobic polymer moiety.

In another embodiment provided herein is a method of treating an auto immune related disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a composition comprising a formulation of a fumagillol derivative that has anti inflammation activity the formulation comprising the fumagillol derivative is associated with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety. In one embodiment the fumagillol derivative is covalently linked to the hydrophobic polymer moiety.

In one embodiment the auto immune related disease or disorder is T cell mediated. T cell involvement may be evidenced by the presence of elevated numbers of T cells at the site of disease the presence of T cells specific for autoantigens the release of performs and granzymes at the site of disease response to immunosuppressive therapy etc. One skilled in the art can determine the level of involvement of T cells e. g. based on the number of reactive T cells found in a sample as compared to a negative control from a naive host or standardized to a data curve obtained from one or more patients. In addition to detecting the qualitative and quantitative presence of auto antigen reactive T cells the T cells may be typed as to the expression of cytokines known to increase or suppress inflammatory responses. It may also be desirable to type the epitopic specificity of the reactive T cells.

T cells may be isolated from patient peripheral blood lymph nodes or preferably from the site inflammation. Reactivity assays may be performed on primary T cells or the cells may be fused to generate hybridomas. Such reactive T cells may also be used for further analysis of disease progression by monitoring their in situ location T cell receptor utilization etc. Assays for monitoring T cell responsiveness are known in the art and include proliferation assays and cytokine release assays.

Proliferation assays measure the level of T cell proliferation in response to a specific antigen and are widely used in the art. In an exemplary assay patient lymph node blood or spleen cells are obtained. A suspension of from about 10to 10cells usually from about 10to 10cells is prepared and washed then cultured in the presence of a control antigen and test antigens. The test antigens may be peptides of any autologous antigens suspected of inducing an inflammatory T cell response. The cells are usually cultured for several days. Antigen induced proliferation is assessed by the monitoring the synthesis of DNA by the cultures e.g. incorporation of 3H thymidine during the last 18H of culture.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA assays are used to determine the cytokine profile of reactive T cells and may be used to monitor for the expression of such cytokines as IL 2 IL 4 IL 5 IFN etc. The capture antibodies may be any antibody specific for a cytokine of interest where supernatants from the T cell proliferation assays as described above are conveniently used as a source of antigen. After blocking and washing labeled detector antibodies are added and the concentrations of protein present determined as a function of the label that is bound.

Auto immune related diseases and disorders arise from an overactive and or abnormal immune response of the body against substances autoantigens and tissues normally present in the body otherwise known as self or autologous substance. This dysregulated inflammatory reaction causes an exaggerated response by macrophages granulocytes and or T lymphocytes leading to abnormal tissue damage and cell death. Subsequent loss of function is associated with inflammatory tissue damage.

An autoimmune disease or auto immune related disease herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual s own tissues or a co segregate or manifestation thereof or resulting condition therefrom.

Autoantigens as used herein are endogenous proteins or fragments thereof that elicit this pathogenic immune response. Autoantigen can be any substance or a portion thereof normally found within a mammal that in an autoimmune disease becomes the primary or a primary target of attack by the immune system. The term also includes antigenic substances that induce conditions having the characteristics of an autoimmune disease when administered to mammals. Additionally the term includes peptic subclasses consisting essentially of immunodominant epitopes or immunodominant epitope regions of autoantigens. Immunodominant epitopes or regions in induced autoimmune conditions are fragments of an autoantigen that can be used instead of the entire autoantigen to induce the disease. In humans afflicted with an autoimmune disease immunodominant epitopes or regions are fragments of antigens specific to the tissue or organ under autoimmune attack and recognized by a substantial percentage e.g. a majority though not necessarily an absolute majority of autoimmune attack T cells.

Autoantigens that are known to be associated with autoimmune disease include myelin proteins with demyelinating diseases e.g. multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune myelitis collagens and rheumatoid arthritis insulin proinsulin glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 GAD65 islet cell antigen ICA512 ICA12 with insulin dependent diabetes.

A common feature in a number of autoimmune related diseases and inflammatory conditions is the involvement of pro inflammatory CD4 T cells. These T cells are responsible for the release of inflammatory Th1 type cytokines Cytokines characterized as Th1 type include interleukin 2 IL 2 interferon TNF and IL 12. Such pro inflammatory cytokines act to stimulate the immune response in many cases resulting in the destruction of autologous tissue. Cytokines associated with suppression of T cell response are the Th2 type and include IL 10 IL 4 and TGF . It has been found that Th1 and Th2 type T cells may use the identical antigen receptor in response to an immunogen in the former producing a stimulatory response and in the latter a suppressive response.

Cytokines play a critical role in the development and recovery from autoimmune diseases. For example Th1 cytokines such as interleukin 12 IL 12 and interferon gamma IFN have been found in the central nervous system CNS of multiple sclerosis MS patients as well as in animals with EAE Issazadeh et al. 1995 . J Neuroimmunol 61 205 12 . Th2 cytokines such as IL 4 IL 5 and IL 10 have been found to be elevated either during remission of MS or EAE Waisman et al. 1997 Immunointervention in autoimmunity by Th1 Th2 regulation L. Adorini ed. Austin Tex. R.G. Landes Co. pp. 129 50 . Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of IL4 as well as local CNS administration of IFN can reduce the severity of EAE Racke et al. 1994 J Exp Med 180 1961 6 Voorthuis et al. 1990 Clin Exp Immunol 81 183 8 . Furthermore the addition of IL 4 to naive T cells can result in the development of Th2 type cells whereas the addition of IL 12 can result in the development of Th1 type cells Macatonia et al. 1993 Int Immunol 5 1119 28 .

Reagents targeting T cells have been developed and used to treat several autoimmune diseases see review in Nature Immunology 2007 8 25 30 For example CTLA 4 Ig Abatacept inhibits the activation of T cells and has been approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Natalizumab interferes with the migration of T cells and is used for treating multiple sclerosis.

In one embodiment the formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor and or a fumagillol derivative having anti inflammation activity anti proliferative activity and or anti angiogenic activity covalently linked to a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety can be administered in conjunction with the common drugs used for the specific auto immune disease and disorders such as azathioprine infliximab omalizumab daclizumab adalimumab eculizumab efalizumab natalizumab omalizumab and or methotrexate among others.

In one embodiment described herein is a method of inhibiting organ transplant rejection in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a MetAP 2 inhibitor formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor having anti proliferative activity and or anti inflammation activity covalently linked to a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety. In one embodiment the MetAP 2 inhibitor is a fumagillol derivative.

In another embodiment provided herein is a method of inhibiting organ transplant rejection in a subject in need thereof the method comprising administering a composition comprising a formulation of a fumagillol derivative that has anti inflammation activity and or anti proliferative activity in which the formulation comprising the fumagillol derivative is associated with a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety.

Transplant rejection occurs when the immune system of the recipient of a transplant attacks the transplanted donor organ or tissue such as the heart lungs pancreas liver and kidneys.

Acute organ rejection is generally mediated by T cell responses to proteins from the donor organ which differ from those found in the recipient. The development of T cell responses first occurs several days after a transplant if the patient is not taking immunosuppressant drugs. Acute organ rejection is caused by mismatched human leukocyte antigens HLA antigens that are present on all cells. HLA antigens are polymorphic therefore the chance of a perfect match is extremely rare.

Physicians skilled in the art can recognize and diagnose transplant rejection. A biopsy of the transplanted organ can confirm that it is being rejected. Some of the signs and symptoms of rejection for specific organs include 

Kidney Rejection Fever over 38 C. or 100.4 F. decreased urine output weight gain over 2 pounds per day increased blood pressure and pain over kidney.

Liver Rejection Fever over 38 C. or 100.4 F. fatigue jaundice yellowing of skin or eyes darkening of urine clay colored stools and pain over liver.

The risk of acute rejection is highest in the first 3 months after transplant. With the development of powerful immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin tacrolimus and rapamycin the incidence of acute rejection has been greatly decreased however organ transplant recipients can develop acute rejection episodes months to years after transplant. Acute rejection episodes can destroy the transplant if it is not recognized and treated appropriately. Episodes occur in around 60 75 of first kidney transplants and 50 to 60 of liver transplants. Untreated acute rejection leads to scarring and damage of the donor organ which then require the recipient to undergo a second or third organ transplant and often set the stage for chronic rejections of grafts.

Accordingly administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor and or a fumagillol derivative having anti inflammation activity anti proliferative activity and or anti angiogenic activity covalently linked to a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety shortly before organ or tissue transplant or immediately after transplant can prevent organ tissue transplant rejection from developing. The formulation described herein can also be administered at the initial diagnosis of such transplant rejection to stop and or prevent the rejection from progressing further or to slow the rejection progression to buy time while searching waiting for another suitable organ to become available for transplant. It is also envisioned that the therapeutically effective amount of a MetAP 2 inhibitor and or a fumagillol derivative covalently linked to a block copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety can be administered in conjunction with powerful immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin tacrolimus daclizumab anti IL 2 antibody azathioprine mycophenolate and rapamycin to suppress organ or tissue transplant rejection.

In one embodiment the fumagillol derivative is covalently linked to the hydrophobic polymer moiety of the block copolymer.

GVHD is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplant in which functional immune cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as foreign and mount an immunologic attack. After bone marrow transplant T cells present in the graft neither as contaminants or intentionally introduced into the host attack the tissues of the transplant recipient after perceiving host tissues as antigenically foreign. The T cells produce an excess of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor TNF alpha and interleukin 1 IL 1 . A wide range of host antigens can initiate graft versus host disease among them the human leukocyte antigens HLAs . However graft versus host disease can occur even when HLA identical siblings are the donors. HLA identical siblings or HLA identical unrelated donors often have genetically different proteins called minor histocompatibility antigens that can be presented by MHC molecules to the recipient s T cells which see these antigens as foreign and so mount an immune response.

While donor T cells are undesirable as effector cells of graft versus host disease they are valuable for engraftment by preventing the recipient s residual immune system from rejecting the bone marrow graft host versus graft . Additionally as bone marrow transplant is frequently used to cure cancer mainly leukemias donor T cells have proven to have a valuable graft versus tumor effect.

Classically acute graft versus host disease is characterized by selective damage to the liver skin and mucosa and the gastrointestinal tract. Newer research indicates that other graft versus host disease target organs include the immune system the hematopoietic system e.g. the bone marrow and the thymus itself and the lungs in the form of idiopathic pneumonitis. Chronic graft versus host disease damages the above organs but also causes changes to the connective tissue e.g. of the skin and exocrine glands .

Transfusion associated graft versus host disease TA GvHD is a rare complication of blood transfusion in which the donor T lymphocytes mount an immune response against the recipient s lymphoid tissue. Donor lymphocytes are usually identified as foreign and destroyed by the recipient s immune system. However in situations where the recipient is immunocompromised inborn immunodeficiency acquired immunodeficiency malignancy or when the donor is homozygous and the recipient is heterozygous for an HLA haplotype as can occur in directed donations from first degree relatives the recipient s immune system is not able to destroy the donor lymphocytes. This can result in graft versus host disease.

Graft versus host disease can largely be avoided by performing a T cell depleted bone marrow transplant. These types of transplants result in reduced target organ damage and generally less graft versus host disease but at a cost of diminished graft versus tumor effect a greater risk of engraftment failure and general immunodeficiency resulting in a patient more susceptible to viral bacterial and fungal infection. Methotrexate and cyclosporin are common drugs used for GVHD prophylaxis.

In one embodiment uveitis is associated with an auto immune related disease or disorder such as diabetes melitis irritable bowel syndrome Behcet s disease Crohn s disease sarcoidosis etc.

Uveitis encompasses all inflammatory processes of the middle layers of the eye also called the uveal tract or uvea. The uvea includes the iris colored part of the eye choroid a thin membrane containing many blood vessels and ciliary body the part of the eye that joins these together . The uvea is very important because its many veins and arteries transport blood to the parts of the eye that are critical for vision. Uveitis may cause inflammation of all three structures that make up the uvea. Alternately only one of the structures may be affected. For instance in the type of uveitis affecting only the iris the condition is caller iritis or anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis is also known as iridocyclitis and posterior uveitis is known as choroiditis or chorioretinitis.

As an inflammatory eye condition uveitis can occur alone or it can occur as part of a generalized inflammatory process in systemic autoimmune diseases. Uveitis can occur as a result of injury infection e. g. Lyme disease tuberculosis syphilis or exposure to toxins. Uveitis is often associated with disorders that have an HLA B27 component such as ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter s disease. Other possible triggers of uveitis include herpes herpes simplex virus infection shingles varicella zoster virus toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus which occurs mainly in people infected by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV and in fungal infections.

Complications of uveitis include visual impairment vision loss glaucoma cataracts or retinal damage. In the United States uveitis is responsible for about 10 percent of all cases of blindness.

As an autoimmune disorder uveitis may occur alone or it may accompany other systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis Bechet syndrome sarcoidosis Kawasaki disease Reiter disease psoriasis ulcerative colitis multiple sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus juvenile idiopathic arthritis sarcoidosis diabetes mellitus inflammatory bowel disease and or ankylosing spondylitis.

The most common type of uveitis is anterior uveitis which represents 75 to 90 percent of all cases and involves inflammation in the front part of the eye. Anterior uveitis is characterized by flares lasting from a few days to a few weeks with appropriate treatment alternating with relapses. Posterior uveitis is generally a more serious condition with inflammatory periods lasting as long as a year. In posterior uveitis permanent vision damage may occur even with treatment. Intermediate uveitis vitritis or plans partitis is caused by inflammation in the vitreous or fluid portion of the eye.

Symptoms in uveitis are related to which of the uvea s three structures are affected. Symptoms may have a sudden onset and pain may not necessarily be present. Symptoms include redness light sensitivity photophobia floaters blurred vision and pain. A skilled physician in the art would be able to differentially diagnose the condition.

Current treatment options for uveitis include steroid eye drops injections or pills taken orally and eye drops that dilate the pupil and reduce pain. In severe cases chemotherapeutic immunosuppressants are used to suppress the immune system. It is recommended that early treatment be under taken as soon as definitive diagnosis is made to avoid the risk of permanent vision loss. In some embodiments the method of treatment of uveitis described herein further comprises administering simultaneously any of the conventional treatment options such as steroid eye drops injections or pills taken orally and eye drops that dilate the pupil and reduce pain. In some embodiments chemotherapeutic immunosuppressants are also administered in conjunction with the MetAP 2 inhibitor and or fumagillol derivative formulation described herein. Ocular inflammation can be graded according to the scoring system described by Ruiz Moreno et al. Ophthalmic Res. 24 162 168 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference. The grading scale is as follows no inflammatory reaction 0 discrete inflammatory reaction 1 moderate dilation of the iris and conjunctival vessels 2 intense iridal hyperemia with flare in the anterior chamber 3 and the same clinical signs as grade 3 plus the presence of fibrinoid exudation in the papillary area with intense flare in the anterior chamber 4. As used herein an improvement of one number grade or more is considered effective treatment for uveitis.

The term MetAP 2 inhibitor refers to an agent that at a minimum inhibits the activity of MetAP 2 by at least 20 in a MetAP 2 assay as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6 548 477 or in U.S. Pat. No. 7 030 262 which are both incorporated herein by reference preferably at least 50 at least 60 at least 70 at least 80 at least 90 at least 95 at least 96 at least 97 at least 98 at least 99 or more up to and including complete or 100 inhibition relative to the absence of such an agent. Reversible and irreversible MetAP 2 inhibitors are known in the art and are encompassed by the term MetAP 2 inhibitor. Fumagillol derivatives as described herein that have anti proliferative activity are MetAP 2 inhibitors as the term is used herein. The fumagillol and ovacilin classes of MetAP 2 inhibitors have a reactive spiroepoxide moiety that reacts to form a covalent bond with the imidazole nitrogen of histidine 231 in the catalytic site of MetAP 2. Molecular modeling with potential irreversible MetAP 2 inhibitors will permit the skilled artisan to readily predict whether a given candidate inhibitor will react with histidine 231 of the enzyme and therefore have the desired inhibitory activity. Similarly a rational design approach can be used to prepare reversible MetAP 2 inhibitors as demonstrated by Wang et al.

No. 5 290 807 which are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference. Other MetAP 2 inhibitory fumagillol derivatives such as PPI 2458 are described by Bernier et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 101 10768 10773 2004 . Fumagillol derivatives as described herein have at a minimum anti angiogenic activity when tested for example in a HUVEC proliferation assay as known in the art and described herein below. It should be understood that the term fumagillol derivative refers to the derivatives of fumagillol of Formula I whereas a fumagillol derivative block copolymer conjugate refers to such derivatives conjugated to a block copolymer. Similarly a MetAP 2 inhibitor refers to the inhibitor itself while a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate refers to the MetAP 2 inhibitor conjugated to a block copolymer.

As used herein the term proliferation refers to the development of cells that result in unwanted or undesirable physiological consequences such as with a tumor or inflammation or hyperpermeable abnormal vasculature viral infections bacterial infections and fungal infections. Angiogenesis should be understood to be a proliferative process. Thus in certain instances the term proliferation can apply to the development of blood vessels. Such development is also referred to herein as angiogenesis. In some instances the term angiogenesis as used herein refers to the sprouting of new blood vessels from pre existing blood vessels characterized by endothelial cell proliferation and migration triggered by certain pathological conditions such as the growth of tumors metastasis AMD and arthritis among others. It should be noted that the term proliferation can also apply to the proliferation of viruses bacteria fungi microsporidia etc. The context of the term will make it clear which type of proliferation is being referred to.

The term anti proliferative activity refers to the property of an agent that inhibits suppresses or reduces the rate of growth or creation of new undesired cells or blood vessels in the body in order to combat disease. A compound or agent with anti proliferative activity as used herein is an agent that inhibits MetAP 2 and leads to the suppression of unwanted proliferating cells e.g. in unwanted angiogenesis unwanted proliferation of CD4 T cell and unwanted proliferation of activated CD4 T cell. Also encompassed by the term anti proliferative activity is an agent that inhibits MetAP 2 and leads to cell death.

As an example the compound A 357300 can be coupled in this manner after amine protection. See e.g. . Similar coupling for can also be used for example to couple compounds such as 1 hydroxymethyl 2 methyl propyl carbamic acid 3R 4S 5S 6R 5 methoxy 4 2R 3R 2 methyl 3 3 methyl but 2 enyl oxiranyl 1 oxa spiro 2.5 oct 6 yl ester see U.S. Pat. No. 6 548 477 . Additional fumagillin derivatives with alcohol functionalities permitting such conjugation are described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 7 087 768 Han et al. see e.g. Example 35 therein.

Assays for MetAP 2 activity are also known in the art. Assays are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6 548 477 and 7 030 262.

Recombinant human MetAP 2 is expressed and purified from insect cells as described in Li and Chang 1996 Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 227 152 159. Various amounts of candidate MetAP 2 inhibitor compound are then added to buffer H 10 mM Hepes pH 7.35 100 mM KC 1 10 glycerol and 0.1 M Co.sup.2 containing 1 nM purified recombinant human MetAP 2 and incubated at 37 C. for 30 minutes. To start the enzymatic reaction a peptide containing a methionine residue e.g. Met Gly Met is added to the reaction mixture to a concentration of 1 mM. Released methionine is subsequently quantified at different time points e.g. at 0 2 3 and 5 minutes using the method of Zou et al. 1995 Mol. Gen Genetics 246 247 253 . MetAP 2 inhibition is scored relative to a control lacking the candidate inhibitor and can also be scored relative to a known MetAP 2 inhibitor e.g. TNP 470 or for example TNP 470 block copolymer conjugate as described herein.

Assays for the inhibition of catalytic activity of MetAP 2 can be performed in 96 well microtiter plates. Compounds to be tested are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 mM and diluted ten fold in assay buffer 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 100 mM NaCl . Ten microliters of solution of each compound to be tested for inhibition are introduced into each cell of the plate. Zero inhibition of enzyme activity is taken to be the result obtained in cells in which 10 mL of assay buffer was placed. A mixture totaling 90 mL per well and made up of 84 mL of assay buffer containing 100 mM MnCl 1 mL of L amino acid oxidase Sigma Catalog No. A 9378 11 mg mL 1 mL of horseradish peroxidase Sigma Catalog No. P 8451 dissolved in assay buffer at a concentration of 10 mg mL 1 mL of the tripeptide Met Ala Ser Bachem dissolved in assay buffer at concentration of 50 mM 1 mL of ortho dianisidine Sigma Catalog No. D 1954 freshly made solution in water at a concentration of 10 mg mL and MetAP 2 at a final concentration of 1.5 mg mL are rapidly mixed and added to each cell containing test or control compound. The absorbence at 450 nanometers is measured every 20 seconds over a period of twenty minutes using an automatic plate reader e.g. from Molecular Devices California USA . The Vmax in mOD min calculated for each well is used to represent MetAP 2 activity. The ICfor each candidate inhibitor is obtained by plotting the remaining activity versus inhibitor concentrations.

It is noted that some pro drugs may require pre treatment e.g. enxymatic or non specific hydrolysis before assaying for MEtAP 2 inhibitory activity.

Among the compounds of the Formula I fumagillol derivatives useful in the methods and compositions as disclosed herein include for example but are not limited to 1 6 O 4 methoxyaniline acetyl fumagillol 2 6 O 3 4 5 trimethexyaniline acetyl fumagillol 3 6 O 4 N N dimethylethoxy aniline acetyl fumagillol 4 6 O cyclopropylamino acetyl fumagillol 5 6 O cyclobutylamino acetyl fumagillol 6 4 cyclopropylamino acetyl oxy 2 1 2 epoxy 1 5 20 dimethyl 4 hexenyl 3 methoxy 1 chloromethyl 1 cyclohexanol and 7 4 cyclobutylamino acetyl oxy 2 1 2 epoxy 1 5 dimethyl 4 hexenyl 3 methoxy 1 chloromethyl 1 cyclohexanol. Structural formulas of the above compounds are shown in Tables in International Patent Application No WO03 027104 which is incorporated herein by reference.

To enhance the activity of anti proliferative or anti angiogenic treatments use of adjunct treatments with MetAP 2 inhibitors including fumagillol derivatives can be performed. Thus in one embodiment use of the compositions as disclosed herein including a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate in conjunction with other agents is encompassed in the present invention for treatment of diseases disorders or conditions associated with characterized by or otherwise requiring MetAP 2 activity for their pathologies. These include but are not limited to diseases involving abnormally stimulated neovascularization such as inflammatory diseases rheumatism and psoriasis among others diabetic retinopathy and cancer.

One aspect of the invention relates to the use of copolymers as carriers for the solubilization and formulation of a MetAP 2 inhibitor for example TNP 470 as disclosed herein. A copolymer is a polymer comprising subunits of more than one type i.e a copolymer can comprise subunits of A and subunits of B etc. In some embodiments a copolymer is an alternating copolymer for example having a repeating structure comprising the different types of subunits for example an alternating copolymer can have the formula A B A B A B A B A B or A B .

In some embodiments MetAP 2 inhibitors as disclosed herein are associated with a block copolymer to form a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate.

The polymers useful in the compositions and methods described herein are block copolymers. A block copolymer comprises subunits of more than one type but instead of an alternating copolymer a block copolymer comprises at a minimum a block of subunits of one subunit type followed by a block of subunits of another subunit type. For example a block copolymer comprising two subunits for example A and B can have the formula of A A B B or A A A A A B B B B B . The number of the different subunits can be different for example A A A A B B B B B. A diblock copolymer is a block copolymer comprising two different blocks of polymer subunits whereas a triblock copolymer is a block copolymer comprising three different blocks of polymer subunits and a tretrablock copolymer is a block copolymer comprising four different blocks of copolymer subunits etc.

As used herein a block copolymer is a polymer comprising at least a first block comprising a polymer of hydrophobic monomers and at least a second block comprising a polymer comprised of hydrophilic monomers see . A block copolymer differs from a non block copolymer in that a block copolymer comprises blocks of polymer of one type e.g. a block of hydrophilic monomers that are joined to a block of polymer of another type e.g. a block of hydrophobic monomers as opposed to a non block copolymer in which the different monomers are not joined together in blocks. For example for a block copolymer of monomers A and B the block copolymer would have e.g. the structure AAAAABBBBB. A non block copolymer of the same monomer subunits would have for example the structure ABAABABBABAABB or the structure ABABABABABAB for example. The blocks of a block copolymer as the term is used herein will have at least 5 monomers per block i.e. for a block copolymer of A and B monomers the A block will be at least 5 A monomers long and the B block will be at least 5 B monomers long . In some embodiments the homopolymer blocks will be at least 10 monomers long 15 monomers long 20 monomers long or more. A block copolymer as the term is used herein can have different block lengths but each block will be at least 5 monomers long differences in block lengths can influence the ability of the block copolymer to form certain structures e.g. micelles. In some instances the monomers making up the hydrophilic block of a block copolymer can comprise different hydrophilic monomer subunits and similarly in some embodiments monomers making up the hydrophobic block of a block copolymer can comprise different hydrophobic monomer subunits.

Diblock copolymers can be made using living polymerization techniques such as atom transfer free radical polymerization ATRP reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer RAFT ring opening metathesis polymerization ROMP and living cationic or living anionic polymerizations.

Block copolymers can microphase separate to form periodic nanostructures for example when one block is hydrophobic and the other hydrophilic. Microphase separation is a situation similar to that of oil and water. Oil and water don t mix together they macrophase separate. If you have an oil like first block and a water like second block the block copolymers undergo microphase separation. The blocks want to get as far from each other as possible but they are covalently bonded so they re not going to get very far. In microphase separation the oil and water blocks form nanometer sized structures including micelles which comprise essentially spherical arrangement with the hydrophilic blocks arrange to the outside of the sphere in contact with an aqueous solution and the hydrophobic blocks forming an inner hydrophobic core. Thermodynamic terms can describe how the different blocks interact. The interaction parameter chi gives an indication of how different chemically the two blocks are and whether or not they will microphase separate. Generally if the product of chi and the molecular weight is large greater than 10.5 the blocks will microphase separate. Conversely if the product of chi and the molecular weight is too small less than 10.5 the different blocks are able to mix rather than microphase separate.

In some embodiments amphiphilic block copolymers are useful in the formulations and compositions of the present invention for example as effective drug carriers that solubilize hydrophobic drugs into an aqueous environment. For example amphiphilic block copolymers exhibiting self association properties are disclosed in EP No. 0397 307 and EP0583955 and EP0552802 which are incorporated herein by reference.

In some embodiments useful biodegradable polyesters comprised by the hydrophobic block of copolymers described herein are for example biodegradable polyester oligomers or polymers synthesized from monomers selected from e.g. D L lactide D lactide L lactide D L lactic acid D lactic acid L lactic acid glycolide glycolic acid caprolactone hydroxy hexanoic acid butyrolactone hydroxy butyric acid valerolactone hydroxy valeric acid hydroxybutyric acids malic acid and copolymers thereof. More preferably the biodegradable polyester is synthesized from monomers selected from the group consisting of D L lactide D lactide L lactide D L lactic acid D lactic acid L lactic acid glycolide glycolic acid caprolactone hydroxy hexanoic acid and copolymers thereof. Most preferably the biodegradable polyester is synthesized from monomers selected from the group consisting of D L lactide D lactide L lactide D L lactic acid D lactic acid L lactic acid glycolide glycolic acid and copolymers thereof.

In some embodiments the block copolymers comprise hydrophobic polyesters containing polyester bonds for example but not limited to polylactic acid PLA polyglycolic acid PGA poly D L lactic co glycolic acid PLGA poly caprolactone poly valerolactone poly hydroxybutyrate and poly hydroxyvalerate .

In some embodiments the block copolymers comprise hydrophobic polymers for example of said block copolymer is selected from the group consisting of poly d L lactic acid poly L lysine poly aspartic acid poly caprolactone PCL poly propylene oxide . In some embodiments a hydrophobic polymer moiety is 1 15 kDa. For example a hydrophobic polymer moiety is between 0.5 10 kDa 1 8 kDa 1 5 kDa 1 3 kDa 3 15 kDa 5 15 kDa 8 15 kDa 10 15 kDa 12 15 kDa 2 12 kDa 4 10 kDa 6 8 kDa in size. In some embodiments a hydrophobic polymer is approximately 2 kDa for example 1.5 kDa 2 kDa or 2.5 kDa. In particular embodiments a hydrophobic moiety useful in the composition as disclosed herein is a poly d L lactic acid PLA polymer for example a poly d L lactic acid PLA polymer of 1 kDa 1000 Da .

In some embodiments the copolymers comprise hydrophilic polymers for example but not limited to polyethene glycol PEG polymer which is also referred to a poly ethylene oxide PEO or poly oxyethelene in the art . In some embodiments the hydrophillic polymer may be capped at one end. In some embodiments the capping group is alkoxy. For example a hydrophilic polymer useful in the composition as disclosed by be capped with a methoxy group. In some embodiments a hydrophilic polymer is between 1 15 kDa. For example a hydrophilic polymer moiety useful in the composition as disclosed is between 1 10 kDa 1 8 kDa 1 5 kDa 1 3 kDa 3 15 kDa 5 15 kDa 8 15 kDa 10 15 kDa 12 15 kDa 2 12 kDa 4 10 kDa 6 8 kDa in size. In some embodiments a hydrophilic polymer is approximately 2 kDa for example 1.5 kDa 2 kDa or 2.5 kDa. In particular embodiments a hydrophilic polymer is a poly ethylene glycol PEG polymer for example a poly ethylene glycol PEG polymer of 2 kDa 2000 Da .

In some embodiments the copolymers comprise a diblock copolymer comprising a PEG PLA diblock copolymer where block copolymer comprises blocks of the hydrophilic PEG monomers and blocks of the hydrophobic monomer PLA.

The hydrophilic blocks of a copolymer can be coupled to the hydrophobic blocks by covalent bonds for example by ester or urethane links and the like. Condensation polymerization and ring opening polymerization procedures may be utilized as may the coupling of a monofunctional hydrophilic block to either end of a difunctional hydrophobic block in the presence of coupling agents such as isocyanates. Furthermore coupling reactions may follow activation of functional groups with activating agents such as carbonyl diimidazole succinic anhydride N hydroxy succinimide and p nitrophenyl chloroformate and the like.

In some embodiments hydrophilic blocks of a copolymer can comprise PEG or derivatized PEG monomers of an appropriate molecular weight. PEG has particularly favorable biocompatibility nontoxic properties hydrophilicity solubilization properties and rapid clearance from a patient s body.

The hydrophobic blocks of a copolymer should also comprise biodegradable polyester monomers that are biodegradable and biocompatible. The in vitro and in vivo degradation of hydrophobic biodegradable polyester blocks of a copolymer are well understood and the degradation products are readily metabolized and or eliminated from the patient s body.

MetAP 2 inhibitors including fumagillol derivatives such as TNP 470 can be solubilized or dispersed using block copolymers as disclosed herein. One advantage of using the block copolymers as disclosed herein is that the MetAP 2 inhibitors such as TNP 470 that have limited solubility or dispersibility in an aqueous or hydrophilic environment have enhanced solubility and or dispersibility and can be administered via oral administration. Another advantage of using the block copolymer is improved biodistribution versus the bengamide class of MetAP 2 inhibitors or the sulphonamide class or the bestatin class of inhibitors.

One can prepare block copolymer MetAP 2 conjugates as micelles as disclosed in the Examples herein. In another embodiment one can prepare block copolymer micelles for sustained release of a MetAP 2 inhibitor using the method is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6 623 729 which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference and is further illustrated in the following steps 

Step 1 Preparation of Block Copolymer. A block copolymer containing a hydrophobic part having hydroxyl group at one end and a hydrophilic part at the other end is prepared by copolymerization of a biodegradable polyester polymer and a polyethylene glycol PEG polymer in the presence of stannous octate as a catalyst The copolymerization is performed at 160 200.quadrature for 2 6 hours under a vacuum condition. The polyester polymer includes polylactic acid PLA polyglycolic acid PGA poly D L lactic co glycolic acid PLGA poly caprolactone poly valerolactone poly hydroxy butyrate or poly hydroxy valerate and in some embodiments PLA and methoxypolyethyleneglycol is used as the polyethyleneglycol polymer.

Step 2 Binding of Linker by an Activation of Functional Groups of Block Copolymer. The block copolymer is dissolved in an organic solvent and reacted with a linker at room temperature in the presence of pyridine and nitrogen The organic solvent includes but without limitation methylenechloride and the linker includes p nitrophenyl chloroformate carbonyldiimidazole CDI N N disuccinimidyl carbonate DSC or a mixture of these compounds preferably p nitrophenyl chloroformate. The reaction is carried out for 2 to 6 hours with a molar ratio of block copolymer linker pyridine ranging from 1 2 2 to 1 2 6.

Step 3 Preparation of a Conjugate of Drug and Biodegradable Polymer. The linker bound block copolymer is conjugated to a drug by covalent linkage to obtain a micelle monomer of a conjugate of drug and block copolymer where the block copolymer obtained by reacting with hydrazine may be used The block copolymer reacted with hydrazine forms a micelle monomer by binding the linker to a ketone group of a MetAP 2 inhibitor such as a fumagillol derivative while the block copolymer without hydrazine reaction forms a micelle monomer by binding the linker to an amine group of a MetAP 2 inhibitor such as a fumagillol derivative. Preferably the MetAP 2 inhibitor is TNP 470. In alternative embodiments other MetAP 2 inhibitors are equally suitable for copolymer conjugation. In yet another embodiment other drugs or chemotherapeutic agents are used in addition to a MetAP 2 inhibitor for example anti cancer agents such as but without limitation doxorubicin adriamycin cisplatin taxol and 5 fluorouracil.

Step 4 Preparation of Sustained Release Micelle. The micelle monomers prepared in Step 3 are dispersed in an aqueous solution to prepare sustained release micelles. When micelle monomers are dispersed in a certain concentration micelles are formed spontaneously by thermodynamic equilibrium. Sustained release micelles thus prepared release a drug by way of hydrolysis and enzymatic action in vivo and the released drug exerts the same effect as free drug does.

In the composition and methods disclosed herein a MetAP 2 inhibitor for example TNP 470 is associated with a block copolymer.

As used herein the term associated with means that one entity is in physical association or contact with another. Thus a MetAP 2 inhibitor associated with a block copolymer can be either covalently or non covalently joined to the block copolymer. It is preferred that the association be covalent. The association can be mediated by a linker moiety particularly where the association is covalent. The term association or interaction or associated with are used interchangeably herein and as used in reference to the association or interaction of a MetAP 2 inhibitor e.g. TNP 470 with a block copolymer refers to any association between the MetAP 2 inhibitor and the block copolymer for example a diblock copolymer comprising a hydrophilic polymer moiety and a hydrophobic polymer moiety either by a direct linkage or an indirect linkage.

An indirect linkage includes an association between a MetAP 2 inhibitor and the block copolymer wherein said a MetAP 2 inhibitor and block copolymer are attached via a linker moiety e.g. they are not directly linked. Linker moieties include but are not limited to chemical linker moieties. In some embodiments a linker between the MetAP 2 inhibitor and the copolymer is formed by reacting the polymer and a linker selected e.g. from the group consisting of p nitrophenyl chloroformate carbonyldiimidazole CDI N N disuccinimidyl carbonate DSC cis aconitic anhydride and a mixture of these compounds.

A direct linkage includes any linkage wherein a linker moiety is not required. In one embodiment a direct linkage includes a chemical or a physical interaction wherein the two moieties i.e. the a MetAP 2 inhibitor and the block copolymer interact such that they are attracted to each other. Examples of direct interactions include covalent interactions non covalent interactions hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic e.g. electrostatic coulombic attraction ion dipole charge transfer Van der Waals or hydrogen bonding and chemical bonding including the formation of a covalent bond. Accordingly in one embodiment a MetAP 2 inhibitor such as TNP 470 and the block copolymer are not linked via a linker e.g. they are directly linked. In a further embodiment a MetAP 2 inhibitor and the block copolymer are electrostatically associated with each other.

In one embodiment the linker is a peptide linker. In another embodiment the peptide linker is enzymatically cleavable e.g. by a protease enzyme that cleaves the linkage to release the MetAP 2 inhibitor. Most preferably the peptide linkage is capable of being cleaved by preselected cellular enzymes for instance those found in lysosomes of cancerous cells or proliferating endothelial cells. Alternatively an acid hydrolysable linker could comprise an ester or amide linkage and be for instance a cis aconityl linkage. A pH sensitive linker can also be used. Cleavage of the linker of the conjugate results in release of active MetAP 2 inhibitor. Thus the MetAP 2 inhibitor must be conjugated with the polymer in a way that does not alter the activity of the agent. The linker preferably comprises at least one cleavable peptide bond. Preferably the linker is an enzyme cleavable oligopeptide group preferably comprising sufficient amino acid units to allow specific binding and cleavage by a selected cellular enzyme. Preferably the linker is at least two amino acids long more preferably at least three amino acids long. Cleavable linkers are described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7 332 523 which is incorporated herein by reference. An example of a preferred peptide linker is Gly Phe Leu Gly see U.S. Pat. No. 7 332 523 . Other linker are known to those of skill in the art.

The MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein is particularly useful in methods of treating conditions in which MetAP 2 activity is involved in or required for the pathology of the condition including but not necessarily limited to conditions in which MetAp 2 is either over expressed or over active in a mammal for example a human. Such conditions herein also referred to as a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder are selected from a group including but not necessarily limited to cancer angiogenic disease or disorder autoimmune or inflammatory disease or disorder ascites formation psoriasis age related macular degeneration uveitis thyroid hyperplasia preeclampsia rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis Alzheimer s disease obesity pleura effusion atherosclerosis endometriosis diabetic other retinopathies neovascular glaucoma age related macular degeneration hemangiomas and corneal neovascularization HIV HPV herpes and other viral infections anthrax IPF COPD multiple sclerosis other sclerotic diseases transplant rejection lupus asthma and other conditions described herein as associated with MetAP 2 activity.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is cancer where the cells are rapidly dividing neoplastic cancer cells and where the neoplastic cells require an efficient blood supply to maintain continued growth of the tumor. As used herein cancer refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of anaplastic cells that tend to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to new body sites and also refers to the pathological condition characterized by such malignant neoplastic growths. The blood vessels provide conduits to metastasize and spread elsewhere in the body. Upon arrival at the metastatic site the cancer cells then work on establishing a new blood supply network. Administration of a MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein is useful to inhibit proliferation at the primary disease site and in the case of cancer at secondary tumor sites embodiments of the invention serve to prevent and limit the progression of the disease. Any disease that requires a continuous proliferation of cells either primary cells endothelial cells adjacent cells or others in order to perpetuate the disease is a candidate target. For example candidates for the treatment of cancer as described herein include but are not limited to carcinomas and sarcomas found in the anus bladder bile duct bone brain breast cervix colon rectum endometrium esophagus eye gallbladder head and neck liver kidney larynx lung mediastinum chest mouth ovaries pancreas penis prostate skin small intestine stomach spinal marrow tailbone testicles thyroid and uterus. The types of carcinomas include papilloma carcinoma choriocarcinoma endodermal sinus tumor teratoma adenoma adenocarcinoma melanoma fibroma lipoma leiomyoma rhabdomyoma mesothelioma angioma osteoma chondroma glioma lymphoma leukemia squamous cell carcinoma small cell carcinoma large cell undifferentiated carcinomas basal cell carcinoma and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. The types of sarcomas include soft tissue sarcoma such as alveolar soft part sarcoma angiosarcoma dermatofibrosarcoma desmoid tumor desmoplastic small round cell tumor extraskeletal chondrosarcoma extraskeletal osteosarcoma fibrosarcoma hemangiopericytoma hemangiosarcoma Kaposi s sarcoma leiomyosarcoma liposarcoma lymphangiosarcoma lymphosarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma neurofibrosarcoma rhabdomyosarcoma synovial sarcoma and Askin s tumor Ewing s sarcoma primitive neuroectodermal tumor malignant hemangioendothelioma malignant schwannoma osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Abnormal build up and growth of blood vessels in the skin or internal organs in the form of hemangiomas can also be treated according to the methods described herein.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is age related macular degeneration. It is known that VEGF contributes to abnormal blood vessel growth from the choroid layer of the eye into the retina similar to what occurs during the wet or neovascular form of age related macular degeneration. Macular degeneration often called AMD or ARMD age related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss and blindness in Americans aged 65 and older. In order for new blood vessels to grow neovascularization beneath the retina and leak blood and fluid endothelial cells must proliferate. This proliferation is uneven and results in the leakage described above which causes permanent damage to light sensitive retinal cells which die off and create blind spots in central vision or the macula.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is diabetic retinopathy abnormal blood vessel growth associated with diabetic eye diseases. In diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity ROP VEGF is released which promotes blood vessel formation thus the disease or disorder is an angiogenic disease or disorder. Released by the retina light sensitive tissue in back of the eye when normal blood vessels are damaged by tiny blood clots due to diabetes VEGF turns on its receptor igniting a chain reaction that culminates in new blood vessel growth. However the backup blood vessels having proliferated too quickly and unevenly are faulty so they leak bleed and encourage scar tissue that detaches the retina resulting in severe loss of vision. Such growth is the hallmark of diabetic retinopathy the leading cause of blindness among young people in developed countries. In one embodiment the subject in need of treatment can be a mammal such as a dog or a cat preferably a human.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis RA is characterized by synovial tissue swelling leukocyte ingress and new blood vessel growth from existing vessels. The disease is thought to occur as an immunological response to an as yet unidentified antigen. The expansion of the synovial lining of joints in rheumatoid arthritis RA and the subsequent invasion by the pannus of underlying cartilage and bone necessitate an increase in the vascular supply to the synovium to cope with the increased requirement for oxygen and nutrients. Endothelial cell proliferation is now recognized as a key event in the formation and maintenance of the pannus in RA Paleolog E. M. 2002 . Thus RA is an angiogenesis related disease or disorder. Even in early RA some of the earliest histological observations are blood vessels. A mononuclear infiltrate characterizes the synovial tissue along with a luxuriant vasculature. Endothelial cell proliferation is integral to formation of the inflammatory pannus and without it leukocyte ingress could not occur Koch A. E. 2000 . Disruption of the formation of new blood vessels would not only prevent delivery of nutrients to the inflammatory site it could also reduce joint swelling due to the additional activity of VEGF a potent proangiogenic factor in RA as a vascular permeability factor.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is Alzheimer s disease. Alzheimer s disease AD is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD is characterized by an excessive cerebral amyloid deposition leading to degeneration of neurons and eventually to dementia. The exact cause of AD is still unknown. It has been shown by epidemiological studies that long term use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs statins histamine H2 receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers all of which are cardiovascular drugs with an anti proliferative effects seem to prevent Alzheimer s disease and or influence the outcome of AD patients. Therefore it has been speculated that in AD endothelial cell proliferation in the brain vasculature may play an important role in AD that is AD can be an angiogenesis related or mediated disease. In Alzheimer s disease the brain endothelium secretes the precursor substrate for the beta amyloid plaque and a neurotoxic peptide that selectively kills cortical neurons. Moreover amyloid deposition in the vasculature leads to endothelial cell apoptosis and endothelial cell activation which leads to neovascularization. Vessel formation could be blocked by the VEGF antagonist SU 4312 as well as by statins indicating that anti proliferative or anti angiogenic strategies can interfere with endothelial cell activation in AD Schultheiss C. el. al. 2006 Grammas P. et. al. 1999 and can be used for preventing and or treating AD.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is obesity. It has been shown that the MetAP 2 inhibitor TNP 470 was able to prevent diet induced and genetic obesity in mice Ebba Br kenhielm et. al. Circulation Research 2004 94 1579 . TNP 470 reduced vascularity in the adipose tissue thereby inhibiting the rate of growth of the adipose tissue and obesity development. Obesity is thus an angiogenesis related or mediated disease or disorder.

In one embodiment a MetAP 2 dependent disease or disorder is endometriosis. Excessive endometrial angiogenesis is proposed as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of endometriosis Healy D L. et. al. 1998 . The endometrium of patients with endometriosis shows enhanced endothelial cell proliferation. Moreover there is an elevated expression of the cell adhesion molecule integrin v 3 in more blood vessels in the endometrium of women with endometriosis when compared with normal women. Strategies that inhibit endothelial cell proliferation can be used to treat endometriosis.

The MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein is particularly useful in methods of inhibiting cell proliferation including angiogenesis at a site of tumorigenesis in a mammaland proliferation of T cells. The MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein administered at such sites and in such varied ways prevents or inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation at the site thereby inhibiting the development and growth of the tumor. The MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein can also be administered at inflammation sites and in such varied ways prevents or inhibits proliferation of T cells and for the suppression of T cell differentiation.

In some embodiments the compositions as disclosed herein comprise a MetAP 2 inhibitor that inhibits proliferation of blood vessel endothelial cells thus having anti angiogenesis effect or inhibition of angiogenesis. Accordingly the compositions as disclosed herein comprising MetAP 2 inhibitors can be used in methods for treating angiogenesis mediated conditions in which MetAP 2 is involved in the pathology such as inhibiting growth and metastasis of cancer as well as treating other various diseases where inappropriate angiogenesis occurs or proliferation of blood vessel endothelial cells occur for example but not limited to inflammatory diseases autoimmune diseases diabetic retinopathy rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Accordingly the compositions comprising MetAP 2 inhibitors as disclosed herein can be used as a cancer metastasis inhibitor or therapeutic agent against cancer autoimmune or inflammatory diseases uveitis diabetic retinopathy rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and other retinopathies such as retinopathy of prematurity.

Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions as described herein can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound s which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular subject or patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the particular MetAP 2 inhibitor the type of administration composition i.e. tablet versus liquid oral administration versus ocular versus topical versus inhaled for example the severity of the condition being treated and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated.

The phrase therapeutically effective amount of a compound e.g. a MetAP 2 inhibitor as described herein means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders at a reasonable benefit risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood however that the total daily usage of the compositions and formulations as disclosed herein will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. A therapeutically effective amount as the term is used herein need not eradicate a disease. Rather a therapeutically effective amount will at least slow progression of a disease as non limiting example the growth of a tumor or neoplasm relative to progression without the therapeutic agent for example the composition as disclosed herein comprising a MetAP 2 block copolymer conjugate. Thus it is preferred but not required that the therapeutic agent actually eliminate the disease.

The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder activity of the specific compound employed the specific composition employed the age body weight general health sex and diet of the patient the time of administration route of administration and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed the duration of the treatment drugs used in combination or coincidental with the compositions and formulations as disclosed herein which are employed and like factors well known in the medical arts. For example it is well within the skill of the art to either start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved or start doses of the compound at high levels and to gradually decrease the dosage until the desired effect is achieved as appropriate for the care of the individual patient.

The compositions as disclosed herein can also be administered in prophylactically or therapeutically effective amounts. The formulations and compositions as disclosed herein can be administered along with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A prophylactically or therapeutically effective amount means that amount necessary at least partly to attain the desired effect or to delay the onset of inhibit the progression of or halt altogether the onset or progression of the particular disease or disorder being treated. Such amounts will depend of course on the particular condition being treated the severity of the condition and individual patient parameters including age physical condition size weight and concurrent treatment. These factors are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art and can be addressed with no more than routine experimentation. It is preferred generally that a maximum dose be used that is the highest safe dose according to sound medical judgment. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art however that a lower dose or tolerable dose can be administered for medical reasons psychological reasons or for virtually any other reasons.

The term effective amount as used herein refers to the amount of therapeutic agent of pharmaceutical composition to alleviate at least some of the symptoms of the disease or disorder. The term effective amount includes within its meaning a sufficient amount of pharmacological composition to provide the desired effect. The exact amount required will vary depending on factors such as the type of disease or disorder to be treated the severity of the disease or disorder the potential drug resistance level of the disease or disorder the species being treated the age and general condition of the subject the mode of administration and so forth. Thus it is not possible to specify the exact effective amount . However for any given case an appropriate effective amount can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.

Efficacy of treatment can be judged by an ordinarily skilled practitioner. As disclosed in the Examples efficacy can be assessed in animal models of disease or disorder for example treatment of a rodent with a model disease or disorder and any treatment or administration of the compositions or formulations that leads to a decrease of at least one symptom of the disease or disorder for example an inhibition or reduction in the indicia of uveitis in the model described herein indicates effective treatment.

In addition the amount of each component to be administered also depends upon the frequency of administration such as whether administration is once a day twice a day 3 times a day or 4 times a day once a week or several times a week for example 2 or 3 or 4 times a week.

As an example only TNP 470 administration will be described in greater detail as a representative example of the administration procedures for all MetAP 2 inhibitors in general. For 6 O N chloroacetylcarbamoyl fumagillol TNP 470 the following information may serve as a general guideline for administration. Usually the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein are administered from once a day to several times a day for example 2 times a day three times a day or four times a day. In alternative embodiments the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein can be administered for example three to five times a week if it is to be plurally administered in a given week. In some modes of administration e.g. IV administration it is desirable to dose less frequently e.g. weekly or biweekly block copolymer conjugate compounds can be useful in such a regimen.

For example in one embodiment a suitable dose of the MetAP 2 inhibitor in the formulations and compositions as disclosed herein for a subject in need of treatment can be used according to conventionally used dose ranges of about 1 mg to about 2000 mg TNP 470 equivalent per kilogram of body weight. Generally however conventional doses of fumagillol derivatives are about 0.1 mg kg to 40 mg kg body weight preferably about 0.5 mg kg to 20 mg kg body weight as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 290 807. In alternative embodiments where maintenance of suppression of disease or disorder is the goal e. g. autoimmune or inflammatory disease or disorder a dose below the threshold used for immunosuppressive therapy or chemotherapy for the initial treatment of acute disease can be used. For example a suitable dose could be less than the conventionally used chemotherapeutic dose for example dose ranges of about 1 g to 1 mg or 0.1 g to 1 mg or 1 mg to 10 mg TNP 470 per kilogram of body weight can be used.

In some embodiments if TNP 470 is administered once a week it can be administered in an amount of from about 20 to about 200 mg m week preferably in an amount of from about 40 to about 180 mg m week and most preferably in an amount of from about 135 to about 175 mg m week. In some embodiments if TNP 470 is administered daily it may be administered in an amount of from about 1 to about 10 mg m day for example in an amount of from about 1.25 to about 5 mg m day or in an amount of from about 1 to about 3 mg m day. For continuous administration the component is usually administered for at least five consecutive days of the week. In some embodiments the effective amount of a composition as disclosed herein comprising a fumagillol derivative can be determined using an anti angiogenesis assay as disclosed herein and in some embodiments the effective amount is less than the amount used as the conventionally effective dose. Alternatively where applied to an autoimmune disease for example a cytokine release array e. g. an ELISA can be used to determine the dose at which inhibition of T cells cytokine occurs. Similar dosage regimes can be applied for formulations of other MetAP 2 inhibitor compositions as disclosed herein.

In an alternative embodiment higher dosages can be used provided there is not unacceptable toxicity. For example dosages in the range of about 50 to about 500 mg m week or more and sub ranges within this range are specifically contemplated. Thus dosages in the range of about 120 to 350 mg m week 200 to 400 mg m week etc. are specifically contemplated.

For the avoidance of doubt one can use any of a number of in vitro or in vivo assays to evaluate the influence of a given agent on proliferation or angiogenesis. Whether or not a composition or formulation comprising a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate in accordance with the present invention can treat or prevent diseases associated with an angiogenesis mediated condition can be determined by its effect in the mouse model as shown in the Examples below. However at a minimum a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer as described herein will have anti proliferative activity i.e. at least 50 of the anti proliferative activity of TNP 470 in a HUVEC assay as described in the Examples herein.

Another useful assay for determining if the compositions and formulations has disclosed herein have anti proliferative or anti angiogenesis activity is the CAM assay which is frequently used to evaluate the effects of endothelial cell proliferation regulating factors because it is relatively easy and provides relatively rapid results. A proliferation regulating factor useful in the methods and compositions described herein will modify the number of microvessels in the modified CAM assay described by Iruela Arispe et al. 1999 Circulation 100 1423 1431. The method is based on the vertical growth of new capillary vessels into a collagen gel pellet placed on the CAM. In the assay as described by Iruela Arispe et al. the collagen gel is supplemented with a proliferative factor such as FGF 2 50 ng gel or VEGF 250 ng gel in the presence or absence of test agents. The extent of the proliferative response is measured using FITC dextran 50 g mL Sigma injected into the circulation of the CAM. The degree of fluorescence intensity parallels variations in capillary density the linearity of this correlation can be observed with a range of capillaries between 5 and 540. Morphometric analyses are performed for example by acquisition of images with a CCD camera. Images are then analyzed by imported into an analysis package e.g. NHImage 1.59 and measurements of fluorescence intensity are obtained as positive pixels. Each data point is compared with its own positive and negative controls present in the same CAM and interpreted as a percentage of inhibition considering the positive control to be 100 VEGF or FGF 2 alone and the negative control vehicle alone 0 . Statistical evaluation of the data is performed to check whether groups differ significantly from random e.g. by analysis of contingency with Yates correction.

Additional proliferative assays including additional assays specifically designed to monitor angiogenic proliferation are known in the art and can be used to evaluate MetAP 2 inhibitors for use in the methods and compositions described herein. These include for example the corneal micropocket assay hamster cheek pouch assay the Matrigel assay and modifications thereof and co culture assays. Donovan et al. describe a comparison of three different in vitro assays developed to evaluate angiogenesis regulators in a human background Donovan et al. 2001 Angiogenesis 4 113 121 incorporated herein by reference . Briefly the assays examined include 1 a basic Matrigel assay in which low passage human endothelial cells Human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC are plated in wells coated with Matrigel Becton Dickinson Cedex France with or without angiogenesis regulator s 2 a similar Matrigel assay using growth factor reduced or GFR Matrigel and 3 a co culture assay in which primary human fibroblasts and HUVEC are co cultured with or without additional angiogenesis regulator s the fibroblasts produce extracellular matrix and other factors that support HUVEC differentiation and tubule formation. In the Donovan et al. paper the co culture assay provided microvessel networks that most closely resembled microvessel networks in vivo. However the basic Matrigel assay and the GFR Matrigel assay can also be used by one of skill in the art to evaluate whether a given fumagillol derivative is an angiogenesis inhibiting agent as necessary for the methods and compositions described herein. Finally an in vitro angiogenesis assay kit is marketed by Chemicon Millipore . The Fibrin Gel In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay Kit is Chemicon Catalog No. ECM630.

Other proliferative assays are disclosed in International Application No WO2003 086178 and U.S. Patent Applications US2005 0203013 and US2005 0112063 and involve assaying endothelial cells on a permeable substrate e.g. a collagen coated inserts of Transwells contacting the assay with a test compound e.g. a fumagillol derivative block copolymer conjugate treating the assay with a marker e.g. FITC label and a permeability inducing agent e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and platelet activating factor PAP among others and measuring the rate of diffusion of the marker compare to control. Compounds that are found to affect vascular permeability can be further tested for anti proliferative activity using existing methods. The bioeffectiveness of MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate as an anti proliferative or angiogenic agent in a patient being treated with such a block copolymer conjugate can be assessed by methods commonly known by person skilled in the art for example as disclosed in International Application No WO2003 086178 and U.S. Patent Applications US2005 0203013 and US2005 0112063. One approach involves administering to the patient an intradermal injection of histamine before treating the subject with the a MetAP 2 block copolymer conjugate and measuring a histamine induced local edema. Then treating the subject with the a MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate and again administering to the subject an intradermal injection of histamine subsequent to treating the subject with the MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate and measuring the histamine induced local edema. A decrease in the measurement of the histamine induced local edema compared to that seen before the treatment with the MetAP 2 inhibitor block copolymer conjugate indicates that the compound is bioeffective.

Compositions or formulations as disclosed herein capable of preventing or treating non proliferative diabetic retinopathy can be tested by in vitro studies of endothelial cell proliferation and in other models of diabetic retinopathy such as Streptozotocin. In addition color Doppler imaging can be used to evaluate the action of a drug in ocular pathology Valli et al. Ophthalmologica 209 13 115 121 1995 . Color Doppler imaging is a recent advance in ulkasonography allowing simultaneous two dimension imaging of structures and the evaluation of blood flow. Accordingly retinopathy can be analyzed using such technology. The manner in which the compositions and formulations as disclosed herein are administered is dependent in part upon whether the treatment of a disease associated with vascular hyperpermeability including non proliferative retinopathy is prophylactic or therapeutic. For example the manner in which compositions and formulations as disclosed herein are administered for treatment of retinopathy is dependent in part upon the cause of the retinopathy. Specifically given that diabetes is the leading cause of retinopathy the compositions and formulations as disclosed herein can be administered preventatively as soon as the pre diabetic retinopathy state is detected.

Compositions or formulations as disclosed herein can be tested for activity against autoimmune disease or inflammation in standard models of MS or EAU for uveitis described herein in the example that follows.

mPEG PLA methoxy poly ethylene glycol poly lactic acid Suc succinated EDC ethyl diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide NHS N hydroxysuccinimide en ethylenamine DDW Double distilled water DMF Dimethylformamide DMSO Dimethyl sulfoxide.

All animal procedures were performed in compliance with Boston Children s Hospital guidelines and protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Aqueous solubility is one of the important chemical properties affecting oral absorption of a drug. In order to predict the intestinal absorption of TNP 470 we measured its Log D value which is a parameter of hydrophobicity determined by the ratio of drug concentration in octanol to that in water at 25 C. Analiza Cleveland Ohio . High Log D values 2 indicate low water solubility and hence a poor oral availability of a drug. For this study Log D values of TNP 470 30 mM were measured at plasma and stomach pHs pH 7.4 and pH 2 respectively.

A known MetAP 2 inhibitor TNP 470 Takeda was chosen for its activity hydrophobicity and poor pharmacokinetic profile see Placidi Cancer Res. 55 3036 3042 1995 and was bound to a diblock co polymer using a two step conjugation . In the first step succinated monomethoxy poly ethylene glycol poly lactic acid mPEG2000 PLA1000 with free carboxic acid end groups Advanced Polymers Materials Inc. was reacted with ethylenediamine Sigma Aldrich . Succinated mPEG b PLA OOCCH2CH2COOH 500 mg was dissolved in DMSO and reacted with ethyl diethylaminopropyl carbodiimide EDC and N hydroxysuccinimide NHS in a molar ratio of 1 10 20 Polymer EDC NHS respectively . In an alternative approach the same amount of succinated mPEG b PLA OOCCH2CH2COOH is dissolved in 10 ml MES buffer at pH 6 and the catalyst is N hydroxysuccinimide sulfo NHS . A five fold molar excess of ethylendiamine was added and reacted for 4 h at 25 C. The polymer solution was then dialyzed MWCO 1000 Spectra Por Biotech Regenerated Cellulose VWR against DMSO leading to a 65 reaction efficiency. In the second step the amine containing polymer was mixed with TNP 470 350 gr dissolved in DMSO and the solution was stirred for 4 h at 25 C. The polymeric micelles were formed by dialyzing the DMSO solution of the conjugate against double distilled water using a regenerated cellulose dialysis bag MWCO 1000 Spectra Por Biotech Regenerated Cellulose VWR to obtain micelles with high incorporation efficiency 90 and 0.8 1 free drug w w . The micelles were then lyophilized and stored at 20 C. in a dry environment until use.

Rhodamine labeled polymeric micelles were formed using a similar protocol. The mPEG PLA was conjugated via the N terminal amine group with Lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. in DMSO. For green fluorescent polymer micelles a commonly used hydrophobic marker 6 coumarin Sigma Aldrich MO USA at 0.1 w w was added to the polymeric solution before the final dialysis step.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance NMR spectrometer analysis NERCE BEID Harvard Medical School was conducted for each reaction step and Mass spectrometry Proteomic core Harvard Medical School was performed on the conjugate. In order to evaluate the efficiency of ethylendiamine binding to mPEG PLA first reaction step and TNP 470 binding to the polymer via the amine second step we used the colorimetric amine detection reagent 2 4 6 Trinitrobenozene Sulfonic Acid TNBSA Pierce Rockford Ill. was used. TNBSA reacts with primary amines to produce a yellow product whose intensity was measured at 450 nm. To calculate amine concentration in the polymer a linear calibration curve of amino acid was used. To measure TNP 470 loading into polymeric micelles we incubated 10 mg ml Lodamin in 500 l NaOH 0.1 N to accelerate PLA degradation. After an overnight incubation with shaking 100 r.p.m at 37 C. we added Acetonitrile to the samples 1 1 NaOH Acetonitrile and analyzed for TNP 470 concentration. TNP 470 concentration was measured using a high performance liquid chromatography system HPLC System Gold Microbore Beckman Coulter . A 20 l portion of each sample was injected into a Nova pak C18 column 3.9 150 mm i.d. Waters and analyzed using a calibration curve of TNP 470. TNP 470 binding to amine was also measured using TNBSA reagent and was confirmed by subtracting the non bound drug from the total drug added to the reaction.

The first step of ethylenediamine binding to the polymer and the second step of TNP470 conjugation reaction through the free amine were further verified using 2 4 6 Trinitrobenozene Sulfonic Acid TNBSA reagent Pierce Rockford Ill. . TNBSA is a sensitive assay reagent which can couple to free amino groups and form a highly chromogenic derivate. The reaction was carried out after the addition of 0.01 w v TNBSA in 0.1M Sodium bicarbonate buffer. A series of PEG PLA polymer concentrations before and after TNP 470 conjugation were allowed to react for 2 hr in 37 C. with TNBSA and the yellow color was measured using a plate reader.

The correlation between the molar amine concentration and color absorption at 450 nm was determined according to a standard curve done for aspartic acid.

Murine Lewis lung carcinoma LLC and B16 F10 melanoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection ATCC Manassas Va. USA . Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial cells HUVEC were purchased from Cambrex USA . The cells were grown and maintained in medium as recommended by the manufacturers. Dulbecco s Modified Eagle s Medium with 10 fetal bovine serum was used for tumor cells and EMB 2 Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville Inc. containing 2 fetal bovine serum and EGM 2 supplements was used for HUVEC.

HUVEC were exposed to different concentrations of Lodamin equivalent to 50 1 000 nM free TNP 470 0.12 2.4 mg ml micelles and incubated in a low serum medium for 48 h at 37 C. To rule out a possible cytotoxic effect of the carrier empty micelles were added to HUVECs as a control 4.8 mg ml . A WST 1 proliferation assay Roche Diagnostics was used. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of formazan absorbance at 450 nm of treated versus untreated cells. Data were derived from quadruplicate samples in two separate experiments. The effect of Lodamin 60 nM TNP 470 equivalent q.o.d. on HUVEC growth rate was evaluated by daily counting of HUVEC cells up to 5 d and compared to the number of untreated cells or cells treated with Vehicle same concentration as Lodamin .

To evaluate the uptake of polymeric micelles by HUVEC 6 coumarin labeled PEG PLA micelles or rhodamine conjugated to mPEG PLA were used. HUVEC were seeded in a 24 well plate 2 10per well in EGM 2 medium Cambrex and were allowed to attach overnight. Fluorescent labeled micelles 10 mg ml were suspended over a bath sonicator for 5 min and 20 l of the suspension was added to the cultured cells. After the designated time points 20 min 2 4 7 and 24 h the cells were washed three times with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry or alternatively fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde. For confocal microscopy cells were mounted using DAPI containing Vectashild Vector Laboratories Burlingame Calif. . Optical sections were scanned using Leica TCS SP2 AOBS a 40 objective equipped with 488 nm argon 543 nm HeNe and 405 nm diode lasers. To study Lodamin internalization into endothelial cells confocal microscopy was used to co localize 6 coumarin labeled polymeric micelles with endo lysozome. Live HUVEC cells were imaged in different time points after addition of labeled micelles to cell media 15 g ml up to 1 h. At this point LysoTracker Red Molecular Probes Eugene Oreg. was added to the medium for the detection of acidic intracellular vesicles Endosomes and Lysosomes. After 20 min of incubation cells were imaged by confocal using optical sections with 488 nm argon 543 nm HeNe and 405 nm diode lasers.

To further verify that polymeric micelle internalization occurs through endocytosis cell uptake was measured in cold conditions 4 C. in comparison to cell uptake at 37 C. HUVEC were plated at a concentration of 15 000 cells ml in two 24 well plates for 24 h. Fluorescent labeled polymeric micelles 15 g ml were added and incubated at different time points 20 30 40 and 60 min n 3 in cold room 4 C. and in 37 C. After the designated time points the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and lysed with 100 l lysis buffer BD Biosciences . Cell extracts were measured for fluorescent signal in a Wallac 1420 VICTOR plate reader Perkin Elmer Life Sciences with excitation emission at 488 nm 530 nm.

In order to study the morphology of MetAP 2 inhibitor polymersomes Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM images were taken at the day of preparation and one week post preparation. Polymer micelles dispersed in double distilled water were imaged with cryo TEM JEOL 2100 TEM Harvard University CNS .

To study the kinetic release of TNP 470 Lodamin 20 mg was incubated with either 1 ml PBS pH 7.4 or simulated gastric fluid HCL ddw pH 1.2 . Every few days supernatant was taken and analyzed for TNP 470 concentration and a cumulative release graph of TNP 470 was determined. TNP 470 concentration was measured using HPLC. TNP 470 was detected as a peak at 6 min with 50 acetonitrile in water at the mobile phase. The flow rate was 1 ml min and the detection was monitored at 210 nm wavelength.

The average size and size distribution of polymeric micelles were determined by Dynamic Light Scatterer DLS DynaPro Wyatt Technology . The measurements were done at 25 C. using Dynamic V6 software. Lodamin TNP 470 polymersomes at 1.5 or 2 mg ml dispersed in double distilled water were measured by 20 successive readings with DLS. Micelles size was also measured after 24 hr to evaluate their structural stability.

Animal procedures were performed in the animal facility at Children s Hospital. Eight week old male C57BL 6 mice Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor Mass. were injected subcutaneously with 1 10Lewis Lung Carcinoma cells LLC at the back. When tumors reached a volume of 100 mmthe mice were divided into 5 groups and treated every day for 12 days with TNP 470 polymeric micelles administrated orally using a gavage needle. Different doses of polymersomes were given daily 15 mg kg 5 mice 30 mg kg 3 mice and 60 mg kg 1 mice TNP 470 equivalent respectively 5 10 20 mg polymeric drug per mouse respectively . The control groups were five mice that were given the same dose of polymersomes without the drug and five mice that were given drinking water.

Every two days the weight of the mice was monitored and tumors dimensions were measured using a caliper. Tumor volume was calculated according to an ellipsoid formula.

A non invasive IVIS 200 in vivo imaging system Xenogen system 3.0 was used in order to track the polymeric micelles labeled with fluorescent marker in a manner similar to the cell uptake study. Fluorescent polymersomes were given orally to three nude mice the mice were anesthetized using an Isofluran chamber and images were taken after different time periods. All the images were taken under identical conditions.

In order to evaluate the antiangiogenic properties of Lodamin the corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay was performed as previously detailed. Pellets containing 80 ng carrier free recombinant human bFGF or 160 ng VEGF R D Systems Minneapolis Minn. were implanted into micropockets created in the cornea of anesthetized mice. Mice were treated daily with 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent of Lodamin for 6 d and then the vascular growth area was measured using a slit lamp. The area of neovascularization was calculated as vessel area by the product of vessel length measured from the limbus and clock hours around the cornea using the following equation Vessel area mm2 clock hours vessel length mm 0.2 mm .

For all biodistribution studies we used a fluorescent marker for tracking Lodamin. Mice were administered 6 coumarin labeled mPEG PLA by oral gavage for 3 d 100 l of 1.5 mg ml . On the third day of treatment after 8 h of fasting animals were sacrificed and spleen kidney brain lungs liver intestine stomach and bladder were collected. The fluorescent 6 coumarin was extracted from the tissues by incubation with formamide for 48 h at 25 C. Samples were centrifuged and signal intensity of fluorescence of supernatants was detected with a Wallac 1420 VICTOR plate reader Perkin Elmer Life Sciences with excitation emission at 488 nm 530 nm. The results were normalized to protein levels in the corresponding tissues. Tissue auto fluorescence was corrected by subtracting the fluorescent signal of non treated mouse organs from the respective readings in treated mice. Similarly levels of fluorescent signal in mouse sera were measured in different time points 1 2 4 8 24 48 and 72 h using excitation emission readings at 488 nm 530 nm.

In order to analyze cell uptake in the different tissues in tumor bearing mice PEG PLA rhodamine micelles 100 l of 1.5 mg ml or water were orally administered to C57Bl 6J mice bearing LLC tumors 200 mm for 3 d. Organs were removed incubated for 50 min in collagenase Liberase Blendzyme 3 Roche Diagnostics Corp. IN in 37 C. to obtain a single cell suspension. These suspensions were analyzed by flow cytometry in order to quantify the uptake of micelles into different tissue cells when compared to those in the untreated mouse.

In order to evaluate intestinal absorption mPEG PLA rhodamine micelles were orally administered to C57Bl 6J mice after 8 h of food fasting. After 2 h mice were sacrificed and 2.5 cm segments of the small intestine were removed washed and analyzed by histology and confocal microscopy. The rhodamine labeled polymeric micelles were detected by confocal microscopy Leica TCS SP2 AOBS with a 488 nm argon laser line. Actin filaments were stained with phalloidin FITC Sigma and nuclei were stained by DAPI Sigma . To further study the uptake of Lodamin in the intestine high resolution images were imaged with cryo TEM. Intestines from treated as above and untreated mice were excised and immersed immediately in a freshly prepared 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS pH 7.4 for 2 h at 25 C. The samples were washed in PBS transferred to a 30 sucrose solution overnight at 4 C. and embedded in OCT and kept at 80 C. until processing. Fifteen sections with 10 m each were prepared and processed for Confocal microscopy or TEM. Four TEM samples were fixed for 30 min in freshly prepared 2 paraformaldehyde 2.5 glutaraldehyde 0.025 CaClin 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer pH 7.4 and subsequently postfixed for 30 min in 1 osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sym collidine buffer pH 7.4 at 25 C. stained en bloc in 2 uranyl acetate dehydrated and embedded under inverted plastic capsules. Samples were snapped free of the glass coverslips by a cycle of rapid freezing and thawing. Thin sections were cut en face with diamond knives using a LEICA UCT Ultramicrotome. Specimens were examined using a JEOL 2100 TEM.

To exclude tissue toxicity histological analysis H E of liver intestine lung and kidneys was conducted Beth Israel pathology department BIDMC . To further exclude liver toxicity we analyzed serum levels of liver enzymes ALT AST Done at Shriners Burns Hospital Boston Mass. . These studies were performed on 20 d long Lodamin treated mice 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent q.d. and compared to untreated mice n 3 4 .

Animal procedures were performed in the animal facility at Children s Hospital Boston using 8 week old C57Bl 6J male mice Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor Me. .

For tumor experiments LLC cells 1 10 or B16 F10 melanoma cells 1 10 were implanted subcutaneously in 8 week old C57Bl 6J male mice Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor Me. . Oral availability of free TNP 470 was compared to that of Lodamin. A dose of 30 mg kg q.o.d. of free TNP 470 and an equivalent dose of Lodamin Lodamin 6 mg in 100 l d were administered to LLC tumor bearing mice 100 mm and tumor growth was followed for 18 d. Free drug was given as a suspension in double distilled water and freshly prepared before each dose. Additionally we compared different doses and frequencies of Lodamin treatment 15 mg kg q.d. 15 mg kg q.o.d. and 30 mg kg q.o.d. To eliminate any possible effect of the vehicle polymer without drug one group of mice was given micelles without drug and tumor progression was compared to water treated mice.

For the melanoma tumor experiment a dose of 15 mg kg q.d. Lodamin was administered to B16 F10 melanoma bearing mice. In all experiments tumor size and animal weight were monitored every 2 d. Tumor volume was measured with calipers in two diameters as follows width length 0.52. Note that all the above Lodamin doses are presented as TNP 470 equivalent.

To examine the effect of oral Lodamin treatment on metastasis development and prevention liver metastases were generated by spleen injection. C57Bl 6J mice n 14 were anaesthetized with Isoflurane and prepared for surgery. A small abdominal incision was made in the left flank and the spleen was isolated. B16 F10 tumor cells in suspension 50 l 5 105 in DMEM medium without serum were injected into the spleen with a 30 gauge needle and the spleen was returned to the abdominal cavity. The wound was closed with stitches and metal clips. After 2 d mice were divided into two groups one was treated daily with oral Lodamin 15 mg kg using gavage and the second group was administered water by gavage. After 20 d we terminated the experiment. Mice were killed and autopsied livers and spleens were removed by surgical dissection imaged and histology was carried out. Liver and spleen tissues were stained with Hematoxylin Eosin to evaluate tissue morphology and detect metastasis. Immunohistochemistry was carried out to specifically detect B16 F10 cells in the liver using anti mouse melanoma antibody HMB45 abCAM and using DAB staining

A slightly modified balance beam motor coordination test was performed on three groups of mice Oral Lodamin treated mice 30 mg kg eq. q.o.d. free TNP 470 30 mg kg subcutaneously injected mice and water treated mice administered by gavage . The mice were pretreated for 14 d n 4 5 per group and then the mice were allowed to acclimate to the procedure room for 1 h after which they were trained in 3 trials to cross a wide 20 mm width 1 m length balance beam. All the mice crossed the wide beam without making foot slip errors. The mice were then trained on a narrow 4 mm width 1 m length beam for 3 trials. At the end of the training trials no freezing behavior was observed and the mice would start to walk within 4 seconds of being placed on the beam. The mice were then videotaped as they performed in 3 test trials of 3 beam crossings each a total of 9 crossings per mouse. The 3 trials were separated by at least 1 h to avoid fatigue of the mice. Videotaped crossings were scored for number of foot slip errors and time to cross. All experiments and scoring of the different groups were performed by an investigator who has been no knowledge regarding the treatment regime of the mice.

Histologic evaluation of tissue was performed on 8 m thick frozen sections of LLC tumors that were removed from two random Lodamin treated or untreated mice 14 d post treatment 15 mg kg q.d.

Block copolymer micelles polymersomes have been proposed for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs with low aqueous solubility such as Paclitaxel . The amphiphilic nature of diblock copolymers such as poly lactide poly ethylene glycol PLA PEG enables the formation of micelles in aqueous media. In an aqueous environment the diblock copolymer is self assembled into a structure of hydrophobic core formed by the association of the hydrophobic polymer and the drug and a hydrophilic shell formed by the hydrophilic polymer commonly PEG.

Block copolymers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4 745 160 which is incorporated herein by reference have been used form water insoluble amphiphilic non crosslinked linear branched or graft block copolymers having polyethylene glycol as the hydrophilic component and poly D L or D L lactic acids as the hydrophobic components.

Block copolymers as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5 543 158 which is incorporated herein by reference have been described to form nanoparticles or microparticles that are solid particles that are suspended in water that are formed from a water insoluble block copolymer consisting essentially of poly alkylene glycol and poly lactic acid . The molecular weight of the block copolymer is high and the copolymer is insoluble in water. In the nanoparticle or microparticle the biodegradable moieties of the copolymer are in the core of the nanoparticle or microparticle and the poly alkylene glycol moieties are on the surface of the nanoparticle or microparticle in an amount effective enough to decrease uptake of the nanoparticle or microparticle by the reticuloendothelial system. Nanoparticles are prepared by dissolving the block copolymer and drug in an organic solvent forming an oil and water emulsion by sonication or stirring and collecting the nanoparticles containing the drug following precipitation. It does not provide for the solubilization of hydrophobic drugs.

The inventors demonstrate that MetAP 2 inhibitor TNP 470 was successfully conjugated to a modified PEG PLA polymer through its amine and formed nano size polymersomes. A schematic diagram of the conjugation process is shown in . Step I demonstrates the reaction between succinated mPEG PLA and ethylendiamine that results in an amine terminated polymer. Step II demonstrates the reaction between the amine reactive polymer and the terminal chlorine of TNP 470. The conjugate is then dialyzed against water in an excess of TNP 470 to form polymeric micelles. The inventors demonstrate using images taken by TEM that spherical micelles were formed and size measurement with DLS showed a low range of size distribution around 10 nanometers. By using confocal microscopy images of fluorescent labeled polymersomes the inventors demonstrate rapid uptake by Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells HUVECs and when TNP 470 polymersomes were added a significant inhibition of HUVECs proliferation was shown as compared to no effect of the carrier itself .

In vivo studies done on mice showed a significant inhibition of subcutaneous Lewis Lung Carcinoma tumors with C57 BL mice given a daily oral administration of TNP470 micelles. A dose of 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent showed 63 inhibition without any weight loss to the mice.

NMR results from the different reaction steps are shown in . The results show the binding of the ethylendiamine through the carboxic acid group at the original polymer and the TNP 470 binding to the polymer through the amine.

To further verify the binding of TNP 470 to the modified PEG PLA through the amine in the polymer and the terminal chlorine in the drug a TNBSA reagent reaction for the detection of free amino groups was performed. According to the results the polymer was saturated with ethylendiamine. Correlation between molar amine groups in the modified polymer and absorption in 450 nm were determined by a theoretical value from a standard curve done for aspartic acid not shown . Moreover after TNP 470 conjugation no free amines were detected indicating that the polymer was saturated with TNP 470 conjugated through the amine group at the polymer.

In order to study the morphology of TNP 470 micelles Transmission Electron Microscopy TEM images were taken at the day of preparation data not shown .

Polymersomes dispersed in double distilled water were imaged with cryo TEM JEOL 2100 TEM Harvard university CNS . The images show that the self assembled polymersomes had a uniform spherical morphology.

The effect of different concentrations of TNP 470 polymersomes on the proliferation of HUVECs was evaluated using a WST 1 reagent. shows the inhibition in proliferation after 48 hr of incubation. shows the effect of TNP 470 micelles and shows the effect of micelles without drug on HUVECs. A significant inhibition of HUVEC proliferation was detected from 0.3 mg ml and up to 2.4 mg ml micelles which are 62.5 nM 1000 nM TNP 470 equivalent 88 and 95 inhibition respectively . The same concentrations of polymeric micelles without TNP 470 as well as double concentration 4.8 mg ml showed no significant effect on HIJVEC proliferation.

In order to evaluate the kinetics of polymersomes uptake by HUVECs in in vitro condition HUVECs were incubated with fluorescent polymersomes washed and imaged by confocal microscopy. HUVECs were incubated with the micelles for 20 min 4 hr and 24 hr. After 20 min. micelles were already uptaken by the cells and located at the cytoplasm data not shown . After 2 hr 4 hr 7 hr and 24 hr the uptake increased and the micelles were detected as concentrated spots inside cell cytoplasm data not shown .

C57 BL mice bearing s.c LLC tumors showed inhibition in tumor growth when treated with PEG PLA TNP 470 micelles given orally. All doses showed a significant effect already after 14 days of daily treatment as shown in . The controlled groups had to be scarified on day 14 and the treatment continued up to day 18. The lowest dose 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent showed a significant inhibition of tumor growth 63 after 14 days p

The non invasive Xenogen system was used to track the absorption kinetics of the polymersomes after oral administration. The micelles were concentrated at the gastrointestinal tract within 10 min post administration GI track data not shown . Apparently the absorption was rapid and after 1 hr fluorescent signal was found near the bladder and the prostate glands. After 24 hr the signal was still detectable.

In an effort to predict the oral availability of TNP 470 the hydrophobicity of Lodamin was measured using log D parameter. The measured Log D values were 2.39 at pH 2 and 2.57 at pH 7.4. The high Log D values 2 indicate a very low solubility in water. This property indicates that the designed Lodamin had with improved solubility and oral availability.

The formulation of Lodamin and the conjugation of TNP 470 are described in detail in the Methods. The chemical and physical properties of Lodamin were characterized. First the binding of TNP 470 to mPEG PLA was confirmed by H NMR data not shown and mass spectrometry showing an average m z of 3687 for mPEG PLA TNP 470. demonstrates the reaction of Lodamin preparation. Using amine detection reagent the incorporation efficiency of ethylenediamine to mPEG PLA was determined as 65 and in the second step TNP 470 was shown to be bound in high efficiency of 90 . Lodamin contained 0.8 1 w w free TNP 470 as determined HPLC. The average size and size distribution of Lodamin was determined by a DLS on the day of preparation and after 10 d of incubation in aqueous medium to evaluate Lodamin stability n 4 . The majority of micelles 90 at day of preparation were 7.8 8 nm in diameter with a small population of larger particles 200 400 nm . The size remained almost unchanged after 10 days.

The morphology of Lodamin was characterized by TEM. . The images showed that the polymeric micelles had acquired a uniform spherical structure which remained stable after two weeks of incubation in water at 37 C. Since the drug is located in the PLA core of the micelle structure and PLA is spontaneously hydrolyzed in an aqueous environment we studied the release kinetics of TNP 470 from Lodamin. A slow release kinetic of TNP 470 was obtained following incubation in PBS pH 7.4 or in gastric liquid pH 1.2 . The TNP 470 was released over a period of 28 d with an early peak burst of 30 after the first day of incubation .

The uptake of polymeric micelles by HUVEC and its kinetics was evaluated initially. HUVEC were incubated with 6 coumarin labeled mPEG PLA micelles for 20 min 2 4 and 7 h and were imaged by confocal microscopy. Confocal images show HUVEC uptake of polymeric micelles labeled with 6 coumarin after 20 min and 7 h incubation time periods data not shown . In Live HUVEC cells as were imaged 1 h post the addition of labeled micelles to cell media 15 g ml in green . LysoTracker Red was used to detect Endosomes and Lysosomes. Overlay between micelles and Endo lysosomes is represented in yellow orange color data not shown . As soon as 20 min after incubation micelles were taken up by the cells and was located in their cytoplasm. After 2 h the uptake was maximal and after 4 to 7 h micelles were detected as defined aggregates inside the cytoplasm. Flow cytometry analysis of HUVEC incubated with rhodamine labeled polymeric micelles for the same incubation times confirmed a maximal uptake after 2 h while no difference was observed between 2 to 24 h of incubation. In live cell analysis co localization of Lyso tracker staining with the micelles suggests endocytosis mechanism of uptake. Incubation of the micelles with HUVEC in cold conditions reduced micelle s uptake by up to 55 confirming the endocytosis process data not shown .

Following polymeric micelle uptake studies the effect of Lodamin on the proliferation of endothelial cells was evaluated. Lodamin 62.5 nM 1 000 nM TNP 470 equivalent inhibited HUVEC proliferation by 88 to 95 respectively after 48 h . The growth of HUVEC treated with Lodamin 60 nM TNP 470 equivalent was completely inhibited compared to untreated cells or cells treated by vehicle only. No substantial cytotoxic effect was found .

The anti proliferative and antiangiogenic properties of Lodamin were evaluated in vivo by the corneal micropocket assay. Mice were treated with daily oral Lodamin 15 mg kg q.d. or vehicle for 6 d. Newly formed blood vessels grew towards the bFGF pellet data not shown in representative eyes of untreated mice. Treated mice show the inhibition of bFGF induced angiogenesis in representative eyes. Quantification of the proliferative area showed 31 inhibition of angiogenesis compared to vehicle P 0.00016 n 10 . Similar results were obtained with VEGF165 160 ng induced angiogenesis in the cornea data not shown in this case Lodamin resulted in 40 inhibition of vessel area.

To study the intestinal absorption of mPEG PLA rhodamine micelles mice were administered oral polymeric micelles. After 2 h mice were euthanized and isolated segments of the small intestine were fixed and imaged using confocal microscopy. A histological section of gut epithelial cells of Lodamin treated mouse was observed with TEM. The polymeric micelles were intensively taken up by columnar epithelium lining the luminal side of the small intestine. In a high magnification of small intestine villi micelles are clearly detected in the lamina propria and in the vicinity of the blood vessels indicating transepithelial absorption. In high resolution TEM images of single gut epithelial cells many endosomes loaded with the drug were detected data not shown . Microvilli MV structures and endosomes loaded with polymeric micelles data not shown are detected. Bar 500 nm left and 200 nm right . Confocal microscopy image also confirms the TEM observations. Note the polymeric micelles can be detected in the lamina propria in the vicinity of blood vessels. The actin filaments were stained with phalloidin FITC nuclei were labeled with DAPI and mPEG PLA were labeled with rhodamine bars 5 m. These vesicles were different in contrast and number than in an intestine of untreated mouse. These data support the premise that Lodamin was absorbed by the villous structure of the intestine by endocytosis.

The biodistribution and tissue uptake of orally administered labeled MetAP 2 inhibitor polymersomes were studied by treating mice with fluorescent labeled PEG PLA micelles for 3 d. After harvesting the tissue tissue drug concentration was quantified by dye extraction or by flow cytometry. The results of the fluorescent dye extraction method showed that as expected a high concentration of fluorescent signal was detected in the stomach and the small intestine where the liver showed the highest level. Importantly the brain showed no presence of fluorescent signal. In the serum labeled micelles were already detected after 1 h post oral administration peaking after 2 h and were still detected up to 72 h. Accordingly in tumor bearing mice flow cytometry analysis of enzymatically digested tissues and D demonstrated a large uptake of labeled micelles by the liver and no uptake by brain cells. Importantly the highest uptake of micelles was detected in tumor cells. In the percentage of FL2cells i.e. cells that absorbed rhodamine labeled micelles is demonstrated. Taken together these results indicate that the drug is mostly concentrated in the tumor and in the gastrointestinal organs although to a lower extent and not in the brain.

No tissue abnormalities were detected in histological analysis H E of liver intestine lung and kidneys of MetAP 2 inhibitor polymersome treated mice 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent q.d. for 20 d when compared to untreated mice data not shown . In addition no significant differences were found in mouse serum liver enzyme profile of MetAP 2 inhibitor polymersome treated mice compared to untreated mice. In Lodamin treated group ALT concentration was 41 9 u l and AST was 120 39 u l whereas in the untreated group the ALT concentration was 37.5 4 u l and AST concentration was 152 131 u l.

The biological efficacy of Lodamin was evaluated as an anti cancer agent in tumor bearing mice. When mice were given oral free TNP 470 at a dose of 30 mg kg q.o.d. no inhibition in the growth of subcutaneous LLC tumors was observe . The equivalent dose of Lodamin however resulted in a significant inhibition of tumor growth . This inhibition was observed after 12 d of Lodamin treatment and at day 18 tumor growth was inhibited by 83 . Different dosing strategies of Lodamin were tested 15 mg kg q.d. 30 mg kg q.o.d. and 15 mg kg q.o.d. resulting 87 77 and 74 of tumor volume inhibition respectively . The vehicle PEG PLA showed no effect on tumor growth and was similar to untreated control mice .

In another tumor model B16 F10 melanoma tumors were induced subcutaneously and their growth was also inhibited by oral Lodamin 15 mg kg q.d. . This treatment was effective as of day 4 and after 13 d 77 volume inhibition was obtained . No apparent side effects or weight loss were detected in either tumor models. Higher doses of Lodamin 30 mg kg q.d. and 60 mg kg. q.o.d. showed substantial tumor inhibition however it was accompanied by weight loss data not shown . shows representative tumors of treated or untreated LLC or B16 F10 tumors.

Since the biodistribution study indicated that Lodamin does not cross the blood brain barrier we further tested if the possible penetration of escaped free drug into the brain might still result in neurotoxicity and cerebellar dysfunction. To examine this mice were subjected to a sensitive test of motor coordination crossing a narrow 4 mm balance beam 30. As shown in Lodamin treated mice 30 mg kg q.o.d. for 14 d performed in this challenge similar to control water treated mice whereas mice injected with free TNP 470 30 mg kg q.o.d. committed over twice as many errors P

Oral MetAP 2 Inhibitor Polymersomes Inhibit Angiogenesis and Cell Proliferation in Tumors and Induce Tumor Cell Apoptosis

The effect of Lodamin on the histological structure of the LLC tumors was tested. Both treated and untreated tumors showed a dense cellular structure data not shown . Lewis lung carcinoma LLC tumors were removed from Lodamin treated or untreated mice and sectioned. Tissues were stained with Hematoxylin Eosin H E to detect tissue morphology. Immunostaining with anti CD31 was used to detect microvessels and anti Ki67 nuclear antigen for cell proliferation. TUNEL staining was used for the detection of apoptotic cells. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Sections were counterstained with Eosin nuclei . The tumors of untreated mice had a net organization of small and large vessels with apparent lumen structure as demonstrated by CD 31 immunostaining. In contrast Lodamin treated tumors formed very small undeveloped vessels data not shown . Lodamin treated tumors showed less cellular proliferation than untreated tumors as detected by the nuclear marker KI 67. TUNEL staining for the detection of apoptosis in the tissues indicated an enhanced apoptosis in Lodamin treated tumors. Lodamin treated tumor had less vessels but high levels of apoptosis predominantly of tumor cells. In the control tissue apoptotic cells were found in the capsule of the tumor but less in the center of the tissue.

In addition the new oral formulation of the MetAP 2 inhibitor TNP 470 did not cause any weight loss or other apparent side effects in the mice .

The effect of oral Lodamin administration on liver metastases was tested after spleen injection of B16 F10. Oral Lodamin treatment dramatically affected development of liver metastasis. After 18 d of treatment mice were autopsied. All untreated mice had ascites while their enlarged livers had macroscopic malignant nodules and extensive cirrhosis . In contrast Lodamin treated mice had no macroscopic metastasis in the abdomen and in the liver . Their organs had normal morphology and no weight loss or other apparent side effects were found. Immunohistology showed only a few sporadic B16 F10 cells in the liver which had not developed into lesions data not shown . Only one treated mouse out of seven had malignant nodules in its liver but the liver was smaller than in the untreated control and had less cirrhosis. The spleens of all Lodamin treated mice had normal morphology compared to the congestion found in the enlarged spleens of control mice . Twenty days post B16 F10 cell injection into the spleen 4 out of 7 control mice had died while all treated mice survived .

In this study the inventors describe for the first time the development of a nontoxic oral formulation of the MetAP 2 inhibitor TNP 470 named Lodamin as a potent anti proliferative and anti metastatic drug. TNP 470 a highly potent anti proliferative antiangiogenesis agent is a leading candidate for chronic administration for cancer maintenance therapy and metastasis prevention.

The challenge that the inventors faced was based on the fact that TNP 470 has very poor oral availability as illustrated by its high Log D values indicating low water solubility. In order to make the drug suitable for oral administration this property of TNP 470 was altered while retaining its activity by conjugating it with mPEG PLA to form mPEG PLA TNP 470 polymeric micelles i.e. Lodamin. Unlike TNP 470 which is only dissolvable in organic solvents Lodamin can be suspended in water to form polymeric micelles caused by the amphiphilic nature of PEG PLA. In this structure the drug is located in the core of the micelle protected from the harsh gastrointestinal environment. Polymer micelles have previously been used for the delivery of hydrophobic drugsand gene delivery. Lodamin acquired a stable spherical morphology of nanomicelles as imaged by TEM. In addition PLA which is a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer hydrolyzes in an aqueous environment and allows a slow release of TNP 470. In vitro studies showed a continuous release of TNP 470 from Lodamin over almost a month period where the majority of the drug was released after 4 d in both gastric and plasma pH conditions although acidic environment is known to accelerate degradation of PLA we observed only a minor effect on day 15. While not wishing to be bound by theory one possible explanation may be the masking effect of the PEG shell which delays the water penetration to the PLA core and slows the release of the drug through diffusion of this layer. In culture Lodamin was rapidly taken up by endothelial cells via endocytosis and retained the original antiangiogenic activity of the free TNP 470 as demonstrated by the inhibition of HUVEC proliferation and growth rate.

PEG PLA micelles penetrated the gut epithelial layer into the submucosa as shown by using fluorescent marker. The mechanism of Lodamin penetration to gut epithelial cells seems to be via endocytosis as detected by high resolution TEM imaging. In serum labeled micelles had long blood circulation time of at least 72 h post administration a significant increase compared to free drug which was detected in mice sera up to 2 h post administration. Biodistribution showed relatively high concentration in the liver because oral administration delivers the drug directly from the intestine to the liver. However no liver toxicity was observed by histology and by liver enzymes profile after 20 d of daily Lodamin treatment.

Lodamin given orally to mice showed substantial anti proliferative effects 83 reduction while free TNP 470 given orally had no effect. The effect on LLC growth was dose dependent as 30 mg kg q.o.d. was more effective than 15 mg kg. q.o.d. and a dose of daily 15 mg kg q.d. was more effective than 30 mg kg q.o.d. a double dose given every 2 d . A similar anti proliferative effect of Lodamin was also observed with melanoma B16 F10 tumors confirming the broad biological effect of Lodamin very much like the original free TNP 470. Immunohistochemical studies carried out on LLC tumor tissues showed a reduction of proliferation and angiogenesis induced by Lodamin. Using TUNEL staining we detected a high level of tumor cell apoptosis following the Lodamin treatment whereas in the controls much of the apoptosis occurred on the capsule of the tumor. These results indicate that the prevention of angiogenesis by Lodamin leads to tumor cell apoptosis thus making Lodamin a cytotoxic drug in addition to an antiangiogenic drug.

One of the most notable effects of oral Lodamin is the prevention of liver metastasis in mice. Liver metastasis is very common in many tumor types and has often been associated with poor prognosis and survival rate. The inventors chose the intrasplenic model for induction of liver metastasis in which the transition time of B16 F10 from spleen to liver microvasculature post spleen injection in mice was found to be very fast 20 of the injected cells after 15 min 40. Mice injected with B16 F10 cells into the spleen had a low survival rate. They developed ascites macroscopic malignant nodules and extensive cirrhosis in their livers 20 d post injection. However all oral Lodamin treated mice survived up to this point and had normal liver except one mouse and spleen morphology without any other apparent side effects. Immunohistology of treated mice s livers showed some rare sporadic B16 F10 cells which remained dormant over the 18 d of oral Lodamin treatment compared to large metastasic tumors found in the untreated mice. It should be noted that Lodamin s effect on secondary tumor growth is in addition to its effect on the primary tumor.

While not wishing to be bound by theory this dramatic effect may be due to the oral route of administration in which Lodamin is absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and concentrated in large quantities in the liver via the portal vein. These results indicate that Lodamin can prevent the development of metastasis in the liver associated with different tumor types. Importantly this property of the polymeric micelles might be used for enabling oral availability of other antiangiogenic or anti cancer drugs to target liver metastasis.

In summary oral Lodamin is therapeutically effective in the treatment of solid tumors and metastasis in mice. It captures the antiproliferative properties of free TNP 470 while adding important advantages oral availability improved biodistribution tumor accumulation continual release improved solubility proper clearance and low related side effects. In addition to use for the treatment or suppression of known existing tumors its use is contemplated among others for cancer patients as a long term maintenance angiogenesis inhibitor to prevent tumor recurrence. Furthermore it is also contemplated for use as maintenance therapy for chronic MetAP 2 related diseases such as age related macular degeneration endometriosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Other contemplated uses are described elsewhere herein.

The effect of Lodamin on human brain tumor U87MG Glioblastoma was studied using subcutaneous tumor bearing nude mice. Treatment with Lodamin started when tumors were in volume of 100 mm. Lodamin that was given by gavage in a daily dose of 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent inhibited tumor volume by 70 after 30 days. When Lodamin was given in drinking water at the same dose a 71 inhibition of tumor volume was obtained after 42 days.

C57 Bl mice were injected into their tail veins with 2.5 10B16 F10 cells. Day after injection the mice were divided into 3 groups 10 mice were given a daily oral administration of Lodamin 15 mg kg TNP 470 equivalent 9 mice were given IP injection with the same Lodamin dose and 10 mice remained untreated. Mice survival was followed up to 40 days post treatment.

Lodamin treated mice showed a prolonged survival as can be seen in Kaplan Meier survival curve . After 32 days all control mice died compared to 6 and 5 mice that lived at day 40 in the IP Lodamin treated group and Oral Lodamin group respectively.

In Vivo Matrigel Angiogenesis Assay was conducted in order to assess the antiangiogenic properties of Lodamin. Matrigel BD bioscience which was remained in 4 C. overnight was mixed with fibroblast growth factor 2 FGF 2 to obtain a final FGF 2 concentration of 1 g ml. Nine C57 Bl mice were injected with Matrigel 500 l in two sites subcutaneously. Three mice got a daily oral treatment with Lodamin 15 mk kg day TNP 470 equivalent . In three mice the Matrigel was mixed with Lodamin 5 mg ml and no further treatment was performed and three untreated mice with Matrigel implant were used as a control.

After 8 days mice were euthanized and the Matrigel implant harvested washed twice with PBS and then one of the implant was immediately frozen on dry ice and used for histology assessment of blood vessels using CD 31 antibody. The second implant was enzymatically digested using collagenase Librease Roche to obtain single cell suspension which again was analyzed by FACS to quantify the number of endothelial cells using CD 31 and CD 45 antibodies endothelial cells are CD31 CD45 .

The implants of Lodamin treated mice both the one with the mixture of matrigel and Lodamin or the mice treated orally with Lodamin showed a significant reduction in blood vessels inside the implants . Histology showed less vessels in Lodamin treated mice and less dense tissue. FACS analysis suggests 70 reduction in the percent of endothelial cells which were attracted to the implant .

Activation of Th17 cells plays an important role in the immune system in response to infection injury irritant and external insult to the body. Activated Th17 cells secrete a number of cytokines IL 17 TNF IL 6 etc induced MMP production and promote angiogenesis and recruit other immune cells such as neutrophils . However prolong activation of Th17 cells have been shown to lead to chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel diseases psoriasis and uveitis to name a few Nature 2 20028 453 1051 1057 Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009 27 485 517 .

Human endogenous uveitis such as Behcet s disease Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease Sarcoidosis is known to be one of the sight threatening intraocular diseases. Complications such as cystoid macular edema secondary glaucoma and proliferative vitreoretinopathy can cause permanent loss of vision.

Uveitis encompasses all inflammatory processes of the middle layers of the eye also called the uveal tract or uvea. The uvea includes the iris colored part of the eye choroid a thin membrane containing many blood vessels and ciliary body the part of the eye that joins these together . The uvea is very important because its many veins and arteries transport blood to the parts of the eye that are critical for vision. Uveitis may cause inflammation of all three structures that make up the uvea. Alternately only one of the structures may be affected. For instance in the type of uveitis affecting only the iris the condition is caller iritis or anterior uveitis. Intermediate uveitis is also known as iridocyclitis and posterior uveitis is known as choroiditis or chorioretinitis.

As an inflammatory eye condition uveitis can occur alone or it can occur as part of a generalized inflammatory process in systemic autoimmune diseases. In many cases of uveitis several immunosuppressive drugs are needed to control the inflammation process in the eye. However long term administration of these drugs can cause severe side effects. shows the Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis EAU as a model of human endogenous uveitis. After immunizing C57BL 6 mice with interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein IRBP EAU severity was assessed by clinically and histopathologically. This autoimmune disease model is T cell mediated disease and Th17 cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Multiple sclerosis MS is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease affecting the central nervous system. Previous studies of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis EAE a murine model of MS indicated that autoimmune responses were initiated by a subset of myelin specific CD4 T cells. shows the Experimental Allergic Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis EAE as a model of human multiple sclerosis. The C57BL 6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein MOG after which the paralysis severity will be assessed. This autoimmune disease model is T cell mediated disease and Th17 cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease.

Lodamin has previously been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth by oral administration without adverse side effects. To confirm that Lodamin can be uptaken by T cells fluorescence labeled Lodamin were used shows the FITC labeled Lodamin uptake by T cells. CD4 cells were purified from splenocytes and lymph nodes cells by MACS then cultured with 6 coumarin labeled Lodamin for the indicated minutes. Fluorescence intensity was analyzed by flow cytometry. Lodamin was uptaken the T cells within 5 minutes of incubation and after 10 minutes the cells were saturated with the drug. This data indicate of fast endocytosis kinetics.

Cellular proliferation is an essential feature of the adaptive immune response. In order to evaluate Lodamin s potential in inhibiting T cell proliferation a calorimetric technique was used. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester CFSE dye was used to stain and monitor the number of cell divisions during cell proliferation. To evaluate the effect of Lodamin for T cell proliferation T cells were stained with CFSE dye and stimulated with anti CD3 antibody. shows the inhibition of T cell proliferation by Lodamin after 72 and 96 hours using CFSE dilution.

IL 17 producing T cells have recently been classified as a new effector T cell subset. Th17 are different from Th1 and Th2 subsets and they play a significant role in autoimmune disease progression. To evaluate the effect of Lodamin on T cell differentiation into Th1 and Th17 T cells were cultured in several conditions in the presence of Lodamin. shows the effects of Lodamin on T cell differentiation as analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining Whole splenocytes were stimulated with soluble anti CD3 1 g ml in each of the three conditions for 72 h Th0 condition anti IFN Ab 1 g ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml Th1 condition IL 12 10 ng ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml Th17 condition TGF 1 2 ng ml IL 6 20 ng ml anti IFN Ab 1 g ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml in the presence of vehicle control no Lodamin Lodamin 1.0 nM and Lodamin 10 nM as indicated. Lodamin inhibit the differentiation of T cells from splenocytes into Th1 Th17.

To further expand and study the effect of Lodamin in suppressing T cell differentiation intracellular cytokine staining was performed. shows the effects of Lodamin on T cell differentiation without antigen presenting cells APC as analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining Purified CD4CD25 T cells not activated Th effector cells were stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 5 g ml and soluble anti CD28 0.5 g ml with each conditions for 72 h Th0 condition anti IFN Ab 1 g ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml Th1 condition IL 12 10 ng ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml Th17 condition TGF 1 2 ng ml IL 6 20 ng ml anti IFN Ab 1 g ml anti IL 4 Ab 1 g ml in the presence of vehicle control no Lodamin Lodamin 1.0 nM and Lodamin 10 nM as indicated. The intracellular cytokine staining and FACS analysis show that Lodamin significantly reduces IL 17.

The effect of Lodamin on the production of Th0 and Th17 cytokines from T cells was evaluated using ELISA. shows the effects of Lodamin on IFN production in CD4CD25 T cells T effector cells stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 5 g ml and soluble anti CD28 0.5 g ml as analyzed by ELISA. The conditions for Th0 Th1 and Th17 were same as . These data indicate that Lodamin significantly inhibited or reduced IFN production in all three cells Th0 Th1 and Th17.

Lodamin also had a similar inhibitory action on IL 17 production in Th0 Th1 and Th17 cells. shows the effects of Lodamin on IL 17 production in CD4CD25 T cells stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 5 g ml and soluble anti CD28 0.5 g ml as analyzed by ELISA. The conditions for Th0 Th1 and Th17 were same as . These data indicate that Lodamin significantly inhibited or reduced IL 17 production in all three cells Th0 Th1 and Th17.

Based on the fact that T cells can uptake Lodamin and the effects of Lodamin on T cell activation and proliferation the suppression of T cell differentiation and of cytokine production the inventors tested whether Lodamin has anti inflammatory effect. To elucidate these effect for T cells cytokine production by anti CD3 stimulated CD4 T cells were analyzed. shows the effects of increasing amounts of Lodamin on IFN production in CD4 T cells stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 1 g ml for three days as analyzed by ELISA. shows the effects of increasing amounts of Lodamin on IL 17 production in CD4 T cells stimulated with plate bound anti CD3 1 g ml for three days as analyzed by ELISA. These data show that Lodamin significantly inhibited or reduced IFN and IL 17 cytokine production indicating that Lodamin has anti inflammatory effect by way of inhibition of cytokine production. IFN and IL 17 cytokines are chosen as representative cytokines known to be associated with inflammation.

As previous studies demonstrated that Th17 cells are the dominant pathogenic cellular component in autoimmune inflammatory diseases. Here the inventors found that Lodamin modulates Th17 differentiation. The inventors further investigated the anti inflammatory effect of Lodamin using animal model of ocular autoimmune disease. shows the use of oral administration of Lodamin to ameliorate experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis EAU . EAU was induced by immunizing C57BL 6 mice with human interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein IRBP 1 20. Lodamin at a dose of 30 mg kg or vehicle was orally administrated every other day after immunization. EAU severity was evaluated clinically and histopathologically on day 21.

To understand the mechanism of the suppressive effect in Lodamin administered mice antigen specific IFN IL 17 production from regional lymph node cells were analyzed. show the suppression of antigen specific cytokine production by lymph nodes from Lodamin administered EAU mice. On day 21 after immunization draining lymph node cells were harvested and IRBP specific IFN and IL 17 production was analyzed by ELISA.

One possible mechanism of action of Lodamin is that Lodamin affect the expansion regulatory T cells resulting in a reduction of Th1 Th17 development and thus disease progression. Foxp3 have been widely known as indispensable transcription factor for regulatory T cells. To exclude the possibility of described above Foxp3 expression in regional lymph node cells were analyzed. shows the Foxp3 expression as a representative marker for regulatory T cells by draining lymph node cells from Lodamin administered EAU mice n 5 . On day 21 after immunization draining lymph node cells were harvested and cell surface was stained with APC labeled anti CD4 antibody followed by intracellular Foxp3 staining.

To elucidate the local eye inflammatory milieu retinas were subjected to polymerase chain reaction PCR . shows the suppression of intraocular cytokine expression of IFN IL 17A and IL 6 from Lodamin administered EAU mice n 3 . On day 21 mRNA from retinas was isolated for quantitative real time PCR qPCR . qPCR for indicated cytokines were performed.

Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for the purposes of clarity of understanding one skilled in the art will easily ascertain that certain changes and modifications may be practiced without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.
