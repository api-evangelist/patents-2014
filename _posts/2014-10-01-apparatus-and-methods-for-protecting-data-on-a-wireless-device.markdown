The present application for patent is a divisional of and claims priority to U.S. application Ser. No. 11 438 658 entitled Apparatus And Methods For Protecting Data On A Wireless Device filed 19 May 2006 which claims priority to Provisional Application No. 60 684 719 entitled Methods and Apparatus for Disabling Service on a Wireless Device filed May 25 2005 assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.

The described embodiments generally relate to wireless communications devices and computer networks. More particularly the described embodiments relate to apparatus and methods for protecting data on a wireless device.

Wireless networking connects one or more wireless devices to other computer devices without a direct electrical connection such as a copper wire or optical cable. Wireless devices communicate data typically in the form of packets across a wireless or partially wireless computer network and open a data or communication channel on the network such that the device can send and receive data packets. The wireless devices often have wireless device resources such as programs and hardware components which individually and cooperatively operate to use and generate data in accordance to their design and specific protocol or configuration such as using open communication connections to transmit and receive data on the network.

These wireless devices generally contain software implemented locks that protect certain types of stored data such as service programming locks SPL that restrict access to service programming data. For example service programming data may include the account information of the user of the wireless device that allows the device to access a particular wireless network associated with a particular network service provider.

There are many reasons to protect data on a wireless device. For example a network service provider may use a service programming lock so that the wireless device can only be used on their particular wireless network. For instance in one scenario a user may purchase a wireless handset and a service contract for cellular services from a network service provider where the wireless handset is sold at a discount based on the service contract. In this case the network provider subsidizes a portion of the handset cost for the purposes of marketing the service. If the user were able to unlock the SPL and reprogram the handset to use it on another network the original network provider would lose the recurring income stream of the service that reimburses the network provider for subsidizing the cost of the handset.

Although locks may prevent a user from reprogramming the wireless device or may prevent unauthorized access to protected data unfettered access to a lock may allow repeated access attempts to eventually succeed.

Accordingly it would be advantageous to provide an apparatus and method that allows for the monitoring and or management of data access attempt occurring on a wireless device.

The described embodiments comprise apparatus methods computer readable media and processors operable to protect data on a wireless device based upon a flexible data monitoring and lock management configuration. Disclosed methods and apparatus may detect unauthorized data access attempt that may initiate the generation and transmission of control commands supplied by at least one of a network service provider wireless device manufacturer and other authorizing parties. Such control commands may be operable to disable non emergency wireless device functionality to protect sensitive data such as service provider operational data so that network disruption and or lost revenue is minimized.

In one aspect a method of protecting data on a wireless device may comprise receiving on a wireless device a monitoring and lock management configuration operable to configure the wireless device to monitor protected data stored thereon. The method may further comprise collecting data access information based on an execution of the configuration on the wireless device and transmitting the collected data access information to another device to determine whether or not the data access is authorized.

Additional aspects may include a wireless device having means for performing the above disclosed operations a processor configured to perform the above disclosed operations and a computer readable medium including one or more sets of instructions stored thereon for performing the above disclosed operations.

Additional aspects may include an apparatus for protecting data on a wireless device may comprise a processor and a data manager module executable by the processor. The data manager may further comprise an information repository operable to receive and store data access information collected from the wireless device based upon execution on the wireless device of a monitoring and lock management configuration and an analyzer operable to generate a data access report based on the access information.

In addition the data manager may further comprise a remote device control module operable to transmit a control command to the wireless device wherein the control command is operable to generate and send a control command to change an operational characteristic of the wireless device based on at least one of the data access report and the access information.

The apparatus methods computer readable media and processors discussed herein relate to the programmable monitoring detecting and recording of attempts to access protected data on a wireless device. The disclosed embodiments further analyze the recorded information in order to reactively and or proactively manage protected data and or the programmable locks placed thereon to maintain the security and or integrity of the protected data. For example the protected data may define a functional and or operational capability of the wireless device. As such these apparatus methods computer readable media and processors may be desirable to thwart attempts to reprogram the functional and or operational data to change a performance of the wireless device such as to cause a malfunction of the device or its associated network and or such as to provide the device with unauthorized capabilities.

Referring to in some aspects a programmable data monitoring and lock management system includes a wireless device operable to execute a flexible data monitoring and lock management configuration for monitoring and recording attempts to access protected data on wireless device . For example protected data may be network related or user related and may include but is not limited to one or any combination of device operational and or functional settings such as service programming codes at least portions of service provision code SPC and or data on one or more modules including but not limited to a subscriber identification module SIM a universal subscriber identification module USIM and a removable user identify module RUIM . Other aspects may include protecting data stored in a personal information manager e.g. names addresses and telephone numbers. Programmable locks may be configured to restrict access to any data including but not limited to a service programming lock SPL .

Further wireless device may be operable based on configuration to collect and forward detected data access information to a user manager computer in communication with wireless device via a network interface and a wireless network . For example data access information may include but is not limited to changes in network settings or a predetermined behavior in regards to data access associated with one or any combination of protected data experiencing an access attempt the data and inputs associated with an access attempt a protected data identifier and or a prior value and or a new value associated with any changes to the protected data based on a successful access attempt a prior value and or a new value of protected data an identifier associated with a module attempting access to protected data an identifier such as a subscriber identifier associated with the respective wireless device an identifier associated with a monitoring configuration responsible for the collected data access information and any other information relating to any attempt to access and or change a lock and or protected data. Further data access information may include the date and time of the attempted access and information identifying the wireless device.

Further in some aspects user manager may be operable to analyze data access information based on one or more predetermined activity standards and generate a data access report that identifies and or characterizes the data access attempt and may determine whether the access is or is not authorized. For example predetermined standards may include but are not limited to one or any combination of rules associated with what protected data is accessed how many access attempts are allowed and identification of authorized and or unauthorized entities.

Additionally system may include a workstation computer which may be operated by a user in communication with user manager via network interface . Workstation may be operable to receive retrieve and or otherwise access data access information and or the data access report and take appropriate action either via user inputs or via predetermined rules to manage e.g. apply remove or change one or more data access restricting locks on wireless device based on the identification and or characterization of data access information . For example user may issue commands to change lock characteristics for example to enhance security when report indicates unauthorized access attempts. In another example commands may be operable to change protected data and or a functionality of wireless device for example such as to disable one or more functionalities of wireless device when report indicates that protected data has been tampered with and or changed.

Thus system is operable to monitor and record protected data related information on a wireless device and transmit the information to a user manager that may reside on a remote device. Aspects of system may include the user manager analyzing the stored information generating data access report and transmitting or providing access to the report to an authorized user . In addition any of the wireless device the user manager and an authorized user may be configured to generate control commands that may be operable to apply remove and modify an operation restricting lock on the wireless device if the wireless device is so configured.

Referring to wireless device may include any type of computerized wireless device such as cellular telephone personal digital assistant two way text pager portable computer and even a separate computer platform that has a wireless communications portal and which also may have a wired connection to a network or the Internet.

In addition wireless device may comprise a computer platform interconnected with an input mechanism and an output mechanism respectively providing inputs and outputs for communicating with resident applications. For example input mechanism may include but is not limited to a mechanism such as a key or keyboard a mouse a touch screen display and a voice recognition module. Output mechanism may include but is not limited to a display an audio speaker and a haptic feedback mechanism.

Computer platform may further include a communications module embodied in one or any combination of hardware software firmware executable instructions and data operable to receive and or to transmit and otherwise enable communication between components within the wireless device as well as to enable both hardwired communications and wireless communications external to wireless device .

For example communications module may include but is not limited to communication interface components such as a serial port a universal serial bus USB a parallel port and wired and or air interface components for implementing communication protocols standards such as World Interoperability for Microwave Access WiMAX infrared protocols such as Infrared Data Association IrDA short range wireless protocols technologies Bluetooth technology ZigBee protocol ultra wide band UWB protocol home radio frequency HomeRF shared wireless access protocol SWAP wideband technology such as a wireless Ethernet compatibility alliance WECA wireless fidelity alliance Wi Fi Alliance 802.11 network technology public switched telephone network technology public heterogeneous communications network technology such as the Internet private wireless communications network land mobile radio network code division multiple access CDMA wideband code division multiple access WCDMA universal mobile telecommunications system UMTS advanced mobile phone service AMPS time division multiple access TDMA frequency division multiple access FDMA orthogonal frequency division multiple access OFDMA global system for mobile communications GSM single carrier 1X radio transmission technology RTT evolution data only EV DO technology general packet radio service GPRS enhanced data GSM environment EDGE high speed downlink data packet access HSPDA analog and digital satellite systems and any other technologies protocols that may be used in at least one of a wireless communications network and a data communications network.

Further computer platform may include a processing engine which may be an application specific integrated circuit ASIC or other chipset processor logic circuit or other data processing device. Processing engine is operable to execute an application programming interface API layer that may interface with any resident programs such as a programmable lock management PLM engine .

In one non limiting aspect API is a runtime environment executing on the respective wireless device. One such runtime environment is Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless BREW software developed by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego Calif. Other runtime environments may be utilized that for example operate to control the execution of applications on wireless computing devices.

Additionally processing engine may include one or a combination of processing subsystems that provide functionality to wireless device . In a cellular phone example processing subsystems may include subsystems such as sound non volatile memory file system transmit receive searcher layer layer layer main control remote procedure handset power management diagnostic digital signal processor vocoder messaging call manager Bluetooth system Bluetooth LPOS position determination position engine user interface sleep data services security authentication USIM SIM voice services graphics USB multimedia such as MPEG GPRS etc. In other words processing subsystems may include any subsystem components that interact with applications executing on computer platform . For example processing subsystems may include any subsystem components that receive data reads and data writes from API on behalf of any resident client application.

Further computer platform may also include a memory for storing data information logic executable instructions etc. For example memory may comprise volatile and or nonvolatile memory such as read only and or random access memory RAM and ROM electronically programmable ROM EPROM electronically erasable programmable ROM EEPROM flash cards or any memory common to computer platforms. Further memory may include one or more flash memory cells and may further include any secondary and or tertiary storage device such as magnetic media optical media tape or soft or hard disk.

Additionally memory may include one or more programmable locks and one or more protected data . Lock comprises one or any combination of hardware software firmware and or other set of executable instructions applied by PLM engine and operable to limit access to a corresponding one or more predetermined protected data . For example in some aspects lock may include a service programming lock SPL which protects certain types of service programming data such as the account information stored in a subscriber identification module SIM which allows wireless device to access a particular wireless network associated with a particular network service provider. Further lock may include an unlocking mechanism in order to gain access to i.e. a reading or writing of a value of protected data and may require one or any combination of a predetermined key a predetermined password a predetermined digital certificate and any other predetermined unlocking mechanism

For example lock may be opened by inputting or providing the predetermined unlocking mechanism which may be received by communications module or entered via input mechanism of wireless device thereby permitting access to the protected data. Lock may protect from unauthorized access one or any combination of protected data including various types of data such as SPCs stored in one or any combination of modules such as a SIM a USIM and a RUIM and or residing in any portion of memory including but not limited to nonvolatile memory e.g. ROM EPROM EEPROM and flash cards and volatile memory e.g. random access memory RAM or any memory common to computer platforms.

Additionally memory may further include PLM engine operable to monitor record and report any attempt to access lock and or protected data . PLM engine is programmable configurable and may include one or any combination of hardware software firmware executable instructions and data. In one aspect PLM engine may comprise PLM control logic operable to manage all functions and components of the PLM engine . Further because different versions of wireless devices may require different implementations PLM engine may include an engine identifier ID such as a name a version etc. which is operable to identify the PLM engine .

In particular referring to PLM engine may be operable to execute configuration to monitor and manage programmable locks and or protected data and to report on data access information . As noted above configuration may be downloaded to memory via wireless transmission over wireless network statically installed at the time of manufacture and downloaded via a hardwired connection to a personal computer PC or another computerized device. For example configuration may be configured by user of workstation and transmitted to wireless device via user manager where in some aspects user is associated with a network service provider. Data access information collected by PLM engine may be stored for example in a data access log which may comprise a plurality of lock activity records. For example data access log may be configured to include one or more records comprising multiple elements pertaining to the specific activity detected.

In some aspects configuration may include one or a combination of a tracking parameter and a reporting parameter which are utilized to monitor record and report data access information .

Tracking parameter may specify which protected data and or locks to monitor when how often and what data access activity related information to record. For example tracking parameter may specify by a name and or code which locks and or protected data of wireless device to monitor including various memory modules such as but not limited to a service programming code SPC module a subscriber identification module SIM a universal subscriber identification module USIM and a removable user identity module RUIM . Further for example tracking parameter may include triggering events such as access attempts that initiate collecting of data access information . Additionally for example tracking parameter may include one or any combination of a time interval a number of input and response sequences and or a triggering event such as a predetermined activity and or a predetermined time period of inactivity which define how often to collect data access information . Further tracking parameter may identify one or any combination of inputs responses types of data types of events etc. which define what information to collect as data access information .

For example data access information may include data representing a sequence of inputs and responses may be logged whenever lock is accessed or attempted to be unlocked or whenever the value of protected data is accessed or changed. Data access information may include any type of data associated with any lock and or protected data usage on wireless device . For example data access information comprises any information associated with access attempts and or attacks on locks and or protected data including but not limited to information such as a time of an access attempt a protected data identifier an input relating to an access attempt an access attempt result a password certificate or code used in an access attempt a previous value and or a new value of protected data a previous and or a new value of an unlocking mechanism associated with a lock an identifier associated with a device and or user attempting to access a lock and or protected data .

Reporting parameter may define when and to whom or to what address and via what mechanism to report out any collected data access information . For example in some aspects reporting parameter may configure PLM engine to selectively transmit data access information and or activity log to user manager across wireless network . Such a transmission may occur at any time including but not limited to at a predetermined time and or on a predetermined interval and on an occurrence of a predetermined event such as upon detection of an attempt to unlock a lock configured for monitoring or an attempt to directly access protected data upon request by an authorized remote device such as user manager or workstation computer and upon the amount of collected data access information reaching a certain memory size and or upon wireless device reaching a predetermined percentage of memory used and or memory available. Further reporting parameter may determine whom to allow local access to data access information and or log thereby allowing a remote device such as the user manager to access memory .

For example in one non limiting aspect data access log may be transmitted to a predetermined party over an open communication connection between wireless device and wireless network . For example PLM engine may piggyback data access log onto an ongoing voice or data call across an open connection. Alternatively in a cellular network configuration PLM engine may transmit data access log to user manager through short message service SMS . Furthermore as noted above user manager may pull log from the wireless device across the network on a scheduled or ad hoc basis.

Further in some aspects configuration may additionally include a predetermined activity standard to identify an unauthorized data access attempt that has been configured for monitoring by operation of one or more tracking parameter discussed above. For example in some aspects wireless device may be configured to operate independently of user manager and user by analyzing the data stored in log and automatically issue control command to the wireless device e.g. to disable the wireless device except for certain emergency communications. For instance PLM control logic may be operable to apply predetermined activity standard to information associated with accessing of lock and or protected data and or to data access information to identify an unauthorized data access attempt which may then trigger continued and or additional information collection and or which may trigger a control command as will be discussed below. For example certain types or numbers of access attempts may be allowed by one network carrier but not allowed by other network carriers. As such predetermined activity standard allows each wireless device to be configured as desired.

Optionally in some aspects PLM engine may also include a wireless device control module operable to receive and or execute on wireless device a locally or remotely generated control command . For example device control module may locally store one or more control commands which may be triggered by predetermined events. Alternatively or in addition device control module may be operable to receive control command from user manager via communications module . Control command may be any instruction operable to alter one or more operational features of wireless device . For example control command may include but is not limited to commands such as instructing wireless device to download configuration uploading data access information disabling all non emergency functions and enabling disabled functions.

For example based upon an analysis of the uploaded data access information identifying a number of unsuccessful attempts to access lock and or protected data user manager may transmit control command to instruct wireless device to disable some predetermined functionality such as network communications. Subsequently for example user of workstation may after communicating with the user of wireless device that has been previously disabled may issue a new control command to enable any and all disabled functions.

Further for example in some aspects when an access attempt is detected that appears to be unauthorized based on predetermined activity standard PLM control logic may notify device control module which may automatically execute control command to automatically disable wireless device . In one aspect the reporting of executed control commands may be based upon reporting parameter . For example the PLM engine may report the executed control command immediately to the user manager . In other embodiments the wireless device may report the control command executed and the detected activity that triggered the command at a later time as configured by the reporting parameter .

In the event of a control command executed on the wireless device limiting wireless device functionality and generally at any time user of workstation who may be a customer service representative of a network service provider may be operable to contact the user of the wireless device to discuss the detected data access attempt. Based upon that discussion the workstation user may transmit a command through the user manager to enable the wireless device or in other situations further restrict wireless device operations.

Additionally in some aspects device control module may request verification of a control command received from a remote device e.g. user manager and workstation computer before executing the command. For example verification may occur by determining whether the issuer of the control command is authorized to issue control commands and or whether the issuer is authorized to issue the particular type of control command. The verification process may include any type of verification and or authorization mechanism such as digital keys digital certificates passwords checking of issuer identification versus an approved list etc.

Optionally in some aspects PLM engine may further establish a limited access communications channel across the wireless network generally not available to the user of wireless device . For example the limited access communications channel may be used for transmitting data access information data access log receiving configuration as well as for receiving generating control command .

The identification and set up of the limited access communications channel may be based on at least one data service parameter . A data service parameter may identify the type of communications that are allowed and may identify the associated communication channels that can be utilized. Data service parameter may be received over the wireless network as part of monitoring and lock management configuration may be locally transferred to wireless device such as through a serial connection or may be preloaded on the wireless device .

Referring back to user manager may be a server personal computer mini computer mainframe computer or any computing device operable to perform at least one or any combination of generating configuration receiving data access information based on configuration analyzing information and taking proactive measures with respect to locks and or protected data on wireless device based on the analysis of information . In some aspects user manager may operate in conjunction with workstation computer and workstation user to perform these functions.

Furthermore there may be separate servers or computer devices associated with user manager working in concert to provide data in usable formats to parties and or provide a separate layer of control in the data flow between wireless device and user manager . Further user manager may send software agents or applications to wireless device across wireless network such that the wireless device returns information from its resident applications and subsystems . Furthermore data manager module may download all or a portion of the resident version of data manager module to each wireless device . For example data manager module may initiate the transfer of PLM engine to a respective wireless device .

Referring to user manager may include a memory operable to store data and executable instructions a processor operable to execute the instructions and data and a communications module operable to relay communications within the components of user manager and between user manager and external devices.

Additionally user manager may comprise a data manager module operable to manage all operations regarding the management of lock and or protected data on wireless device . Data manager module may include one or any combination of hardware software firmware data and executable instructions. In some aspects data manager module may include lock manager control logic operable to control the functionality of data manager module .

In some aspects data manager module may include a configuration generator operable to generate configuration for monitoring lock and or protected data on wireless device .

Referring to in some aspects for example configuration generator may comprise configuration logic operable to provide a user with the ability to select from a plurality of parameters to define configuration . For example in some aspects configuration may comprise but is not limited to one or any combination of one or more parameters selected from a plurality of tracking parameters a plurality of reporting parameters a plurality of predetermined activity standards a plurality of control command parameters a plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations a plurality of predetermined wireless device types and a plurality of network service providers .

Each of the plurality of tracking parameters may define different tracking capabilities. As such a selection of one of the plurality of tracking parameters defined as tracking parameter thereby defines a desired tracking capability.

Each of the plurality of reporting parameters may define different reporting capabilities. As such a selection of one of the plurality of reporting parameters defined as reporting parameter thereby defines a desired reporting capability.

Each of the plurality of predetermined activity standards may define different allowable access related behaviors such as sequences of inputs to lock access attempts by one entity or in a certain time period etc. As such a selection of one of the plurality of predetermined activity standards defined as predetermined activity standard thereby selects a specific activity behavior and or capability to use when analyzing data access attempt configured for monitoring by tracking parameter .

Each of the plurality of control command parameters may define different control command capabilities. As such a selection of one of the plurality of control command parameters defined as control command thereby defines a desired control capability.

Alternatively rather than selecting the various configuration parameters individually each of the plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations may define different known combinations of the above stated parameters. For example there may be certain combinations of monitoring parameters that can be defined as a standard for performing certain actions on wireless device and as such these standards may be saved and recalled rather than having to assemble configuration from scratch in each instance. As such a selection of one of the plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations thereby defines configuration .

Additionally in some aspects each of the plurality of predetermined wireless device types may define a different manufacturer make and or model of wireless device. Further each of the plurality of predetermined wireless device types may correspond to one of the plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations . For example the presence of a given lock and or a given protected data may be dependent upon the specific wireless device in operation. For instance certain types of wireless devices may not include a RUIM and or a USIM. In this case since different types of wireless devices have different data modules configuration may be device specific. Accordingly configuration logic may provide a user with the ability to select from a menu of a plurality of predetermined wireless device types .

Similarly what may be considered as access attempt activities to monitor and record by one network service provider may not be considered relevant activities by another network service provider. For example some network service providers may allow or require certain accessing activities while other network service providers may desire to prohibit the same activities. Accordingly configuration logic may provide a user with the ability to select from a menu of a plurality of predetermined network service providers each corresponding to a given one of the plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations . As such different monitoring configurations may be generated for different network providers to detect network specific accessing activities to monitor and record. Accordingly a device roaming from one network service provider to the next may receive a new monitoring configuration depending on the current network service provider.

Further configuration generator may be operable to define at least one data service parameter selected from a plurality of data service parameters operable to establish a limited access communications channel across the wireless network allowing the wireless device to transmit the information log to and receive control commands from the user manager or authorized user and where the limited access communications channel is not available to an end user of the wireless device . In another aspect the data service parameter may be received over the wireless network or may be preloaded on the wireless device .

Additionally in some aspects once the specific parameters of a given configuration are determined configuration logic may assign a unique configuration identifier ID to the given configuration. Further configuration logic may be operable to store the given configuration in a library for later recall such as among the plurality of predetermined monitoring configurations .

Further in some aspects configuration logic and or another component of data manager module may be operable to initiate the transmission of configuration to one or more wireless devices . In some aspects for example control command may be transmitted to activate the transmitted configuration on wireless device . In other embodiments PLM engine may be configured to activate the newly transmitted configuration immediately upon download.

Referring back to in some aspects data manager module may further comprise an information repository such as any type of memory and or storage device for storing collected data. For example data manager module is executable by user manager to manage the collection of data access information and or information logs from wireless devices and store the data in information repository . As noted above data manager module may be operable to pull data access information and or information logs from wireless device based on commands from a user or the logs may be pushed from the respective devices at predetermined times or upon reaching predetermined memory data storage levels or upon reaching predetermined conditions such as the value of a protected data on the wireless device being changed.

In addition data manager module may be further operable to analyze the data access information stored in data access log and generate a data access report based upon the analysis performed. For example in some aspects data manager module may comprise an analyzer operable to analyze and process data access information and or data access log received from wireless device and stored in information repository . Analyzer may comprise one or any combination of hardware software firmware data and executable instructions including algorithms fuzzy logic heuristic routines decision making routines statistical programs etc. for analyzing and interpreting data in data access information and or data access log .

Additionally analyzer may further include one or a plurality of predetermined activity standards which may define one or more activities events sequences of inputs approved accessing entities and unauthorized accessing entities. Analyzer may be operable to execute the algorithms etc. in combination with predetermined activity standard in order to determine an access characteristic associated with the data of data access information and or data access log . Although illustrated as being associated with data manager module and memory resident within user manager analyzer may be located anywhere in communication with wireless network such as on workstation computer another server connected to the network on a wireless device and etc.

More specifically in some aspects analyzer may compare a selected portion of data access information and or data access log such as the number of unsuccessful attempts to access protected data to a selected portion of the predetermined standard such as the maximum number of times a particular portion of protected data may be unsuccessful accessed before the access attempts should be characterized as an attempt to breach the security of the wireless device . Based upon this comparison analyzer may send a type of control command PLM engine of wireless device for example to disable some predetermined functionality of wireless device .

Furthermore in some aspects after performing an initial analysis on data access information and or data access log analyzer may initiate further communications with one or more wireless devices to retrieve additional data access information . Analyzer may continue to request information until a predetermined solution is achieved i.e. until analyzer determines there is enough collected information to characterize the data in the aggregated data access information and or data access log .

For example although analyzer may be configured in some aspects to immediately report to a predetermined user i.e. workstation user whenever there is an attempt to access lock and or protected data in other aspects data manager module may be configured to notify workstation user only after the analysis indicates actual access to a predetermined lock and or protected data . For instance in order to minimize operator workload prior to notifying workstation user analyzer may generate and forward a new configuration to the wireless device thereby gathering more information relating to lock and protected data within the respective wireless device to determine if there is a security problem with the respective wireless device .

Furthermore based upon the log of one wireless device the analyzer may proactively poll other wireless devices to determine whether other wireless devices have had similar attacks on lock and or protected data . For example such polling may detect a virus that for example only attempts a predetermined number of accesses on a lock so as not to be detected on a single wireless device .

Furthermore in some aspects data manager module may further include a report generator operable to generate data access report which presents the result of analyzer and which may include all or a portion of the collected data access information . In some aspects data manager module may be operable to make data access report available to a predetermined party such as allowing remote access to report through another device such as workstation and or such as by generating and transmitting an electronic message including at least portions of report to another device such as workstation computer . In another example data manager module may be operable to generate an E mail comprising at least portions of the report over a communication channel to a predetermined party such as workstation computer . Further for example user manager may present protected data related information on a monitor or display device.

Thus data manager module and its corresponding components may provide a predetermined user with a ready view of protected data related information collected from the wireless devices based on configuration . User manager may present report in any form such as tables maps graphics views plaintext interactive programs or web pages or any other display or presentation of the data. Further data manager module may group unauthorized access activity based on one or more of tracking parameters and any access related information stored in log .

Also in some aspects user manager may change the configuration and or send a control command to be run on the respective wireless device e.g. to apply a lock in order to disable wireless device based on data access information and or information log and or based on report generated by the analyzer . For example in some situations e.g. wherein protected data of wireless device has been breached after repeated attacks data manager module may be configured to automatically apply a lock to disable the wireless device for non emergency use and then transmit a report to the workstation user that includes the actions taken.

Additionally in some aspects still referring to data manager module may further include a remote device control module operable by execution of control logic to receive control command from workstation computer to be transmitted to wireless device . In some other embodiments remote device control logic may be configured to automatically generate and transmit control command to wireless device based upon a determination of analyzer .

Referring to in some aspects remote device control module is operable under control of permission logic to determine the validity of a received control command . Control command may comprise a wireless device identifier ID an operator identification ID and a control activity . The wireless ID may be a SID or any unique identifier of the wireless device for which the control activity is directed. The operator ID may be some manner of identifying the originator of control command . For example operator ID may be a name a number a digital signature a hash or any other type of data or value that may be associated with an authorized user e.g. workstation user . Further operator ID may not be explicitly contained in the control command but rather may be derived from the origin of control command . Control activity may be the operation to be performed on wireless device by PLM engine through executing control command . As mentioned above the operation may include downloading configuration and uploading data access information and or data access log . Thus before executing or forwarding control command device control module may execute permission logic to verify the authenticity or authority of the party issuing control command .

For instance certain operators may be restricted to certain control activities or restricted to controlling certain wireless devices. The authorization of control command may simply be a prompt to workstation computer to confirm whether the workstation user actually wishes to execute control activity on wireless device . Alternatively permission logic may parse operator ID and control activity from control command and correlate these parameters with a database of a plurality of operator IDs a plurality of control permissions and a plurality of wireless device identifications IDs in order to generate a permission decision that is used by lock manager control logic to control the transmission of the control command to the wireless device .

It should be noted however that the plurality of operator IDs the plurality of control permissions and the plurality of wireless device identifications IDs may be correlated in any manner. For example control command may contain an operator ID and a control activity that would update monitoring configuration for a particular one of the plurality of wireless device IDs . Permission logic may search the database of control permissions and operator IDs to determine if the operator was permitted to push a new configuration on the given wireless device .

Referring now to workstation computer may be operable to enable an authorized user e.g. workstation user to review data access report communicate with a user of wireless device download the PLM engine and or monitoring configuration file to wireless device and upload the data access log from the wireless device . Furthermore workstation user may via workstation computer issue commands to the wireless device that may for example be operable to apply at least one lock to disable enable at least portions of the functionality of the wireless device and or instructions to update configuration .

Workstation computer may comprise an input mechanism and an output mechanism interconnected to a computer platform . The input mechanism and the output mechanism may be similar to their respective counterparts and on wireless device .

The workstation computer may further comprise a memory for storing applications and data files a processing engine to execute the applications and process the data and a communications module operable to transmit and receive content between the workstation computer the user manager wireless device as well as any network component on wireless network . Furthermore the communications module may be operable to transmit voice over the network thereby allowing workstation user to engage in voice communications with a wireless device user or other authorized personnel.

Memory may further comprise an operator control module made executable by processing engine . As the number of operator workstations and the number of operators are non limiting an operator ID parameter previously discussed in reference to may be stored into memory and may be used to log on to the network and identify that operator to network components.

The operator control module may itself comprise lock management logic operable in conjunction with Graphic User Interface GUI logic input mechanism and output mechanism to guide the operator through an attack analysis and the selection and transmission of any control command . The GUI logic may control for example browser communications E mail communication text messaging voice communication report presentation as well providing a menu for selecting and transmitting any control command to the wireless device through the user manager .

The operator control module may further comprise a remote device control module similar to the remote device control module of the user manager and may similarly generate a control command operable on the wireless device to perform a variety of activities including but not limited to uploading data access log and the forwarding of a network stored version of PLM engine and or configuration to the wireless device .

Although the user of workstation computer may normally be a person e.g. workstation user the workstation may be a computing device comprising hardware software content and combinations thereof for analyzing and responding to report or to an external communication such as from the user of the wireless device . Such software may include algorithms decision making routines statistical programs etc. for analyzing and interpreting report . Further as with the data manager module the workstation computer may reside on any network device of wireless network such as on user manager another server connected to the network or even on a wireless device .

The workstation user or other authorized user may generate a new configuration or control command such as disable wireless device for the respective wireless device based on the information log and or on the report .

Additionally in some aspects the analysis performed by analyzer module may also be performed all or in part by the workstation user or user of the wireless device by manually reviewing the information log and or the report and or predetermined standard .

Referring back to network interface may be any mechanism that allows user manager and workstation computer to communicate across wireless network . For example network interface may include a local area network that connects user manager through an Internet Service Provider to the Internet which in turn may be connected to a respected wireless device through a carrier network and a base station.

Additionally referring to wireless network includes any communications network operable at least in part for enabling wireless communications between a respective wireless device and any other device connected to wireless network . Further wireless network may include all network components and all connected devices that form the network.

For example wireless network may include at least one or any combination of a cellular telephone network a terrestrial telephone network a satellite telephone network an infrared network such as an Infrared Data Association IrDA based network a short range wireless network a Bluetooth technology network a ZigBee protocol network an ultra wide band UWB protocol network a home radio frequency HomeRF network a shared wireless access protocol SWAP network a wideband network such as a wireless Ethernet compatibility alliance WECA network a wireless fidelity alliance Wi Fi Alliance network and a 802.11 network a public switched telephone network a public heterogeneous communications network such as the Internet a private communications network and land mobile radio network.

Referring to in some aspects system may be implemented within a cellular telephone system including wireless network connected to a wired network via a carrier network .

In system user manager may be in communication over a LAN network with a separate data repository for storing the protected data related information gathered from one or more remote wireless devices i.e. the respective data access log . Further a data management server may be in communication with user manager to provide post processing capabilities data flow control etc. User manager data repository and data management server may be present on the cellular network with any other network components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services.

User manager and or data management server communicate with carrier network through a data link such as the Internet a secure LAN WAN or other network. Carrier network controls messages generally being data packets sent to a mobile switching center MSC . Further carrier network communicates with MSC by a network such as the Internet and or POTS plain old telephone service . In some embodiments of network a network or Internet portion transfers data and the POTS portion transfers voice information.

MSC may be connected to multiple base stations BTS by another network e.g. a data network and or Internet portion for data transfer and a POTS portion for voice information. BTS may ultimately broadcast messages wirelessly to the wireless devices e.g. cellular telephones by short messaging service SMS or other over the air methods.

Referring to in some aspects a method for managing data access attempt on a wireless device may include loading at step at least a portion of a PLM engine onto a computer platform of a wireless device . For example the PLM engine may be embodied within the hardware and or firmware of the wireless device during the manufacture of the device. Alternatively the PLM engine may be pushed by a user manager to the wireless device or pulled from a user manager by the wireless device across a wireless network .

Furthermore the PLM engine may be pulled or pushed depending on whether or not the wireless device has the latest version of the PLM engine for the respective wireless device . In another alternative loading of the PLM engine may be implemented as a result of one of several events including but not limited to a change in the value of protected data activation of the wireless device and a reported problem with data access attempt.

Further at step at least a portion of a configuration may be loaded on the computer platform of the wireless device . For example the configuration may be embodied within the hardware and or firmware of the wireless device during the manufacture of the device. Alternatively the configuration may be loaded into memory by means of a static connection to the wireless device e.g. a hardwired connection to a PC.

Alternatively the configuration may be pushed by a user manager to the wireless device or pulled from a user manager by the wireless device across a wireless network . In another alternative loading of the configuration may be initiated in any manner for example being initiated by a predetermined event such as a change to the SID. In another alternative the pushing or pulling of the configuration to the wireless device may be configurable in any manner for example being initiated by a predetermined event such as the activation of the wireless device or being initiated by an event such as a technician receiving a report of a problem with data access attempt by the user of the wireless device or by the user of the wireless device .

Further at step data access information may be collected from the processing engine of the wireless device in accordance with the configuration . For example configuration may dictate the storage of predetermined data access information from processing engine and the appropriate subsystem of the wireless device during its operation in information log .

For example the wireless device may be configured by appropriate settings of one or more tracking parameter to log attempts by a wireless user to change carriers or to change the telephone number of the wireless device. In another aspect the wireless device may log attempts by a user to activate unauthorized features of the wireless device.

Optionally at step PLM control logic may compare the logged data access attempt with the predetermined activity standard in order to determine if there has been an unauthorized attempt to gain access to lock and or protected data . Based upon the results of the comparison the PLM engine may request further information or issue a control command to the wireless device processing engine to disable one or more functions of the wireless device . Furthermore there may be multiple levels of protection and standards by which the wireless device may for example just report a single attempt to access protected data as opposed to disable wireless functionality based upon multiple attempts. Further the wireless device may be configured to report certain logs immediately and report other logs during the normal course of operation. For example a situation wherein a user has attempted to change their SIN five time over the course of a week may not be sufficient to warrant transmitting an immediate notification to a user manager whereas five attempts to change an SIN over a one hour time period may result in user manager notification.

Further the PLM control logic may be operable to log all executed control commands and transmit the logged list of commands to a user manager or remote user based upon a reporting parameter .

Furthermore either alternatively or in addition to automatically issuing a command the PLM engine may at step forward the collected data access information and or data access log across the wireless network to a network device e.g. user manager . In one embodiment the data access log is uploaded from the wireless device to user manager in accordance with the configuration such as through a standard HTTP an FTP or some other data transfer protocol. In another embodiment a data service configuration is used to upload the information log across a channel that is not available to the user of the wireless device . In other embodiments the information log is uploaded from the wireless device using any communication means the wireless device may access.

At step wireless device may receive a control command transmitted from a remote device i.e. unit manager . This command may be in response to an analysis performed on the transmitted data access log and may be in some embodiments one or any combination of a request to the processing engine to disable all non emergency uses of the wireless device to transmit additional information and to receive a new configuration . Also in some aspects the command may be received over a limited data channel based upon a data service parameter as set in monitoring configuration .

At step wireless device control module may in some embodiments be operable to request verification of the source of the command prior to it execution. Verification may comprise opening a communication channel with user manager to verify the origin of the command .

Upon command verification or upon reception of the command if verification is not required processing engine is operable to execute command . An acknowledgment may be transmitted back to the originating device indicating implementation of the command .

Referring to in some aspects a method whereby a user manager manages programmable locks and protected data on a wireless device may optionally include at step generating a configuration that may be downloaded to a wireless device across a wireless network . For example configuration may be generated by operation of configuration generator and or some other portion of data manager module . The configuration may set configurable parameters in the wireless device that may be used to determine whether locks and or protected data has or is in danger of being compromised.

After generating the monitoring configuration at step the user manager may at step optionally forward the configuration to the wireless device or to another network device responsible for forwarding the configuration to the wireless device . In addition the PLM engine may not at this time be loaded onto the wireless device . Accordingly prior to downloading configuration the user manager may download or cause to be downloaded a version of the PLM engine to the memory of the wireless device . The PLM engine as well as the configuration may be transmitted over a limited service data channel defined by data service parameter .

In some embodiments of the lock management system of the user manager is operable to wait until a wireless device notifies the user manager that data access information and or data access log is ready to be uploaded. In other embodiments the user manager is operable to poll a wireless device requesting the contents of data access log .

Regardless of whether data access information and or data access log is pushed or pulled the data manager module is operable at step to receive from across a network data access information and or data access log from a wireless device and store the data in an information repository module that may be part of the user manager . Furthermore data access information and or data access log may be received either as a whole or in pieces and assembled by the user manager . Alternatively information repository module may be stored on any accessible network device.

Upon receipt of data access information and or data access log data manager module is operable at step to generate a data access report detailing at least portions of the data in data access information and or data access log . For example report generator may process multiple sets of data access information and or data access log received from a plurality of wireless devices and generate a composite report . For example the composite report may be based upon one or any combination of for example SID numbers the activity being reported in each log the lock for which the activity was detected and the time of the activity. The report or notification of the availability of the report may be communicated to a predetermined network device e.g. workstation computer or an authorized user e.g. workstation user . For example the report may be transmitted via electronic mail or an authorized user may access the user manager or repository of the report to view the generated report.

In other embodiments in order to minimize operator workload the received data access information and or data access log may be analyzed for example by analyzer prior to notifying an operator in order to determine whether a lock or protected data has been compromised or an attempt has been made to access restricted data on wireless device . For example in some embodiments analyzer may comprise predetermined activity standards for analyzing the information stored in data access information and or data access log .

Optionally in some aspects at step the user manger may generate and or receive a control command based on report . For example remote device control module may be operable to generate control command operable to disable all but emergency features of the wireless device . In the case of receiving the command the control command may be generated by another network device e.g. workstation computer . Control command may be intended for a particular wireless device based on the corresponding data access report produced based on the data access information from that device. For example the particular wireless device may be specified by wireless ID e.g. a SID or other uniquely identifying feature. In some aspects the authenticity and or validity of control command may be verified.

Optionally in some aspects data manager module may be configured to transmit at step control command to the wireless device based upon results of the analysis performed by analyzer . For example remote device control module may be operable to generate control command operable to disable all but emergency features of the wireless device and transmit the command over a limited service communication channel based upon data service parameters stored in monitoring configuration .

As noted above the user manager may be configured to determine the validity of the received command prior to transmitting the control command . For example a user manager resident remote device control module is operable based upon permission logic a list comprising a plurality of controls a list comprising a plurality of authorized operator IDs and a list comprising a plurality of wireless device IDs to determine a permission decision that indicates the validity of the control command as it pertains to the specific wireless device addressed in the command .
