The present invention relates to newly identified polynucleotides polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides antibodies specific for such polypeptides the use of such antibodies as well as the production of such antibodies. The polypeptides of the present invention have been identified as members of the vascular endothelial growth factor family. More particularly the polypeptides of the present invention are human vascular endothelial growth factor 2 VEGF 2 . Antibodies of the invention are specific for such VEGF 2 polypeptides. The invention also relates to inhibiting the action of such polypeptides.

The formation of new blood vessels or angiogenesis is essential for embryonic development subsequent growth and tissue repair. Angiogenesis is also an essential part of certain pathological conditions such as neoplasia i.e. tumors and gliomas . Abnormal angiogenesis is associated with other diseases such as inflammation rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis and diabetic retinopathy Folkman J. and Klagsbrun M. 235 442 447 1987 .

Both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factor molecules are mitogens for endothelial cells and other cell types. Angiotropin and angiogenin can induce angiogenesis although their functions are unclear Folkman J. Lea and Febiger Press pp. 153 170 1993 . A highly selective mitogen for vascular endothelial cells is vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF Ferrara N. et al. 13 19 32 1992 which is also known as vascular permeability factor VPF .

Vascular endothelial growth factor is a secreted angiogenic mitogen whose target cell specificity appears to be restricted to vascular endothelial cells. The murine VEGF gene has been characterized and its expression pattern in embryogenesis has been analyzed. A persistent expression of VEGF was observed in epithelial cells adjacent to fenestrated endothelium e.g. in choroid plexus and kidney glomeruli. The data was consistent with a role of VEGF as a multifunctional regulator of endothelial cell growth and differentiation Breier G. et al. 1.14 521 532 1992 .

VEGF shares sequence homology with human platelet derived growth factors PDGFa and PDGFb Leung D. W. et al. 246 1306 1309 1989 . The extent of homology is about 21 and 23 respectively. Eight cysteine residues contributing to disulfide bond formation are strictly conserved in these proteins. Although they are similar there are specific differences between VEGF and PDGF. While PDGF is a major growth factor for connective tissue VEGF is highly specific for endothelial cells. Alternatively spliced mRNAs have been identified for both VEGF PLGF and PDGF and these different splicing products differ in biological activity and in receptor binding specificity. VEGF and PDGF function as homo dimers or hetero dimers and bind to receptors which elicit intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity following receptor dimerization.

VEGF has four different forms of 121 165 189 and 206 amino acids due to alternative splicing. VEGF121 and VEGF165 are soluble and are capable of promoting angiogenesis whereas VEGF189 and VEGF 206 are bound to heparin containing proteoglycans in the cell surface. The temporal and spatial expression of VEGF has been correlated with physiological proliferation of the blood vessels Gajdusek C. M. and Carbon S. J. 139 570 579 1989 McNeil P. L. et al. 109 811 822 1989 . Its high affinity binding sites are localized only on endothelial cells in tissue sections Jakeman L. B. et al. 89 244 253 1989 . The factor can be isolated from pituitary cells and several tumor cell lines and has been implicated in some human gliomas Plate K. H. 359 845 848 1992 . Interestingly expression of VEGF121 or VEGF165 confers on Chinese hamster ovary cells the ability to form tumors in nude mice Ferrara N. et al. 91 160 170 1993 . The inhibition of VEGF function by anti VEGF monoclonal antibodies was shown to inhibit tumor growth in immune deficient mice Kim K. J. 362 841 844 1993 . Further a dominant negative mutant of the VEGF receptor has been shown to inhibit growth of glioblastomas in mice.

Vascular permeability factor VPF has also been found to be responsible for persistent microvascular hyperpermeability to plasma proteins even after the cessation of injury which is a characteristic feature of normal wound healing. This suggests that VPF is an important factor in wound healing. Brown L. F. et al. 176 1375 1379 1992 .

The expression of VEGF is high in vascularized tissues e.g. lung heart placenta and solid tumors and correlates with angiogenesis both temporally and spatially. VEGF has also been shown to induce angiogenesis in vivo. Since angiogenesis is essential for the repair of normal tissues especially vascular tissues VEGF has been proposed for use in promoting vascular tissue repair e.g. in atherosclerosis 

U.S. Pat. No. 5 073 492 issued Dec. 17 1991 to Chen et al. discloses a method for synergistically enhancing endothelial cell growth in an appropriate environment which comprises adding to the environment VEGF effectors and serum derived factor. Also vascular endothelial cell growth factor C sub unit DNA has been prepared by polymerase chain reaction techniques. The DNA encodes a protein that may exist as either a heterodimer or homodimer. The protein is a mammalian vascular endothelial cell mitogen and as such is useful for the promotion of vascular development and repair as disclosed in European Patent Application No. 92302750.2 published Sep. 30 1992.

These and other aspects of the present invention should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there are provided isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding a VEGF 2 polypeptide having the deduced amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 which was determined by sequencing a cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 was obtained by sequencing a cDNA clone which was deposited on May 12 1995 at the American Type Tissue Collection ATCC 10801 University Boulevard Manassas Va. 20110 2209 and given ATCC Deposit No. 97149.

In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there are provided isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide encoding a truncated VEGF 2 polypeptide having the deduced amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 4 which was determined by sequencing a cloned cDNA. The nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 3 was obtained by sequencing a cDNA clone which was deposited on Mar. 4 1994 at the American Type Tissue Collection ATCC 10801 University Boulevard Manassas Va. 20110 2209 and given ATCC Deposit Number 75698.

Unless otherwise indicated all nucleotide sequences determined by sequencing a DNA molecule herein were determined using an automated DNA sequencer such as the Model 373 from Applied Biosystems Inc. and all amino acid sequences of polypeptides encoded by DNA molecules determined herein were predicted by translation of a DNA sequence determined as above. Therefore as is known in the art for any DNA sequence determined by this automated approach any nucleotide sequence determined herein may contain some errors Nucleotide sequences determined by automation are typically at least about 90 identical more typically at least about 95 to at least about 99.9 identical to the actual nucleotide sequence of the sequenced DNA molecule. The actual sequence can be more precisely determined by other approaches including manual DNA sequencing methods well known in the art. As is also known in the art a single insertion or deletion in a determined nucleotide sequence compared to the actual sequence will cause a frame shift in translation of the nucleotide sequence such that the predicted amino acid sequence encoded by a determined nucleotide sequence will be completely different from the amino acid sequence actually encoded by the sequenced DNA molecule beginning at the point of such an insertion or deletion.

A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention may be obtained from early stage human embryo week 8 to 9 osteoclastomas adult heart or several breast cancer cell lines. The polynucleotide of this invention was discovered in a cDNA library derived from early stage human embryo week 9. It is structurally related to the VEGF PDGF family. It contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of about 419 amino acid residues of which approximately the first 23 amino acid residues are the putative leader sequence such that the mature protein comprises 396 amino acids and which protein exhibits the highest amino acid sequence homology to human vascular endothelial growth factor 30 identity followed by PDGFa 24 and PDGFb 22 See . It is particularly important that all eight cysteines are conserved within all four members of the family see boxed areas of . In addition the signature for the PDGF VEGF family PXCVXXXRCXGCCN SEQ ID NO 8 is conserved in VEGF 2 see . The homology between VEGF 2 VEGF and the two PDGFs is at the protein sequence level. No nucleotide sequence homology can be detected and therefore it would be difficult to isolate the VEGF 2 through simple approaches such as low stringency hybridization.

The VEGF 2 polypeptide of the present invention is meant to include the full length polypeptide and polynucleotide sequence which encodes for any leader sequences and for active fragments of the fall length polypeptide. Active fragments are meant to include any portions of the full length amino acid sequence which have less than the full 419 amino acids of the full length amino acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 2 but still contain the eight cysteine residues shown conserved in and that still have VEGF 2 activity.

There are at least two alternatively spliced VEGF 2 mRNA sequences present in normal tissues. The two bands in lane 5 indicate the presence of the alternatively spliced mRNA encoding the VEGF 2 polypeptide of the present invention.

The polynucleotide of the present invention may be in the form of RNA or in the form of DNA which DNA includes cDNA genomic DNA and synthetic DNA. The DNA may be double stranded or single stranded and if single stranded may be the coding strand or non coding anti sense strand. The coding sequence which encodes the mature polypeptide may be identical to the coding sequence shown in or or that of the deposited clones or may be a different coding sequence which as a result of the redundancy or degeneracy of the genetic code encodes the same mature polypeptide as the DNA of or the deposited cDNAs.

The polynucleotide which encodes for the mature polypeptide of or or for the mature polypeptides encoded by the deposited cDNAs may include only the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and additional coding sequences such as a leader or secretory sequence or a proprotein sequence the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide and optionally additional coding sequences and non coding sequences such as introns or non coding sequence 5 and or 3 of the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide.

Thus the term polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide encompasses a polynucleotide which includes only coding sequences for the polypeptide as well as a polynucleotide which includes additional coding and or non coding sequences.

The present invention further relates to variants of the hereinabove described polynucleotides which encode for fragments analogs and derivatives of the polypeptide having the deduced amino acid sequence of or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of the deposited clones. The variant of the polynucleotide may be a naturally occurring allelic variant of the polynucleotide or a non naturally occurring variant of the polynucleotide.

Thus the present invention includes polynucleotides encoding the same mature polypeptide as shown in or the same mature polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of the deposited clones as well as variants of such polynucleotides which variants encode for a fragment derivative or analog of the polypeptides of or the polypeptide encoded by the cDNA of the deposited clones. Such nucleotide variants include deletion variants substitution variants and addition or insertion variants.

As hereinabove indicated the polynucleotide may have a coding sequence which is a naturally occurring allelic variant of the coding sequence shown in or of the coding sequence of the deposited clones. As known in the art an allelic variant is an alternate form of a polynucleotide sequence which have a substitution deletion or addition of one or more nucleotides which does not substantially alter the function of the encoded polypeptide.

The present invention also includes polynucleotides wherein the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide may be fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids in expression and secretion of a polypeptide from a host cell for example a leader sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell. The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a preprotein and may have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the mature form of the polypeptide. The polynucleotides may also encode for a proprotein which is the mature protein plus additional 5 amino acid residues. A mature protein having a prosequence is a proprotein and is an inactive form of the protein. Once the prosequence is cleaved an active mature protein remains.

Thus for example the polynucleotide of the present invention may encode for a mature protein or for a protein having a prosequence or for a protein having both a prosequence and presequence leader sequence .

The polynucleotides of the present invention may also have the coding sequence fused in frame to a marker sequence which allows for purification of the polypeptide of the present invention. The marker sequence may be a hexa histidine tag supplied by a pQE 9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host or for example the marker sequence may be a hemagglutinin HA tag when a mammalian host e.g. COS 7 cells is used. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson I. et al. 37 767 1984 .

Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical and more preferably at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 2 b a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino kid sequence in SEQ ID NO 2 but lacking the N terminal methionine c a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions from about 1 to about 396 in SEQ ID NO 2 d a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97149 e a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature VEGF 2 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 97149 or f a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the nucleotide sequences in a b c d or e .

Further embodiments of the invention include isolated nucleic acid molecules comprising a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical and more preferably at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 4 b a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence in SEQ ID NO 4 but lacking the N terminal methionine c a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence at positions from about 1 to about 326 in SEQ ID NO 4 d a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 75698 e a nucleotide sequence encoding the mature VEGF 2 polypeptide having the amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA clone contained in ATCC Deposit No. 75698 or f a nucleotide sequence complementary to any of the nucleotide sequences in a b c d or e .

By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence encoding a VEGF 2 polypeptide is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the VEGF 2 polypeptide. In other words to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted Into the reference sequence. These mutations of the reference sequence may occur at the 5N or 3N terminal positions of the reference nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule is at least 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 or 3 or to the nucleotides sequence of the deposited cDNA clone s can be determined conventionally using known computer programs such as the Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 . Bestfit uses the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 to find the best segment of homology between two sequences. When using Bestfit or any other sequence alignment program to determine whether a particular sequence is for instance 95 identical to a reference sequence according to the present invention the parameters are set of course such that the percentage of identity is calculated over the full length of the reference nucleotide sequence and that gaps in homology of up to 5 of the total number of nucleotides in the reference sequence are allowed.

As described in detail below the polypeptides of the present invention can be used to raise polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies which are useful in diagnostic assays for detecting VEGF 2 protein expression as described below or as agonists and antagonists capable of enhancing or inhibiting VEGF 2 protein function. Further such polypeptides can be used in the yeast two hybrid system to capture VEGF 2 protein binding proteins which are also candidate agonist and antagonist according to the present invention. The yeast two hybrid system is described in Fields and Song Nature 340 245 246 1989 .

In another aspect the invention provides a peptide or polypeptide comprising an epitope bearing portion of a polypeptide of the invention. As to the selection of peptides or polypeptides bearing an antigenic epitope i.e. that contain a region of a protein molecule to which an antibody can bind it is well known in that art that relatively short synthetic peptides that mimic part of a protein sequence are routinely capable of eliciting an antiserum that reacts with the partially mimicked protein. See for instance Sutcliffe J. G. Shinnick T. M. Green N. and Learner R. A. 1983 Antibodies that react with predetermined sites on proteins. Science 219 660 666. Peptides capable of eliciting protein reactive sera are frequently represented in the primary sequence of a protein can be characterized by a set of simple chemical rules and are confined neither to immunodominant regions of intact proteins i.e. immunogenic epitopes nor to the amino or carboxyl terminals. Peptides that are extremely hydrophobic and those of six or fewer residues generally are ineffective at inducing antibodies that bind to the mimicked protein longer soluble peptides especially those containing proline residues usually are effective. Sutcliffe et al. supra at 661. For instance 18 of 20 peptides designed according to these guidelines containing 8 39 residues covering 75 of the sequence of the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA1 polypeptide chain induced antibodies that reacted with the HA1 protein or intact virus and 12 12 peptides from the MuLV polymerase and 18 18 from the rabies glycoprotein induced antibodies that precipitated the respective proteins.

Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are therefore useful to raise antibodies including monoclonal antibodies that bind specifically to a polypeptide of the invention. Thus a high proportion of hybridomas obtained by fusion of spleen cells from donors immunized with an antigen epitope bearing peptide generally secrete antibody reactive with the native protein. Sutcliffe et al. supra at 663. The antibodies raised by antigenic epitope bearing peptides or polypeptides are useful to detect the mimicked protein and antibodies to different peptides may be used for tracking the fate of various regions of a protein precursor which undergoes post translational processing. The peptide and anti peptide antibodies may be used in a variety of qualitative or quantitative assays for the mimicked protein for instance in competition assays since it has been shown that even short peptides e.g. about 9 amino acids can bind and displace the larger peptides in immunoprecipitation assays. See for instance Wilson et al. 37 767 778 1984 at 777. The anti peptide antibodies of the invention also are useful for purification of the mimicked protein for instance by adsorption chromatography using methods well known in the art.

Antigenic epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention designed according to the above guidelines preferably contain a sequence of at least seven more preferably at least nine and most preferably between about 15 to about 30 amino acids contained within the amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention. However peptides or polypeptides comprising a larger portion of an amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention containing about 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 or 150 amino acids or any length up to and including the entire amino acid sequence of a polypeptide of the invention also are considered epitope bearing peptides or polypeptides of the invention and also are useful for inducing antibodies that react with the mimicked protein. Preferably the amino acid sequence of the epitope bearing peptide is selected to provide substantial solubility in aqueous solvents i.e. the sequence includes relatively hydrophilic residues and highly hydrophobic sequences are preferably avoided and sequences containing proline residues are particularly preferred 

Non limiting examples of antigenic polypeptides or peptides that can be used to generate VEGF 2 specific antibodies include the following a polypeptide comprising amino acid residues from about leu 37 to about glu 45 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Tyr 58 to about Gly 66 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Gln 73 to about Glu 81 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Asp 100 to about Cys 108 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Gly 140 to about Leu 148 in SEQ ID NO.2 from about Pro 168 to about Val 176 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about His 183 to about Lys 191 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Ile 201 to about Thr 209 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Ala 216 to about Tyr 224 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Asp 244 to about His 254 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Gly 258 to about Glu 266 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Cys 272 to about Ser 280 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Pro 283 to about Ser 291 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Cys 296 to about Gln 304 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Ala 307 to about Cys 316 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Val 319 to about Cys 335 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Cys 339 to about Leu 347 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Cys 360 to about Glu 373 in SEQ ID NO 2 from about Tyr 378 to about Val 386 in SEQ ID NO 2 and from about Ser 388 to about Ser 396 in SEQ ID NO 2. These polypeptide fragments have been determined to bear antigenic epitopes of the VEGF 2 protein by the analysis of the Jameson Wolf antigenic index.

The epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention may be produced by any conventional means for making peptides or polypeptides including recombinant means using nucleic acid molecules of the invention. For instance a short epitope bearing amino acid sequence may be fused to a larger polypeptide that acts as a carrier during recombinant production and purification as well as during immunization to produce anti peptide antibodies. Epitope bearing peptides also may be synthesized using known methods of chemical synthesis. For instance Houghten has described a simple method for synthesis of large numbers of peptides such as 10 20 mg of 248 different 13 residue peptides representing single amino acid variants of a segment of the HA1 polypeptide which were prepared and characterized by ELISA type binding studies in less than four weeks. Houghten R. A. 1985 General method for the rapid solid phase synthesis of large numbers of peptides specificity of antigen antibody interaction at the level of individual amino acids. . USA 82 5131 5135. This Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis SNIPS process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 to Houghten et al. 1986 . In this procedure the individual resins for the solid phase synthesis of various peptides are contained in separate solvent permeable packets enabling the optimal use of the many identical repetitive steps involved in solid phase methods. A completely manual procedure allows. 500 1000 or more syntheses to be conducted simultaneously. Houghten et al. supra at 5134.

Epitope bearing peptides and polypeptides of the invention are used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art. See for instance Sutcliffe of al. supra Wilson et al. supra Chow M. et al. 82 910 914 and Bittle F. J. et al. 66 2347 2354 1985 . Generally animals may be immunized with free peptide however anti peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling of the peptide to a macromolecular carrier such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin KLH or tetanus toxoid. For instance peptides containing cysteine may be coupled to carrier using a linker such as m maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS while other peptides may be coupled to carrier using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier coupled peptides for instance by intraperitoneal and or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 mg peptide or carrier protein and Freund s adjuvant. Several booster injections may be needed for instance at intervals of about two weeks to provide a useful titer of anti peptide antibody which can be detected for example by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti peptide antibodies for instance by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.

Immunogenic epitope bearing peptides of the invention i.e. those parts of a protein that elicit an antibody response when the whole protein is the immunogen are identified according to methods known in the art. For instance Geysen et al. supra discloses a procedure for rapid concurrent synthesis on solid supports of hundreds of peptides of sufficient purity to react in an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Interaction of synthesized peptides with antibodies is then easily detected without removing them from the support. In this manner a peptide bearing an immunogenic epitope of a desired protein may be identified routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art. For instance the immunologically important epitope in the coat protein of foot and mouth disease virus was located by Geysen et al. with a resolution of seven amino acids by synthesis of an overlapping set of all 208 possible hexapeptides covering the entire 213 amino acid sequence of the protein. Then a complete replacement set of peptides in which all 20 amino acids were substituted in turn at every position within the epitope were synthesized and the particular amino acids conferring specificity for the reaction with antibody were determined. Thus peptide analogs of the epitope bearing peptides of the invention can be made routinely by this method. U.S. Pat. No. 4 708 781 to Geysen 1987 further describes this method of identifying a peptide bearing an immunogenic epitope of a desired protein.

Further still U.S. Pat. No. 5 194 392 to Geysen 1990 describes a general method of detecting or determining the sequence of monomers amino acids or other compounds which is a topological equivalent of the epitope i.e. a Amimotope which is complementary to a particular paratope antigen binding site of an antibody of interest. More generally U.S. Pat. No. 4 433 092 to Geysen 1989 describes a method of detecting or determining a sequence of monomers which is a topographical equivalent of a ligand which is complementary to the ligand binding site of a particular receptor of interest. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. 5 480 971 to Houghten R. A. et al. 1996 on Peralkylated Oligopeptide Mixtures discloses linear C C alkyl peralkylated oligopeptides and sets and libraries of such peptides as well as methods for using such oligopeptide sets and libraries for determining the sequence of a peralkylated oligopeptide that preferentially binds to an acceptor molecule of interest. Thus non peptide analogs of The epitope bearing peptides of the invention also can be made routinely by these methods.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate VEGF 2 polypeptides of the present invention and the epitope bearing fragments thereof described above can be combined with parts of the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgG resulting in chimeric polypeptides. These fusion proteins facilitate purification and show an increased half life in vivo. This has been shown e.g. for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins EPA 394 827 Traunecker et al. 331 84 86 1988 .

In accordance with the present invention novel variants of VEGF 2 are also described. These can be produced by deleting or substituting one or more amino acids of VEGF 2. Natural mutations are called allelic variations. Allelic variations can be silent no change in the encoded polypeptide or may have altered amino acid sequence.

In order to attempt to improve or alter the characteristics of native VEGF 2 protein engineering may be employed. Recombinant DNA technology known to those skilled in the art can be used to create novel polypeptides. Muteins and deletions can show e.g. enhanced activity or increased stability. In addition they could be purified in higher yield and show better solubility at least under certain purification and storage conditions. Set forth below are examples of mutations that can be constructed.

Furthermore VECF 2 appears to be proteolytically cleaved upon expression resulting in polypeptide fragments of the following sizes when run on a SDS PAGE gel sizes area approximate See for example 80 59 45 43 41 40 39 38 37 36 31 29 21 and 15 kDa. These polypeptide fragments are the result of proteolytic cleavage at both the N terminal and C terminal portions of the protein. These proteolytically generated fragments appears to have activity particularly the 21 kDa fragment.

In addition protein engineering may be employed in order to improve or alter one or more characteristics of native VEGF 2. The deletion of carboxyterminal amino acids can enhance the activity of proteins. One example is interferon gamma that shows up to ten times higher activity by deleting ten amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of the protein Dobeli et al. 7 199 216 1988 . Thus one aspect of the invention is to provide polypeptide analogs of VEGF 2 and nucleotide sequences encoding such analogs that exhibit enhanced stability e.g. when exposed to typical pH thermal conditions or other storage conditions relative to the native VEGF 2 polypeptide.

19 F 9 to A 18 F 9 to D 17 F 9 to S 16 F 9 to L 15 of SEQ ID NO 2. Specifically preferred is the polypeptide fragment comprising amino acid residues F 9 to R 203 of SEQ ID NO 2 as well as polynucleotides encoding this polypeptide. This F 9 to R 203 of SEQ ID NO 2 polypeptide preferably is associated with a S 205 to S 396 of SEQ ID NO 2 polypeptide. Association may be through disulfide covalent or noncovalent interactions by linkage via a linker e.g. serine glycine proline linkages or by an antibody.

Many polynucleotide sequences such as EST sequences are publicly available and accessible through sequence databases. Some of these sequences are related to SEQ ID NO 1 and may have been publicly available prior to conception of the present invention. Preferably such related polynucleotides are specifically excluded from the scope of the present invention. To list every related sequence would be cumbersome. Accordingly preferably excluded from the present invention are one or more polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence described by the general formula of a b where a is any integer between 1 to 1660 of SEQ ID NO 1 b is an integer of 15 to 1674 where both a and b correspond to the positions of nucleotide residues shown in SEQ ID NO 1 and where the b is greater than or equal to a 14.

Thus in one aspect N terminal deletion mutants are provided by the present invention. Such mutants include those comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 18 except for a deletion of at least the first 24 N terminal amino acid residues i.e. a deletion of at least Met 1 Glu 24 but not more than the first 115 N terminal amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO 18 . Alternatively first 24 N terminal amino acid residues i.e. a deletion of at least Met 1 Glu 24 but not more than the first 103 N terminal amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO 18 etc.

In another aspect C terminal deletion mutants are provided by the present invention. Such mutants include those comprising the amino acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 18 except for a deletion of at least the last C terminal amino acid residue Ser 419 but not more than the last 220 C terminal amino acid residues i.e. a deletion of amino acid residues Val 199 Ser 419 of SEQ ID NO 18 . Alternatively the deletion will include at least the last C terminal amino acid residue but not more than the last 216 C terminal amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO 18 . Alternatively the deletion will include at least the last C terminal amino acid residue but not more than the last 204 C terminal amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO 18 .

Alternatively the deletion will include at least the last C terminal amino acid residues but not more than the last 52 C terminal amino acid residues of SEQ ID NO 18 .

In yet another aspect also included by the present invention are deletion mutants having amino acids deleted from both the N terminal and C terminal residues. Such mutants include all combinations of the N terminal deletion mutants and C terminal deletion mutants described above.

The term gene means the segment of DNA involved in producing a polypeptide chain it includes regions preceding and following the coding region leader and trailer as well as intervening sequences introns between individual coding segments exons .

The present invention is further directed to fragments of the isolated nucleic acid molecules described herein. By a fragment of an isolated nucleic acid molecule having the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA s or the nucleotide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 is intended fragments at least about 15 nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably at least about 40 nt in length which are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed herein. Of course larger fragments of 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350 375 400 425 450 475 500 525 550 575 600 625 650 675 700 725 750 775 800 825 850 875 900 925 950 975 1000 1025 1050 1075 1100 1125 1150 1175 1200 1225 1250 1275 1300 1325 1350 1375 1400 1425 1450 1475 1500 1525 1550 1575 1600 1625 1650 or 1674 nt in length are also useful according to the present invention as are fragments corresponding to most if not all of the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA s or as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3. By a fragment at least 20 nt in length for example is intended fragments which include 20 or more contiguous bases from the nucleotide sequence of the deposited cDNA s or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 or 3.

Moreover representative examples of VEGF 2 polynucleotide fragments include for example fragments having a sequence from about nucleotide number 1 50 51 100 101 150 151 200 201 250 251 300 301 350 351 400 401 450 451 500 501 550 551 600 651 700 701 750 751 800 800 850 851 900 901 950 or 951 to the end of SEQ ID NO 1 or the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 nucleotides at either terminus or at both termini. Preferably these fragments encode a polypeptide which has biological activity.

Fragments of the full length gene of the present invention may be used as a hybridization probe for a cDNA library to isolate the full length cDNA and to isolate other cDNAs which have a high sequence similarity to the gene or similar biological activity. Probes of this type preferably have at least 30 bases and may contain for example 50 or more bases. The probe may also be used to identify a cDNA clone corresponding to a full length transcript and a genomic clone or clones that contain the complete gene including regulatory and promoter regions exons and introns. An example of a screen comprises isolating the coding region of the gene by using the known DNA sequence to synthesize an oligonucleotide probe. Labeled oligonucleotides having a sequence complementary to that of the gene of the present invention are used to screen a library of human cDNA genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of the library the probe hybridizes to.

A VEGF 2 polynucleotide also includes those polynucleotides capable of hybridizing under stringent hybridization conditions to sequences contained in SEQ ID NO 1 or for instance the cDNA clone s contained in ATCC Deposit Nos. 97149 or 75698 the complement thereof Stringent hybridization conditions refers to an overnight incubation at 42 C. in a solution comprising 50 formamide 5 SSC 750 mM NaCl 75 mM sodium citrate 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.6 5 Denhardt s solution 10 dextran sulfate and 20 g ml denatured sheared salmon sperm DNA followed by washing the filters in 0.1 SSC at about 65 C.

Also contemplated are nucleic acid molecules that hybridize to the VEGF 2 polynucleotides at lower stringency hybridization conditions. Changes in the stringency of hybridization and signal detection are primarily accomplished through the manipulation of formamide concentration lower percentages of formamide result in lowered stringency salt conditions or temperature. For example lower stringency conditions include an overnight incubation at 37 C. in a solution comprising 6 SSPE 20 SSPE 3M NaCl 0.2M NaHPO 0.02M EDTA pH 7.4 0.5 SUS 30 formamide 100 ug ml salmon sperm blocking DNA followed by washes at 50 C. with 1 SSPE 0.1 SDS. In addition to achieve even lower stringency washes performed following stringent hybridization can be done at higher salt concentrations e.g. 5 SSC .

Note that variations in the above conditions may be accomplished through the inclusion and or substitution of alternate blocking reagents used to suppress background in hybridization experiments. Typical blocking reagents include Denhardt s reagent BLOTTO heparin denatured salmon sperm DNA and commercially available proprietary formulations. The inclusion of specific blocking reagents may require modification of the hybridization conditions described above due to problems with compatibility.

Of course a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to polyA sequences such as any 3 terminal polyA tract of a cDNA shown in the sequence listing or to a complementary stretch of T or U residues would not be included in the definition of polynucleotide since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or the complement thereof e.g. practically any double stranded cDNA clone .

By a polynucleotide which hybridizes to a portion of a polynucleolide is intended a polynucleotide either DNA or RNA hybridizing to at least about 15 nucleotides nt and more preferably at least about 20 nt still more preferably at least about 30 nt and even more preferably about 30 70 nt of the reference polynucleotide. These are useful as diagnostic probes and primers as discussed above and in more detail below.

By a portion of a polynucleotide of at least 20 nt in length for example is intended 20 or more contiguous nucleotides from the nucleotide sequence of the reference polynucleotide e.g. the deposited cDNA or the nucleotide sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO 1 . Of course a polynucleotide which hybridizes only to a poly A sequence such as the 3N terminal poly A tract of the VEGF 2 cDNA shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 or 3 or to a complementary stretch of T or U resides would not be included in a polynucleotide of the invention used to hybridize to a portion of a nucleic acid of the invention since such a polynucleotide would hybridize to any nucleic acid molecule containing a poly A stretch or the complement thereof e.g. practically any double stranded cDNA clone .

The present application is directed to nucleic acid molecules at least 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ JD NOS 1 or 3 or to the nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNA s irrespective of whether they encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 activity. This is because even where a particular nucleic acid molecule does not encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 activity one of skill in the art would still know how to use the nucleic acid molecule for instance as a hybridization probe or a polymerase chain reaction PCR primer. Uses of the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention that do not encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 activity include inter alia 1 isolating the VEGF 2 gene or allelic variants thereof in a cDNA library 2 in situ hybridization e.g. FISH to metaphase chromosomal spreads to provide precise chromosomal location of the VEGF 2 gene as described in Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 and Northern Blot analysis for detecting VEGF 2 mRNA expression in specific tissues.

Preferred however are nucleic acid molecules having sequences at least 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NOS 1 or 3 or to a nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNA s which do in fact encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 protein activity. By a polypeptide having VEGF 2 activity is intended polypeptides exhibiting VEGF 2 activity in a particular biological assay. For example VEGF 2 protein activity can be measured using for example mitogenic assays and endothelial cell migration assays. See e.g. Olofsson et al. 93 2576 2581 1996 and Joukov et al. 5 290 298 1996 .

Of course due to the degeneracy of the genetic code one of ordinary skill in the art will immediately recognize that a large number of the nucleic acid molecules having a sequence at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a nucleic acid sequence of the deposited cDNA s or the nucleic acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 will encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 protein activity. In fact since degenerate variants of these nucleotide sequences all encode the same polypeptide this will be clear to the skilled artisan even without performing the above described comparison assay. It will be further recognized in the art that for such nucleic acid molecules that are not degenerate variants a reasonable number will also encode a polypeptide having VEGF 2 protein activity. This is because the skilled artisan is fully aware of amino acid substitutions that are either less likely or not likely to significantly effect protein function e.g. replacing one aliphatic amino acid with a second aliphatic amino acid .

For example guidance concerning how to make phenotypically silent amino acid substitutions is provided in Bowie J. U. et al. Deciphering the Message in Protein Sequences Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions 247 1306 1310 1990 wherein the authors indicate that proteins are surprisingly tolerant of amino acid substitutions.

Thus the present invention is directed to polynucleotides having at least a 70 identity preferably at least 90 and more preferably at least a 95 96 97 or 98 identity to a polynucleotide which encodes the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS 2 or 4 as well as fragments thereof which fragments have at least 30 bases and preferably at least 50 bases and to polypeptides encoded by such polynucleotides.

 Identity per se has an art recognized meaning and can be calculated using published techniques. See e.g. COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Lesk A.M. ed. Oxford University Press New. York 1988 BIOCOMPUTING INFORMATICS AND GENOME PROJECTS Smith D. W. ed. Academic Press New York 1993 COMPUTER ANALYSIS OF SEQUENCE DATA PART I Griffin A.M. and Griffin H. G. eds. Humana Press New Jersey 1994 SEQUENCE ANALYSIS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY von Heinje G. Academic Press 1987 and SEQUENCE ANALYSIS PRIMER. Gribskov M. and Devereux J. eds. M Stockton Press New York 1991 . While there exists a number of methods to measure identity between two polynucleotide or polypeptide sequences the term identity is well known to skilled artisans. Carillo H. and Lipton D. 48 1073 1988 . Methods commonly employed to determine identity or similarity between two sequences include but are not limited to those disclosed in Guide to Huge Computers Martin J. Bishop ed. Academic Press San Diego 1994 and Carillo and Lipton D. 48 1073 1988 . Methods for aligning polynucleotides Or polypeptides are codified in computer programs including the GCG program package Devereux J. et al. 12 1 387 1984 BLASTP BLASTN FASTA Atschul S. F. et al. 215 403 1990 Bestfit program Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package Version 8 for Unix Genetics Computer Group University Research Park 575 Science Drive Madison Wis. 53711 using the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman 2 482 489 1981 . By a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least for example 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence of the present invention it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotide is identical to the reference sequence except that the polynucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence encoding the VEGF 2 polypeptide. In other words to obtain a polynucleotide having a nucleotide sequence at least 95 identical to a reference nucleotide sequence up to 5 of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide or a number of nucleotides up to 5 of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be an entire sequence SEQ ID NO 1 the ORF open reading frame or any fragment specified as described herein.

As a practical matter whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to a nucleotide sequence of the presence invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. 6 237 245 1990 . In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U s to T s. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are Matrix Unitary k tuple 4 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 30 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence whichever is shorter.

If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5 or 3 deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5 and 3 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5 or 3 ends relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5 and 3 bases of the subject sequence as displayed by the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score.

For example a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5 end of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched alignment of the first 10 bases at 5 end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10 of the sequence number of bases at the 5 and 3 ends not matched total number of bases in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5 or 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only bases 5 and 3 of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.

By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least for example 95 identical to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to five amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95 identical to a query amino acid sequence up to 5 of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted deleted indels or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence.

As a practical matter whether any particular polypeptide is at least 90 95 96 97 98 or 99 identical to for instance the amino acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 SEQ ID NO 18 or to the amino acid sequence encoded by deposited DNA clones can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence a sequence of the present invention and a subject sequence also referred to as a global sequence alignment can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. . 1990 6 237 245 . In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are Matrix PAM 0 k tuple 2 Mismatch Penalty 1 Joining Penalty 20 Randomization Group Length 0 Cutoff Score 1 Window Size sequence length Gap Penalty 5 Gap Size Penalty 0.05 Window Size 500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence whichever is shorter.

If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to N or C terminal deletions not because of internal deletions a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for N and C terminal truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the N and C termini relative to the query sequence the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are N and C terminal of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with a corresponding subject residue as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the N and C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is only query residue positions outside the farthest N and C terminal residues of the subject sequence.

For example a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a 100 residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the N terminus of the subject sequence and therefore the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching alignment of the first 10 residues at the N terminus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10 of the sequence number of residues at the N and C termini not matched total number of residues in the query sequence so 10 is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90 . In another example a 90 residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the N or C termini of the subject sequence which are not matched aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again only residue positions outside the N and C terminal ends of the subject sequence as displayed in the FASTDB alignment which are not matched aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention.

The present invention further relates to polypeptides which have the deduced amino acid sequence of or which has the amino acid sequence encoded by the deposited cDNAs as well as fragments analogs and derivatives of such polypeptides.

The terms fragment. derivative and analog when referring to the polypeptide of or that encoded by the deposited cDNA means a polypeptide which retains the conserved motif of VEGF proteins as shown in and essentially the same biological function or activity.

In the present invention a polypeptide fragment refers to a short amino acid sequence contained in SEQ ID NO 2 or encoded by the cDNA contained in the deposited clone. Protein fragments may be free standing or comprised within a larger polypeptide of which the fragment forms a part or region most preferably as a single continuous region. Representative examples of polypeptide fragments of the invention include for example fragments from about amino acid number 1 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 102 120 121 140 141 160 161 180 181 200 201 220 221 240 241 260 261 280 or 281 to the end of the coding region. Moreover polypeptide fragments can be about 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 or 150 amino acids in length. In this context about includes the particularly recited ranges larger or smaller by several 5 4 3 2 or 1 amino acids at either extreme or at both extremes.

Preferred polypeptide fragments include the secreted VEGF 2 protein which is preferably a dimer of amino acids beginning at residue 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 or 114 of SEQ ID NO 18 and ending at amino acid residue 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 or 229 of SEQ ID NO 18 the pro protein form which is preferably about amino acid 32 419 of SEQ ID NO 18 and mature form. Other preferred polypeptide fragments include the mature form having a continuous series of deleted residues from the amino or the carboxy terminus or both. For example any number of amino acids ranging from 1 60 can be deleted from the amino terminus of either the secreted VEGF 2 polypeptide or the mature form. Similarly any number of amino acids ranging from 1 30 can be deleted from the carboxy terminus of the secreted VEGF 2 protein or mature form. Furthermore any combination of the above amino and carboxy terminus deletions are preferred. Similarly polynucleotide fragments encoding these VEGF 2 polypeptide fragments are also preferred.

Also preferred are VEGF 2 polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments characterized by structural or functional domains such as fragments that comprise alpha helix and alpha helix forming regions beta sheet and beta sheet forming regions turn and turn forming regions coil and coil forming regions hydrophilic regions hydrophobic regions alpha amphipathic regions beta amphipathic regions flexible regions surface forming regions substrate binding region and high antigenic index regions. Polypeptide fragments of SEQ ID NO 2 falling within conserved domains are specifically contemplated by the present invention. See . Moreover polynucleotide fragments encoding these domains are also contemplated.

Other preferred fragments are biologically active VEGF 2 fragments. Biologically active fragments are those exhibiting activity similar but not necessarily identical to an activity of the VEGF 2 polypeptide. The biological activity of the fragments may include an improved desired activity or a decreased undesirable activity.

The polypeptides of the present invention may be recombinant polypeptides natural polypeptides or synthetic polypeptides preferably recombinant polypeptides.

It will be recognized in the art that some amino acid sequences of the VEGF 2 polypeptide can be varied without significant effect of the structure or function of the protein. If such differences in sequence are contemplated it should be remembered that there will be critical areas on the protein which determine activity.

Thus the invention further includes variations of the VEGF 2 polypeptide which show substantial VEGF 2 polypeptide activity or which include regions of VEGF 2 protein such as the protein portions discussed below. Such mutants include deletions insertions inversions repeats and type substitutions. As indicated above guidance concerning which amino acid changes are likely to be phenotypically silent can be found in Bowie J. U. et al. Deciphering the Message in Protein Sequences Tolerance to Amino Acid Substitutions 247 1306 1310 1990 .

Thus the fragments derivatives or analogs of the polypeptides of or that encoded by the deposited cDNAs may be I one in which one or more of the amino acid residues are substituted with a conserved or non conserved amino acid residue preferably a conserved amino acid residue and such substituted amino acid residue may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code or ii one in which one or more of the amino acid residues includes a substituent group or iii one in which the mature polypeptide is fused with another compound such as a compound to increase the half life of the polypeptide for example polyethylene glycol or iv one in which the additional amino acids are fused to the mature polypeptide such as a leader or secretory sequence or a sequence which is employed for purification of the mature polypeptide or a proprotein sequence or v one in which comprises fewer amino acid residues shown in SEQ ID NOS 2 or 4 and retains the conserved motif and yet still retains activity characteristics of the VEGF family of polypeptides. Such fragments derivatives and analogs are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

Of particular interest are substitutions of charged amino acids with another charged amino acid and with neutral or negatively charged amino acids. The latter results in proteins with reduced positive charge to improve the characteristics of the VEGF 2 protein. The prevention of aggregation is highly desirable. Aggregation of proteins not only results in a loss of activity but can also be problematic when preparing pharmaceutical formulations because they can be immunogenic. Pinckard et al. 2 331 340 1967 Robbins et al. 36 838 845 1987 Cleland et al. 10 307 377 1993 .

The replacement of amino acids can also change the selectivity of binding to cell surface receptors. Ostade et al. 361 266 268 1993 describes certain mutations resulting in selective binding of TNF a to only one of the two known types of TNF receptors. Thus the VEGF 2 of the present invention may include one or more amino acid substitutions deletions or additions either from natural mutations or human manipulation.

As indicated changes are preferably of a minor nature such as conservative amino acid substitutions that do not significantly affect the folding or activity of the protein see Table 1 .

Of course the number of amino acid substitutions a skilled artisan would make depends on many factors including those described above. Generally speaking the number of substitutions for any given VEGF 2 polypeptide will not be more than 50 40 30 25 20 15 10 5 or 3.

Amino acids in the VEGF 2 protein of the present invention that are essential for function can be identified by methods known in the art such as site directed mutagenesis or alanine scanning mutagenesis Cunningham and Wells 244 1081 1085 1989 . The latter procedure introduces single alanine mutations at every residue in the molecule. The resulting mutant molecules are then tested for biological activity such as receptor binding or in vitro or in vitro proliferative activity. Sites that are critical for ligand receptor binding can also be determined by structural analysis such as crystallization nuclear magnetic resonance or photoaffinity labeling Smith et al. 224 899 904 1992 and de Vos et al. 255 306 312 1992 .

The polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention are preferably provided in an isolated form and preferably are purified to homogeneity.

The term isolated means that the material is removed from its original environment e.g. the natural environment if it is naturally occurring . For example a naturally occurring polynucleotide or polypeptide present in a living animal is not isolated but the same polynucleotide or DNA or polypeptide separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system is isolated. Such polynucleotide could be part of a vector and or such polynucleotide or polypeptide could be part of a composition and still be isolated in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment.

In specific embodiments the polynucleotides of the invention are less than 300 kb 200 kb 100 kb 50 kb 15 kb 10 kb or 7.5 kb in length. In a further embodiment polynucleotides of the invention comprise at least 15 contiguous nucleotides of VEGF 2 coding sequence but do not comprise all or a portion of any VEGF 2 intron. In another embodiment the nucleic acid comprising VEGF 2 coding sequence does not contain coding sequences of a genomic flanking gene i.e. 5 or 3 to the VEGF 2 gene in the genome .

The polypeptides of the present invention include the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4 in particular the mature polypeptide as well as polypeptides which have at least 70 similarity preferably at least 70 identity to the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4 and more preferably at least 90 similarity more preferably at least 95 identity to the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4 and still more preferably at least 95 similarity still more preferably at least 90 identity to the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS 2 and 4 and also include portions of such polypeptides with such portion of the polypeptide generally containing at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.

As known in the art similarity between two polypeptides is determined by comparing the amino acid sequence and its conserved amino acid substitutes of one polypeptide to the sequence of a second polypeptide.

Fragments or portions of the polypeptides of the present invention may be employed for producing the corresponding full length polypeptide by peptide synthesis therefore the fragments may be employed as intermediates for producing the full length polypeptides. Fragments or portions of the polynucleotides of the present invention may be used to synthesize full length polynucleotides of the present invention.

The polypeptides of the present invention include the polypeptide encoded by the deposited cDNA including the leader the mature polypeptide encoded by the deposited the cDNA minus the leader i.e. the mature protein a polypeptide comprising amino acids about 23 to about 396 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acids about 22 to about 396 in SEQ ID NO 2 a polypeptide comprising amino acids about 1 to about 396 in SEQ ID NO 2 as well as polypeptides which are at least 95 identical and more preferably at least 96 97 98 or 99 identical to the polypeptides described above and also include portions of such polypeptides with at least 30 amino acids and more preferably at least 50 amino acids.

Any VEGF 2 polypeptide can be used to generate fusion proteins. For example the VEGF 2 polypeptide when fused to a second protein can be used as an antigenic tag. Antibodies raised against the VEGF 2 polypeptide can be used to indirectly detect the second protein by binding to the VEGF 2. Moreover because secreted proteins target cellular locations based on trafficking signals the VEGF 2 polypeptides can be used as a targeting molecule once fused to other proteins.

Examples of domains that can be fused to VEGF 2 polypeptides include not only heterologous signal sequences but also other heterologous functional regions. The fusion does not necessarily need to be direct but may occur through linker sequences.

Moreover fusion proteins may also be engineered to improve characteristics of the VEGF 2 polypeptide. For instance a region of additional amino acids particularly charged amino acids may be added to the N terminus of the VEGF 2 polypeptide to improve stability and persistence during purification from the host cell or subsequent handling and storage. Also peptide moieties may be added to the VEGF 2 polypeptide to facilitate purification. Such regions may be removed prior to final preparation of the VEGF 2 polypeptide. The addition of peptide moieties to facilitate handling of polypeptides are familiar and routine techniques in the art.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate and as discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention e.g. those comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences. For example polypeptides of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 or any combination thereof and portions thereof resulting in chimeric polypeptides. By way of another non limiting example polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused with albumin including but not limited to recombinant human serum albumin or fragments or variants thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 969 issued Mar. 2 1999 EP Patent 0 413 622 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 issued Jun. 16 1998 herein incorporated by reference in their entirety . In a preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with the mature form of human serum albumin i.e. amino acids 1 585 of human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of EP Patent 0 322 094 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 1 x of human serum albumin where x is an integer from 1 to 585 and the albumin fragment has human serum albumin activity. In another preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 1 z of human serum albumin where z is an integer from 369 to 419 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused to either the N or C terminal end of the heterologous protein e.g. immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide . Polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins of the invention are also encompassed by the invention.

Such fusion proteins as those described above may facilitate purification and may increase half life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See e.g. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens e.g. insulin conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments see e.g. PCT Publications WO 96 22024 and WO 99 04813 . IgG Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion desulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric secreted polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See e.g. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Nucleic acids encoding the above polypeptides can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag e.g. the hemagglutinin HA tag or flag tag to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines Janknecht et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 8972 897 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2 nitriloacetic acid agarose column and histidine tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers.

Similarly EP A O 464 533 Canadian counterpart 2045869 discloses fusion proteins comprising various portions of constant region of immunoglobulin molecules together with another human protein or part thereof. In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 0232 262. Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See D. Bennett et al. 8 52 58 1995 K. Johanson et al. 270 9459 9471 1995 . 

Moreover the VEGF 2 polypeptides can be fused to marker sequences such as a peptide which facilitates purification of VEGF 2. In preferred embodiments the marker amino acid sequence is a hexa histidine peptide such as the tag provided in a pQE vector QIAGEN Inc. 9259 Eton Avenue Chatsworth Calif. 91311 among others many of which are commercially available. As described in Gentz et al. 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Another peptide tag useful for purification the HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein. Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 . 

Thus any of these above fusions can be engineered using the VEGF 2 polynucleotides or the polypeptides.

VEGF 2 polynucleotides and polypeptides can be used in assays to test for one or more biological activities. If VEGF 2 polynucleotides and polypeptides do exhibit activity in a particular assay it is likely that VEGF 2 may be involved in the diseases associated with the biological activity. Therefore VEGF 2 or VEGF 2 antibodies could be used to treat the associated disease.

The naturally occurring balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis is one in which inhibitory influences predominate. Rastinejad et al. . 56 345 355 1989 . In those rare instances in which neovascularization occurs under normal physiological conditions such as wound healing organ regeneration embryonic development and female reproductive processes angiogenesis is stringently regulated and spatially and temporally delimited. Under conditions of pathological angiogenesis such as that characterizing solid tumor growth these regulatory controls fail. Unregulated angiogenesis becomes pathologic and sustains progression of many neoplastic and non neoplastic diseases. A number of serious diseases are dominated by abnormal neovascularization including solid tumor growth and metastases arthritis some types of eye disorders and psoriasis. See e.g. reviews by Moses et al. 9 630 634 1991 Folkman et al. 333 1757 1763 1995 Auerbach et al. 29 401 411 1985 Folkman Advances in Cancer Research eds. Klein and Weinhouse Academic Press New York pp. 175 203 1985 Patz 94 715 743 1982 and Folkman et al. Science 221 719 725 1983 . In a number of pathological conditions the process of angiogenesis contributes to the disease state. For example significant data have accumulated which suggest that the growth of solid tumors is dependent on angiogenesis. Folkman and Klagsbrun 235 442 447 1987 .

The present invention provides for treatment of diseases or disorders associated with neovascularization by administration of the antibodies of the invention. Malignant and metastatic conditions which can be treated with the antibodies of the invention include but are not limited to malignancies solid tumors and cancers described herein and otherwise known in the art for a review of such disorders see Fishman et al. Medicine 2d Ed. J. B. Lippincott Co. Philadelphia 1985 . Thus the present invention provides a method of treating an angiogenesis related disease and or disorder comprising administering to an individual in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of an antibody of the invention. For example antibodies may be utilized in a variety of additional methods in order to therapeutically treat a cancer or tumor. Cancers which may be treated with antibodies include but are not limited to solid tumors including prostate lung breast brain ovarian stomach pancreas larynx esophagus testes liver parotid biliary tract colon rectum cervix uterus endometrium kidney bladder thyroid cancer primary tumors and metastases melanomas glioblastoma Kaposi s sarcoma leiomyosarcoma non small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer advanced malignancies and blood born tumors such as leukemias. For example antibodies may be delivered topically in order to treat cancers such as skin cancer head and neck tumors breast tumors and Kaposi s sarcoma.

Within yet other aspects antibodies may be utilized to treat superficial forms of bladder cancer by for example intravesical administration. Antibodies may be delivered directly into the tumor or near the tumor site via injection or a catheter. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate the appropriate mode of administration will vary according to the cancer to be treated. Other modes of delivery are discussed herein.

Antibodies may be useful in treating other disorders besides cancers which involve angiogenesis. These disorders include but are not limited to benign tumors for example hemangiomas acoustic neuromas neurofibromas trachomas and pyogenic granulomas artheroscleric plaques ocular angiogenic diseases for example diabetic retinopathy retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration corneal graft rejection neovascular glaucoma retrolental fibroplasia rubeosis retinoblastoma uvietis and Pterygia abnormal blood vessel growth of the eye rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis delayed wound healing endometriosis vasculogenesis granulations hypertrophic scars keloids nonunion fractures scleroderma trachoma vascular adhesions myocardial angiogenesis coronary collaterals cerebral collaterals arteriovenous malformations ischemic limb angiogenesis Osler Webber Syndrome plaque neovascularization telangiectasia hemophiliac joints angiofibroma fibromuscular dysplasia wound granulation Crohn s disease and atherosclerosis.

For example within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids comprising the step of administering a antibodies of the invention to a hypertrophic scar or keloid.

Within one embodiment of the present invention antibodies of the invention are directly injected into a hypertrophic scar or keloid in order to prevent the progression of these Jesions. This therapy is of particular value in the prophylactic treatment of conditions which are known to result in the development of hypertrophic scars and keloids e.g. burns and is preferably initiated after the proliferative phase has had time to progress approximately 14 days after the initial injury but before hypertrophic scar or keloid development. As noted above the present invention also provides methods for treating neovascular diseases of the eye including for example corneal neovascularization neovascular glaucoma proliferative diabetic retinopathy retrolental fibroplasia and macular degeneration.

Moreover ocular disorders associated with neovascularization which can be treated with the antibodies of the present invention include but are not limited to neovascular glaucoma diabetic retinopathy retinoblastoma retrolental fibroplasia uveitis retinopathy of prematurity macular degeneration corneal graft neovascularization as well as other eye inflammatory diseases ocular tumors and diseases associated with choroidal or iris neovascularization. See e.g. reviews by Waltman et al. 85 704 710 1978 and Gartner et al. 22 291 312 1978 .

Thus within one aspect of the present invention methods are provided for treating neovascular diseases of the eye such as corneal neovascularization including corneal graft neovascularization comprising the step of administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as described above including antibodies to the cornea such that the formation of blood vessels is inhibited. Briefly the cornea is a tissue which normally lacks blood vessels. In certain pathological conditions however capillaries may extend into the cornea from the pericorneal vascular plexus of the limbus. When the cornea becomes vascularized it also becomes clouded resulting in a decline in the patient s visual acuity. Visual loss may become complete if the cornea completely opacitates. A wide variety of disorders can result in corneal neovascularization including for example corneal infections e.g. trachoma herpes simplex keratitis leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis immunological processes e.g. graft rejection and Stevens Johnson s syndrome alkali burns trauma inflammation of any cause toxic and nutritional deficiency states and as a complication of wearing contact lenses.

The solution or suspension may be prepared in its pure form and administered several times daily. Alternatively anti angiogenic compositions prepared as described above may also be administered directly to the cornea. Within preferred embodiments the anti angiogenic composition is prepared with a muco adhesive polymer which binds to cornea. Within further embodiments the anti angiogenic factors or anti angiogenic compositions may be utilized as an adjunct to conventional steroid therapy. Topical therapy may also be useful prophylactically in corneal lesions which are known to have a high probability of inducing an angiogenic response such as chemical burns . In these instances the treatment likely in combination with steroids may be instituted immediately to help prevent subsequent complications.

Within other embodiments the antibodies described above may be injected directly into the corneal stroma by an ophthalmologist under microscopic guidance. The preferred site of injection may vary with the morphology of the individual lesion but the goal of the administration would be to place the composition at the advancing front of the vasculature i.e. interspersed between the blood vessels and the normal cornea . In most cases this would involve perilimbic corneal injection to protect the cornea from the advancing blood vessels. This method may also be utilized shortly after a corneal insult in order to prophylactically prevent corneal neovascularization. In this situation the material could be injected in the perilimbic cornea interspersed between the corneal lesion and its undesired potential limbic blood supply. Such methods may also be utilized in a similar fashion to prevent capillary invasion of transplanted corneas. In a sustained release form injections might only be required 2 3 times per year. A steroid could also be added to the injection solution to reduce inflammation resulting from the injection itself.

VEGF 2 antibodies may be useful in treating deficiencies or disorders of the immune system by activating or inhibiting the proliferation differentiation or mobilization chemotaxis of immune cells. Immune cells develop through a process called hematopoiesis producing myeloid platelets red blood cells neutrophils and macrophages and lymphoid B and T lymphocytes cells from pluripotent stem cells. The etiology of these immune deficiencies or disorders may be genetic somatic such as cancer or some autoimmune disorders acquired e.g. by chemotherapy or toxins or infectious. Moreover VEGF 2 antibodies can be used as a marker or detector of a particular immune system disease or disorder.

VEGF 2 antibodies may be useful in treating or detecting deficiencies or disorders of hematopoietic cells. VEGF 2 antibodies could be used to increase differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells including the pluripotent stem cells in an effort to treat those disorders associated with a decrease in certain or many types hematopoietic cells. Examples of immunologic deficiency syndromes include but are not limited to blood protein disorders e.g. agammaglobulinemia dysgammaglobulinemia ataxia telangiectasia common variable immunodeficiency Digeorge Syndrome HIV infection HTLV BLV infection leukocyte adhesion deficiency syndrome lymphopenia phagocyte bactericidal dysfunction severe combined immunodeficiency SCIDs Wiskott Aldrich Disorder anemia thrombocytopenia or hemoglobinuria.

Moreover VEGF 2 antibodies can also be used to modulate hemostatic the stopping of bleeding or thrombolytic activity clot formation . For example by increasing hemostatic or thrombolytic activity VEGF 2 antibodies could be used to treat blood coagulation disorders e.g. afibrinogenemia factor deficiencieS blood platelet disorders e.g. thrombocytopenia or wounds resulting from trauma surgery or other causes. Alternatively VEGF 2 antibodies that can decrease hemostatic or thromboltic activity could be used to inhibit or dissolve clotting important in the treatment of heart attacks infarction strokes or scarring.

VEGF 2 antibodies may also be useful in treating or detecting autoimmune disorders. Many autoimmune disorders result from inappropriate recognition of self as foreign material by immune cells. This inappropriate recognition results in an immune response leading to the destruction of the host tissue. Therefore the administration of VEGF 2 antibodies that can inhibit an immune response particularly the proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing autoimmune disorders.

Examples of autoimmune disorders that can be treated or detected by VEGF 2 antibodies include but are not limited to Addison s Disease hemolytic anemia antiphospholipid syndrome rheumatoid arthritis dermatitis allergic encephalomyelitis glomerulonephritis Goodpasture s Syndrome Graves Disease Multiple Sclerosis Myasthenia Gravis Neuritis Ophthalmia Bullous Pemphigoid Pemphigus Polyendocrinopathies Purpura Reiter s Disease Stiff Man Syndrome Autoimmune Thyroiditis Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Autoimmune Pulmonary Inflammation Guillain Barre Syndrome insulin dependent diabetes mellitis and autoimmune inflammatory eye disease.

Similarly allergic reactions and conditions such as asthma particularly allergic asthma or other respiratory problems may also be treated by VEGF 2 antibodies. Moreover VEGF 2 antibodies can be used to treat anaphylaxis hypersensitivity to an antigenic molecule or blood group incompatibility.

VEGF 2 antibodies may also be used to treat and or prevent organ rejection or graft versus host disease GVHD . Organ rejection occurs by host immune cell destruction of the transplanted tissue through an immune response. Similarly an immune response is also involved in GVHD but in this case the foreign transplanted immune cells destroy the host tissues. The administration of VEGF 2 antibodies that inhibits an immune response particularly the proliferation differentiation or chemotaxis of T cells may be an effective therapy in preventing organ rejection or GVHD.

Similarly VEGF 2 antibodies may also be used to modulate inflammation. For example VEGF 2 antibodies may inhibit the proliferation and differentiation of cells involved in an inflammatory response. These molecules can be used to treat inflammatory conditions both chronic and acute conditions including inflammation associated with infection e.g. septic shock sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome SIRS ischemia reperfusion injury endotoxin lethality arthritis complement mediated hyperacute rejection nephritis cytokine or chemokine induced lung injury inflammatory bowel disease Crohn s disease or resulting from over production of cytokines e.g. TNF or IL 1. 

VEGF 2 antibodies of the invention can be used to treat or detect hyperproliferative disorders including neoplasms. VEGF 2 antibodies may inhibit the proliferation of the disorder through direct or indirect initeractions. Alternatively VEGF 2 antibodies may proliferate other cells which can inhibit the hyperproliferative disorder.

For example by increasing an immune response particularly increasing antigenic qualities of the hyperproliferative disorder or by proliferating differentiating or mobilizing T cells hyperproliferative disorders can be treated. This immune response may be increased by either enhancing an existing immune response or by initiating a new immune response. Alternatively decreasing an immune response may also be a method of treating hyperproliferative disorders such as a chemotherapeutic agent.

Examples of hyperproliferative disorders that can be treated or detected by VEGF 2 antibodies include but are not limited to neoplasms located in the abdomen bone breast digestive system liver pancreas peritoneum endocrine glands adrenal parathyroid pituitary testicles ovary thymus thyroid eye head and neck brain nervous central and peripheral lymphatic system pelvic skin soft tissue spleen prostate thoracic and urogenital. In preferred embodiments VEGF 2 antibodies may be used to treat prevent or ameliorate breast cancer. In other preferred embodiments VEGF 2 antibodies may be used to treat prevent or ameliorate brain cancer. In other preferred embodiments VEGF 2 antibodies may be used to treat prevent or ameliorate prostate cancer. In other preferred embodiments VEGF 2 antibodies may be used to treat prevent or ameliorate colon cancer. In other preferred embodiments VEGF 2 antibodies may be used to treat prevent or ameliorate Kaposi s sarcoma.

Similarly other hyperproliferative disorders can also be treated or detected by VEGF 2 antibodies. Examples of such hyperproliferative disorders include but are not limited to hypergammaglobulinemia lymphoproliferative disorders paraproteinemias purpura sarcoidosis Sezary Syndrome Waldenstron s Macroglobulinemia Gaucher s Disease histiocytosis and any other hyperproliferative disease besides neoplasia located in an organ system listed above.

VEGF 2 polypeptides may be used to screen for molecules that bind to VEGF 2 or for molecules to which VEGF 2 binds. The binding of VEGF 2 and the molecule may activate agonist increase inhibit antagonist or decrease activity of the VEGF 2 or the molecule bound. Examples of such molecules include antibodies oligonucleotides proteins e.g. receptors or small molecules.

Preferably the molecule is closely related to the natural ligand of VEGF 2 e.g. a fragment of the ligand or a natural substrate a ligand a structural or functional mimetic. See Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Similarly the molecule can be closely related to the natural receptor to which VEGF 2 binds i.e. flk 1 or flt 4 or at least a fragment of the receptor capable of being bound by VEGF 2 e.g. active site . In either case the molecule can be rationally designed using known techniques. Preferably the screening for these molecules involves producing appropriate cells which express VEGF 2 either as a secreted protein or on the cell membrane. Preferred cells include cells from mammals yeast or . Cells expressing VEGF 2 or cell membrane containing the expressed polypeptide are then preferably contacted with a test compound potentially containing the molecule to observe binding stimulation or inhibition of activity of either VEGF 2 or the molecule.

The assay may simply test binding of a candidate compound to VEGF 2 wherein binding is detected by a label or in an assay involving competition with a labeled competitor. Further the assay may test whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by binding to VEGF 2.

Alternatively the assay can be carried out using cell free preparations polypeptide molecule affixed to a solid support chemical libraries or natural product mixtures. The assay may also simply comprise the steps of mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing VEGF 2 measuring VEGF 2 molecule activity or binding and comparing the VEGF 2 molecule activity or binding to a standard.

Preferably an ELISA assay can measure VEGF 2 level or activity in a sample e.g. biological sample using a monoclonal or polyclonal antibody. The antibody can measure VEGF 2 level or activity by either binding directly or indirectly to VEGF 2 or by competing with VEGF 2 for a substrate.

All of these above assays can be used as diagnostic or prognostic markers. The molecules discovered using these assays can be used to treat disease or to bring about a particular result in a patient e.g. blood vessel growth by activating or inhibiting the VEGF 2 molecule. Moreover the assays can discover agents which may inhibitor enhance the production of VEGF 2 from suitably manipulated cells or tissues.

Therefore the invention includes a method of identifying compounds which bind to VEGF 2 comprising the steps of a incubating a candidate binding compound with VEGF 2 and b determining if binding has occurred. Moreover the invention includes a method of identifying agonists antagonists comprising the steps of a incubating a candidate compound with VEGF 2 b assaying a biological activity and b determining if a biological activity of VEGF 2 has been altered.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method of delivering compositions to targeted cells expressing a receptor for VEGF 2 polypeptides or cells expressing a cell bound form of VEGF 2 polypeptide.

As discussed herein antibodies of the invention may be associated with heterologous polypeptides heterologous nucleic acids toxins or prodrugs via hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic and or covalent interactions. In one embodiment the invention provides a method for the specific delivery of compositions of the invention to cells by administering antibodies of the invention that are associated with heterologous polypeptides or nucleic acids. In one example the invention provides a method for delivering a therapeutic protein into the targeted cell. In another example the invention provides a method for delivering a single stranded nucleic acid e.g. antisense or ribozymes or double stranded nucleic acid e.g. DNA that can integrate into the cell s genome or replicate episomally and that can be transcribed into the targeted cell.

In another embodiment the invention provides a method for the specific destruction of cells e.g. the destruction of tumor cells by administering VEGF 2 antibodies of the invention in association with toxins or cytotoxic prodrugs.

By toxin is meant compounds that bind and activate endogenous cytotoxic effector systems radioisotopes holotoxins modified toxins catalytic subunits of toxins or any molecules or enzymes not normally present in or on the surface of a cell that under defined conditions cause the cell s death. Toxins that may be used according to the methods of the invention include but are not limited to radioisotopes known in the art compounds such as for example antibodies or complement fixing containing portions thereof that bind an inherent or induced endogenous cytotoxic effector system thymidine kinase endonuclease RNAse alpha toxin ricin abrin exotoxin A diphtheria toxin saporin momordin gelonin pokeweed antiviral protein alpha sarcin and cholera toxin. By cytotoxic prodrug is meant a non toxic compound that is converted by an enzyme normally present in the cell into a cytotoxic compound. Cytotoxic prodrugs that may be used according to the methods of the invention include but are not limited to glutamyl derivatives of benzoic acid mustard alkylating agent phosphate derivatives of etoposide or mitomycin C cytosine arabinoside daunorubisin and phenoxyacetamide derivatives of doxorubicin.

Further contemplated is the use of the polypeptides of the present invention or the polynucleotides encoding these polypeptides to screen for molecules which modify the activities of VEGF 2 polypeptides. Such a method would include contacting the polypeptide of the present invention with a selected compound s suspected of having antagonist or agonist activity and assaying the activity of these polypeptides following binding.

This invention is particularly useful for screening therapeutic compounds by using the VEGF 2 polypeptides or binding fragments thereof in any of a variety of drug screening techniques. The polypeptide or fragment employed in such a test may be affixed to a solid support expressed on a cell surface free in solution or located intracellularly. One method of drug screening utilizes eukaryotic or prokaryotic host cells which are stably transformed with recombinant nucleic acids expressing the polypeptide or fragment. Drugs are screened against such transformed cells in competitive binding assays. One may measure for example the formulation of complexes between the agent being tested and a polypeptide of the present invention.

Thus the present invention provides methods of screening for drugs or any other agents which affect activities mediated by VEGF 2 polypeptides. These methods comprise contacting such an agent with a VEGF 2 polypeptide or a fragment thereof and assaying for the presence of a complex between the agent and the polypeptide or a fragment thereof by methods well known in the art. In such a competitive binding assay the agents to screen are typically labeled. Following incubation free agent is separated from that present in bound form and the amount of free or uncomplexed label is a measure of the ability of a particular agent to bind to VEGF 2 polypeptides.

Another technique for drug screening provides high throughput screening for compounds having suitable binding affinity to VEGF 2 polypeptides and is described in great detail in European Patent Application 84 03564 published on Sep. 13 1984 which is incorporated herein by reference herein. Briefly stated large numbers of different small peptide test compounds are synthesized on a solid substrate such as plastic pins or some other surface. The peptide test compounds are reacted with polypeptides of the present invention and washed. Bound polypeptides are then detected by methods well known in the art. Purified polypeptides are coated directly onto plates for use in the aforementioned drug screening techniques. In addition non neutralizing antibodies may be used to capture the peptide and immobilize it on the solid support.

This invention also contemplates the use of competitive drug screening assays in which neutralizing antibodies capable of binding VEGF 2 polypeptides specifically compete with a test compound for binding to the VEGF 2 polypeptides or fragments thereof. In this manner the antibodies are used to detect the presence of any peptide which shares one or more antigenic epitopes with a polypeptide of the invention.

The invention also encompasses screening methods for identifying polypeptides and nonpolypeptides that bind VEGF 2 polypeptides and the binding molecules identified thereby. These binding molecules are useful for example as agonists and antagonists such as VEGF 2 antibodies of the VEGF 2 polypeptides. Such antibodies can be used in accordance with the invention in the therapeutic embodiments described in detail below.

This method comprises the steps of contacting VEGF 2 polypeptides with a plurality of molecules and identifying a molecule that binds VEGF 2 polypeptides.

The step of contacting VEGF 2 polypeptides with the plurality of molecules may be effected in a number of ways. For example one may contemplate immobilizing the VEGF 2 polypeptides on a solid support and bringing a solution of the plurality of molecules in contact with the immobilized VEGF 2 polypeptides. Such a procedure would be akin to an affinity chromatographic process with the affinity matrix being comprised of the immobilized polypeptides of the invention. The molecules having a selective affinity for the VEGF 2 polypeptides can then be purified by affinity selection. The nature of the solid support process for attachment of the polypeptides to the solid support solvent and conditions of the affinity isolation or selection are largely conventional and well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

Alternatively one may also separate a plurality of polypeptides into substantially separate fractions comprising a subset of or individual polypeptides. For instance one can separate the plurality of polypeptides by gel electrophoresis column chromatography or like method known to those of ordinary skill for the separation of polypeptides. The individual polypeptides can also be produced by a transformed host cell in such a way as to be expressed on or about its outer surface e.g. a recombinant phage . Individual isolates can then be probed by the polypeptides of the invention optionally in the presence of an inducer should one be required for expression to determine if any selective affinity interaction takes place between the polypeptides and the individual clone. Prior to contacting the VEGF 2 polypeptides with each fraction comprising individual polypeptides the polypeptides could first be transferred to a solid support for additional convenience. Such a solid support may simply be a piece of filter membrane such as one made of nitrocellulose or nylon. In this manner positive clones could be identified from a collection of transformed host cells of an expression library which harbor a DNA construct encoding a polypeptide having a selective affinity for polypeptides of the invention. Furthermore the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide having a selective affinity for the polypeptides of the invention can be determined directly by conventional means or the coding sequence of the DNA encoding the polypeptide can frequently be determined more conveniently. The primary sequence can then be deduced from the corresponding DNA sequence. If the amino acid sequence is to be determined from the polypeptide itself one may use microsequencing techniques. The sequencing technique may include mass spectroscopy.

In certain situations it may be desirable to wash away any unbound polypeptides from a mixture of the VEGF 2 polypeptides and the plurality of polypeptides prior to attempting to determine or to detect the presence of a selective affinity interaction. Such a wash step may be particularly desirable when the VEGF 2 polypeptides or the plurality of polypeptides are bound to a solid support.

The plurality of molecules provided according to this method may be provided by way of diversity libraries such as random or combinatorial peptide or nonpeptide libraries which can be screened for molecules that specifically VEGF 2 polypeptides. Many libraries are known in the art that can be used e.g. chemically synthesized libraries recombinant e.g. phage display libraries and in vitro translation based libraries. Examples of chemically synthesized libraries are described in Fodor et al. 1991 Science 251 767 773 Houghten et al. 1991 Nature 354 84 86 Lam et al. 1991 Nature 354 82 84 Medynski 1994 Bio Technology 12 709 710 Gallop et al. 1994 J. Medicinal Chemistry 37 9 1233 1251 Ohlmeyer et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 10922 10926 Erb et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 11422 11426 Houghien et al. 1992 Biotechniques 13 412 Jayawickreme et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 1614 1618 Salmon et al. 1993 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90 11708 11712 PCT Publication No. WO 93 20242 and Brenner and Lerner 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 5381 5383.

Examples of phage display libraries are described in Scott and Smith 1990 Science 249 386 390 Devlin et al. 1990 Science 249 404 406 Christian R. B. et al. 1992 J. Mol. Biol. 227 711 718 Lenstra 1992 J. Immunol. Meth. 152 149 157 Kay et al. 1993 Gene 128 59 65 and PCT Publication No. WO 94 18318 dated Aug. 18 1994.

In vitro translation based libraries include but are not limited to those described in PCT Publication No. WO 91 05058 dated Apr. 18 1991 and Mattheakis et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 9022 9026.

By way of examples of nonpeptide libraries a benzodiazepine library see e.g. Bunin et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 4708 4712 can be adapted for use. Peptoid libraries Simon et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 9367 9371 can also be used. Another example of a library that can be used in which the amide functionalities in peptides have been permethylated to generate a chemically transformed combinatorial library is described by Ostresh et al. 1994 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 11138 11142 .

The variety of non peptide libraries that are useful in the present invention is great. For example Ecker and Crooke 1995 Bio Technology 13 351 360 list benzodiazepines hydantoins piperazinediones biphenyls sugar analogs beta mercaptoketones arylacetic acids acylpiperidines benzopyrans cubanes xanthines aminimides and oxazolones as among the chemical species that form the basis of various libraries.

Non peptide libraries can be classified broadly into two types decorated monomers and oligomers. Decorated monomer libraries employ a relatively simple scaffold structure upon which a variety functional groups is added. Often the scaffold will be amolecule with a known useful pharmacological activity. For example the scaffold might be the benzodiazepine structure.

Non peptide oligomer libraries utilize a large number of monomers that are assembled together in ways that create new shapes that depend on the order of the monomers. Among the monomer units that have been used are carbamates pyrrolinones and morpholinos. Peptoids peptide like oligomers in which the side chain is attached to the alpha amino group rather than the alpha carbon form the basis of another version of non peptide oligomer libraries. The first non peptide oligomer libraries utilized a single type of monomer and thus contained a repeating backbone. Recent libraries have utilized more than one monomer giving the libraries added flexibility.

Screening the libraries can be accomplished by any of a variety of commonly known methods. See e.g. the following references which disclose screening of peptide libraries Parmley and Smith 1989 Adv. Exp. Med Biol. 251 215 218 Scott and Smith 1990 Science 249 386 390 Fowlkes et al. 1992 BioTechniques 13 422 427 Oldenburg et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 5393 5397 Yu et al. 1994 Cell 76 933 945 Staudt et al. 1988 Science 241 577 580 Bock et al. 1992 Nature 355 564 566 Tuerk et al. 1992 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 6988 6992 Ellington et al. 1992 Nature 355 850 852 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 096 815 5 223 409 and 5 198 346 all to Ladner et al. Rebar and Pabo 1993 Science 263 671 673 and CT Publication No. WO 94 18318.

In a specific embodiment screening to identify a molecule that binds VEGF 2 polypeptides can be carried out by contacting the library members with polypeptides of the invention immobilized on a solid phase and harvesting those library members that bind to VEGF 2 polypeptides. Examples of such screening methods termed panning techniques are described by way of example in Parmley and Smith 1988 Gene 73 305 318 Fowlkes et al. 1992 

In another embodiment the two hybrid system for selecting interacting proteins in yeast Fields and Song 1989 Nature 340 245 246 Chien et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 9578 9582 can be used to identify molecules that specifically bind to VEGF 2 polypeptides.

Where the binding molecule is a polypeptide the polypeptide can be conveniently selected from any peptide library including random peptide libraries combinatorial peptide libraries or biased peptide libraries. The term biased is used herein to mean that the method of generating the library is manipulated so as to restrict one or more parameters that govern the diversity of the resulting collection of molecules in this case peptides.

Thus a truly random peptide library would generate a collection of peptides in which the probability of finding a particular amino acid at a given position of the peptide is the same for all 20 amino acids. A bias can be introduced into the library however by specifying for example that a lysine occur every fifth amino acid or that positions 4 8 and 9 of a decapeptide library be fixed to include only arginine. Clearly many types of biases can be contemplated and the present invention is not restricted to any particular bias. Furthermore the present invention contemplates specific types of peptide libraries such as phage displayed peptide libraries and those that utilize a DNA construct comprising a lambda phage vector with a DNA insert.

As mentioned above in the case of a binding molecule that is a polypeptide the polypeptide may have about 6 to less than about 60 amino acid residues preferably about 6 to about 10 amino acid residues and most preferably about 6 to about 22 amino acids. In another embodiment a binding polypeptide has in the range of 15 0.100 amino acids or 20 50 amino acids.

The present invention also relates to recombinant vectors which include the isolated nucleic acid molecules of the present invention and to host cells containing the recombinant vectors as well as to methods of making such vectors and host cells and for using them for production of VEGF 2 polypeptides or peptides by recombinant techniques.

Host cells are genetically engineered transduced transformed or transfected with the vectors of this invention which may be for example a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector may be for example in the form of a plasmid a viral particle a phage etc. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters selecting transformants or amplifying the VEGF 2 genes of the invention. The culture conditions such as temperature pH and the like are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression and will be apparent to the skilled artisan.

The polynucleotides of the present invention may be employed for producing polypeptides by recombinant techniques. Thus for example the polynucleotide sequence may be included in any one of a variety of expression vectors for expressing a polypeptide. Such vectors include chromosomal nonchromosomal and synthetic DNA sequences e.g. derivatives of SV40 bacterial plasmids phage DNA yeast plasmids vectors derived from combinations of plasmids and phage DNA viral DNA such as vaccinia adenovirus fowl pox virus and pseudorabies. However any other plasmid or vector may be used so long as it is replicable and viable in the host.

The appropriate DNA sequence may be inserted into the vector by a variety of procedures. In general the DNA sequence is inserted into an appropriate restriction endonuclease site s by procedures known in the art. Such procedures and others are deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art.

The DNA sequence in the expression vector is operatively linked to an appropriate expression control sequence s promoter to direct mRNA synthesis. As representative examples of such promoters there may be mentioned LTR or SV40 promoter the . lac or trp the phage lambda Ppromoter and other promoters known to control expression of genes in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells or their viruses. The expression vector also contains a ribosome binding site for translation initiation and a transcription terminator. The vector may also include appropriate sequences for amplifying expression.

In addition the expression vectors preferably contain at least one selectable marker gene to provide a phenotypic trait for selection of transformed host cells. Such markers include dihydrofolate reductase DHFR or neomycin resistance for eukaryotic cell culture and tetracycline or ampicillin resistance for culturing in and other bacteria.

The vector containing the appropriate DNA sequence as herein above described as well as an appropriate promoter or control sequence may be employed to transform an appropriate host to permit the host to express the protein. Representative examples of appropriate hosts include but are not limited to bacterial cells such as and fungal cells such as yeast insect cells such as S2 and Sf9 animal cells such as CHO COS and Bowes melanoma and plant cells. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.

More particularly the present invention also includes recombinant constructs comprising one or more of the sequences as broadly described above. The constructs comprise a vector such as a plasmid or viral vector into which a sequence of the invention has been inserted in a forward or reverse orientation. In a preferred aspect of this embodiment the construct further comprises regulatory sequences including for example a promoter operably linked to the sequence. Large numbers of suitable vectors and promoters are known to those of skill in the art and are commercially available. The following vectors are provided by way of example bacterial pQE70 pQE60 and pQE 9 available from Qiagen pBS vectors Phagescript vectors Bluescript vectors pNH8A pNH16a pNH18A pNH46A available from Stratagene and ptrc99a pKK223 3 pKK233 3 pDR540 pRIT5 available from Pharmacia. Among preferred eukaryotic vectors are pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene and pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.

In addition to the use of expression vectors in the practice of the present invention the present invention further includes novel expression vectors comprising operator and promoter elements operatively linked to nucleotide sequences encoding a protein of interest. One example of such a vector is pHE4a which is described in detail below.

As summarized in components of the pHE4a vector SEQ ID NO 16 include 1 a neomycinphosphotransferase gene as a selection marker 2 an origin of replication 3 a T5 phage promoter sequence 4 two lac operator sequences 5 a Shine Delgarno sequence 6 the lactose operon repressor gene lacIq and 7 a multiple cloning site linker region. The origin of replication oriC is derived from pUC19 LTI Gaithersburg Md. . The promoter sequence and operator sequences were made synthetically. Synthetic production of nucleic acid sequences is well known in the art. C95 96 Catalog pages 215 216 C 1020 East Meadow Circle Palo Alto Calif. 94303. The pHE4a vector was deposited with the ATCC on Feb. 25 1998 and given accession number 209645.

A nucleotide sequence encoding VEGF 2 SEQ ID NO 1 is operatively linked to the promoter and operator of pHE4a by restricting the vector with NdeI and either XbaI BamHI XhoI or Asp718 and isolating the larger fragment the multiple cloning site region is about 310 nucleotides on a gel. The nucleotide sequence encoding VEGF 2 SEQ ID NO 1 having the appropriate restriction sites is generated for example according to the PCR protocol described in Example1 using PCR primers having restriction sites for NdeI as the 5 primer and either XbaI BamHI XhoI or Asp718 as the 3 primer . The PCR insert is gel purified and restricted with compatible enzymes. The insert and vector are ligated according to standard protocols.

As noted above the pHE4a vector contains a lacIq gene. LacIq is an allele of the lacI gene which confers tight regulation of the lac operator. Amann E. et al. 69 301 315 1988 Stark M. 51 255 267 1987 . The lacIq gene encodes a repressor protein which binds to lac operator sequences and blocks transcription of down stream i.e. 3 sequences. However the lacIq gene product dissociates from the lac operator in the presence of either lactose or certain lactose analogs e.g. isopropyl B D thiogalactopyranoside IPTG VEGF 2 thus is not produced in appreciable quantities in uninduced host cells containing the pHE4a vector. Induction of these host cells by the addition of an agent such as IPTG however results in the expression of the VEGF 2 coding sequence.

The promoter operator sequences of the pHE4a vector SEQ ID NO 17 comprise a T5 phage promoter and two lac operator sequences. One operator is located 5 to the transcriptional start site and the other is located 3 to the same site. These operators when present in combination with the lacIq gene product confer tight repression of down stream sequences in the absence of a lac operon inducer e.g. IPTG. Expression of operatively linked sequences located down stream from the lac operators may be induced by the addition of a lac operon inducer such as IPTG. Binding of a lac inducer to the lacIq proteins results in their release from the lac operator sequences and the initiation of transcription of operatively linked sequences. Lac operon regulation of gene expression is reviewed in Devlin T. TBCC4th Edition 1997 pages 802 807.

The pHE4 series of vectors contain all of the components of the pHE4a vector except for the VEGF 2 coding sequence. Features of the pHE4a vectors include optimized synthetic T5 phage promoter lac operator and Shine Delagarno sequences. Further these sequences are also optimally spaced so that expression of an inserted gene may be tightly regulated and high level of expression occurs upon induction.

Among known bacterial promoters suitable for use in the production of proteins of the present invention include the lacI and lacZ promoters the T3 and T7 promoters the gpt promoter the lambda PR and PL promoters and the trp promoter. Suitable eukaryotic promoters include the CMV immediate early promoter the HSV thymidine kinase promoter the early and late SV40 promoters the promoters of retroviral LTRs such as those of the Rous Sarcoma Virus RSV and metallothionein promoters such as the mouse metallothionein I promoter.

The pHE4a vector also contains a Shine Delgarno sequence 5 to the AUG initiation codon. Shine Delgarno sequences are short sequences generally located about 10 nucleotides up stream i.e. 5 from the AUG initiation codon. These sequences essentially direct prokaryotic ribosomes to the AUG initiation codon.

Thus the present invention is also directed to expression vector useful for the production of the proteins of the present invention. This aspect of the invention is exemplified by the pHE4a vector SEQ ID NO 16 .

Promoter regions can be selected from any desired gene using CAT chloramphenicol transferase vectors or other vectors with selectable markers. Two appropriate vectors are pKK232 8 and pCM7. Particular named bacterial promoters include lac lacZ T3 T7 gpt lambda P Pand trp. Eukaryotic promoters include CMV immediate early. HSV thymidine kinase early and late SV40 LTRs from retrovirus and mouse metallothionein I. Selection of the appropriate vector and promoter is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art.

In a further embodiment the present invention relates to host cells containing the above described construct. The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian cell or a lower eukaryotic cell such as a yeast cell or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterial cell. Introduction of the construct into the host cell can be effected by calcium phosphate transfection DEAE Dextran mediated transfection electroporation transduction infection or other methods Davis L. et al. 1986 .

The constructs in host cells can be used in a conventional manner to produce the gene product encoded by the recombinant sequence. Alternatively the polypeptides of the invention can be synthetically produced by conventional peptide synthesizers.

Mature proteins can be expressed in mammalian cells yeast bacteria or other cells under the control of appropriate promoters. Cell free translation systems can also be employed to produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the present invention. Appropriate cloning and expression vectors for use with prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts are described by Sambrook et al. . Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Transcription of a DNA encoding the polypeptides of the present invention by higher eukaryotes is increased by inserting an enhancer sequence into the vector. Enhancers are cis acting elements of DNA usually about from 10 to 300 bp that act on a promoter to increase its transcription. Examples include the SV40 enhancer on the late side of the replication origin bp 100 to 270 a cytomegalovirus early promoter enhancer a polyona enhancer on the late side of the replication origin and adenovirus enhancers.

Generally recombinant expression vectors will include origins of replication and selectable markers permitting transformation of the host cell e.g. the ampicillin resistance gene of and TRPI gene and a promoter derived from a highly expressed gene tob direct transcription of a downstream structural sequence. Such promoters can be derived from operons encoding glycolytic enzymes such as 3 phosphoglycerate kinase PGK a factor acid phosphatase or heat shock proteins among others. The heterologous structural sequence is assembled in appropriate phase with translation initiation and termination sequences and preferably a leader sequence capable of directing secretion of translated protein into the periplasmic space or extracellular medium. Optionally the heterologous sequence can encode a fusion protein including an N terminal identification peptide imparting desired characteristics e.g. stabilization or simplified purification of expressed recombinant product.

Useful expression vectors for bacterial use are constructed by inserting a structural DNA sequence encoding a desired protein together with suitable translation initiation and termination signals in operable reading phase with a functional promoter. The vector will comprise one or more phenotypic selectable markers and an origin of replication to ensure maintenance of the vector and to if desirable provide amplification within the host. Suitable prokaryotic hosts for transformation include and various species within the genera and although others may also be employed as a matter of choice.

As a representative but nonlimiting example useful expression vectors for bacterial use can comprise a selectable marker and bacterial origin of replication derived from commercially available plasmids comprising genetic elements of the well known cloning vector pBR322 ATCC 37017 . Such commercial vectors include for example pKK223 3 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals Uppsala Sweden and GEMI Promega Biotec Madison Wis. USA . These pBR322 backbone sections are combined with an appropriate promoter and the structural sequence to be expressed.

Following transformation of a suitable host strain and growth of the host strain to an appropriate cell density the selected promoter is derepressed by appropriate means e.g. temperature shift or chemical induction and cells are cultured for an additional period.

Cells are typically harvested by centrifugation disrupted by physical or chemical means and the resulting crude extract retained for further purification.

Microbial cells employed in expression of proteins can be disrupted by any convenient method well known to those skilled in the art including freeze thaw cycling sonication mechanical disruption or use of cell lysing agents.

Various mammalian cell culture systems can also be employed to express recombinant protein. Examples of mammalian expression systems include the COS 7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts described by Gluzman 23 175 1981 and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector for example the C127 3T3 CHO HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors will comprise an origin of replication a suitable promoter and enhancer and also any necessary ribosome binding sites polyadenylation site splice donor and acceptor sites transcriptional termination sequences and 5 flanking nontranscribed sequences. DNA sequences derived from the SV40 viral genome for example SV40 origin early promoter enhancer splice and polyadenylation sites may be used to provide the required nontranscribed genetic elements.

In addition to encompassing host cells containing the vector constructs discussed herein the invention also encompasses primary secondary and immortalized host cells of vertebrate origin particularly mammalian origin that have been engineered to delete or replace endogenous genetic material e.g. VEGF 2 sequence and or to include genetic material e.g. heterologous promoters that is operably associated with VEGF 2 sequence of the invention and which activates alters and or amplifies endogenous VEGF 2 polynucleotides. For example techniques known in the art may be used to operably associate heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences e.g. encoding VEGF 2 via homologous recombination see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication No. WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication No. WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties .

The host cell can be a higher eukaryotic cell such as a mammalian cell e.g. a human derived cell or a lower eukaryotic cell such as a yeast cell or the host cell can be a prokaryotic cell such as a bacterial cell. The host strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted gene sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Expression from certain promoters can be elevated in the presence of certain inducers thus expression of the genetically engineered polypeptide may be controlled. Furthermore different host cells have characteristics and specific mechanisms for the translational and post translational processing and modification e.g. glycosylation phosphorylation cleavage of proteins. Appropriate cell lines can be chosen to ensure the desired modifications and processing of the protein expressed.

The polypeptides can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell cultures by methods used heretofore including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation acid extraction anion or cation exchange chromatography phosphocellulose chromatography hydrophobic interaction chromatography affinity chromatography hydroxylapatite chromatography and lectin chromatography. It is preferred to have low concentrations approximately 0.1 5 mM of calcium ion present during purification Price et al. 244 917 1969 . Protein refolding steps can be used as necessary in completing configuration of the mature protein. Finally high performance liquid chromatography HPLC can be employed for final purification steps.

The polypeptides of the present invention may be a naturally purified product or a product of chemical synthetic procedures or produced by recombinant techniques from a prokaryotic or eukaryotic host for example by bacterial yeast higher plant insect and mammalian cells in culture . Depending upon the host employed in a recombinant production procedure the polypeptides of the present invention may be glycosylated with mammalian or other eukaryotic carbohydrates or may be non glycosylated. Polypeptides of the invention may also include an initial methionine amino acid residue.

In addition polypeptides of the invention can be chemically synthesized using techniques known in the art e.g. see Creighton 1983 Proteins Structures and Molecular Principles W.H. Freeman Co. N.Y. and Hunkapiller M. et al. 1984 Nature 310 105 111 . For example a peptide corresponding to a fragment of the VEGF 2 polypeptides of the invention can be synthesized by use of a peptide synthesizer. Furthermore if desired nonclassical amino acids or chemical amino acid analogs can be introduced as a substitution or addition into the VEGF 2 polynucleotide sequence. Non classical amino acids include but are not limited to to the D isomers of the common amino acids 2 4 diaminobutyric acid amino isobutyric acid 4 aminobutyric acid Abu 2 amino butyric acid g Abu e Ahx 6 amino hexanoic acid Aib 2 amino isobutyric acid 3 amino propionic acid ornithine norleucine norvaline hydroxyproline sarcosine citrulline homocitrulline cysteic acid t butylglycine t butylalanine phenylglycine cyclohexylalanine b alanine fluoro amino acids designer amino acids such as b methyl amino acids Ca methyl amino acids Na methyl amino acids and amino acid analogs in general. Furthermore the amino acid can be D dextrorotary or L levorotary .

The invention encompasses VEGF 2 polypeptides which are differentially modified during or after translation e.g. by glycosylation acetylation phosphorylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to an antibody molecule or other cellular ligand etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage by cyanogen bromide trypsin chymotrypsin papain V8 protease NaBH acetylation formylation oxidation reduction metabolic synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin etc.

Additional post translational modifications encompassed by the invention include for example e.g. N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains processing of N terminal or C terminal ends attachment of chemical moieties to the amino acid backbone chemical modifications of N linked or O linked carbohydrate chains and addition or deletion of an N terminal methionine residue as a result of procaryotic host cell expression. The polypeptides may also be modified with a detectable label such as an enzymatic fluorescent isotopic or affinity label to allow for detection and isolation of the protein.

Also provided by the invention are chemically modified derivatives of VEGF 2 which may provide additional advantages such as increased solubility stability and circulating time of the polypeptide or decreased immunogenicity see U.S. Pat. No. 4 179 337 . The chemical moieties for derivitization may be selected from water soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol ethylene glycol propylene glycol copolymers carboxymethylcellulose dextran polyvinyl alcohol and the like. The polypeptides may be modified at random positions within the molecule or at predetermined positions within the molecule and may include one two three or more attached chemical moieties.

The polymer may be of any molecular weight and may be branched or unbranched. For polyethylene glycol the preferred molecular weight is between about 1 kDa and about 100 kDa the term about indicating that in preparations of polyethylene glycol some molecules will weigh more some less than the stated molecular weight for ease in handling and manufacturing. Other sizes may be used depending on the desired therapeutic profile e.g. the duration of sustained release desired the effects if any on biological activity the ease in handling the degree or lack of antigenicity and other known effects of the polyethylene glycol to a therapeutic protein or analog .

The polyethylene glycol molecules or other chemical moieties should be attached to the protein with consideration of effects on functional or antigenic domains of the protein. There are a number of attachment methods available to those skilled in the art e.g. EP 0 401 384 herein incorporated by reference coupling PEG to G CSF see also Malik et al. Exp. Hematol. 20 1028 1035 1992 reporting pegylation of GM CSF using tresyl chloride . For example polyethylene glycol may be covalently bound through amino acid residues via a reactive group such as a free amino or carboxyl group. Reactive groups are those to which an activated polyethylene glycol molecule may be bound. The amino acid residues having a free amino group may include lysine residues and the N terminal amino acid residues those having a free carboxyl group may include aspartic acid residues glutamic acid residues and the C terminal amino acid residue. Sulthydryl groups may also be used as a reactive group for attaching the polyethylene glycol molecules. Preferred for therapeutic purposes is attachment at an amino group such as attachment at the N terminus or lysine group.

One may specifically desire proteins chemically modified at the N terminus. Using polyethylene glycol as an illustration of the present composition one may select from a variety of polyethylene glycol molecules by molecular weight branching etc. the proportion of polyethylene glycol molecules to protein or peptide molecules in the reaction mix the type of pegylation reaction to be performed and the method of obtaining the selected N terminally pegylated protein. The method of obtaining the N terminally pegylated preparation i.e. separating this moiety from other monopegylated moieties if necessary may be by purification of the N terminally pegylated material from a population of pegylated protein molecules. Selective proteins chemically modified at the N terminus modification may be accomplished by reductive alkylation which exploits differential reactivity of different types of primary amino groups lysine versus the N terminal available for derivatization in a particular protein. Under the appropriate reaction conditions substantially selective derivatization of the protein at the N terminus with a carbonyl group containing polymer is achieved.

Antibodies may be administered using any method known in the art including but not limited to direct needle injection at the delivery site intravenous injection topical administration catheter infusion biolistic injectors particle accelerators gelfoam sponge depots other commercially available depot materials osmotic pumps oral or suppositorial solid pharmaceutical formulations decanting or topical applications during surgery aerosol delivery. Such methods are known in the art. VEGF 2 antibodies may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition described in more detail below. Methods of delivering VEGF 2 antibodies are described in more detail below.

Another aspect of the present invention is to gene therapy methods for treating disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy methods relate to the introduction of nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA sequences into an animal to achieve expression of the VEGF 2 polypeptide of the present invention. This method requires a polynucleotide which codes for a VEGF 2 polypeptide operatively linked to a promoter and any other genetic elements necessary for the expression of the polypeptide by the target tissue. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques are known in the art see for example WO 90 11092 which is herein incorporated by reference.

Thus for example cells from a patient may be engineered with a polynucleotide DNA or RNA comprising a promoter operably linked to a VEGF 2 polynucleotide ex vivo with the engineered cells then being provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well known in the art. For example see Belldegrun A. et al. 85 207 216 1993 Ferrantini M. et al. 53 1107 1112 1993 Ferrantini M. et al. 153 4604 4615 1994 Kaido f. et al. 60 221 229 1995 Ogura H. et al. 50 5102 5106 1990 Santodonato L. et al. 7 1 10 1996 Santodonato L. et al. 4 1246 1255 1997 and Zhang J. F. et al. 3 31 38 1996 which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment the cells which are engineered are arterial cells. The arterial cells may be reintroduced into the patient through direct injection to the artery the tissues surrounding the artery or through catheter injection.

As discussed in more detail below the VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver and the like . The VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs may be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

In one embodiment the VEGF 2 polynucleotide is delivered as a naked polynucleotide. The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However the VEGF 2 polynucleotides can also be delivered in liposome formulations and lipofectin formulations and the like can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art. Such methods are described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 593 972 5 589 466 and 5 580 859 which are herein incorporated by reference.

The VEGF 2 polynucleotide vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Appropriate vectors include pWLNEO pSV2CAT pOG44 pXT1 and pSG available from Stratagene pSVK3 pBPV pMSG and pSVL available from Pharmacia and pEF1 V5 pcDNA3.1 and pRc CMV2 available from Invitrogen. Other suitable vectors will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan.

Any strong promoter known to those skilled in the art can be used for driving the expression of VEGF 2 DNA. Suitable promoters include adenoviral promoters such as the adenoviral major late promoter or heterologous promoters such as the cytomegalovirus CMV promoter the respiratory syncytial virus RSV promoter inducible promoters such as the MMT promoter the metallothionein promoter heat shock promoters the albumin promoter the ApoAI promoter human globin promoters viral thymidine kinase promoters such as the Herpes Simplex thymidine kinase promoter retroviral LTRs the b actin promoter and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter for VEGF 2.

Unlike other gene therapy techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The VEGF 2 polynucleotide construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue esheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. Delivery to the interstitial space of muscle tissue is preferred for the reasons discussed below. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. In vivo muscle cells are particularly competent in their ability to take up and express polynucleotides.

For the naked acid sequence injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 mg kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration.

The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked VEGF 2 DNA constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The naked polynucleotides are delivered by any method known in the art including but not limited to direct needle injection at the delivery site intravenous injection topical administration catheter infusion and so called gene guns . These delivery methods are known in the art.

As is evidenced by Example 18 naked VEGF 2 nucleic acid sequences can be administered in vivo results in the successful expression of VEGF 2 polypeptide in the femoral arteries of rabbits.

The constructs may also be delivered with delivery vehicles such as viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

In certain embodiments the VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs are complexed in a liposome preparation. Liposomal preparations for use in the instant invention include cationic positively charged anionic negatively charged and neutral preparations. However cationic liposomes are particularly preferred because a tight charge complex can be formed between the cationic liposome and the polyanionic nucleic acid. Cationic liposomes have been shown to mediate intracellular delivery of plasmid DNA Felgner et al. 1987 84 7413 7416 which is herein incorporated by reference mRNA Malone et al. 1989 86 6077 6081 which is herein incorporated by reference and purified transcription factors Debs et al. 1990 265 10189 10192 which is herein incorporated by reference in functional form.

Cationic liposomes are readily available. For example N 1 2 3 dioleyloxy propyl N N N triethylammonium DOTMA liposomes are particularly useful and are available under the trademark Lipofectin from GIBCO BRL Grand Island N.Y. See also Felgner et al. 1987 84 7413 7416 which is herein incorporated by reference . Other commercially available liposomes include transfectace DDAB DOPE and DOTAP DOPE Boehringer .

Other cationic liposomes can be prepared from readily available materials using techniques well known in the art. See e.g. PCT Publication No. WO 90 11092 Which is herein incorporated by reference for a description of the synthesis of DOTAP 1 2 bis oleoyloxy 3 trimethylammonio propane liposomes. Preparation of DOTMA liposomes is explained in the literature see e.g. P. Felgner et al. 84 7413 7417 which is herein incorporated by reference. Similar methods can be used to prepare liposomes from other cationic lipid materials.

Similarly anionic and neutral liposomes are readily available such as from Avanti Polar Lipids Birmingham Ala. or can be easily prepared using readily available materials. Such materials include phosphatidyl choline cholesterol phosphatidyl ethanolamine dioleoylphosphatidyl choline DOPC dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol DOPG dioleoylphoshatidyl ethanolamine DOPE among others. These materials can also be mixed with the DOTMA and DOTAP starting materials in appropriate ratios. Methods for making liposomes using these materials are well known in the art.

For example commercially dioleoylphosphatidyl choline DOPC dioleoylphosphatidyl glycerol DOPG and dioleoylphosphatidyl ethanolamine DOPE can be used in various combinations to make conventional liposomes with or without the addition of cholesterol. Thus for example DOPG DOPC vesicles can be prepared by drying 50 mg each of DOPG and DOPC under a stream of nitrogen gas into a sonication vial. The sample is placed under a vacuum pump overnight and is hydrated the following day with deionized water. The sample is then sonicated for 2 hours in a capped vial using a Heat Systems model 350 sonicator equipped with an inverted cup bath type probe at the maximum setting while the bath is circulated at 15EC. Alternatively negatively charged vesicles can be prepared without sonication to produce multilamellar vesicles or by extrusion through nucleopore membranes to produce unilamellar vesicles of discrete size. Other methods are known and available to those of skill in the art.

The liposomes can comprise multilamellar vesicles MLVs small unilamellar vesicles SUVs or large unilamellar vesicles LUVs with SUVs being preferred. The various liposome nucleic acid complexes are prepared using methods well known in the art. See e.g. Straubinger et al. 1983 101 512 527 which is herein incorporated by reference. For example MLVs containing nucleic acid can be prepared by depositing a thin film of phospholipid on the walls of a glass tube and subsequently hydrating with a solution of the material to be encapsulated. SUVs are prepared by extended sonication of MLVs to produce a homogeneous population of unilamellar liposomes. The material to be entrapped is added to a suspension of preformed MLVs and then sonicated. When using liposomes containing cationic lipids the dried lipid film is resuspended in an appropriate solution such as sterile water or an isotonic buffer solution such as 10 mM Tris NaCl sonicated and then the preformed liposomes are mixed directly with the DNA. The liposome and DNA form a very stable complex due to binding of the positively charged liposomes to the cationic DNA. SUVs find use with small nucleic acid fragments. LUVs are prepared by a number of methods well known in the art. Commonly used methods include. Ca EDTA chelation Papahadjopoulos et al. 1975 394 483 Wilson et al. 1979 17 77 ether injection Deamer D. and Bangham A. 1976 443 629 Ostro et al. 1977 76 836 Fraley et al. 1979 76 3348 detergent dialysis Enoch H. and Strittmatter P. 1979 76 145 and reverse phase evaporation REV Fraley et al. . 1980 255 10431 Szoka F. and Papahadjopoulos D. 1978 75 145 Schaefer Ridder et al. 1982 215 166 which are herein incorporated by reference.

Generally the ratio of DNA to liposomes will be from about 10 1 to about 1 10. Preferably the ration will be from about 5 1 to about 1 5. More preferably the ration will be about 3 1 to about 1 3. Still more preferably the ratio will be about 1 1.

WO 94 9469 which are herein incorporated by reference provide methods for delivering DNA cationic lipid complexes to mammals.

In certain embodiments cells are be engineered ex vivo or in vivo using a retroviral particle containing RNA which comprises a sequence encoding VEGF 2. Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors may be derived include but are not limited to Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus spleen necrosis virus Rous sarcoma Virus Harvey Sarcoma Virus avian leukosis virus gibbon ape leukemia virus human immunodeficiency virus Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus and mammary tumor virus.

The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include but are not limited to the PE501 PA317 R 2 R AM PA12 T19 14 VT 19 17 H2 RCRE RCRIP GP E 86 GP envAm12 and DAN cell lines as described in Miller 1 5 14 1990 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector may transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include but are not limited to electroporation the use of liposomes and CaPOprecipitation. In one alternative the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome or coupled to a lipid and then administered to a host.

The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector particles which include polynucleotide encoding VEGF 2. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed to transduce eukaryotic cells either in vitro or in vivo. The transduced eukaryotic cells will express VEGF 2.

In certain other embodiments cells are engineered ex vivo or in vivo with VEGF 2 polynucleotide contained in an adenovirus vector. Adenovirus can be manipulated such that it encodes and expresses VEGF 2 and at the same time is inactivated in terms of its ability to replicate in a normal lytic viral life cycle. Adenovirus expression is achieved without integration of the viral DNA into the host cell chromosome thereby alleviating concerns about insertional mutagenesis. Furthermore adenoviruses have been used as live enteric vaccines for many years with an excellent safety profile Schwartz A. R. et al. 1974 109 233 238 . Finally adenovirus mediated gene transfer has been demonstrated in a number of instances including transfer of alpha 1 antitrypsin and CFTR to the lungs of cotton rats Rosenfeld M. A. et al. 1991 252 431 434 Rosenfeld et al. 1992 68 143 155 Furthermore extensive studies to attempt to establish adenovirus as a causative agent in human cancer were uniformly negative Green M. et al. 1979 76 6606 .

Suitable adenoviral vectors useful in the present invention are described for example in Kozarsky and Wilson 3 499 503 1993 Rosenfeld et al. 68 143 155 1992 Engelhardt et al. 4 759 769 1993 Yang et al. 7 362 369 1994 Wilson et al. 365 691 692 1993 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 652 224 which are herein incorporated by reference. For example the adenovirus vector Ad2 is useful and can be grown in human 293 cells. These cells contain the E1 region of adenovirus and constitutively express E1a and E1b which complement the defective adenoviruses by providing the products of the genes deleted from the vector. In addition to Ad2 other varieties of adenovirus e.g. Ad3 Ad5 and Ad7 are also useful in the present invention.

Preferably the adenoviruses used in the present invention are replication deficient. Replication deficient adenoviruses require the aid of a helper virus and or packaging cell line to form infectious particles. The resulting virus is capable of infecting cells and can express a polynucleotide of interest which is operably linked to a promoter for example the HARP promoter of the present invention but cannot replicate in most cells. Replication deficient adenoviruses may be deleted in one or more of all or a portion of the following genes E1a E1b. E3 E4 E2a or L1 through L5.

In certain other embodiments the cells are engineered ex vivo or in vivo using an adeno associated virus AAV . AAVs are naturally occurring defective viruses that require helper viruses to produce infectious particles Muzyczka N. 158 97 1992 . It is also one of the few viruses that may integrate its DNA into non dividing cells. Vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can integrate but space for exogenous DNA is limited to about 4.5 kb. Methods for producing and using such AAVs are known in the art. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 139 941 5 173 414 5 354 678 5 436 146 5 474 935 5 478 745 and 5 589 377.

For example an appropriate AAV vector for use in the present invention will include all the sequences necessary for DNA replication encapsidation and host cell integration. The VEGF 2 polynucleotide construct is inserted into the AAV vector using standard cloning methods such as those found in Sambrook et al. Cold Spring Harbor Press 1989 . The recombinant AAV vector is then transfected into packaging cells which are infected with a helper virus using any standard technique including lipofection electroporation calcium phosphate precipitation etc. Appropriate helper viruses include adenoviruses cytomegaloviruses vaccinia viruses or herpes viruses. Once the packaging cells are transfected and infected they will produce infectious AAV viral particles which contain the VEGF 2 polynucleotide construct. These viral particles are then used to transduce eukaryotic cells either ex vivo or in vivo. The transduced cells will contain the VEGF 2 polynucleotide construct integrated into its genome and will express VEGF 2.

Another method of gene therapy involves operably associating heterologous control regions and endogenous polynucleotide sequences e.g. encoding VEGF 2 via homologous recombination see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International. Publication No. WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication No. WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not normally expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired.

Polynucleotide constructs are made using standard techniques known in the art which contain the promoter with targeting sequences flanking the promoter. Suitable promoters are described herein. The targeting sequence is sufficiently complementary to an endogenous sequence to permit homologous recombination of the promoter targeting sequence with the endogenous sequence. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of the VEGF 2 desired endogenous polynucleotide sequence so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination.

The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter. The amplified promoter and targeting sequences are digested and ligated together.

The promoter targeting sequence construct is delivered to the cells either as naked polynucleotide or in conjunction with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles whole viruses lipofection precipitating agents etc. described in more detail above. The P promoter targeting sequence can be delivered by any method included direct needle injection intravenous injection topical administration catheter infusion particle accelerators etc. The methods are described in more detail below.

The promoter targeting sequence construct is taken up by cells. Homologous recombination between the construct and the endogenous sequence takes place such that an endogenous VEGF 2 sequence is placed under the control of the promoter. The promoter then drives the expression of the endogenous VEGF 2 sequence.

The polynucleotides encoding VEGF 2 may be administered along with other polynucleotides encoding other angiongenic proteins. Angiogenic proteins include but are not limited to acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors VEGF 1 epidermal growth factor alpha and beta platelet derived endothelial cell growth factor platelet derived growth factor tumor necrosis factor alpha hepatocyte growth factor insulin like growth factor colony stimulating factor macrophage colony stimulating factor granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and nitric oxide synthase.

Preferably the polynucleotide encoding VEGF 2 contains a secretory signal sequence that facilitates secretion of the protein. Typically the signal sequence is positioned in the coding region of the polynucleotide to be expressed towards or at the 5 end of the coding region. The signal sequence may be homologous or heterologous to the polynucleotide of interest and may be homologous or heterologous to the cells to be transfected. Additionally the signal sequence may be chemically synthesized using methods known in the art.

Any mode of administration of any of the above described polynucleotides constructs can be used so long as the mode results in the expression of one or more molecules in an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic effect. This includes direct needle injection systemic injection catheter infusion biolistic injectors particle accelerators i.e. gene guns gelfoam sponge depots other commercially available depot materials osmotic pumps e.g. Alza minipumps oral or suppositorial solid tablet or pill pharmaceutical formulations and decanting or topical applications during surgery. For example direct injection of naked calcium phosphate precipitated plasmid into rat liver and rat spleen or a protein coated plasmid into the portal vein has resulted in gene expression of the foreign gene in the rat livers Kaneda et al. 243 375 1989 .

A preferred method of local administration is by direct injection. Preferably a recombinant molecule of the present invention complexed with a delivery vehicle is administered by direct injection into or locally within the area of arteries. Administration of a composition locally within the area of arteries refers to injecting the composition centimeters and preferably millimeters within arteries.

Another method of local administration is to contact a polynucleotide construct of the present invention in or around a surgical wound. For example a patient can undergo surgery and the polynucleotide construct can be coated on the surface of tissue inside the wound or the construct can be injected into areas of tissue inside the wound.

Therapeutic compositions useful in systemic administration include recombinant molecules of the present invention complexed to a targeted delivery vehicle of the present invention. Suitable delivery vehicles for use with systemic administration comprise liposomes comprising ligands for targeting the vehicle to a particular site.

Preferred methods of systemic administration include intravenous injection aerosol oral and percutaneous topical delivery. Intravenous injections can be performed using methods standard in the art. Aerosol delivery can also be performed using methods standard in the art see for example Stribling et al. 189 11277 11281 1992 which is incorporated herein by reference . Oral delivery can be performed by complexing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention to a carrier capable of withstanding degradation by digestive enzymes in the gut of an animal. Examples of such carriers include plastic capsules or tablets such as those known in the art. Topical delivery can be performed by mixing a polynucleotide construct of the present invention with a lipophilic reagent e.g. DMSO that is capable of passing into the skin.

Determining an effective amount of substance to be delivered can depend upon a number of factors including for example the chemical structure and biological activity of the substance the age and weight of the animal the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity and the route of administration. Thefrequency of treatments depends upon a number of factors such as the amount of polynucleotide constructs administered per dose as well as the health and history of the subject. The precise amount number of doses and timing of doses will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian.

Therapeutic compositions of the present invention can be administered to any animal preferably to mammals and birds. Preferred mammals include humans dogs cats mice rats rabbits sheep cattle horses and pigs with humans being particularly preferred.

VEGF 2 nucleic acid sequences and VEGF 2 polypeptides may also be employed for in vitro purposes related to scientific research synthesis of DNA and manufacture of DNA vectors and for the production of diagnostics and therapeutics to treat human disease. For example VEGF 2 may be employed for in vitro culturing of vascular endothelial cells where it is added to the conditional medium in a concentration from 10 pg ml to 10 ng ml.

Fragments of the full length VEGF 2 gene may be used as a hybridization probe for a cDNA library to isolate other genes which have a high sequence similarity to the gene or similar biological activity. Probes of this type generally have at least 50 base pairs although they may have a greater number of bases. The probe may also be used to identify a cDNA clone corresponding to a full length transcript and a genomic clone or clones that contain the complete VEGF 2 gene including regulatory and promoter regions exons and introns. An example of a screen comprises isolating the coding region of the VEGF 2 gene by using the known DNA sequence to synthesize an oligonucleotide probe. Labeled oligonucleotides having a sequence complementary to that of the gene of the present invention are used to screen a library of human cDNA genomic DNA or mRNA to determine which members of the library the probe hybridizes to.

This invention provides methods for identification of VEGF 2 receptors. The gene encoding the receptor can be identified by numerous methods known to those of skill in the art for example ligand panning and FACS sorting Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 5 1991 . Preferably expression cloning is employed wherein polyadenylated RNA is prepared from a cell responsive to VEGF 2 and a cDNA library created from this RNA is divided into pools and used to transfect COS cells or other cells that are not responsive to VEGF 2. Transfected cells which are grown on glass slides are exposed to labeled VEGF 2. VEGF 2 can be labeled by a variety of means including iodination or inclusion of a recognition site for a site specific protein kinase. Following fixation and incubation the slides are subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Positive pools are identified and sub pools are prepared and retransfected using an iterative sub pooling and rescreening process eventually yielding a single clone that encodes the putative receptor.

As an alternative approach for receptor identification labeled VEGF 2 can be photoaffinity linked with cell membrane or extract preparations that express the receptor molecule. Cross linked material is resolved by PAGE and exposed to X ray film. The labeled complex containing VEGF 2 is then excised resolved into peptide fragments and subjected to protein microsequencing. The amino acid sequence obtained from microsequencing would be used to design a set of degenerate oligonucleotide probes to screen a cDNA library to identify the gene encoding the putative receptor.

This invention is also related to a method of screening compounds to identify those which are VEGF 2 agonists or antagonists. An example of such a method takes advantage of the ability of VEGF 2 to significantly stimulate the proliferation of human endothelial cells in the presence of the comitogen Con A. Endothelial cells are obtained and cultured in 96 well flat bottomed culture plates Costar Cambridge Mass. in a reaction mixture supplemented with Con A Calbiochem La Jolla Calif. . Con A polypeptides of the present invention and the compound to be screened are added. After incubation at 37 degrees C. cultures are pulsed with 1 FCi of H thymidine 5 Ci mmol 1 Ci 37 BGq NEN for a sufficient time to incorporate the H and harvested onto glass fiber filters Cambridge Technology Watertown Mass. . Mean H thymidine incorporation cpm of triplicate cultures is determined using a liquid scintillation counter Beckman Instruments Irvine Calif. . Significant H thymidine incorporation as compared to a control assay where the compound is excluded indicates stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation.

To assay for antagonists the assay described above is performed and the ability of the compound to inhibit H thymidine incorporation in the presence of VEGF 2 indicates that the compound is an antagonist to VEGF 2. Alternatively VEGF 2 antagonists may be detected by combining VEGF 2 and a potential antagonist with membrane bound VEGF 2 receptors or recombinant receptors under appropriate conditions for a competitive inhibition assay. VEGF 2 can be labeled such as by radioactivity such that the number of VEGF 2 molecules bound to the receptor can determine the effectiveness of the potential antagonist.

Alternatively the response of a known second messenger system following interaction of VEGF 2 and receptor would be measured and compared in the presence or absence of the compound. Such second messenger systems include but are not limited to cAMP guanylate cyclase ion channels or phosphoinositide hydrolysis. In another method a mammalian cell or membrane preparation expressing the VEGF 2 receptor is incubated with labeled VEGF 2 in the presence of the compound. The ability of the compound to enhance or block this interaction could then be measured.

Potential VEGF 2 antagonists include an antibody or in some cases an oligonucleotide which binds to the polypeptide and effectively eliminates VEGF 2 function. Alternatively a potential antagonist may be a closely related protein which binds to VEGF 2 receptors however they are inactive forms of the polypeptide and thereby prevent the action of VEGF 2. Examples of these antagonists include a dominant negative mutant of the VEGF 2 polypeptide for example one chain of the hetero dimeric form of VEGF 2 may be dominant and may be mutated such that biological activity is not retained. An example of a dominant negative mutant includes truncated versions of a dimeric VEGF 2 which is capable of interacting with another dimer to form wild type VEGF 2 however the resulting homo dimer is inactive and fails to exhibit characteristic VEGF activity.

Another potential VEGF 2 antagonist is an antisense construct prepared using antisense technology. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of the polynucleotide sequence which encodes for the mature polypeptides of the present invention is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from about 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1360 1991 thereby preventing transcription and the production of VEGF 2. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of the mRNA molecule into the VEGF 2 polypeptide Antisense Okano 56 560 1991 Oligodeoxynucleotides as Antisense Inhibitors of Gene Expression CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 . The oligonucleotides described above can also be delivered to cells such that the antisense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of VEGF 2.

Potential VEGF 2 antagonists also include small molecules which bind to and occupy the active site of the polypeptide thereby making the catalytic site inaccessible to substrate such that normal biological activity is prevented. Examples of small molecules include but are not limited to small peptides or peptide like molecules.

The antagonists such as VEGF 2 antibodies may be employed to limit angiogenesis necessary for solid tumor metastasis. The identification of VEGF 2 can be used for the generation of certain inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor. Since angiogenesis and neovascularization are essential steps in solid tumor growth inhibition of angiogenic activity of the vascular endothelial growth factor is very useful to prevent the further growth retard or even regress solid tumors. Although the level of expression of VEGF 2 is extremely low in normal tissues including breast it can be found expressed at moderate levels in at least two breast tumor cell lines that are derived from malignant tumors. It is therefore possible that VEGF 2 is involved in tumor angiogenesis and growth.

Gliomas are also a type of neoplasia which may be treated with the antagonists of the present invention.

The antagonists such as VEGF 2 antibodies may also be used to treat chronic inflammation caused by increased vascular permeability. In addition to these disorders the antagonists may also be employed to treat retinopathy associated with diabetes rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

The antagonists such as VEGF 2 antibodies may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. as hereinafter described.

The VEGF 2 antibodies may be employed in combination with a suitable pharmaceutical carrier. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the polypeptide or agonist or antagonist and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Such a carrier includes but is not limited to saline buffered saline dextrose water glycerol ethanol and combinations thereof. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Associated with such container s can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration. In addition the pharmaceutical compositions may be employed in conjunction with other therapeutic compounds.

The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the topical intravenous intraperitoneal intramuscular intratumor subcutaneous intranasal or intradermal routes. The pharmaceutical compositions are administered in an amount which is effective for treating and or prophylaxis of the specific indication. In general the pharmaceutical compositions are administered in an amount of at least about 10 mg kg body weight and in most cases they will be administered in an amount not in excess of about 8 mg Kg body weight per day. In most cases the dosage is from about 10 mg kg to about 1 mg kg body weight daily taking into account the routes of administration symptoms etc.

The VEGF 2 antibodies which are polypeptides may also be employed in accordance with the present invention by expression of such polypeptide in vivo which is often referred to as gene therapy described above.

Thus for example cells such as bone marrow cells may be engineered with a polynucleotide DNA or RNA encoding for the polypeptide or an VEGF 2 antibody ex vivo the engineered cells are then provided to a patient to be treated with the polypeptide. Such methods are well known in the art. For example cells may be engineered by procedures known in the art by use of a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding the polypeptide of the present invention.

Similarly cells may be engineered in vivo for expression of a polypeptide or an VEGF 2 antibody in vivo for example by procedures known in the art. As known in the art a producer cell for producing a retroviral particle containing RNA encoding VEGF 2 antibodies of the present invention may be administered to a patient for engineering cells in vivo and expression of VEGF 2 antibodies in vivo. These and other methods for administering VEGF 2 antibodies of the present invention by such methods should be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings of the present invention. For example the expression vehicle for engineering cells may be other than a retroviral particle for example an adenovirus which may be used to engineer cells in vivo after combination with a suitable delivery vehicle.

Retroviruses from which the retroviral plasmid vectors hereinabove mentioned may be derived include but are not limited to Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus spleen necrosis virus retroviruses such as Rous Sarcoma Virus Harvey Sarcoma Virus avian leukosis virus gibbon ape leukemia virus human immunodeficiency virus adenovirus Myeloproliferative Sarcoma Virus and mammary tumor virus. In one embodiment the retroviral plasmid vector is derived from Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus.

The vector includes one or more promoters. Suitable promoters which may be employed include but are not limited to the retroviral LTR the SV40 promoter and the human cytomegalovirus CMV promoter described in Miller et al. 7 980 990 1989 or any other promoter e.g. cellular promoters such as eukaryotic cellular promoters including but not limited to the histone pol III and b actin promoters . Other viral promoters which may be employed include but are not limited to adenovirus promoters thymidine kinase TK promoters and B19 parvovirus promoters. The selection of a suitable promoter will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teachings contained herein.

The nucleic acid sequence encoding the polypeptide of the present invention is under the control of a suitable promoter. Suitable promoters which may be employed include but are not limited to adenoviral promoters such as the adenoviral major late promoter or heterologous promoters such as the cytomegalovirus CMV promoter the respiratory syncytial virus RSV promoter inducible promoters such as the MMT promoter the metallothionein promoter heat shock promoters the albumin promoter the ApoAI promoter human globin promoters viral thymidine kinase promoters such as the Herpes Simplex thyrnidine kinase promoter retroviral LTRs including the modified retroviral LTRs hereinabove described the b actin promoter and human growth hormone promoters. The promoter also may be the native promoter which controls the gene encoding the polypeptide.

The retroviral plasmid vector is employed to transduce packaging cell lines to form producer cell lines. Examples of packaging cells which may be transfected include but are not limited to the PE501 PA317 y 2 y AM PA12 T19 14 VT 19 17 H2 yCRE yCRIP GP E 86 GP envAm12 and DAN cell lines as described in Miller 1 5 14 1990 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The vector nay transduce the packaging cells through any means known in the art. Such means include but are not limited to electroporation the use of liposomes and CaPOprecipitation. In one alternative the retroviral plasmid vector may be encapsulated into a liposome or coupled to a lipid and then administered to a host.

The producer cell line generates infectious retroviral vector partiles which include the nucleic acid sequence s encoding the polypeptides. Such retroviral vector particles then may be employed to transduce eukaryotic cells either in vitro or in vivo The transduced eukaryotic cells will express the nucleic acid sequence s encoding the polypeptide. Eukaryotic cells which may be transduced include but are not limited to embryonic stem cells embryonic carcinoma cells as well as hematopoietic stem cells hepatocytes fibroblasts myoblasts keratinocytes endothelial cells and bronchial epithelial cells.

This invention is also related to the use of the VEGF 2 gene as part of a diagnostic assay for detecting diseases or susceptibility to diseases related to the presence of mutations in VEGF 2 nucleic acid sequences.

Individuals carrying mutations in the VEGF 2 gene may be detected at the DNA level by a variety of techniques. Nucleic acids for diagnosis may be obtained from a patient s cells such as from blood urine saliva tissue biopsy and autopsy material. The genomic DNA may be used directly for detection or may be amplified enzymatically by using PCR Saiki et al. 324 163 166 1986 prior to analysis. RNA or cDNA may also be used for the same purpose. As an example PCR primers complementary to the nucleic acid encoding VEGF 2 can be used to identify and analyze VEGF 2 mutations. For example deletions and insertions can be detected by a change in size of the amplified product in comparison to the normal genotype. Point mutations can be identified by hybridizing amplified DNA to radiolabeled VEGF 2 RNA or alternatively radiolabeled VEGF 2 antisense DNA sequences. Perfectly matched sequences can be distinguished from mismatched duplexes by RNase A digestion or by differences in melting temperatures.

Genetic testing based on DNA sequence differences may be achieved by detection of alteration in electrophoretic mobility of DNA fragments in gels with or without denaturing agents. Small sequence deletions and insertions can be visualized by high resolution gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments of different sequences may be distinguished on denaturing formamide gradient gels in which the mobilities of different DNA fragments are retarded in the gel at different positions according to their specific melting or partial melting temperatures see e.g. Myers et al. 230 1242 1985 .

Sequence changes at specific locations may also be revealed by nuclease protection assays such as RNase and S1 protection or the chemical cleavage method e.g. Cotton et al. 85 4397 4401 1985 .

Thus the detection of a specific DNA sequence may be achieved by methods such as hybridization RNase protection chemical cleavage direct DNA sequencing or the use of restriction enzymes e.g. Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms RFLP and Southern blotting of genomic DNA.

In addition to more conventional gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing mutations can also be detected by in situ analysis.

The present invention also relates to a diagnostic assay for detecting altered levels of VEGF 2 protein in various tissues since an over expression of the proteins compared to normal control tissue samples may detect the presence of a disease or susceptibility to a disease for example abnormal cellular differentiation. Assays used to detect levels of VEGF 2 protein in a sample derived from a host are well known to those of skill in the art and include radioimmunoassays competitive binding assays Western Blot analysis ELISA assays and sandwich assay. An ELISA assay Coligan et al. 1 2 Chapter 6 1991 initially comprises preparing an antibody specific to the VEGF 2 antigen preferably a monoclonal antibody. In addition a reporter antibody is prepared against the monoclonal antibody. To the reporter antibody is attached a detectable reagent such as radioactivity fluorescence or in this example a horseradish peroxidase enzyme. A sample is removed from a host and incubated on a solid support e.g. a polystyrene dish that binds the proteins in the sample. Any free protein binding sites on the dish are then covered by incubating with a non specific protein such as bovine serum albumen. Next the monoclonal antibody is incubated in the dish during which time the monoclonal antibodies attach to any VEGF 2 proteins attached to the polystyrene dish. All unbound monoclonal antibody is washed out with buffer. The reporter antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase is placed in the dish resulting in binding of the reporter antibody to any monoclonal antibody bound to VEGF 2. Unattached reporter antibody is then washed out. Peroxidase substrates are then added to the dish and the amount of color developed in a given time period is a measurement of the amount of VEGF 2 protein present in a given volume of patient sample when compared against a standard curve.

A competition assay may be employed wherein antibodies specific to VEGF 2 are attached to a solid support. Polypeptides of the present invention are then labeled for example by radioactivity and a sample derived from the host are passed over the solid support and the amount of label detected for example by liquid scintillation chromatography can be correlated to a quantity of VEGF 2 in the sample.

A sandwich assay is similar to an ELISA assay. In a sandwich assay VEGF 2 is passed over a solid support and binds to antibody attached to a solid support. A second antibody is then bound to the VEGF 2. A third antibody which is labeled and specific to the second antibody is then passed over the solid support and binds to the second antibody and an amount can then be quantified.

The sequences of the present invention are also valuable for chromosome identification. The sequence is specifically targeted to and can hybridize with a particular location on an individual human chromosome. Moreover there is a current need for identifying particular sites on the chromosome. Few chromosome marking reagents based on actual sequence data repeat polymorphism s are presently available for marking chromosomal location. The mapping of DNAs to chromosomes according to the present invention is an important first step in correlating those sequences with genes associated with disease.

Briefly sequences can be mapped to chromosomes by preparing PCR primers preferably 15 25 bp from the cDNA. Computer analysis of the cDNA is used to rapidly select primers that do not span more than one exon in the genomic DNA thus complicating the amplification process. These primers are then used for PCR screening of somatic cell hybrids containing individual human chromosomes. Only those hybrids containing the human gene corresponding to the primer will yield an amplified fragment.

PCR mapping of somatic cell hybrids is a rapid procedure for assigning a particular DNA to a particular chromosome. Using the present invention with the same oligonucleotide primers sublocalization can be achieved with panels of fragments from specific chromosomes or pools of large genomic clones in an analogous manner. Other mapping strategies that can similarly be used to map to its chromosome include in situ hybridization prescreening with labeled flow sorted chromosomes and preselection by hybridization to construct chromosome specific cDNA libraries.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH of a cDNA clone to a metaphase chromosomal spread can be used to provide a precise chromosomal location in one step. This technique can be used with probes from the cDNA as short as 50 or 60 base pairs. For a review of this technique see Verma et al. Pergamon Press New York 1988 .

Once a sequence has been mapped to a precise chromosomal location the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found for example in V. McKusick Mendelian Inheritance in Man available on line through Johns Hopkins University Welch Medical Library . The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis coinheritance of physically adjacent genes .

Next it is necessary to determine the differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence between affected and unaffected individuals. If a mutation is observed in some or all of the affected individuals but not in any normal individuals then the mutation is likely to be the causative agent of the disease.

With current resolution of physical mapping and genetic mapping techniques a cDNA precisely localized to a chromosomal region associated with the disease could be one of between 50 and 500 potential causative genes. This assumes 1 megabase mapping resolution and one gene per 20 kb .

Comparison of affected and unaffected individuals generally involves first looking for structural alterations in the chromosomes such as deletions or translocations that are visible from chromosome spreads or detectable using PCR based on that cDNA sequence. Ultimately complete sequencing of genes from several individuals is required to confirm the presence of a mutation and to distinguish mutations from polymorphisms.

The present invention is further directed to inhibiting VEGF 2 in vivo by the use of antisense technology. Antisense technology can be used to control gene expression through triple helix formation or antisense DNA or RNA both of which methods are based on binding of a polynucleotide to DNA or RNA. For example the 5 coding portion of the mature polynucleotide sequence which encodes for the polypeptide of the present invention is used to design an antisense RNA oligonucleotide of from 10 to 40 base pairs in length. A DNA oligonucleotide is designed to be complementary to a region of the gene involved in transcription triple helix see Lee et al. 6 3073 1979 Cooney et al. 241 456 1988 and Dervan et al. 251 1360 199.1 thereby preventing transcription and the production of VEGF 2. The antisense RNA oligonucleotide hybridizes to the mRNA in vivo and blocks translation of an mRNA molecule into the VEGF 2 antisense Okano 56 560 1991 CRC Press Boca Raton Fla. 1988 .

Alternatively the oligonucleotides described above can be delivered to cells by procedures in the art such that the anti sense RNA or DNA may be expressed in vivo to inhibit production of VEGF 2 in the manner described above.

Antisense constructs to VEGF 2 therefore may inhibit the angiogenic activity of the VEGF 2 and prevent the further growth or even regress solid tumors since angiogenesis and neovascularization are essential steps in solid tumor growth. These antisense constructs may also be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis diabetic retinopathy and Kaposi s sarcoma which are all characterized by abnormal angiogenesis.

The present invention encompasses polypeptides comprising or alternatively consisting of an epitope of the polypeptide having an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 18 or fragments or variants thereof or the full length polypeptide or fragments or variant thereof encoded by a polynucleotide sequence contained in ATCC deposit Nos. 97149 or 75698 or encoded by a polynucleotide that hybridizes to the complement of the sequence of SEQ ID NOs 1 or 3 or contained in ATCC deposit Nos. 97149 or 75698 under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions as defined supra. The present invention further encompasses polynucleotide sequences encoding an epitope of a polypeptide sequence of the invention such as for example the sequence disclosed in SEQ ID NOs 2 4 and 18 polynucleotide sequences of the complementary strand of a polynucleotide sequence encoding an epitope of the invention and polynucleotide sequences which hybridize to the complementary strand under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency hybridization conditions defined supra.

In another aspect the invention provides peptides and polypeptides comprising epitope bearing portions of the polypeptides of the present invention as well as polynucleotides encoding these epitopes bearing portions. These epitopes are immunogenic or antigenic epitopes of the polypeptides of the present invention. An immunogenic epitope is defined as a part of a protein that elicits an antibody response in vivo when the whole polypeptide of the present invention or fragment thereof is the immunogen. On the other hand a region of a polypeptide to which an antibody can bind is defined as an antigenic determinant or antigenic epitope. The number of in vivo immunogenic epitopes of a protein generally is less than the number of antigenic epitopes. See e.g. Geysen et al. 1983 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 3998 4002. However antibodies can be made to any antigenic epitope regardless of whether it is an immunogenic epitope by using methods such as phage display. See e.g. Petersen G. et al. 1995 Mol. Gen. Genet. 249 425 431. Therefore included in the present invention are both immunogenic epitopes and antigenic epitopes.

It is particularly pointed out that the immunogenic epitopes comprises predicted critical amino acid residues determined by the Jameson Wolf analysis. Thus additional flanking residues on either the N terminal C terminal or both N and C terminal ends may be added to these sequences to generate an epitope bearing polypeptide of the present invention. Therefore the immunogenic epitopes may include additional N terminal or C terminal amino acid residues. The additional flanking amino acid residues may be contiguous flanking N terminal and or C terminal sequences from the polypeptides of the present invention heterologous polypeptide sequences or may include both contiguous flanking sequences from the polypeptides of the present invention and heterologous polypeptide sequences.

Antibodies are preferably prepared from these regions or from discrete fragments in these regions. However antibodies can be prepared from any region of the peptide as described herein. A preferred fragment produces an antibody that diminishes or completely prevents binding of VEGF 2 to its receptor e.g. flk 1 or flt 4 . Antibodies can be developed against the full length VEGF 2 or portions of the receptor for example the secreted form of VEGF 2 polypeptide or any portions of these regions. Antibodies may also be developed against specific functional sites such as the site of receptor binding or sites that are glycosylated phosphorylated myristoylated or amidated.

Fragments which function as epitopes may be produced by any conventional means. See e.g. Houghten Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 5131 5135 1985 further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 .

Polypeptides of the present invention comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 7 amino acids residues in length. At least means that a polypeptide of the present invention comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope may be 7 amino acid residues in length or any integer between 7 amino acids and the number of amino acid residues of the full length polypeptides of the invention. Preferred polypeptides comprising immunogenic or antigenic epitopes are at least 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 or 100 amino acid residues in length. However it is pointed out that each and every integer between 7 and the number of amino acid residues of the full length polypeptide are included in the present invention.

The immunogenic and antigenic epitope bearing fragments may be specified by either the number of contiguous amino acid residues as described above or further specified by N terminal and C terminal positions of these fragments on the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2. Every combination of a N terminal and C terminal position that a fragment of for example at least 7 or at least 15 contiguous amino acid residues in length could occupy on the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 18 is included in the invention. Again at least 7 contiguous amino acid residues in length means 7 amino acid residues in length or any integer between 7 amino acids and the number of amino acid residues of the full length polypeptide of the present invention. Specifically each and every integer between 7 and the number of amino acid residues of the full length polypeptide are included in the present invention.

Immunogenic and antigenic epitope bearing polypeptides of the invention are useful for example to make antibodies which specifically bind the polypeptides of the invention and in immunoassays to detect the polypeptides of the present invention. The antibodies are useful for example in affinity purification of the polypeptides of the present invention. The antibodies may also routinely be used in a variety of qualitative or quantitative immunoassays specifically for the polypeptides of the present invention using methods known in the art. See e.g. Harlow et al. Antibodies A Laboratory Manual Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd Ed. 1988 .

Preferred antigenic epitopes include the antigenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these antigenic epitopes. Antigenic epitopes can be used as the target molecules in immunoassays. See for instance Wilson et al. Cell 37 767 778 1984 Sutcliffe et al. Science 219 660 666 1983 .

Preferred immunogenic epitopes include the immunogenic epitopes disclosed herein as well as any combination of two three four five or more of these immunogenic epitopes. The polypeptides comprising one or more immunogenic epitopes may be presented for eliciting an antibody response together with a carrier protein such as an albumin to an animal system such as rabbit or mouse or if the polypeptide is of sufficient length at least about 25 amino acids the polypeptide may be presented without a carrier. However immunogenic epitopes comprising as few as 8 to 10 amino acids have been shown to be sufficient to raise antibodies capable of binding to at the very least linear epitopes in a denatured polypeptide e.g. in Western blotting .

The epitope bearing polypeptides of the present invention may be produced by any conventional means for making polypeptides including synthetic and recombinant methods known in the art. For instance epitope bearing peptides may be synthesized using known methods of chemical synthesis. For instance Houghten has described a simple method for the synthesis of large numbers of peptides such as 10 20 mgs of 248 individual and distinct 13 residue peptides representing single amino acid variants of a segment of the HA1 polypeptide all of which were prepared and characterized by ELISA type binding studies in less than four weeks Houghten R. A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 5131 5135 1985 . This Simultaneous Multiple Peptide Synthesis SMPS process is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4 631 211 to Houghten and coworkers 1986 . In this procedure the individual resins for the solid phase synthesis of various peptides are contained in separate solvent permeable packets enabling the optimal use of the many identical repetitive steps involved in solid phase methods. A completely manual procedure allows 500 1000 or more syntheses to be conducted simultaneously Houghten et al. 1985 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 82 5131 5135 at 5134.

Epitope bearing peptides of the invention may also be synthesized as multiple antigen peptides MAPs first described by J. P. Tam in 85 5409 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. MAPs consist of multiple copies of a specific peptide attached to a non immunogenic lysine core. Map peptides usually contain four or eight copies of the peptide often refferred to as MAP 4 or MAP 8 peptides. By way of non limiting example MAPs may be synthesized onto a lysine core matrix attached to a polyethylene glycol polystyrene PEG PS support. The peptide of interest is synthesized onto the lysine residues using 9 fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl Fmoc chemistry. For example Applied Biosystems Foster City Calif. offers MAP resins such as for example the Fmoc Resin 4 Branch and the Fmoc Resin 8 Branch which can be used to synthesize MAPs. Cleavage of MAPs from the resin is performed with standard trifloroacetic acid TFA based cocktails known in the art. Purification of MAPs except for desalting is not necessary. MAP peptides may be used as an immunizing vaccine which elicits antibodies that recognize both the MAP and the native protein from which the peptide was derived.

Epitope bearing polypeptides of the invention may be modified for example by the addition of amino acids at the amino and or carboxy termini of the peptide. Such modifications may be performed for example to alter the conformation of the epitope bearing polypeptide such that the epitope will have a conformation more closely related to the structure of the epitope in the native protein. An example of a modified epitope bearing polypeptide of the invention is a polypeptide in which one or more cysteine residues have been added to the polypeptide to allow for the formation of a disulfide bond between two cysteines resulting in a stable loop structure of the epitope bearing polypeptide under non reducing conditions. Disulfide bonds may form between a cysteine residue added to the polypeptide and a cysteine residue of the naturally occurring epitope or may form between two cysteines which have both been added to the naturally occurring epitope bearing polypeptide. Additionally it is possible to modify one or more amino acid residues of the naturally occurring epitope bearing polypeptide by substituting them with cysteines to promote the formation of disulfide bonded loop structures. Cyclic thioether molecules of synthetic peptides may be routinely generated using techniques known in the art and are described in PCT publication WO 97 46251 incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. Other modifications of epitope bearing polypeptides contemplated by this invention include biotinylation.

Epitope bearing polypeptides of the present invention are used to induce antibodies according to methods well known in the art including but not limited to in vivo immunization in vitro immunization and phage display methods. See e.g. Sutcliffe et al. supra Wilson et al. supra and Bittle et al. 1985 J. Gen. Virol. 66 2347 2354. If in vivo immunization is used animals may be immunized with free peptide however anti peptide antibody titer may be boosted by coupling of the peptide to a macromolecular carrier such as keyhole limpet hemacyanin KLH or tetanus toxoid. For instance peptides containing cysteine residues may be coupled to a carrier using a linker such as maleimidobenzoyl N hydroxysuccinimide ester MBS while other peptides may be coupled to carriers using a more general linking agent such as glutaraldehyde. Animals such as rabbits rats and mice are immunized with either free or carrier coupled peptides or MAP peptides for instance by intraperitoneal and or intradermal injection of emulsions containing about 100 gs of peptide or carrier protein and Freund s adjuvant. Several booster injections may be needed for instance at intervals of about two weeks to provide a useful titer of anti peptide antibody which can be detected for example by ELISA assay using free peptide adsorbed to a solid surface. The titer of anti peptide antibodies in serum from an immunized animal may be increased by selection of anti peptide antibodies for instance by adsorption to the peptide on a solid support and elution of the selected antibodies according to methods well known in the art.

As one of skill in the art will appreciate and as discussed above the polypeptides of the present invention e.g. those comprising an immunogenic or antigenic epitope can be fused to heterologous polypeptide sequences. For example polypeptides of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused with the constant domain of immunoglobulins IgA IgE IgG IgM or portions thereof CH1 CH2 CH3 or any combination thereof and portions thereof resulting in chimeric polypeptides. By way of another non limiting example polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused with albumin including but not limited to recombinant human serum albumin or fragments or variants thereof see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 876 969 issued Mar. 2 1999 EP Patent 0 413 622 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 issued Jun. 16 1.998 herein incorporated by reference in their entirety . In a preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with the mature form of human serum albumin i.e. amino acids 1 585.0f human serum albumin as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2 of EP Patent 0 322 094 which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. In another preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 1 x of human serum albumin where x is an integer from 1 to 585 and the albumin fragment has human serum albumin activity. In another preferred embodiment polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof are fused with polypeptide fragments comprising or alternatively consisting of amino acid residues 1 z of human serum albumin where z is an integer from 369 to 419 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 766 883 herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Polypeptides and or antibodies of the present invention including fragments or variants thereof may be fused to either the N or C terminal end of the heterologous protein e.g. immunoglobulin Fc polypeptide or human serum albumin polypeptide . Polynucleotides encoding fusion proteins of the invention are also encompassed by the invention.

Such fusion proteins as those described above may facilitate purification and may increase half life in vivo. This has been shown for chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. See e.g. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . Enhanced delivery of an antigen across the epithelial barrier to the immune system has been demonstrated for antigens e.g. insulin conjugated to an FcRn binding partner such as IgG or Fc fragments see e.g. PCT Publications WO 96 22024 and WO S99 04813 . IgG. Fusion proteins that have a disulfide linked dimeric structure due to the IgG portion desulfide bonds have also been found to be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than monomeric polypeptides or fragments thereof alone. See e.g. Fountoulakis et. al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . Nucleic acids encoding the above epitopes can also be recombined with a gene of interest as an epitope tag e.g. the hemagglutinin HA tag or flag tag to aid in detection and purification of the expressed polypeptide. For example a system described by Janknecht et al. allows for the ready purification of non denatured fusion proteins expressed in human cell lines Janknecht et al. 1991 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 8972 897 . In this system the gene of interest is subcloned into a vaccinia recombination plasmid such that the open reading frame of the gene is translationally fused to an amino terminal tag consisting of six histidine residues. The tag serves as a matrix binding domain for the fusion protein. Extracts from cells infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus are loaded onto Ni2 nitriloacetic acid agarose column and histidine tagged proteins can be selectively eluted with imidazole containing buffers.

Additional fusion proteins of the invention may be generated through the techniques of gene shuffling motif shuffling exon shuffling and or codon shuffling collectively referred to as DNA shuffling . DNA shuffling may be employed to modulate the activities of polypeptides of the invention such methods can be used to generate polypeptides with altered activity as well as agonists and antagonists of the polypeptides. See generally U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 605 793 5 811 238 5 830 721 5 834 252 and 5 837 458 and Patten et al. Curr. Opinion Biotechnol. 8 724 33 1997 Harayama Trends Biotechnol. 16 2 76 82 1998 Hansson et al.

In one embodiment alteration of polynucleotides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 1 or SEQ ID NO 3 and the polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides may be achieved by DNA shuffling. DNA shuffling involves the assembly of two or more DNA segments by homologous or site specific recombination to generate variation in the polynucleotide sequence. In another embodiment polynucleotides of the invention or the encoded polypeptides may be altered by being subjected to random mutagenesis by error prone PCR random nucleotide insertion or other methods prior to recombination. In another embodiment one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of a polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the invention may be recombined with one or more components motifs sections parts domains fragments etc. of one or more heterologous molecules.

The VEGF 2 polypeptides bound by the antibodies of the invention may be in monomers or multimers i.e. dimers trimers tetramers and higher multimers . Accordingly the present invention relates to antibodies that bind monomers and multimers of the VEGF 2 polypeptides of the invention their preparation and compositions preferably pharmaceutical compositions containing them. In specific embodiments the VEGF 2 polypeptides bound by the antibodies of the invention are monomers dimers trimers or tetramers. In additional embodiments the polypeptides bound by the antibodies of the invention of the invention are at least dimers at least trimers or at least tetramers.

Multimeric VEGF 2 bound by the antibodies of the invention may be homomers or heteromers. A VEGF 2 homomer refers to a multimer containing only VEGF 2 polypeptides including VEGF 2 fragments variants and fusion proteins as described herein . These homomers may contain VEGF 2 polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences. In specific embodiments the VEGF 2 multimer bound by antibodies of the invention is a homodimer e.g. containing two VEGF 2 polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences or a homotrimer e.g. containing three VEGF 2 polypeptides having identical or different amino acid sequences . In a preferred embodiment the antibodies of the invention bind homotrimers of VEGF 2. In additional embodiments the homomeric VEGF 2 multimer bound by the antibodies of the invention is at least a homodimer at least a homotrimer or at least a homotetramer.

Heteromeric VEGF 2 refers to a multimer containing heterologous polypeptides i.e. polypeptides of a different protein in addition to the VEGF 2 polypeptides of the invention. In a specific embodiment the VEGF 2 multimer bound by the antibodies of the invention is a heterodimer a heterotrimer or a heterotetramer. In additional embodiments the heteromeric VEGF 2 multimer bound by the antibodies of the invention is at least a heterodimer at least a heterotrimer or at least a heterotetramer.

VEGF 2 multimers bound by the antibodies of the invention may be the result of hydrophobic hydrophilic ionic and or covalent associations and or may be indirectly linked by for example liposome formation. Thus in one embodiment VEGF 2 multimers such as for example homodimers or homotrimers are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact one another in solution. In another embodiment VEGF 2 heteromultimers such as for example VEGF 2 heterotrimers or VEGF 2 heterotetrainers are formed when polypeptides of the invention contact antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention including antibodies to the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a fusion protein of the invention in solution. In other embodiments VEGF 2 multimers are formed by covalent associations with and or between the VEGF 2 polypeptides of the invention. Such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the polypeptide sequence e.g. that recited in SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 14 or SEQ ID NO 18 . In one instance the covalent associations are cross linking between cysteine residues located within the polypeptide sequences which interact in the native i.e. naturally occurring polypeptide. In another instance the covalent associations are the consequence of chemical or recombinant manipulation. Alternatively such covalent associations may involve one or more amino acid residues contained in the heterologous polypeptide sequence in a VEGF 2 fusion protein. In one example covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a fusion protein see e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 5 478 925 . In a specific example the covalent associations are between the heterologous sequence contained in a VEGF 2 Fc fusion protein. In another specific example covalent associations of fusion proteins of the invention are between heterologous polypeptide sequence from another PDGF VEGF family ligand receptor member that is capable of forming covalently associated multimers. Examples include those peptide linkers described in U.S. Pat. No. 5 073 627 hereby incorporated by reference . Proteins comprising multiple VEGF 2 polypeptides separated by peptide linkers may be produced using conventional recombinant DNA technology.

The basic antibody structural unit is known to comprise a tetramer. Each tetramer is composed of two identical pairs of polypeptide chains each pair having one light about 25 kDa and one heavy chain about 50 70 kDa . The amino terminal portion of each chain includes a variable region of about 100 to 110 or more amino acids primarily responsible for antigen recognition. The carboxy terminal portion of each chain defines a constant region primarily responsible for effector function. Human light chains are classified as kappa and lambda light chains. Heavy chains are classified as mu delta gamma alpha or epsilon and define the antibody s isotype as IgM IgD IgG IgA and IgE respectively. Ch. 7 Paul W. ed. 2nd d. Raven Press N.Y. 1989 incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes . The variable regions of each light heavy chain pair form the antibody binding site.

Thus an intact IgG antibody has two binding sites. Except in bifunctional or bispecific antibodies the two binding sites are the same.

The chains all exhibit the same general structure of relatively conserved framework regions FR joined by three hyper variable regions also called complementarity determining regions or CDRs. The CDRs from the heavy and the ligt chains of each pair are aligned by the framework regions enabling binding to a specific epitope. From N terminal to C terminal both light and heavy chains comprise the domains FR1 CDR1 FR2 CDR2 FR3 CDR3 and FR4. The assignment of amino acids to each domain is in accordance with the definitions of Kabat National Institutes of Health Bethesda Md. 1987 and 1991 or Chothia Lesk 196 901 917 1987 Chothia et al. 342 878 883 1989 .

A bispecific or bifunctional antibody is an artificial hybrid antibody having two different heavy light chain pairs and two different binding sites. Bispecific antibodies can be produced by a variety of methods including fusion of hybridomas or linking of Fab fragments. See e.g. Songsivilai Lachmann 79 315 321 1990 Kostelny et al. J. 148 1547 1553 1992 . In addition bispecific antibodies may be formed as diabodies Holliger et al. Diabodies small bivalent and bispecific antibody fragments PNAS USA 90 6444 6448 1993 or Janusins Traunecker et al. Bispecific single chain molecules Janusins target cytotoxic lymphocytes on HIV infected cells 10 3655 3659 1991 and Traunecker et al. Janusin new molecular design for bispecific reagents 7 51 52 1992 .

Antibodies of the present invention have uses that include but are not limited to methods known in the art to purify detect and target the polypeptides of the present invention including both in vitro and in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic methods. For example the antibodies have use in immunoassays for qualitatively and quantitatively measuring levels of the polypeptides of the present invention in biological samples. See e.g. Harlow et al. ANTIBODIES A LABORATORY MANUAL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 incorporated by reference in the entirety .

By way of another non limiting example antibodies of the invention may be administered to individuals as a form of passive immunization. Alternatively antibodies of the present invention may be used for epitope mapping to identify the epitope s bound by the antibody. Epitopes identified in this way may in turn for example be used as vaccine candidates i.e. to immunize an individual to elicit antibodies against the naturally occurring forms of VEGF 2.

The antibodies of the present invention may be used either alone or in combination with other compositions. The antibodies may further be recombinantly fused to a heterologous polypeptide at the N or C terminus or chemically conjugated including covalently and non covalently conjugations to polypeptides or other compositions. For example antibodies of the present invention may be recombinantly fused or conjugated to molecules useful as labels in detection assays and effector molecules such as heterologous polypeptides drugs or toxins. See e.g. WO 92 08495 WO 91 14438 WO 89 12624 U.S. Pat. No. 5 314 995 and EP 0 396 387.

The antibodies of the invention include derivatives that are modified i.e by the covalent attachment of any type of molecule to the antibody. For example but not by way of limitation the antibody derivatives include antibodies that have been modified e.g. by glycosylation acetylation pegylation phosphylation amidation derivatization by known protecting blocking groups proteolytic cleavage linkage to a cellular ligand or other protein etc. Any of numerous chemical modifications may be carried out by known techniques including but not limited to specific chemical cleavage acetylation formylation metabolic synthesis of tunicamycin etc. Additionally the derivative may contain one or more non classical amino acids.

The antibodies of the present invention may be prepared by any suitable method known in the art. For example a polypeptide of the present invention or an antigenic fragment thereof can be administered to an animal in order to induce the production of sera containing polyclonal antibodies specific for the antigen. Various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species and include but are not limited to Freund s complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanins dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as BCG bacille Calmette Guerin and . Such adjuvants are also well known in the art.

Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared using a wide of techniques known in the art including the use of hybridoma and recombinant technology. See e.g. Harlow et al. ANTIBODIES A LABORATORY MANUAL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 2nd ed. 1988 Hammerling et al. in MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES AND T CELL HYBRIDOMAS 563 681 Elsevier N.Y. 1981 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties . The term monoclonal antibody as used herein is not limited to antibodies produced through hybridoma technology. The term monoclonal antibody refers to an antibody that is derived from a single clone including any eukaryotic prokaryotic or phage clone and not the method by which it is produced.

Methods for producing and screening for specific antibodies using hybridoma technology are routine and well known in the art. In a non limiting example mice can be immunized with a polypeptide of the invention or a cell expressing such peptide. Once an immune response is detected e.g. antibodies specific for the antigen are detected in the mouse serum the mouse spleen is harvested and splenocytes isolated. The splenocytes are then fused by well known techniques to any suitable myeloma cells for example cells from cell line SP2 0 available from the ATCC. Hybridomas are selected and cloned by limited dilution. The hybridoma clones are then assayed by methods known in the art for cells that secrete antibodies capable of binding a polypeptide of the invention. Ascites fluid which generally contains high levels of antibodies can be generated by immunizing mice with positive hybridoma clones.

Accordingly the present invention provides methods of generating monoclonal antibodies as well as antibodies produced by the method comprising culturing a hybridoma cell secreting an antibody of the invention wherein preferably the hybridoma is generated by fusing splenocytes isolated from a mouse immunized with an antigen of the invention with myeloma cells and then screening the hybridomas resulting from the fusion for hybridoma clones that secrete an antibody able to bind a polypeptide of the invention.

Another well known method for producing both polyclonal and monoclonal human B cell lines is transformation using Epstein Barr Virus EBV . Protocols for generating EBV transformed B cell lines are commonly known in the art such as for example the protocol outlined in Chapter 7.22 of Current Protocols in Immunology Coligan et al. Eds. 1994 John Wiley Sons NY which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference herein. The source of B cells for transformation is commonly human peripheral blood but B cells for transformation may also be derived from other sources including but not limited to lymph nodes tonsil spleen tumor tissue and infected tissues. Tissues are generally made into single cell suspensions prior to EBV transformation. Additionally steps may be taken to either physically remove or inactivate T cells e.g. by treatment with cyclosporin A in B cell containing samples because T cells from individuals seropositive for anti EBV antibodies can suppress B cell immortalization by EBV. In general the sample containing human B cells is innoculated with EBV and cultured for 3 4 weeks. A typical source of EBV is the culture supernatant of the B95 8 cell line ATCC VR 1492 . Physical signs of EBV transformation can generally be seen towards the end of the 3 4 week culture period. By phase contrast microscopy transformed cells may appear large clear hairy and tend to aggregate in tight clusters of cells. Initially EBV lines are generally polyclonal. However over prolonged periods of cell cultures EBV lines may become monoclonal or polyclonal as a result of the selective outgrowth of particular B cell clones. Alternatively polyclonal EBV transformed lines may be subcloned e.g. by limiting dilution culture or fused with a suitable fusion partner and plated at limiting dilution to obtain monoclonal B cell lines. Suitable fusion partners for EBV transformed cell lines include mouse myeloma cell lines e.g. SP2 0 X63 Ag8.653 heteromyeloma cell lines human x mouse e.g SPAM 8 SBC H20 and CB F7 and human cell lines e.g. GM 1500 SKO 007 RPMI 8226 and KR 4 . Thus the present invention also provides a method of generating polyclonal or monoclonal human antibodies against polypeptides of the invention or fragments thereof comprising EBV transformation of human B cells.

Antibody fragments which recognize specific epitopes may be generated by known techniques. For example Fab and F ab 2 fragments of the invention may be produced by proteolytic cleavage of immunoglobulin molecules using enzymes such as papain to produce Fab fragments or pepsin to produce F ab 2 fragments . F ab 2 fragments contain the variable region the light chain constant region and the CH1 domain of the heavy chain.

Alternatively antibodies of the present invention can be produced through the application of recombinant DNA technology or through synthetic chemistry using methods known in the art. For example the antibodies of the present invention can be prepared using various phage display methods known in the art. In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of a phage particle which carries polynucleotide sequences encoding them. Phage with a desired binding property are selected from a repertoire or combinatorial antibody library e.g. human or murine by selecting directly with antigen typically antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 with Fab Fv or disulfide stabilized Fv antibody domains recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII protein. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include those disclosed in Brinkman U. et al. 1995 J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 Ames R. S. et al. 1995 J. Imnunol. Methods 184 177 186 Kettleborough C. A. et al. 1994 Eur. J. Immunol. 24 952 958 Persic L. et al. 1997 Gene 187 9 18 Burton D.

As described in the above references after phage selection the antibody coding regions from the phage can be isolated and used to generate whole antibodies including human antibodies or any other desired antigen binding fragment and expressed in any desired host including mammalian cells insect cells plant cells yeast and bacteria. For example techniques to recombinantly produce Fab Fab and F ab 2 fragments can also be employed using methods known in the art such as those disclosed in WO 92 22324 Mullinax R. L. et al. 1992 BioTechniques 12 6 864 869 and Sawai H. et al. 1995 AJRI 34 26 34 and Better M. et al. 1988 Science 240 1041 1043 said references incorporated by reference in their entireties .

Examples of techniques which can be used to produce single chain Fvs and antibodies include those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 946 778 and 5 258 498 Huston et al. 1991 Methods in Enzymology 203 46 88 Shu L. et al. 1993 PNAS 90 7995 7999 and Skerra A. et al. 1988 Science 240 1038 1040. For some uses including in vivo use of antibodies in humans and in vitro detection assays it may be preferable to use chimeric humanized or human antibodies. Methods for producing chimeric antibodies are known in the art. See e.g. Morrison Science 229 1202 1985 Oi et al. BioTechniques 4 214 1986 Gillies S. D. et al. 1989 J. Immunol. Methods 125 191 202 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 807 715 4 816 567 and 4 816 397 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Humanized antibodies are antibody molecules from non human species antibody that binds the desired antigen having one or more complementarity determining regions CDRs from the non human species and a framework regions from a human immunoglobulin molecule. Often framework residues in the human framework regions will be substituted with the corresponding residue from the CDR donor antibody to alter preferably improve antigen binding. These framework substitutions are identified by methods well known in the art e.g. by modeling of the interactions of the CDR and framework residues to identify framework residues important for antigen binding and sequence comparison to identify unusual framework residues at particular positions. See e.g. Queen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 585 089 Riechmann et al. Nature 332 323 1988 which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. 

Antibodies can be humanized using a variety of techniques including CDR grafting EP 0 239 0.400 WO 91 09967 U.S. Pat.

Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including phage display methods described above using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin sequences. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4 444 887 and 4 716 111 and PCT publications WO 98 46645 WO 98 50433 WO. 98 24893 WO 98 16654 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 and WO 91 10741 each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Human antibodies can also be produced using transgenic mice which are incapable of expressing functional endogenous immunoglobulins but which can express human immunoglobulin genes. For example the human heavy and light chain immunoglobulin gene complexes may be introduced randomly or by homologous recombination into mouse embryonic stem cells. Alternatively the human variable region constant region and diversity region may be introduced into mouse embryonic stem cells in addition to the human heavy and light chain genes. The mouse heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes may be rendered non functional separately or simultaneously with the introduction of human immunoglobulin loci by homologous recombination. In particular homozygous deletion of the JH region prevents endogenous antibody production. The modified embryonic stem cells are expanded and microinjected into blastocysts to produce chimeric mice. The chimeric mice are then bred to produce homozygous offspring which express human antibodies. The transgenic mice are immunized in the normal fashion with a selected antigen e.g. all or a portion of a polypeptide of the invention. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen can be obtained from the immunized transgenic mice using conventional hybridoma technology. The human immunoglobulin transgenes harbored by the transgenic mice rearrange during B cell differentiation and subsequently undergo class switching and somatic mutation. Thus using such a technique it is possible to produce therapeutically useful IgG IgA IgM and IgE antibodies. For an overview of this technology for producing human antibodies see Lonberg and Huszar Int. Rev. Immunol. 13 65 93 1995 . For a detailed discussion of this technology for producing human antibodies and human monoclonal antibodies and protocols for producing such antibodies see e.g. PCT publications WO 98 24893 WO 92 01047 WO 96 34096 WO 96 33735 European Patent No. 0 598 877 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 413 923 5 625 126 5 633 425 5 569 825 5 661 016 5 545 806 5 814 318 5 885 793 5 916 771 5 939 598 6 075 181 and 6 114 598 which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. In addition companies such as Abgenix Inc. Fremont Calif. and Genpharm San Jose Calif. can be engaged to provide human antibodies directed against a selected antigen using technology similar to that described above.

Completely human antibodies which recognize a selected epitope can be generated using a technique referred to as guided selection. In this approach a selected non human monoclonal antibody e.g. a mouse antibody is used to guide the selection of a completely human antibody recognizing the same epitope. Jespers et al. Bio technology 12 899 903 1988 .

Further antibodies to the polypeptides of the invention can in turn be utilized to generate anti idiotype antibodies that mimic polypeptides of the invention using techniques well known to those skilled in the art. See e.g. Greenspan Bona FASEB J. 7 5 437 444 1989 and Nissinoff J. Immunol. 147 8 2429 2438 1991 . For example antibodies which bind to and competitively inhibit polypeptide multimerization and or binding of a polypeptide of the invention to a ligand can be used to generate anti idiotypes that mimic the polypeptide multimerization and or binding domain and as a consequence bind to and neutralize polypeptide and or its ligand. Such neutralizing anti idiotypes or Fab fragments of such anti idiotypes can be used in therapeutic regimens to neutralize polypeptide ligand. For example such anti idiotypic antibodies can be used to bind a polypeptide of the invention and or to bind its ligands receptors and thereby activate or block its biological activity.

Intrabodies are antibodies often scFvs that expressed from a recombinant nucleic acid molecule and engineered to be retained intracellularly e.g. retained in the cytoplasm endoplasmic reticulum or periplasm . Intrabodies may be used for example to ablate the function of a protein to which the intrabody binds. The expression of intrabodies may also be regulated through the use of inducible promoters in the nucleic acid expression vector comprising the intrabody. Intrabodies of the invention can be produced using methods known in the art such as those disclosed and reviewed in Chen et al. 5 595 601 1994 Marasco W.A. 4 11 15 1997 Rondon and Marasco 51 257 283 1997 Proba et al. 275 245 253 1998 Cohen et al.

In particular a CCR5 intrabody has been produced by Steinberger et al. 97 805 810 2000 .

Antibodies in accordance with the invention may be prepared the utilizing transgenic mouse that has a substantial portion of the human antibody producing genome inserted but that is rendered deficient in the production of endogenous murine antibodies e.g. XenoMouse strains available from Abgenix Inc. Fremont Calif. . Such mice then are capable of producing human immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies and are deficient in the production of murine immunoglobulin molecules and antibodies. Technologies utilized for achieving the same are disclosed in the patents applications and references disclosed herein.

The ability to clone and reconstruct megabase sized human loci in YACs and to introduce them into the mouse germline provides a powerful approach to elucidating the functional components of very large or crudely mapped loci as well as generating useful models of human disease. Furthermore the utilization of such technology for substitution of mouse loci with their human equivalents could provide unique insights into the expression and regulation of human gene products during development their communication with other systems and their involvement in disease induction and progression.

An important practical application of such a strategy is the humanization of the mouse humoral immune system. Introduction of human immunoglobulin Ig loci into mice in which the endogenous Ig genes have been inactivated offers the opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying programmed expression and assembly of antibodies as well as their role in B cell development. Furthermore such a strategy could provide an ideal source for production of fully human monoclonal antibodies Mabs an important milestone towards fulfilling the promise of antibody therapy in human disease.

Fully human antibodies are expected to minimize the immunogenic and allergic responses intrinsic to mouse or mouse derivatized Monoclonal antibodies and thus to increase the efficacy and safety of the administered antibodies. The use of fully human antibodies can be expected to provide a substantial advantage in the treatment of chronic and recurring human diseases such as cancer which require repeated antibody administrations.

One approach towards this goal was to engineer mouse strains deficierit in mouse antibody production with large fragments of the human Ig loci.in anticipation that such mice would produce a large repertoire of human antibodies in the absence of mouse antibodies. Large human Ig fragments would preserve the large variable gene diversity as well as the proper regulation of antibody production and expression. By exploiting the mouse machinery for antibody diversification and selection and the lack of immunological tolerance to human proteins the reproduced human antibody repertoire in these mouse strains should yield high affinity antibodies against any antigen of interest including human antigens. Using the hybridoma technology antigen specific human Monoclonal antibodies with the desired specificity could be readily produced and selected.

This general strategy was demonstrated in connection with the generation of the first XenoMouse strains as published in 1994. See Green et al. 7 13 21 1994 . The XenoMouse strains were engineered with yeast artificial chromosomes YACS containing 245 kb and 10 190 kb sized germline configuration fragments of the human heavy chain locus and kappa light chain locus respectively which contained core variable and constant region sequences. Id. The human Ig containing YACs proved to be compatible with the mouse system for both rearrangement and expression of antibodies and were capable of substituting for the inactivated mouse Ig genes. This was demonstrated by their ability to induce B cell development to produce an adult like human repertoire of fully human antibodies and to generate antigen specific human monoclonal antibodies. These results also suggested that introduction of larger portions of the human Ig loci containing greater numbers of V genes additional regulatory elements and human Ig constant regions might recapitulate substantially the full repertoire that is characteristic of the human humoral response to infection and immunization. The work of Green et al. was recently extended to the introduction of greater than approximately 8.0 of the human antibody repertoire through introduction of megabase sized germline configuration YAC fragments of the human heavy chain loci and kappa light chain loci respectively to produce XenoMouse mice. See Mendez et al. 15 146 156 1997 Green and Jakobovits 188 483 495 1998 Green 231 11 23 1999 and U.S. patent application Ser.

Human anti mouse antibody HAMA responses have led the industry to prepare chimeric or otherwise humanized antibodies. While chimeric antibodies have a human constant region and a murine variable region it is expected that certain human anti chimeric antibody HACA responses will be observed particularly in chronic or multi dose utilizations of the antibody. Thus it would be desirable to provide fully human antibodies against VEGF 2 polypeptides in order to vitiate concerns and or effects of HAMA or HACA responses.

The present invention also provides antibodies including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants that immunospecifically bind to a VEGF 2 polypeptide or polypeptide fragment or variant of a VEGF 2 wherein said antibodies comprise or alternatively consist of one two three or more VH. CDRs and one two three or more VL CDRs as contained in a VH domain or VL domain of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 2.

The present invention also provides for nucleic acid molecules generally isolated encoding an antibody of the invention including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof . In a specific embodiment a nucleic acid molecule of the invention encodes an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof comprising or alternatively consisting of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 2 and a VL domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 2. In another embodiment a nucleic acid molecule of the invention encodes an antibody including molecules comprising or alternatively consisting of antibody fragments or variants thereof comprising or alternatively consisting of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VH domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 2 or a VL domain having an amino acid sequence of any one of the VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 2.

The present invention also provides antibodies that comprise or alternatively consist of variants including derivatives of the antibody molecules e.g. the VH domains and or VL domains described herein which antibodies immunospecifically bind to a VEGF 2 or fragments or variant thereof. Standard techniques known to those of skill in the art can be used to introduce mutations in the nucleotide sequence encoding a molecule of the invention including for example site directed mutagenesis and PCR mediated mutagenesis which result in amino acid substitutions. Preferably the variants including derivatives encode less than 50 amino acid substitutions less than 40 amino acid substitutions less than 30 amino acid substitutions less than 25 amino acid substitutions less than 20 amino acid substitutions less than 15 amino acid substitutions less than 10 amino acid substitutions less than 5 amino acid substitutions less than 4 amino acid substitutions less than 3 amino acid substitutions or less than 2 amino acid substitutions relative to the reference VH domain VHCDR1 VHCDR2 VHCDR3 VL domain VLCDR1 VLCDR2 or VLCDR3. A conservative amino Acid substitution is one in which the amino acid residue is replaced with an amino acid residue having a side chain with a similar charge. Families of amino acid residues having side chains with similar charges have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains e.g. lysine arginine histidine acidic side chains e.g. aspartic acid glutamic acid uncharged polar side chains e.g. glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine cysteine nonpolar side chains e.g. alanine valine leucine isoleucine proline phenylalanine methionine tryptophan beta branched side chains e.g. threonine valine isoleucine and aromatic side chains e.g. tyrosine phenylalanine tryptophan histidine . Alternatively mutations can be introduced randomly along all or part of the coding sequence such as by saturation mutagenesis and the resultant mutants can be screened for biological activity to identify mutants that retain activity e.g. the ability to bind a VEGF 2 .

For example it is possible to introduce mutations only in framework regions or only in CDR regions of an antibody molecule. Introduced mutations may be silent or neutral missense mutations i.e. have no or little effect on an antibody s ability to bind antigen. These types of mutations may be useful to optimize codon usage or improve a hybriodma s antibody production. Alternatively non neutral missense mutations may alter an antibody s ability to bind antigen. The location of most silent and neutral missense mutations is likely to be in the framework regions while the location of most non neutral missense mutations is likely to be in CDR though this is not an absolute requirement. One of skill in the art would be able to design and test mutant molecules with desired properties such as no alteration in antigen binding activity or alteration in binding activity e.g improvements in antigen binding activity or change in antibody specificity . Following mutagenesis the encoded protein may routinely be expressed and the functional and or biological activity of the encoded protein e.g. ability to immunospecifically bind a VEGF 2 can be determined using techniques described herein or by routinely modifying techniques known in the art.

In a specific embodiment an antibody of the invention including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that immunospecifically binds VEGF 2 polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof comprises or alternatively consists of an amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes to a nucleotide sequence that is complementary to that encoding one of the VH or VL domains of one or more scFvs referred to in Table 2 under stringent conditions e.g. hybridization to filter bound DNA in 6 sodium chloride sodium citrate SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.2 SSC 0.1 SDS at about 50 65 C. under highly stringent conditions e.g. hybridization to filter bound nucleic acid in 6 SSC at about 45 C. followed by one or more washes in 0.1 SSC 0.2 SDS at about 68 C. or under other stringent hybridization conditions which are known to those of skill in the art see for example Ausubel F. M. et al. eds. 1989 Vol. Green Publishing Associates Inc. and John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at pages 6.3.1 6.3.6 and 2.10.3 . Nucleic acid molecules encoding these antibodies are also encompassed by the invention.

It is well known within the art that polypeptides or fragments or variants thereof with similar amino acid sequences often have similar structure and many of the same biological activities. Thus in one embodiment an antibody including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that immunospecifically binds to a VEGF 2 polypeptide or fragments or variants of a VEGF 2 polypeptide comprises or alternatively consists of a VH domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the amino acid sequence of a VH domain of an scFv referred to in Table 2.

In another embodiment an antibody including a molecule comprising or alternatively consisting of an antibody fragment or variant thereof that immunospecifically binds to a VEGF 2 polypeptide or fragments or variants of a VEGF 2 polypeptide comprises or alternatively consists of a VL domain having an amino acid sequence that is at least 35 at least 40 at least 45 at least 50 at least 55 at least 60 at least 65 at least 70 at least 75 at least 80 at least 85 at least 90 at least 95 or at least 99 identical to the amino acid sequence of a VL domain of an scFv referred to in Table 2.

Antibodies of the invention including antibody fragments or variants can be produced by any method known in the art. For example it will be appreciated that antibodies in accordance with the present invention can be expressed in cell lines other than hybridoma cell lines. Sequences encoding the cDNAs or genomic clones for the particular antibodies can be used for transformation of a suitable mammalian or nonmammalian host cells of to generate phage display libraries for example. Additionally polypeptide antibodies of the invention may be chemically synthesized or produced through the use of recombinant expression systems.

One way to produce the antibodies of the invention would be to clone the VH and or VL domains of the scFvs referred to in Table 2. In order to isolate the VH and VL domains from the hybridoma cell lines PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences See Example 32 may be used to amplify the expressed VH and VL sequences expressed by phage. The PCR products may then be cloned using vectors for example which have a PCR product cloning site consisting of a 5 and 3 single T nucleotide overhang that is complementary to the overhanging single adenine nucleotide added onto the 5 and 3 end of PCR products by many DNA polymerases used for PCR reactions. The VH and VL domains can then be sequenced using conventional methods known in the art.

The cloned VH and VL genes may be placed into one or more suitable expression vectors. By way of non limiting example PCR primers including VH or VL nucleotide sequences a restriction site and a flanking sequence to protect the restriction site may be used to amplify the VH or VL sequences. Utilizing cloning techniques known to those of skill in the art the PCR amplified VH domains may be cloned into vectors expressing the appropriate immunoglobulin constant region e.g. the human IgG1 or IgG4 constant region for VH domains and the human kappa or lambda constant regions for kappa and lambda VL domains respectively.

Preferably the vectors for expressing the VH or VL domains comprise a promoter suitable to direct expression of the heavy and light chains in the chosen expression system a secretion signal a cloning site for the immunoglobulin variable domain immunoglobulin constant domains and a selection marker such as neomycin. The VH and VL domains may also be cloned into a single vector expressing the necessary constant regions. The heavy chain conversion vectors and light chain conversion vectors are then co transfected into cell lines to generate stable or transient cell lines that express full length antibodies e.g. IgG using techniques known to those of skill in the art See for example Guo et al. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 82 925 31 1997 and Ames et al. Immunol. Methods 184 177 86 1995 which are herein incorporated in their entireties by reference .

The invention further provides polynucleotides comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody of the invention and fragments thereof. The invention also encompasses polynucleotides that hybridize under stringent or lower stringency hybridization conditions e.g. as defined supra to polynucleotides that encode an antibody preferably that specifically binds to a polypeptide of the invention preferably an antibody that binds to a polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4OR SEQ ID NO 18.

The polynucleotides may be obtained and the nucleotide sequence of the polynucleotides determined by any method known in the art. For example if the nucleotide sequence of the antibody is known a polynucleotide encoding the antibody may be assembled from chemically synthesized oligonucleotides e.g. as described in Kutmeier et al. BioTechniques 17 242 1994 which briefly involves the synthesis of overlapping oligonucleotides containing portions of the sequence encoding the antibody annealing and ligating of those oligonucleotides and then amplification of the ligated oligonucleotides by PCR.

Alternatively a polynucleotide encoding an antibody may be generated from nucleic acid from a suitable source. If a clone containing a nucleic acid encoding a particular antibody is not available but the sequence of the antibody molecule is known a nucleic acid encoding the immunoglobulin may be chemically synthesized or obtained from a suitable source e.g. an antibody cDNA library or a cDNA library generated from or nucleic acid preferably poly A RNA isolated from any tissue or cells expressing the antibody such as hybridoma cells selected to express an antibody of the invention by PCR amplification using synthetic primers hybridizable to the 3 and 5 ends of the sequence See Example 32 or by cloning using an oligonucleotide probe specific for the particular gene sequence to identify e.g. a cDNA clone from a cDNA library that encodes the antibody. Amplified nucleic acids generated by PCR may then be cloned into replicable cloning vectors using any method well known in the art.

Once the nucleotide sequence and corresponding amino acid sequence of the antibody is determined the nucleotide sequence of the antibody may be manipulated using methods well known in the art for the manipulation of nucleotide sequences e.g. recombinant DNA techniques site directed mutagenesis PCR etc. see for example the techniques described in Sambrook et al. 1990 Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual 2d Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. and Ausubel et al. eds. 1998 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY which are both incorporated by reference herein in their entireties to generate antibodies having a different amino acid sequence for example to create amino acid substitutions deletions and or insertions.

In a specific embodiment the amino acid sequence of the heavy and or light chain variable domains may be inspected to identify the sequences of the complementarity determining regions CDRs by methods that are well known in the art e.g. by comparison to known amino acid sequences of other heavy and light chain variable regions to determine the regions of sequence hypervariability. Using routine recombinant DNA techniques one or more of the CDRs may be inserted within framework regions e.g. into human framework regions to humanize a non human antibody as described supra. The framework regions may be naturally occurring or consensus framework regions and preferably human framework regions see e.g. Chothia et al. J. Mol. Biol. 278 457 479 1998 for a listing of human framework regions . Preferably the polynucleotide generated by the combination of the framework regions and CDRs encodes an antibody that specifically binds a polypeptide of the invention. Preferably as discussed supra one or more amino acid substitutions may be made within the framework regions and preferably the amino acid substitutions improve binding of the antibody to its antigen. Additionally such methods may be used to make amino acid substitutions or deletions of one or more variable region cysteine residues participating in an intrachain disulfide bond to generate antibody molecules lacking one or more intrachain disulfide bonds. Other alterations to the polynucleotide are encompassed by the present invention and within the skill of the art.

For some uses such as for in vitro affinity maturation of an antibody of the invention it may be useful to express the VH and VL domains of one or more antibodies of the invention as single chain antibodies or Fab fragments in a phage display library. For example the cDNAs encoding the VH and VL domains of one or more antibodies of the invention may be expressed in all possible combinations using a phage display library allowing for the selection of VH VL combinations that bind a VEGF 2 polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates. Additionally VH and VL segments the CDR regions of the VH and VL domains of one or more antibodies of the invention in particular may be mutated in vitro. Expression of VH and VL domains with mutant CDRs in a phage display library allows for the selection of VH VL combinations that bind a VEGF 2 receptor polypeptides with preferred binding characteristics such as improved affinity or improved off rates.

In phage display methods functional antibody domains are displayed on the surface of phage particles which carry the polynucleotide sequences encoding them. In particular DNA sequences encoding VH and VL domains are amplified from animal cDNA libraries e.g. human or murine cDNA libraries of lymphoid tissues or synthetic cDNA libraries. The DNA encoding the VH and VL domains are joined together by an scFv linker by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector e.g. p CANTAB 6 or pComb 3 HSS . The vector is electroporated in and the is infected with helper phage. Phage used in these methods are typically filamentous phage including fd and M13 and the VH and VL domains are usually recombinantly fused to either the phage gene III or gene VIII. Phage expressing an antigen binding domain that binds to an antigen of interest i.e. a VEGF 2 polypeptide or a fragment thereof can be selected or identified with antigen e.g. using labeled antigen or antigen bound or captured to a solid surface or bead. Examples of phage display methods that can be used to make the antibodies of the present invention include but are not limited to those disclosed in Brinkman et al. J. Immunol. Methods 182 41 50 1995 Ames et al. J. Immunol. Methods 184 177 186 1995 Kettleborough et al. Eur. J. Immunol. 24 952 958 1994 Persic et al. Gene 187 9 18 1997 Burton et al.

In addition techniques developed for the production of chimeric antibodies Morrison et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81 851 855 1984 Neuberger et al. Nature 312 604 608 1984 Takeda et al. Nature 314 452 454 1985 by splicing genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used. As described supra a chimeric antibody is a molecule in which different portions are derived from different animal species such as those having a variable region derived from a murine mAb and a human immunoglobulin constant region e.g. humanized antibodies.

Alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies U.S. Pat. No. 4 946 778 Bird Science 242 423 42 1988 Huston et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 5879 5883 1988 and Ward et al. Nature 334 544 54 1989 can be adapted to produce single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies are formed by linking the heavy and light chain fragments of the Fv region via an amino acid bridge resulting in a single chain polypeptide. Techniques for the assembly of functional Fv fragments in may also be used Skerra et al. Science 242 1038 1041 1988 .

The antibodies of the invention can be produced by any method known in the art for the synthesis of antibodies in particular by chemical synthesis by intracellular immunization i.e. intrabody technology or preferably by recombinant expression techniques. Methods of producing antibodies include but are not limited to hybridoma technology EBV transformation and other methods discussed herein as well as through the use recombinant DNA technology as discussed below.

Recombinant expression of an antibody of the invention or fragment derivative variant or analog thereof e.g. a heavy or light chain of an antibody of the invention or a single chain antibody of the invention requires construction of an expression vector containing a polynucleotide that encodes the antibody. Once a polynucleotide encoding an antibody molecule or a heavy or light chain of an antibody or portion thereof preferably containing the heavy or light chain variable domain of the invention has been obtained the vector for the production of the antibody molecule may be produced by recombinant DNA technology using techniques well known in the art. Thus methods for preparing a protein by expressing a polynucleotide containing an antibody encoding nucleotide sequence are described herein. Methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences and appropriate transcriptional and translational control signals. These methods include for example in vitro recombinant DNA techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo genetic recombination. The invention thus provides replicable vectors comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an antibody molecule of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a heavy or light chain variable domain operably linked to a promoter. Such vectors may include the nucleotide sequence encoding the constant region of the antibody molecule see e.g. PCT Publication WO 86 05807 PCT Publication WO 89 01036 and U.S. Pat. No. 5 122 464 and the variable domain of the antibody may be cloned into such a vector for expression of the entire heavy or light chain.

The expression vector is transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce an antibody of the invention. Thus the invention includes host cells containing a polynucleotide encoding an antibody of the invention or a heavy or light chain thereof or a single chain antibody of the invention operably linked to a heterologous promoter. In preferred embodiments for the expression of double chained antibodies vectors encoding both the heavy and light chains may be co expressed in the host cell for expression of the entire immunoglobulin molecule as detailed below.

A variety of host expression vector systems may be utilized to express the antibody molecules of the invention. Such host expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of interest may be produced and subsequently purified but also represent cells which may when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences express an antibody molecule of the invention in situ. These include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria e.g. transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences yeast e.g. transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing antibody coding sequences insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. baculovirus containing antibody coding sequences plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus CaMV tobacco mosaic virus TMV or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors e.g. Ti plasmid containing antibody coding sequences or mammalian cell systems e.g. COS CHO BHK 293 3T3 NSO cells harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells e.g. metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses e.g. the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter . Preferably bacterial cells such as and more preferably eukaryotic cells especially for the expression of whole recombinant antibody molecule are used for the expression of a recombinant antibody molecule. For example mammalian cells such as Chinese hamster ovary cells CHO in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for antibodies Foecking et al.

In bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the antibody molecule being expressed. For example when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of an antibody molecule vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include but are not limited to the expression vector pUR278 Ruther et al. EMBO J. 2 1791 1983 in which the antibody coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced pIN vectors Inouye Inouye Nucleic Acids Res. 13 3101 3109 1985 Van ieeke Schuster J. Biol. Chem. 24 5503 5509 1989 and the like pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S Transferase GST . In general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to matrix glutathione agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.

In an insect system nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcNPV is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in cells. The antibody coding sequence may be cloned individually into non essential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter .

In mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the antibody coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription translation control complex e.g. the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non essential region of the viral genome e.g. region E1 or E3 will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the antibody molecule in infected hosts. e.g. see Logan Shenk Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 355 359 1984 . Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc. see Bittner et al. Methods in Enzymol. 153 51 544 1987 .

In addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications e.g. glycosylation and processing e.g. cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the post translational processing and modification of proteins and gene products. Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO VERY BHK Hela COS MDCK 293 3T3 W138 and in particular breast cancer cell lines such as for example BT483 Hs578T HTB2 BT20 and T47D and normal mammary gland cell line such as for example CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.

For long term high yield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred. For example cell lines which stably express the antibody molecule may be engineered. Rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with DNA controlled by appropriate expression control elements e.g. promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc. and a selectable marker. Following the introduction of the foreign DNA engineered cells may be allowed to grow for 1 2 days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media. The selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines. This method may advantageously be used to engineer cell lines which express the antibody molecule. Such engineered cell lines may be particularly useful in screening and evaluation of compounds that interact directly or indirectly with the antibody molecule.

A number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase Wigler et al. Cell 11 223 1977 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase Szybalska Szybalski Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 48 202 1992 and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase Lowy et al.

Also antimetabolite resistance can be used as the basis of selection for the following genes dhfr which confers resistance tomethotrexate Wigler et al. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 357 1980 O Hare et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78 1527 1981 gpt which confers resistance to mycophenolic acid Mulligan Berg Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology may be routinely applied to select the desired recombinant clone and such methods are described for example in Ausubel et al. eds. . Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons. NY 1993 Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 and in Chapters 12 and 13 Dracopoli et al. eds Current Protocols in Human Genetics John Wiley Sons NY 1994 Colberre Garapin et al.

The expression levels of an antibody molecule can be increased by vector amplification for a review see Bebbington and Hentschel The use of vectors based on gene amplification for the expression of cloned genes in mammalian cells in DNA cloning Vol. 3. Academic Press New York 1987 . When a marker in the vector system expressing antibody is amplifiable increase in the level of inhibitor present in culture of host cell will increase the number of copies of the marker gene. Since the amplified region is associated with the antibody gene production of the antibody will also increase Crouse et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 3 257 1983 .

Vectors which use glutamine synthase GS or DHFR as the selectable markers can be amplified in the presence of the drugs methionine sulphoximine or methotrexate respectively. An advantage of glutamine synthase based vectors are the availabilty of cell lines e.g. the murine myeloma cell line NSO which are glutamine synthase negative. Glutamine synthase expression systems can also function in glutamine synthase expressing cells e.g. Chinese Hamster Ovary CHO cells by providing additional inhibitor to prevent the functioning of the endogenous gene. Vectors that use glutamine synthase as the selectable marker include but pre not limited to the pEE6 expression vector described in Stephens and Cockett 17 7110 1989 . A glutamine synthase expression system and components thereof are detailed in PCT publications WO87 04462 WO86 05807 WO89 01036 WO89 10404 and WO91 06657 which are incorporated in their entireties by reference herein. Additionally glutamine synthsse expression vectors that may be used according to the present invention are commercially available from suplliers including for example Lonza Biologics Inc. Portsmouth N.H. .

The host cell may be co transfected with two expression vectors of the invention the first vector encoding a heavy chain derived polypeptide and the second vector encoding a light chain derived polypeptide. The two vectors may contain identical selectable markers which enable equal expression of heavy and light chain polypeptides. Alternatively a single vector may be used which encodes and is capable of expressing both heavy and light chain polypeptides. In such situations the light chain should be placed before the heavy chain to avoid an excess of toxic free heavy chain Proudfoot Nature 322 52 1986 Kohler Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 77 2197 1980 . The coding sequences for the heavy and light chains may comprise cDNA or genomic DNA.

The present invention further includes compositions comprising the polypeptides of the present invention fused or bonjugated to antibody domains other than the variable regions. For example the polypeptides of the present invention may be fused or conjugated to an antibody Fc region or portion thereof. The antibody portion fused to a polypeptide of the present invention may comprise the constant region hinge region CH1 domain CH2 domain and CH3 domain or any combination of whole domains or portions thereof. The polypeptides may also be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to form multimers. For example Fc portions fused to the polypeptides of the present invention can form dimers through disulfide bonding between the Fc portions. Higher multimeric forms can be made by fusing the polypeptides to portions of IgA and IgM.

As discussed supra the polypeptides corresponding to a polypeptide polypeptide fragment or a variant of SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 18 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to increase the in vivo half life of the polypeptides or for use in immunoassays using methods known in the art. Further the polypeptides corresponding to SEQ ID NO 2 SEQ ID NO 4 or SEQ ID NO 18 may be fused or conjugated to the above antibody portions to facilitate purification. One reported example describes chimeric proteins consisting of the first two domains of the human CD4 polypeptide and various domains of the constant regions of the heavy or light chains of mammalian immunoglobulins. EP 394 827 Traunecker et al. Nature 331 84 86 1988 . The polypeptides of the present invention fused or conjugated to an antibody having disulfide linked dimeric structures due to the IgG may also be more efficient in binding and neutralizing other molecules than the monomeric secreted protein or protein fragment alone. Fountoulakis et al. J. Biochem. 270 3958 3964 1995 . In many cases the Fc part in a fusion protein is beneficial in therapy and diagnosis and thus can result in for example improved pharmacokinetic properties. EP A 232 262 . Alternatively deleting the Fc part after the fusion protein has been expressed detected and purified would be desired. For example the Fc portion may hinder therapy and diagnosis if the fusion protein is used as an antigen for immunizations. In drug discovery for example human proteins such as hIL 5 have been fused with Fc portions for the purpose of high throughput screening assays to identify antagonists of hIL 5. See Bennett et al. J. Molecular Recognition 8 52 58 1995 Johanson et al. J. Biol. Chem. 270 9459 9471 1995 .

As described in Gentz et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 821 824 1989 for instance hexa histidine provides for convenient purification of the fusion protein. Other peptide tags useful for purification include but are not limited to the HA tag which corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein Wilson et al.

The antibodies of the invention may be utilized for immunophenotyping of cell lines and biological samples. The translation product of the gene of the present invention may be useful as a cell specific marker or more specifically as a cellular marker that is differentially expressed at various stages of differentiation and or maturation of particular cell types. Monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific epitope or combination of epitopes will allow for the screening of cellular populations expressing the marker. Various techniques can be utilized using monoclonal antibodies to screen for cellular populations expressing the marker s and include magnetic separation using antibody coated magnetic beads panning with antibody attached to a solid matrix i.e. plate and flow cytometry See e.g. U.S. Pat.

These techniques allow for the screening of particular populations of cells such as might be found with hematological malignancies i.e. minimal residual disease MRD in acute leukemic patients and non self cells in transplantations to prevent Graft versus Host Disease GVHD . Alternatively these techniques allow for the screening of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells capable of undergoing proliferation and or differentiation as might be found in human umbilical cord blood.

The antibodies of the invention may be assayed for immunospecific binding by any method known in the art. The immunoassays which can be used include but are not limited to competitive and non competitive assay systems using techniques such as BIAcore analysis see e.g. Example 33 FACS Fluorescence activated cell sorter analysis immunofluorescence immunocytochemistry western blots radioimmunoassays ELISA enzyme linked immunosorbent assay sandwich immunoassays immunoprecipitation assays precipitin reactions gel diffusion precipitin reactions immunodiffusion assays agglutination assays complement fixation assays immunoradiometric assays fluorescent immunoassays protein A immunoassays to name but a few. Such assays are routine and well known in the art see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . Exemplary immunoassays are described briefly below but are not intended by way of limitation .

Immunoprecipitation protocols generally comprise lysing a population of cells in a lysis buffer such as RIPA buffer 1 NP 40 or Triton X 100 1 sodium deoxycholate 0.1 SDS 0.15 M NaCl 0.01 M sodium phosphate at pH 7.2 1 Trasylol supplemented with protein phosphatase and or protease inhibitors e.g. EDTA PMSF aprotinin sodium vanadate adding the antibody of interest to the cell lysate incubating for a period of time e.g. 1 4 hours at 4 C. adding protein A and or protein G sepharose beads to the cell lysate incubating for about an hour or more at 4 C. washing the beads in lysis buffer and resuspending the beads in SDS sample buffer. The ability of the antibody of interest to immunoprecipitate a particular antigen can be assessed by e.g. western blot analysis One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to inicrease the binding of the antibody to an antigen and decrease the background e.g. pre clearing the cell lysate with sepharose beads . For further discussion regarding immunoprecipitation protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.16.1.

Western blot analysis generally comprises preparing protein samples electrophoresis of the protein samples in a polyacrylamide gel e.g. 8 20 SDS PAGE depending on the molecular weight of the antigen transferring the protein sample from the polyacrylamide gel to a membrane such as nitrocellulose PVDF or nylon blocking the membrane in blocking solution e.g. PBS with 3 BSA or non fat milk washing the membrane in washing buffer e.g. PBS Tween 20 blocking the membrane with primary antibody the antibody of interest diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in washing buffer blocking the membrane with a secondary antibody which recognizes the primary antibody e.g. an anti human antibody conjugated to an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase or radioactive molecule e.g. P or 1251 diluted in blocking buffer washing the membrane in wash buffer and detecting the presence of the antigen. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected and to reduce the background noise. For further discussion regarding western blot protocols see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 10.8.1.

ELISAs comprise preparing antigen coating the well of a 96 well microtiter plate with the antigen adding the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound such as an enzymatic substrate e.g. horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase to the well and incubating for a period of time and detecting the presence of the antigen. In ELISAs the antibody of interest does not have to be conjugated to a detectable compound instead a second antibody which recognizes the antibody of interest conjugated to a detectable compound may be added to the well. Further instead of coating the well with the antigen the antibody may be coated to the well. In this case a second antibody conjugated to a detectable compound may be added following the addition of the antigen of interest to the coated well. One of skill in the art would be knowledgeable as to the parameters that can be modified to increase the signal detected as well as other variations of ELISAs known in the art. For further discussion regarding ELISAs see e.g. Ausubel et al eds 1994 Current Protocols in Molecular Biology Vol. 1 John Wiley Sons Inc. New York at 11.2.1.

The binding affinity of an antibody to an antigen and the off rate of an antibody antigen interaction can be determined by competitive binding assays. One example of a competitive binding assay is a radioimmunoassay comprising the incubation of labeled antigen e.g. H or I or fragment or variant thereof with the antibody of interest in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled antigen and the detection of the antibody bound to the labeled antigen. The affinity of the antibody of interest for a particular antigen and the binding off rates can be determined from the data by scatchard plot analysis. Competition with a second antibody can also be determined using radioimmunoassays. In this case the antigen is incubated with antibody of interest conjugated to a labeled compound e.g. compound labeled with H or I in the presence of increasing amounts of an unlabeled second antibody. This kind of competitive assay between two antibodies may also be used to determine if two antibodies bind the same or different epitopes.

In a preferred embodiment BIAcore kinetic analysis is used to determine the binding on and off rates of antibodies including antibody fragments or variants thereof to a VEGF 2 or fragments of VEGF 2 BIAcore kinetic analysis comprises analyzing the binding and dissociation of antibodies from chips with immobilized VEGF 2 on their surface as described in detail in Example 33.

In a specific embodiment nucleic acids comprising sequences encoding antibodies or functional derivatives thereof are administered to treat inhibit or prevent a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention by way of gene therapy. Gene therapy refers to therapy performed by the administration to a subject of an expressed or expressible nucleic acid. In this embodiment of the invention the nucleic acids produce their encoded protein that mediates a therapeutic effect.

Any of the methods for gene therapy available in the art can be used according to the present invention. Exemplary methods are described below.

For general reviews of the methods of gene therapy see Goldspiel et al. Clinical Pharmacy 12 488 505 1993 Wu and Wu Biotherapy 3 87 95 1991 Tolstoshev Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 32 573 596 1993 Mulligan Science 260 926 932 1993 and Morgan and Anderson Ann. Rev. Biochem. 62 191 217 1993 May TIBTECH 11 5 155 215 1993 . Methods commonly known in the art of recombinant DNA technology which can be used are described in Ausubel et al. eds. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley Sons NY 1993 and Kriegler Gene Transfer and Expression A Laboratory Manual Stockton Press NY 1990 .

In a preferred aspect the compound comprises nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody said nucleic acid sequences being part of expression vectors that express the antibody or fragments or chimeric proteins or heavy or light chains thereof in a suitable host. In particular such nucleic acid sequences have promoters operably linked to the antibody coding region said promoter being inducible or constitutive and optionally tissue specific. In another particular embodiment nucleic acid molecules are used in which the antibody coding sequences and any other desired sequences are flanked by regions that promote homologous recombination at a desired site in the genome thus providing for intrachromosomal expression of the antibody encoding nucleic acids Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 . In specific embodiments the expressed antibody molecule is a single chain antibody alternatively the nucleic acid sequences include sequences encoding both the heavy and light chains or fragments thereof of the antibody.

Delivery of the nucleic acids into a patient may be either direct in which case the patient is directly exposed to the nucleic acid or nucleic acid carrying vectors or indirect in which case cells are first transformed with the nucleic acids in vitro then transplanted into the patient. These two approaches are known respectively as in vivo or ex vivo gene therapy.

In a specific embodiment the nucleic acid sequences are directly administered in vivo where it is expressed to produce the encoded product. This can be accomplished by any of numerous methods known in the art e.g. by constructing them as part of an appropriate nucleic acid expression vector and administering it so that they become intracellular e.g. by infection using defective or attenuated retrovirals or other viral vectors see U.S. Pat. No. 4 980 286 or by direct injection of naked DNA or by use of microparticle bombardment e.g. a gene gun Biolistic Dupont or coating with lipids or cell surface receptors or transfecting agents encapsulation in liposomes microparticles or microcapsules or by administering them in linkage to a peptide which is known to enter the nucleus by administering it in linkage to a ligand subject to receptor mediated endocytosis see e.g. Wu and Wu J. Biol. Chem. 262 4429 4432 1987 which can be used to target cell types specifically expressing the receptors etc. In another embodiment nucleic acid ligand complexes can be formed in which the ligand comprises a fusogenic viral peptide to disrupt endosomes allowing the nucleic acid to avoid lysosomal degradation. In yet another embodiment the nucleic acid can be targeted in vivo for cell specific uptake and expression by targeting a specific receptor see e.g. PCT Publications WO 92 06180 WO 92 22635 WO92 20316 WO93 14188 WO 93 20221 . Alternatively the nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination Koller and Smithies Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 8932 8935 1989 Zijlstra et al. Nature 342 435 438 1989 .

In a specific embodiment viral vectors that contains nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody of the invention are used. For example a retroviral vector can be used see Miller et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 581 599 1993 . These retroviral vectors contain the components necessary for the correct packaging of the viral genome and integration into the host cell DNA. The nucleic acid sequences encoding the antibody to be used in gene therapy are cloned into one or more vectors which facilitates delivery of the gene into a patient. More detail about retroviral vectors can be found in Boesen et al. Biotherapy 6 291 302 1994 which describes the use of a retroviral vector to deliver the mdr1 gene to hematopoietic stem cells in order to make the stem cells more resistant to chemotherapy. Other references illustrating the use of retroviral vectors in gene therapy are Clowes et al. J. Clin. Invest. 93 644 651 1994 Kiem et al. Blood 83 1467 1473 1994 Salmons and Gunzberg Human Gene Therapy 4 129 141 1993 and Grossman and Wilson Curr. Opin in Genetics and Devel. 3 110 114 1993 .

Adenoviruses are other viral vectors that can be used in gene therapy. Adenoviruses are especially attractive vehicles for delivering genes to respiratory epithelia. Adenoviruses naturally infect respiratory epithelia where they cause a mild disease. Other targets for adenovirus based delivery systems are liver the central nervous system endothelial cells and muscle. Adenoviruses have the advantage of being capable of infecting non dividing cells. Kozarsky and Wilson Current Opinion in Genetics and Development 3 499 503 1993 present a review of adenovirus based gene therapy. Bout et al. Human Gene Therapy 5 3 10 1994 demonstrated the use of adenovirus vectors to transfer genes to the respiratory epithelia of rhesus monkeys. Other instances of the use of adenoviruses in gene therapy can be found in Rosenfeld et al. Science 252 431 434 1991 Rosenfeld et al. Cell 68 143 155 1992 Mastrangeli et al. J. Clin. Invest. 91 225 234 1993 PCT Publication WO94 12649 and Wang et al. Gene Therapy 2 775 783 1995 . In a preferred embodiment adenovirus vectors are used.

Adeno associated virus AAV has also been proposed for use in gene therapy Walsh et al. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 204 289 300 1993 U.S. Pat. No. 5 436 146 .

Another approach to gene therapy involves transferring a gene to cells in tissue culture by such methods as electroporation lipofection calcium phosphate knediated transfection or viral infection. Usually the method of transfer includes the transfer of a selectable marker to the cells. The cells are then placed under selection to isolate those cells that have taken up and are expressing the transferred gene. Those cells are then delivered to a patient.

In this embodiment the nucleic acid is introduced into a cell prior to administration in vivo of the resulting recombinant cell. Such introduction can be carried out by any method known in the art including but not limited to transfection electroporation microinjection infection with a viral or bacteriophage vector containing the nucleic acid sequences cell fusion chromosome mediated gene transfer microcell mediated gene transfer spheroplast fusion etc. Numerous techniques are known in the art for the introduction of foreign genes into cells see e.g. Loeffler and Behr Meth. Enzymol. 217 599 618 1993 Cohen et al. Meth. Enzymol. 217 618 644 1993 Cline Pharmac. Ther. 29 69 92m 1985 and may be used in accordance with the present invention provided that the necessary developmental and physiological functions of the recipient cells are not disrupted. The technique should provide for the stable transfer of the nucleic acid to the cell so that the nucleic acid is expressible by the cell and preferably heritable and expressible by its cell progeny.

The resulting recombinant cells can be delivered to a patient by various methods known in the art. Recombinant blood cells e.g. hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are preferably administered intravenously. The amount of cells envisioned for use depends on the desired effect patient state etc. and can be determined by one skilled in the art.

Cells into which a nucleic acid can be introduced for purposes of gene therapy encompass any desired available cell type and include but are not limited to epithelial cells endothelial cells keratinocytes fibroblasts muscle cells hepatocytes blood cells such as Tlymphocytes Blymphocytes monocytes macrophages neutrophils eosinophils megakaryocytes granulocytes various stem or progenitor cells in particular hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells e.g. as obtained from bone marrow umbilical cord blood peripheral blood fetal liver etc.

In an embodiment in which recombinant cells are used in gene therapy nucleic acid sequences encoding an antibody are introduced into the cells such that they are expressible by the cells or their progeny and the recombinant cells are then administered in vivo for therapeutic effect. In a specific embodiment stem or progenitor cells are used. Any stem and or progenitor cells which can be isolated and maintained in vitro can potentially be used in accordance with this embodiment of the present invention see e.g. PCT Publication WO 94 08598 Stemple and Anderson Cell 71 973 985 1992 Rheinwald Meth. Cell Bio. 21A 229 1980 and Pittelkow and Scott Mayo Clinic Proc. 61 771 1986 .

The effect of the compound or composition on the cell line and or tissue sample can be determined utilizing techniques known to those of skill in the art including but not limited to rosette formation assays and cell lysis assays. In accordance with the invention in vitro assays which can be used to determine whether administration of a specific compound is indicated include in vitro cell culture assays in which a patient tissue sample is grown in culture and exposed to or otherwise administered a compound and the effect of such compound upon the tissue sample is observed.

The invention provides methods of treatment inhibition and prophylaxis by administration to a subject of an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the invention preferably an antibody of the invention.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88 1864 1868 1991 etc. Alternatively a nucleic acid can be introduced intracellularly and incorporated within host cell DNA for expression by homologous recombination.

The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a compound and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a specific embodiment the term pharmaceutically acceptable means approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The term carrier refers to a diluent adjuvant excipient or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids such as water and oils including those of petroleum animal vegetable or synthetic origin such as peanut oil soybean oil mineral oil sesame oil and the like. Water is a preferred carrier when the pharmaceutical composition is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch glucose lactose sucrose gelatin malt rice flour chalk silica gel sodium stearate glycerol monostearate talc sodium chloride dried skim milk glycerol propylene glycol water ethanol and the like. The composition if desired can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions suspensions emulsion tablets pills capsules powders sustained release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated as a suppository with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol lactose starch magnesium stearate sodium saccharine cellulose magnesium carbonate etc. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington s Pharmaceutical Sciences by E. W. Martin. Such compositions will contain a therapeutically effective amount of the compound preferably in purified form together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration.

In a preferred embodiment the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for intravenous administration to human beings. Typically compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form for example as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration.

The compounds of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those formed with anions such as those derived from hydrochloric phosphoric acetic oxalic tartaric acids etc. and those formed with cations such as those derived from sodium potassium ammonium calcium ferric hydroxides isopropylamine triethylamine 2 ethylamino ethanol histidine procaine etc.

The amount of the compound of the invention which will be effective in the treatment inhibition and prevention of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration and the seriousness of the disease or disorder and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient s circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.

For antibodies the dosage administered to a patient is typically 0.1 mg kg to 100 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Preferably the dosage administered to a patient is between 0.1 mg kg and 20 mg kg of the patient s body weight more preferably 1 mg kg to 10 mg kg of the patient s body weight. Generally human antibodies have a longer half life within the human body than antibodies from other species due to the immune response to the foreign polypeptides. Thus lower dosages of human antibodies and less frequent administration is often possible. Further the dosage and frequency of administration of antibodies of the invention may be reduced by enhancing uptake and tissue penetration e.g. into the brain of the antibodies by modifications such as for example lipidation.

The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. Optionally associated with such container s can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture use or sale for human administration.

Labeled antibodies and derivatives and analogs thereof which specifically bind to a polypeptide of interest can be used for diagnostic purposes to detect diagnose or monitor diseases disorders and or conditions associated with the aberrant expression and or activity of a polypeptide of the invention. The invention provides for the detection of aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of aberrant expression.

The invention provides a diagnostic assay for diagnosing a disorder comprising a assaying the expression of the polypeptide of interest in cells or body fluid of an individual using one or more antibodies specific to the polypeptide interest and b comparing the level of gene expression with a standard gene expression level whereby an increase or decrease in the assayed polypeptide gene expression level compared to the standard expression level is indicative of a particular disorder. With respect to cancer the presence of a relatively high amount of transcript in biopsied tissue from an individual may indicate a predisposition for the development of the disease or may provide a means for detecting the disease prior to the appearance of actual clinical symptoms. A more definitive diagnosis of this type may allow health professionals to employ preventative measures or aggressive treatment earlier thereby preventing the development or further progression of the cancer.

Antibodies of the invention can be used to assay protein levels in a biological sample using classical immunohistological methods known to those of skill in the art e.g. see Jalkanen et al. J. Cell. Biol. 101 976 985 1985 Jalkanen et al. J. Cell Biol. 105 3087 3096 1987 . Other antibody based methods useful for detecting protein gene expression include immunoassays such as the enzyme linked imniunosorbent assay ELISA and the radioimmunoassay RIA . Suitable antibody assay labels are known in the art and include enzyme labels such as glucose oxidase radioisotopes such as iodine 125I 121I carbon 14C sulfur 35S tritium 3H indium 112In and technetium 99Tc luminescent labels such as luminol and fluorescent labels such as fluorescein and rhodamine and biotin.

One aspect of the invention is the detection and diagnosis of a disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of a polypeptide of interest in an animal preferably a mammal and most preferably a human. In one embodiment diagnosis comprises a administering for example parenterally subcutaneously or intraperitoneally to a subject an effective amount of a labeled molecule which specifically binds to the polypeptide of interest b waiting for a time interval following the administering for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject where the polypeptide is expressed and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level c determining background level and d detecting the labeled molecule in the subject such that detection of labeled molecule above the background level indicates that the subject has a particular disease or disorder associated with aberrant expression of the polypeptide of interest. Background level can be determined by various methods including comparing the amount of labeled molecule detected to a standard value previously determined for a particular system.

It will be understood in the art that the size of the subject and the imaging system used will determine the quantity of imaging moiety needed to produce diagnostic images. In the case of a radioisotope moiety for a human subject the quantity of radioactivity injected will normally range from about 5 to 20 millicuries of 99 mTc. The labeled antibody or antibody fragment will then preferentially accumulate at the location of cells which contain the specific protein. In vivo tumor imaging is described in S. W. Burchiel et al. Immunopharmacokinetics of Radiolabeled Antibodies and Their Fragments. Chapter 13 in Tumor Imaging The Radiochemical Detection of Cancer S. W. Burchiel and B. A. Rhodes eds. Masson Publishing Inc. 1982 .

Depending on several variables including the type of label used and the mode of administration the time interval following the administration for permitting the labeled molecule to preferentially concentrate at sites in the subject and for unbound labeled molecule to be cleared to background level is 6 to 48 hours or 6 to 24 hours or 6 to 12 hours. In another embodiment the time interval following administration is 5 to 20 days or 5 to 10 days.

In an embodiment monitoring of the disease or disorder is carried out by repeating the method for diagnosing the disease or disease for example one month after initial diagnosis six months after initial diagnosis one year after initial diagnosis etc.

Presence of the labeled molecule can be detected in the patient using methods known in the art for in vivo scanning. These methods depend upon the type of label used. Skilled artisans will be able to determine the appropriate method for detecting a particular label. Methods and devices that may be used in the diagnostic methods of the invention include but are not limited to computed tomography CT whole body scan such as position emission tomography PET magnetic resonance imaging MRI and sonography.

In a specific embodiment the molecule is labeled with a radioisotope and is detected in the patient using a radiation responsive surgical instrument Thurston et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 441 050 . In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a fluorescent compound and is detected in the patient using a fluorescence responsive scanning instrument. In another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a positron emitting metal and is detected in the patent using positron emission tomography. In yet another embodiment the molecule is labeled with a paramagnetic label and is detected in a patient using magnetic resonance imaging MRI .

The present invention provides kits that can be used in the above methods. In one embodiment a kit comprises an antibody of the invention preferably a purified antibody in one or more containers. In a specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a substantially isolated polypeptide comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with an antibody included in the kit. Preferably the kits of the present invention further comprise a control antibody which does not react with the polypeptide of interest. In another specific embodiment the kits of the present invention contain a means for detecting the binding of an antibody to a polypeptide of interest e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate such as a fluorescent compound an enzymatic substrate a radioactive compound or a luminescent compound or a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody may be conjugated to a detectable substrate .

In another specific embodiment of the present invention the kit is a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antibodies specific against proliferative and or cancerous polynucleotides and polypeptides. Such a kit may include a control antibody that does not react with the polypeptide of interest. Such a kit may include a substantially isolated polypeptide antigen comprising an epitope which is specifically immunoreactive with at least one anti polypeptide antigen antibody. Further such a kit includes means for detecting the binding of said antibody to the antigen e.g. the antibody may be conjugated to a fluorescent compound such as fluorescein or rhodamine which can be detected by flow cytometry . In specific embodiments the kit may include a recombinantly produced or chemically synthesized polypeptide antigen. The polypeptide antigen of the kit may also be attached to a solid support.

In a more specific embodiment the detecting means of the above described kit includes a solid support to which said polypeptide antigen is attached. Such a kit may also include a non attached reporter labeled anti human antibody. In this embodiment binding of the antibody to the polypeptide antigen can be detected by binding of the said reporter labeled antibody.

In an additional embodiment the invention includes a diagnostic kit for use in screening serum containing antigens of the polypeptide of the invention. The diagnostic kit includes a substantially isolated antibody specifically immunoreactive with polypeptide or polynucleotide antigens and means for detecting the binding of the polynucleotide or polypeptide antigen to the antibody. In one embodiment the antibody is attached to a solid support. In a specific embodiment the antibody may be a monoclonal antibody. The detecting means of the kit may include a second labeled monoclonal antibody. Alternatively or in addition the detecting means may include a labeled competing antigen.

In one diagnostic configuration test serum is reacted with a solid phase reagent having a surface bound antigen obtained by the methods of the present invention. After binding with specific antigen antibody to the reagent and removing unbound serum components by washing the reagent is reacted with reporter labeled anti human antibody to bind reporter to the reagent in proportion to the amount of bound anti antigen antibody on the solid support. The reagent is again washed to remove unbound labeled antibody and the amount of reporter associated with the reagent is determined. Typically the reporter is an enzyme which is detected by incubating the solid phase in the presence of a suitable fluorometric luminescent or colorimetric substrate Sigma St. Louis Mo. .

The solid surface reagent in the above assay is prepared by known techniques for attaching protein material to solid support material such as polymeric beads dip sticks 96 well plate or filter material. These attachment methods generally include non specific adsorption of the protein to the support or covalent attachment of the protein typically through a free amine group to a chemically reactive group on the solid support such as an activated carboxyl hydroxyl or aldehyde group. Alternatively streptavidin coated plates can be used in conjunction with biotinylated antigen s .

Thus the invention provides an assay system or kit for carrying out this diagnostic method. The kit generally includes a support with surface bound recombinant antigens and a reporter labeled anti human antibody for detecting surface bound anti antigen antibody.

Antibodies may further be used in an immunoassay to detect the presence of tumors in certain individuals. Enzyme immunoassay can be performed from the blood sample of an individual. Elevated levels of VEGF 2 can be considered diagnostic of cancer.

Truncated versions of VEGF 2 can also be produced that are capable of interacting with wild type VEGF 2 to form dimers that fail to activate endothelial cell growth therefore inactivating the endogenous VEGF 2. Or mutant forms of VEGF 2 form dimers themselves and occupy the ligand binding domain of the proper tyrosine kinase receptors on the target cell surface but fail to activate cell growth.

Alternatively antagonists to the polypeptides of the present invention may be employed which bind to the receptors to which a polypeptide of the present invention normally binds. The antagonists may be closely related proteins such that they recognize and bind to the receptor sites of the natural protein however they are inactive forms of the natural protein and thereby prevent the action of VEGF 2 since Receptor sites are occupied. In these ways the action of the VEGF 2 is prevented and the antagonist inhibitors may be used therapeutically as an anti tumor drug by occupying the receptor sites of tumors which are recognized by VEGF 2 or by inactivating VEGF 2 itself. The antagonist inhibitors may also be used to prevent inflammation due to the increased vascular permeability action of VEGF 2. The antagonist inhibitors may also be used to treat solid tumor growth diabetic retinopathy psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis.

The antagonist inhibitors may be employed in a composition with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier e.g. as hereinabove described.

The present invention will be further described with reference to the following examples however it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to such examples. All parts or amounts unless otherwise specified are by weight.

In order to facilitate understanding of the following examples certain frequently occurring methods and or terms will be described.

 Plasmids are designated by a lower case p preceded and or followed by capital letters and or numbers. The starting plasmids herein are either commercially available publicly available on an unrestricted basis or can be constructed from available plasmids in accord with published procedures. In addition equivalent plasmids to those described are known in the art and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.

 Digestion of DNA refers to catalytic cleavage of the DNA with a restriction enzyme that acts only at certain sequences in the DNA. The various restriction enzymes used herein are commercially available and their reaction conditions cofactors and other requirements were used as would be known to the ordinarily skilled artisan. For analytical purposes typically 1 mg of plasmid or DNA fragment is used with about 2 units of enzyme in about 20 Fl of buffer solution. For the purpose of isolating DNA fragments for plasmid construction typically 5 to 50 mg of DNA are digested with 20 to 250 units of enzyme in a larger volume. Appropriate buffers and substrate amounts for particular restriction enzymes are specified by the manufacturer. Incubation times of about 1 hour at 37EC are ordinarily used but may vary in accordance with the supplier s instructions. After digestion the reaction is electrophoresed directly on a polyacrylamide gel to isolate the desired fragment.

Size separation of the cleaved fragments is performed using 8 percent polyacrylamide gel described by Goeddel D. et al. 8 4057 1980 .

 Oligonucleotides refer to either a single stranded polydeoxynucleotideor two complementary polydeoxynucleotide strands which may be chemically synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides have no 5 phosphate and thus will not ligate to another oligonucleotide without adding a phosphate with an ATP in the presence of a kinase. A synthetic oligonucleotide will ligate to a fragment that has not been dephosphorylated.

 Ligation refers to the process of forming phosphodiester bonds between two double stranded nucleic acid fragments Sambrook et al. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 p. 146 . Unless otherwise provided ligation may be accomplished using known buffers and conditions with 10 units of T4 DNA ligase ligase per 0.5 mg of approximately equimolar amounts of the DNA fragments to be ligated.

Unless otherwise stated transformation was performed as described by the method of Graham F. and Van der Eb A. 52 456 457 1973 .

Northern blot analysis was carried out to examine the levels of expression of VEGF 2 in human tissues and breast cancer cell lines in human tissues. Total cellular RNA samples were isolated with RNAzol B system Biotecx Laboratories Inc. . About 10 mg of total RNA isolated from each breast tissue and cell line specified was separated on 1 agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon filter Sambrook et al. Second Edition Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1989 . The labeling reaction was done according to the Stratagene Prime It kit with 50 ng DNA fragment. The labeled DNA was purified with a Select G 50 column from 5 Prime 3 Prime Inc Boulder Colo. . The filter was then hybridized with a radioactive labeled full length VEGF 2 gene at 1 000 000 cpm ml in 0.5 M NaPOand 7 SDS overnight at 65 C. After washing twice at room temperature and twice at 60 C. with 0.5 SSC 0.1 SDS the filters were then exposed at 70 C. overnight with an intensifying screen. A message of 1.6 Kd was observed in 2 breast cancer cell lines. lane 4 represents a very tumorigenic cell line that is estrogen independent for growth.

Also 10 mg of total RNA from 10 human adult tissues were separated on an agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon filter. The filter was then hybridized with radioactively labeled VEGF 2 probe in 7 SDS 0.5 M NaPO pH 7.2 1 BSA overnight at 65bC. Following washing in 0.2 SSC at 65 C. the filter was exposed to film for 24 days at 70 C. with intensifying screen. See .

The VEGF 2 cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro to determine the size of the translatable polypeptide encoded by the truncated form of VEGF 2 and a partial VEG 2 cDNA. The two inserts of VEGF 2 in the pBluescript SK vector were amplified by PCR with three pairs of primers 1 M13 reverse and forward primers 2 M13 reverse primer and VEGF primer F4 and 3 M13 reverse primer and VEGF primer F5. The sequence of these primers are as follows.

M13 2 reverse primer 5 ATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG 3 SEQ ID NO 9 This sequence is located upstream of the 5 end of the VEGF 2 cDNA insert in the pBlueScript vector and is in an anti sense orientation as the cDNA. A T3 promoter sequence is located between this primer and the VEGF 2 cDNA.

M13 2 forward primer 5 GGGTTITCCCAGTCACGAC 3 SEQ ID NO 10 . This sequence is located downstream of the 3 end of the VEGF 2 cDNA insert in the pBluescript vector and is in an anti sense orientation as the cDNA insert.

VEGF primer F4 5 CCACATGGTTCAGGAAAGACA 3 SEQ ID NO 11 . This sequence is located within the VEGF 2 cDNA in an anti sense orientation from bp 1259 1239 which is about 169 bp away from the 3 end of the stop codon and about 266 bp before the last nucleotide of the cDNA.

PCR reaction with all three pairs of primers produce amplified products with T3 promoter sequence in front of the cDNA insert. The first and third pairs of primers produce PCR products that encode the polypeptide of VEGF 2 shown in SEQ ID NO 4. The second pair of primers produce PCR product that misses 36 amino acids coding sequence at the C terminus of the VEGF 2 polypeptide.

Approximately 0.5 mg of PCR product from first pair of primers 1 mg from second pair of primers 1 mg from third pair of primers were used for in vitro transcription translation. The in vitro transcription translation reaction was performed in a 25 Fl of volume using the TTJ Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems Promega CAT L4950 . Specifically the reaction contains 12.5 Fl of TT rabbit reticulocyte lysate 2 Fl of TT reaction buffer 1 Fl of T3 polymerase 1 Fl of 1 mM amino acid mixture minus methionine 4 Fl of S methionine 1000 Ci mmol 10 mCi ml 1 Fl of 40 U l RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor 0.5 or 1 mg of PCR products. Nuclease free HO was added to bring the volume to 25 Fl. The reaction was incubated at 30 C. for 2 hours. Five microliters of the reaction product was analyzed on a 4 20 gradient SDS PAGE gel. After fixing in 25 isopropanol and 10 acetic acid the gel was dried and exposed to an X ray film overnight at 70 C.

As shown in PCR products containing the truncated VEGF 2 cDNA i.e. as depicted in SEQ ID NO 3 and the cDNA missing 266 bp in the 3 un translated region 3 UTR produced the same length of translated products whose molecular weights are estimated to be 38 40 dk lanes 1 and 3 . The cDNA missing all the 3 UTR and missing sequence encoding the C terminal 36 amino acids was translated into a polypeptide with an estimated molecular weight of 36 38 kd lane 2 .

The DNA sequence encoding the VEGF 2 protein without 46 amino acids at the N terminus see ATCC No. 97149 was amplified using PCR oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the 5 and 3 sequences of the gene 

The 5 primer has the sequence TGT AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT AGG GAT CCC GCC ATG GAG GCC ACG GCT TAT GC SEQ ID NO 12 and contains a BamHI restriction enzyme site in bold and 17 nucleotide sequence complementary to the 5 sequence of VEGF 2 nt. 150 166 .

The 3 primer has the sequence GATC TCT AGA TTA GCT CAT TTG TGG TCT SEQ ID NO 13 and contains the cleavage site for the restriction enzyme XbaI and 18 nucleotides complementary to the 3 sequence of VEGF 2 including the stop codon and 15 nt sequence before stop codon.

The amplified sequences were isolated from a 1 agarose gel using a commercially available kit Geneclean BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . The fragment was then digested with the endonuclease BamHI and XbaI and then purified again on a 1 agarose gel. This fragment was ligated to pAcGP67A baculovirus transfer vector Pharmingen at the BamHI and XbaI sites. Through this ligation VEGF 2 cDNA was cloned in frame with the signal sequence of baculovirus gp67 gene and was located at the 3 end of the signal sequence in the vector. This is designated pAcGP67A VEGF 2.

To clone VEGF 2 with the signal sequence of gp67 gene to the pRGI vector for expression VEGF 2 with the signal sequence and some upstream sequence were excised from the pAcGP67A VEGF 2 plasmid at the Xho restriction endonuclease site located upstream of the VEGF 2 cDNA and at the XbaI restriction endonuclease site by XhoI and XbaI restriction enzyme. This fragment was separated from the rest of vector on a 1 agarose gel and was purified using Geneclean kit. It was designated F2.

The PRGI vector modification of pVL941 vector is used for the expression of the VEGF 2 protein using the baculovirus expression system for review see Summers M. D. and Smith G. E. Texas Agricultural Experimental Station Bulletin No. 1555 1987 . This expression vector contains the strong polyhedrin promoter of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus AcMNPV followed by the recognition sites for the restriction endonucleases BamHI SmaI XbaI BglII and Asp718. A site for restriction endonuclease XhoI is located upstream of BamHI site. The sequence between XhoI and BamHI is the same as that in PAcGp67A static on tape vector. The polyadenylation site of the simian virus SV 40 is used for efficient polyadenylation. For an easy selection of recombinant virus the beta galactosidase gene from is inserted in the same orientation as the polyhedrin promoter followed by the polyadenylation signal of the polyhedrin gene. The polyhedrin sequences are flanked at both sides by viral sequences for the cell mediated homologous recombination of cotransfected wild type viral DNA. Many other baculovirus vectors could be used in place of pRGI such as pAc373 pVL941 and pAcIM1 Luckow V. A and Summers M. D. 170 31 39 1989 .

The plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes XboI and XbaI and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase by procedures known in the art. The DNA was then isolated from a 1 agarose gel using the commercially available kit Geneclean BIO 101 Inc. La Jolla Calif. . This vector DNA is designated V2.

Fragment F2 and the dephosphorylated plasmid V2 were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. HB101 cells were then transformed and bacteria identified that contained the plasmid pBac gp67 VEGF 2 with the VEGF 2 gene using the enzymes BamHI and XbaI. The sequence of the cloned fragment was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

5 mg of the plasmid pBac gp67 VEGF 2 was cotransfected with 1.0 mg of a commercially available linearized baculovirus BaculoGoldJ baculovirus DNA Pharmingen San Diego Calif. using the lipofectin method Felgner et al. 84 7413 7417 1987 .

1 mg of BaculoGoldJ virus DNA and 5 mg of the plasmid pBac gp67 VEGF 2 were mixed in a sterile well of a microtiter plate containing 50 ml of serum free Grace s mediun Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg Md. . Afterwards 10 ml Lipofectin plus 90 ml Grace s medium were added mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then the transfection mixture was added dropwise to the Sf9 insect cells ATCC CRL 1711 seeded in a 35 mm tissue culture plate with 1 ml Grace s medium without serum. The plate was rocked back and forth to mix the newly added solution. The plate was then incubated for 5 hours at 27 C. After 5 hours the transfection solution was removed from the plate and 1 ml of Grace s insect medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum was added. The plate was put back into an incubator and cultivation continued at 27 C. for four days.

After four days the supernatant was collected and a plaque assay performed similar as described by Summers and Smith supra. As a modification an agarose gel with Blue Gal Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg was used which allows an easy isolation of blue stained plaques. A detailed description of a plaque assay can also be found in the user s guide for insect cell culture and baculovirology distributed by Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg page 9 10 .

Four days after the serial dilution the virus was added to the cells blue stained plaques were picked with the tip of an Eppendorf pipette. The agar containing the recombinant viruses was then resuspended in an Eppendorf tube containing 200 ml of Grace s medium. The agar was removed by a brief centrifugation and the supernatant containing the recombinant baculovirus was used to infect Sf9 cells seeded in 35 mm dishes. Four days later the supernatants of these culture dishes were harvested and then stored at 4 C.

Sf9 cells were grown in Grace s medium supplemented with 10 heat inactivated FBS. The cells were infected with the recombinant baculovirus V gp67 VEGF 2 at a multiplicity of infection MOI of 1. Six hours later the medium was removed and replaced with SF900 II medium minus methionine and cysteine Life Technologies Inc. Gaithersburg . 42 hours later 5 mCi of S methionine and 5 mCi S cysteine Amersham were added. The cells were further incubated for 16 hours before they were harvested by centrifugation and the labelled proteins visualized by SDS PAGE and autoradiography.

Protein from the medium and cytoplasm of the Sf9 cells was analyzed by SDS PAGE under non reducing and reducing conditions. See respectively. The medium was dialyzed against 50 mM MES pH 5.8. Precpitates were obtained after dialysis and resuspended in 100 mM NaCltrate pH 5.0. The resuspended precipitate was analyzed again by SDS PAGE and was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. See .

The medium supernatant was also diluted 1 10 in 50 mM MES pH 5.8 and applied to an SP 650M column 1.0 6.6 cm Toyopearl at a flow rate of 1 ml min. Protein was eluted with step gradients at 200 300 and 500 mM NaCl. The VEGF 2 was obtained using the elution at 500 mM. The eluate was analyzed by SDS PAGE in the presence or absence of reducing agent b mercaptoethanol and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue. See .

The expression of plasmid VEGF 2 HA is derived from a vector pcDNAI Amp Invitrogen containing 1 SV40 origin of replication 2 ampicillin resistance gene 3 replication origin 4 CMV promoter followed by a polylinker region an SV40 intron and polyadenylation site. A DNA fragment encoding the entire VEGF 2 precursor and a HA tag fused in frame to its 3 end was cloned into the polylinker region of the vector therefore the recombinant protein expression is directed under the CMV promoter. The HA tag corresponds to an epitope derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein as previously described Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 . The infusion of HA tag to the target protein allows easy detection of the recombinant protein with an antibody that recognizes the HA epitope. The plasmid construction strategy is described as follows 

The DNA sequence encoding VEGF 2 ATCC No. 97149 was constructed by PCR using two primers the 5 primer CGC GGA TCC ATG ACT GTA CTC TAC CCA SEQ ID NO 14 contains a BamHI site followed by 18 nucleotides of VEGF 2 coding sequence starting from the initiation codon 

the 3 sequence CGC TCT AGA TCA AGC GTA GTC TGG GAC GTC GTA TGG GTA CTC GAG GCT CAT TTG TGG TCT 3 SEQ ID NO 15 contains complementary sequences to an XbaI site HA tag XhoI site and the last 15 nucleotides of the VEGF 2 coding sequence not including the stop codon .

Therefore the PCR product contains a BamHI site coding sequence followed by an XhoI restriction endonuclease site and HA tag fused in frame a translation termination stop codon next to the HA tag and an XbaI site. The PCR amplified DNA fragment and the vector pcDNAI Amp were digested with BamHI and XbaI restriction enzyme and ligated. The ligation mixture was transformed into strain SURE Stratagene Cloning Systems La Jolla Calif. 92037 the transformed culture was plated on ampicillin media plates and resistant colonies were selected. Plasmid DNA was isolated from transformants and examined by restriction analysis for the presence of the correct fragment. For expression of the recombinant VEGF 2 COS cells were transfected with the expression vector by DEAE DEXTRAN method J. Sambrook E. Fritsch T. Maniatis Cold Spring Laboratory Press 1989 . The expression of the VEGF 2 HA protein was detected by radiolabelling and immunoprecipitation method E. Harlow and D. Lane Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press 1988 . Cells were labelled for 8 hours with S cysteine two days post transfection. Culture media was then collected and cells were lysed with detergent RIPA buffer 150 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 0.1 SDS 1 NP 40 0.5 DOC 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 Wilson et al. 37 767 1984 . Both cell lysate and culture media were precipitated with an HA specific monoclonal antibody. Proteins precipitated were analyzed on 15 SDS PAGE gels.

On day 1 human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC were seeded at 2 5 10cells 35 mm dish density in M199 medium containing 4 fetal bovine serum FBS 16 units ml heparin and 50 units ml endothelial cell growth supplements ECGS Biotechnique Inc. . On day 2 the medium was replaced with M199 containing 10 FBS 8 units ml heparin.

Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media e.g. Ham s F12 media with 10 FBS penicillin and streptomycin is added. This is then incubated at 37 C. for approximately one week. At this time fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.

pMV 7 Kirschmeier P. T. et al. 7 219 225 1988 flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified using glass beads.

The cDNA encoding a polypeptide of the present invention is amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5 and 3 end sequences respectively. The 5 primer containing an EcoRI site and the 3 primer further includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained undet conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is used to transform bacteria HB101 which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector had the gene of interest properly inserted.

The amphotropic pA317 or GP am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium DMEM with 10 calf serum CS penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells are transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the gene the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells .

Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells and subsequently the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media containing the infectious viral particles is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker such as neo or his.

The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product.

Northern blot analysis was carried out to examine the levels of expression of VEGF 2 mRNA in human fetal and adult tissues. A cDNA probe containing the entire nucleotide sequence of the VEGF 2 protein was labeled with P using the rediprime DNA labeling system Amersham Life Science according to the manufacturer s instructions. After labeling the probe was purified using a CHROMA SPIN 100 column Clontech Laboratories Inc. according to manufacturer s protocol number PT1200 1. The purified labeled probe was then used to examine various human tissues for VEGF 2 mRNA.

A Multiple Tissue Northern MTN blot containing various human tissues Fetal Kidney Fetal Lung Fetal Liver Brain Kidney Lung Liver Spleen Thymus Bone Marrow Testes Placenta and Skeletal Muscle was obtained from Clontech. The MTN blot was examined with the labeled probe using ExpressHyb hybridization solution Clontech according t6 manufacturer s protocol number PT1190 1. Following hybridization and washing the blot was exposed to film at 70 C. overnight with an intensifying screen and developed according to standard procedures.

Expression of VEGF 2 mRNA is abundant in vascular smooth muscle and several highly vascularized tissues. VEGF 2 is expressed at significantly higher levels in tissues associated with hematopoetic or angiogenic activities i.e. fetal kidney fetal lung bone marrow placental spleen and lung tissue. The expression level of VEGF 2 is low in adult kidney fetal liver adult liver testes and is almost undetectable in fetal brain and adult brain See .

In primary cultured cells the expression of VEGF 2 mRNA is abundant in vascular smooth muscle cells and dermal fibroblast cells but much lower in human umbilical vein endothelial cells see . This mRNA distribution pattern is very similar to that of VEGF.

In order to identify and analyze biologically active VEGF 2 polypeptides a panel of deletion mutants of VEGF 2 was constructed using the expression vector pHE4a.

To permit Polymerase Chain Reaction directed amplification and sub cloning of VEGF 2 T103 L215 amino acids 103 to 215 in or SEQ ID NO 18 into the protein expression vector pHE4 two oligonucleotide primers complementary to the desired region of VEGF 2 were synthesized with the following base sequence

Chinese hamster ovary or other cells lacking dihydrofolate activity that are transfected with these plasmids can be selected by growing the cells in a selective medium alpha minus MEM Life Technologies supplemented with the chemotherapeutic agent methotrexate. The amplification of the DHFR genes in cells resistant to methotrexate MTX has been well documented see e.g. Alt F. W. Kellems R. M. Bertino J. R. and Schimke R. T. 1978253 1357 1370 Hamlin J. L and Ma C. 19901097 107 143 Page M. J and Sydenham M. A. 19919 64 68 . Cells grown in increasing concentrations of MTX develop resistance to the drug by overproducing the target enzyme DHFR as a result of amplification of the DHFR gene. If a second gene is linked to the DHFR gene it is usually co amplified and over expressed. It is state of the art to develop cell lines carrying more than 1 000 copies of the genes. Subsequently when the methotrexate is withdrawn cell lines contain the amplified gene integrated into the chromosome s .

Plasmid pC1 contains for the expression of the gene of interest a strong promoter of the long terminal repeat LTR of the Rouse Sarcoma Virus Cullen et al. March 1985 438 4470 plus a fragment isolated from the enhancer of the immediate early gene of human cytomegalovirus CMV Boshart et al. 41 521 530 1985 . Downstream of the promoter are the following single restriction enzyme cleavage sites that allow the integration of the genes BamHI PvuII and NruI. Behind these cloning sites the plasmid contains translational stop codons in all three reading frames followed by the 3N intron and the polyadenylation site of the rat preproinsulin gene. Other high efficient promoters can also be used for the expression e.g. the human b actin promoter the SV40 early or late promoters or the long terminal repeats from other retroviruses e.g. HIV and HTLVI. For the polyadenylation of the mRNA other signals e.g. from the human growth hormone or globin genes can be used as well.

Stable cell lines carrying a gene of interest integrated into the chromosomes can also be selected upon co transfection with a selectable marker such as gpt G418 or hygromycin. It is advantageous to use more than one selectable marker in the beginning e.g. G418 plus methotrexate.

The plasmid pC1 is digested with the restriction enzyme BamHI and then dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphates by procedures known in the art. The vector is then isolated from a 1 agarose gel

Expression of the VEGF 2 HA fusion protein from the construct made in Example 4 for example was detected by radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation using methods described in for example Harlow and colleagues Antibodies A Laboratory Manual 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Cold Spring Harbor N.Y. 1988 . To this end two days after transfection the cells were labeled by incubation in media containing 35S cysteine for 8 hours. The cells and the media were collected and the cells were washed and then lysed with detergent containing RIPA buffer 150 mM NaCl 1 NP 40 0.1 SDS 1 NP 40 0.5 DOC 50 mM TRIS pH 7.5 as described by Wilson and colleagues supra . Proteins were precipitated from the cell lysate and from the culture media using an HA specific monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins then were analyzed by SDS PAGE and autoradiography.

As shown in cells transfected with pcDNA VEGF 2HA secreted a 56 kd and a 30 kd protein. The 56 kd protein but not the 30 kd protein could also be detected in the cell lysate but is not detected in controls. This suggests the 30 kd protein is likely to result from cleavage of the 56 kd protein. Since the HA tag is on the C terminus of VEGF 2 the 30 kd protein must represent the C terminal portion of the cleaved protein whereas the N terminal portion of the cleaved protein would not be detected by immunoprecipitation. These data indicate that VEGF 2 protein expressed in mammalian cells is secreted and processed.

Expression of VEGF 2 is abundant in highly vascularized tissues. Therefore the role of VEGF 2 in regulating proliferation of several types of endothelial cells was examined.

For evaluation of mitogenic activity of growth factors the colorimetric MTS 3 4 5 dimethylthiazol 2 yl 5 3 carboxymethoxyphenyl 2 4 sulfophenyl H tetrazolium assay with the electron coupling reagent PMS phenazine methosulfate was performed CellTiter 96 AQ Promega . Cells were seeded in a 96 well plate 5 000 cells well in 0.1 mL serum supplemented medium and allowed to attach overnight. After serum starvation for 12 hours in 0.5 FBS conditions bFGF VEGFor VEGF 2 in 0.5 FBS with or without Heparin 8 U ml were added to wells for 48 hours. 20 mg of MTS PMS mixture 1 0.05 were added per well and allowed to incubate for 1 hour at 37 C. before measuring the absorbance at 490 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Background absorbance from control wells some media no cells was subtracted and seven wells were performed in parallel for each condition. See Leak et al. 30A 512 518 1994 

VEGF 2 stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC and dermal microvascular endothelial cells slightly . The stimulatory effect of VEGF 2 is more pronounced on proliferation of endometrial and microvascular endothelial cells . Endometrial endothelial cells HEEC demonstrated the greatest response to VEGF 2 96 of the effect of VEGF on microvascular endothelial cells . The response of microvasculai endothelial cells HMEC to VEGF 2 was 73 compared to VEGF. The response of HUVEC and BAEC bovine aortic endothelial cells to VEGF 2 was substantially lower at 10 and 7 respectively. The activity of VEGF 2 protein has varied between different purification runs with the stimulatory effect of certain batches on HUVEC proliferation being significantly higher than that of other batches.

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 induced proliferation of endothelial cells.

VEGF 2 expression is high in vascular smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle is an important therapeutic target for vascular diseases such as restenosis. To evaluate the potential effects of VEGF 2 on smooth muscle cells the effect of VEGF 2 on human aortic smooth muscle cell HAoSMC proliferation was examined.

HAoSMC proliferation can be measured for example by BrdUrd incorporation. Briefly subconfluent quiescent cells grown on the 4 chamber slides are transfected with CRP or FITC labeled AT2 3LP. Then the cells are pulsed with 10 calf serum and 6 mg ml BrdUrd. After 24 h immunocytochemistry is performed by using BrdUrd Staining Kit Zymed Laboratories . In brief the cells are incubated with the biotinylated mouse anti BrdUrd antibody at 4 C. for 2 h after exposing to denaturing solution and then with the streptavidin peroxidase and diaminobenzidine. After counterstaining with hematoxylin the cells are mounted for microscopic examination and the BrdUrd positive cells are counted. The BrdUrd index is calculated as a percent of the BrdUrd positive cells to the total cell number. In addition the simultaneous detection of the BrdUrd staining nucleus and the FITC uptake cytoplasm is performed for individual cells by the concomitant use of bright field illumination and dark field UV fluorescent illumination. See Hayashida et al. 6 271 36 21985 21992 1996 .

VEGF 2 has an inhibitory effect on proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells induced by PDGF but not by Fetal Bovine Serum FBS .

This example will be used to explore the possibility that VEGF 2 may stimulate lymphatic endothelial cell migration. Currently there are no published reports of such a model. However we will be adapting a model of vascular endothelial cell migration for use with lymphatic endothelial cells essentially as follows 

Endothelial cell migration assays are performed using a 48 well microchemotaxis chamber Neuroprobe Inc. Cabin John Md. Falk W. Goodwin R. H. J. and Leonard E. J. A 48 well micro chemotaxis assembly for rapid and accurate measurement of leukocyte migration. 1980 33 239 247 . Polyvinylpyrrolidone free polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 8 um Nucleopore Corp. Cambridge Mass. are coated with 0.1 gelatin for at least 6 hours at room temperature and dried under sterile air. Test substances are diluted to appropriate concentrations in M199 supplemented with 0.25 bovine serum albumin BSA and 25 ul of the final dilution is placed in the lower chamber of the modified Boyden apparatus. Subconfluent early passage 2 6 HUVEC or BMEC cultures are washed and trypsinized for the minimum time required to achieve cell detachment. After placing the filter between lower and upper chamber 2.5 10cells suspended in 50 ul M199 containing 1 FBS are seeded in the upper compartment. The apparatus is then incubated for 5 hours at 37 C. in a humidified chamber with 5 CO2 to allow cell migration. After the incubation period the filter is removed and the upper side of the filter with the non migrated cells is scraped with a rubber policeman. The filters are fixed with methanol and stained with a Giemsa solution Diff Quick Baxter McGraw Park Ill. . Migration is quantified by counting cells of three random high power fields 40 in each well and all groups are performed in quadruplicate.

In an assay examining HUVEC migration using a 43 well microchemotaxis chamber VEGF 2 was able to stimulate migration of HUVEC .

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 induced migration of endothelial cells.

Nitric oxide released by the vascular endothelium is believed to be a mediator of vascular endothelium relaxation. VEGF 1 has been demonstrated to induce nitric oxide production by endothelial cells in response to VEGF 1. As a result VEGF 2 activity can be assayed by determining nitric oxide production by endothelial cells in response to VEGF 2.

Nitric oxide is measured in 96 well plates of confluent microvascular endothelial cells after 24 hours staivation and a subsequent 4 hr exposure to various levels of VEGF 1 and VEGF 2. Nitric oxide in the medium is determined by use of the Griess reagent to measure total nitrite after reduction of nitric oxide derived nitrate by nitrate reductase. The effect of VEGF 2 on nitric oxide release was examined on HUVEC.

Briefly NO release from cultured HUVEC monolayer was measured with a NO specific polarographic electrode connected to a NO meter Iso NO World Precision Instruments Inc. 1049 . Calibration of the NO elements was performed according to the following equation 2 KNO 2 KI 2HSO6 2 NO I 2 HO 2 KSO

The standard calibration curve was obtained by adding graded concentrations of KNO 0 5 10 25 50 100 250 and 500 nmol L into the calibration solution containing KI and HSO. The specificity of the Iso NO electrode to NO was previously determined by measurement of NO from authentic NO gas 1050 . The culture medium was removed and HUVECs were washed twice with Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline. The cells were then bathed in 5 ml of filtered Krebs Henseleit solution in 6 well plates and the cell plates were kept on a slide warmer Lab Line Instruments Inc. To maintain the temperature at 37 C. The NO sensor probe was inserted vertically into the wells keeping the tip of the electrode 2 mm under the surface of the solution before addition of the different conditions. S nitroso acetyl penicillanin SNAP was used as a positive control. The amount of released NO was expressed as picomoles per 1 10endothelial cells. All values reported were means of four to six measurements in each group number of cell culture wells . See Leak et al. 217 96 105 1995 .

VEGF 2 was capable of stimulating nitric oxide release on HUVEC to a higher level than VEGF. This suggested that VEGF 2 may modify vascular permeability and vessel dilation.

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 induced nitric oxide release from endothelial cells.

Another step in angiogenesis is cord formation marked by differentiation of endothelial cells. This bioassay measures the ability of microvascular endothelial cells to form capillary like structures hollow structures when cultured in vitro.

CADMEC microvascular endothelial cells are purchased from Cell Applications Inc. as proliferating passage 2 cells and are cultured in Cell Applications CADMEC Growth Medium and used at passage 5. For the in vitro angiogenesis assay the wells of a 48 well cell culture plate are coated with Cell Applications Attachment Factor Medium 200 ml well for 30 min. at 37 C. CADMEC are seeded onto the coated wells at 7 500 cells well and cultured overnight in Growth Medium. The Growth Medium is then replaced with 300 mg Cell Applications Cord Formation Medium containing control buffer or the protein of the invention 0.1 to 100 ng ml and the cells are cultured for an additional 48 hr. The numbers and lengths of the capillary like cords are quantitated through use of the Boeckeler VIA 170 video image analyzer. All assays are done in triplicate.

Commercial R D VEGF 50 ng ml is used as a positive control b estradiol 1 ng ml is used as a negative control. The appropriate buffer without protein is also utilized as a control.

It has been observed that VEGF 2 inhibits cord formation similar to IFNa which also stimulates endothelial cell proliferation . This inhibitory effect may be a secondary effect of endothelial proliferation which is mutually exclusive with the cord formation process.

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 inhibition of cord formation.

Chick chorioallantoic membrane CAM is a well established system to examine angiogenesis. Blood vessel formation on CAM is easily visible and quantifiable. The ability of VEGF 2 to stimulate angiogenesis in CAM was examined.

Fertilized eggs of the White Leghorn chick and the Japanese qual were incubated at 37.8 C. and 80 humidity. Differentiated CAM of 16 day old chick and 13 day old qual embryos was studied with the following methods.

On Day 4 of development a window was made into the egg shell of chick eggs. The embryos were checked for normal development and the eggs sealed with cellotape. They were further incubated until Day 13. Thermanox coverslips Nunc Naperville Ill. were cut into disks of about 5 mm in diameter. Sterile and salt free growth factors were dissolved in distilled water and about 3.3 mg 5 ml was pipetted on the disks. After air drying the inverted disks were applied on CAM. After 3 days the specimens were fixed in 3 glutaraldehyde and 2 formaldehyde and rinsed in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer. They were photographed with a stereo microscope Wild M8 and embedded for semi and ultrathin sectioning as described above. Controls were performed with carrier disks alone.

This data demonstrates that VEGF 2 can stimulate angiogenesis in the CAM assay nine fold compared to the untreated control. However this stimulation is only 45 of the level of VEGF stimulation .

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 stimulation of angiogenesis in the CAM assay.

In order to establish an in vivo model for angiogenesis to test protein activities mice and rats have been implanted subcutaneously with methylcellulose disks containing either 20 mg of BSA negative control and 1 mg of bFGF and 0.5 mg of VEGF 1 positive control .

It appeared as though the BSA disks contained little vascularization while the positive control disks showed signs of vessel formation. At day 9 one mouse showed a clear response to the bFGF.

Both VEGF proteins appeared to enhance Matrigel cellularity by a factor of approximately 2 by visual estimation.

An additional 30 mice were implanted with disks containing BSA bFGF and varying amounts of VEGF 1 VEGF 2 B8 and VEGF 2 C4. Each mouse received two identical disks rather than one control and one experimental disk.

Samples of all the disks recovered were immunostained with Von Willebrand s factor to detect for the presence of endothelial cells in the disks and flk 1 and flt 4 to distinguish between vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. However definitive histochemical analysis of neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis could not be determined.

Additionally one of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 modulated angiogenesis.

To study the in vivo effects of VEGF 2 on ischemia a rabbit hindlimb ischemia model was created by surgical removal of one femoral artery as described previously Takeshita S. et al. 147 1649 1660 1995 . The excision of the femoral artery results in retrograde propagation of thrombus and occlusion of the external iliac artery. Consequently blood flow to the ischemic limb is dependent upon collateral vessels originating from the internal iliac artery Takeshita S. et al. 147 1649 1660 1995 . An interval of 10 days was allowed for post operative recovery of rabbits and development of endogenous collateral vessels. At 10 day post operatively day 0 after performing a baseline angiogram the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb was transfected with 500 mg naked VEGF 2 expression plasmid by arterial gene transfer technology using a hydrogel coated balloon catheter as described Riessen R. et al. 4 749 758 1993 Leclerc G. et al. 90 936 944 1992 . When VEGF 2 was used in the treatment a single bolus of 500 mg VEGF 2 protein or control was delivered into the internal iliac artery of the ischemic limb over a period of 1 min. through an infusion catheter. On day 30 various parameters were measured in these rabbits.

Both VEGF 2 protein and naked expression plasmid were able to restore the following parameters in the ischemic limb. Restoration of blood flow angiographic score seem to be slightly more by administration of 500 mg plasmid compared with by 500 mg protein The extent of the restoration is comparable with that by VEGF in separate experiments data not shown . A vessel dilator was not able to achieve the same effect suggesting that the blood flow restoration is not simply due to a vascular dilation effect.

Max FL the blood flow during fully dilated condition also an indirect measure of the blood vessel amount 

This is measured by the angiogram of collateral vessels. A score was determined by the percentage of circles in an overlaying grid that with crossing opacified arteries divided by the total number m the rabbit thigh.

As discussed VEGF 2 is processed to an N terminal and a C terminal fragment which are co purified. The N terminal fragment contains the intact putative functional domain and may be responsible for the biologic activity.

As described above VEGF 2 can stimulate NO release a mediator of vascular endothelium dilation. Since dilation of vascular endothelium is important in reducing blood pressure the ability of VEGF 2 to affect the blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR was examined. VEGF 2 caused a dose dependent decrease in diastolic blood pressure

 . There was a steady decline in diastolic blood pressure with increasing doses of VEGF 2 which attained statistical significance when a dose of 300 mg kg was administered. The changes observed at this dose were not different than those seen with acetylcholine 0.5 mg kg . Decreased mean arterial pressure MAP was observed as well . VEGF 2 300 mg kg and acetylcholine reduced the MAP of these SHR animals to normal levels.

Additionally increasing doses 0 10 30 100 300 and 900 mg kg of the B8 C5 and C4 preps of VEGF 2 were administered to 13 14 week old spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR . Data are expressed as the mean SEM. Statistical analysis was performed with a paired t test and statistical significance was defined as p

Studies with VEGF 2 C5 prep revealed that although it significantly decreased the blood pressure the magnitude of the response was not as great as that seen with VEGF 2 B8 prep even when used at a dose of 900 mg kg.

Studies with VEGF 2 C4 preparation revealed that this CHO expressed protein preparation yielded similar results to that seen with C5 i.e. statistically significant but of far less magnitude than seen with the B8 preparation see .

As a control and since the C4 and C5 batches of VEGF 2 yielded minor but statistically significant changes in blood pressure experiments were performed experiments with another CHO expressed protein M CIF. Administration of M CIF at doses ranging from 10 900 mg kg produced no significant changes in diastolic blood pressure. A minor statistically significant reduction in mean arterial blood pressure was observed at doses of 100 and 900 mg kg but no dose response was noted. These results suggest that the reductions in blood pressure observed with the C4 and C5 batches of VEGF 2 were specific i.e. VEGF 2 related.

The evaluation parameters include skin blood flow skin temperature and factor VIII immunohistochemistry or endothelial alkaline phosphatase reaction. VEGF 2 expression during the skin ischemia is studied using in situ hybridization.

Angiogenic therapy using VEGF 2 has been developed as a novel therapeutic strategy to obtain restoration of blood flow around the ischemia in case of peripheral arterial diseases.

VEGF 2 is evaluated as a potent mitogen capable of stimulating the development of collateral vessels and restructuring new vessels after coronary artery occlusion. Alteration of VEGF 2 expression is investigated in situ.

In this protocol the VEGF 2 polypeptide and or VEGF 2 antibodies are delivered to the rat cornea using a filter disk which is inserted into the cornea as described below.

Sterile cornea filter disks are stamped from 0.45 m pore size Millipore HAWP01300 filters using a sterile 20 G needle with the standard bevel cut off and a machined bevel ground around the flattened tip under biosafety hood. Stamped disks are removed from the 20 G needle by means of a 24 G stylet. VEGF 2 polypeptides and or VEGF 2 antibody solution are prepared in sterile filtered 1 TBS 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4 150 mM NaCl as described below. The control groups will receive 1 TBS or flag peptide only.

Generally 20 Sprague Dawley rats weighing 175 200 grams is used for these experiments. On the day of surgery each animal is anesthetized with ketamine 50 mg kg im Phoenix NDC 57319 291 02 xylazine 10 mg kg im Phoenix NDC 57319 326 26 and acepromazine 1.0 mg kg im Fermenta 117 531 . After the rat is anesthetized the vibrissae is trimmed and the rat is injected with 0.5 mg kg atropine sulfate RBI A 105 Lot 69H0545 . The rat is wrapped in sterile surgical drape. Sterile gloves is used for the surgical procedure. The surgical field eye plus surrounding fur is rinsed with saline followed by 5 povidone iodine Perdue Frederick H8151 K97 Lot 6H31 . The eye is then be rinsed with sterile saline and 2 drops of 2 lidocaine HCl Phoenix NDC 57319 093 05 Lot 0080991 are dropped onto the eye. Eyes are irrigated with saline throughout the procedure to prevent desiccation. An incision is made with a sterile 15 scalpel blade 2 mm from the corneal limbus. The incision is made approximately half way through the thickness of the cornea. After the incision is made sterile microsurgical scissors are used to create a pocket that extends from the point of the incision to approximately 0.75 mm from the limbus. The presoaked disk soaked in a sterile petri dish on ice overnight in 20 L of the respective test solution is inserted into this pocket so that the leading edge of the disk is 1 mm from the limbus.

After the surgery is complete the eyelid is closed and gently held together with a microaneurysm clamp. The rat is then be turned over and the procedure starting at step 6 is repeated. After both eyes are finished the rat is placed in an isolation cage to wake up. As soon as the rat begins to regain consciousness the microaneurysm clamps are removed.

Five days following the surgery the rat is dosed with 0.5 mg kg atropine. Upon observation of mydriasis the animal is euthanized. Each rat eye is digitally imaged using ImagePro Plus at 4.0 . The surface area pixels and density percent of area of interest is quantitated in the area directly beneath and on either side of the filter disk. Nine surface area measurements are obtained per eye. A mean angiogenic surface area is obtained for each eye.

One of skill in the art could readily modify the above protocol to test the effect of agonists and or antagonists of VEGF 2 e.g. VEGF 2 antibodies on VEGF 2 modulated neovascularization. In one modification the filter disks might be soaked with an equimolar amount of VEGF 2 and VEGF 2 antibody. Alternatively one could treat the corneas directly only with VEGF 2 polypetides and administer VEGF 2 antibody systemically via intraperitoneal intravenous or subcutaneous injection. When systemic injection is used afor exmaple the rat may be given one or more doses of between 0.1 to 10 mg kg.

To demonstrate that VEGF 2 accelerates the healing process the genetically diabetic mouse model of wound healing is used. The full thickness wound healing model in the db db mouse is a well characterized clinically relevant and reproducible model of impaired wound healing. Healing of the diabetic wound is dependent on formation of granulation tissue and re epithelialization rather than contraction Gartner M. H. et al. 52 389 1992 Greenhalgh D. G. et al. 136 1235 1990 .

The diabetic animals have many of the characteristic features observed in Type II diabetes mellitus. Homozygous db db mice are obese in comparison to their normal heterozygous db m littermates.

The characteristics observed in these animals suggests that healing in this model may be similar to the healing observed in human diabetes Greenhalgh et al. 136 1235 1246 1990 .

Genetically diabetic female C57BL KsJ db db mice and their non diabetic db m heterozygous littermates are used in this study Jackson Laboratories . The animals are purchased at 6 weeks of age and were 8 weeks old at the beginning of the study. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. The experiments are conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Wounding protocol is performed according to previously reported methods Tsuboi R. and Rifkin D. B. 172 245 251 1990 . Briefly on the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of Avertin 0.01 mg mL 2 2 2 tribromoethanol and 2 methyl 2 butanol dissolved in deionized water. The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol solution and iodine. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is then created using a Keyes tissue punch. Immediately following wounding the surrounding skin is gently stretched to eliminate wound expansion. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Application of the treatment is given topically for 5 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of surgery and at two day intervals thereafter. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue is no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

VEGF 2 is administered using at a range different doses of VEGF 2 from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology and immunohistochemistry. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Three groups of 10 animals each 5 diabetic and 5 non diabetic controls are evaluated 1 Vehicle placebo control 2 VEGF 2.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total square area of the wound. Contraction is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm the corresponding size of the dermal punch Calculations are made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 Histology

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using a Reichert Jung microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining is performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds are used to assess whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin is altered by treatment with VEGF 2. This assessment included verification of the presence of cell accumulation inflammatory cells capillaries fibroblasts re epithelialization and epidermal maturity Greenhalgh D. G. et al. 136 1235 1990 . A calibrated lens micrometer is used by a blinded observer.

Tissue sections are stained immunohistochemically with a polyclonal rabbit anti human keratin antibody using ABC Elite detection system. Human skin is used as a positive tissue control while non immune IgG is used as a negative control. Keratinocyte growth is determined by evaluating the extent of reepithelialization of the wound using a calibrated lens micrometer.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen cyclin PCNA in skin specimens is demonstrated by using anti PCNA antibody 1 50 with an ABC Elite detection system. Human colon cancer served as a positive tissue control and human brain tissue is used as a negative tissue control. Each specimen included a section with omission of the primary antibody and substitution with non immune mouse IgG. Ranking of these sections is based on the extent of proliferation on a scale of 0 8 the lower side of the scale reflecting slight proliferation to the higher side reflecting intense proliferation.

To demonstrate that VEGF 2 can accelerate the healing process the effects of multiple topical applications of VEGF 2 on full thickness excisional skin wounds in rats in which healing has been impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone is assessed.

Young adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250 300 g Charles River Laboratories are used in this example The animals are purchased at 8 weeks of age and are 9 weeks old at the beginning of the study. The healing response of rats is impaired by the systemic administration of methylprednisolone 17 mg kg rat intramuscularly at the time of wounding. Animals are individually housed and received food and water ad libitum. All manipulations are performed using aseptic techniques. This study is conducted according to the rules and guidelines of Human Genome Sciences Inc. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

The wounding protocol is followed according to section A above. On the day of wounding animals are anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine 50 mg kg and xylazine 5 mg kg . The dorsal region of the animal is shaved and the skin washed with 70 ethanol and iodine solutions. The surgical area is dried with sterile gauze prior to wounding. An 8 mm full thickness wound is created using a Keyes tissue punch. The wounds are left open for the duration of the experiment. Applications of the testing materials are given topically once a day for 7 consecutive days commencing on the day of wounding and subsequent to methylprednisolone administration. Prior to treatment wounds are gently cleansed with sterile saline and gauze sponges.

Wounds are visually examined and photographed at a fixed distance at the day of wounding and at the end of treatment. Wound closure is determined by daily measurement on days 1 5 and on day 8 for Figure. Wounds are measured horizontally and vertically using a calibrated Jameson caliper. Wounds are considered healed if granulation tissue was no longer visible and the wound is covered by a continuous epithelium.

VEGF 2 is administered using at a range different doses of VEGF 2 from 4 mg to 500 mg per wound per day for 8 days in vehicle. Vehicle control groups received 50 mL of vehicle solution.

Animals are euthanized on day 8 with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 300 mg kg . The wounds and surrounding skin are then harvested for histology. Tissue specimens are placed in 10 neutral buffered formalin in tissue cassettes between biopsy sponges for further processing.

Four groups of 10 animals each 5 with methylprednisolone and 5 without glucocorticoid are evaluated 1 Untreated group 2 Vehicle placebo control 3 VEGF 2 treated groups.

Wound closure is analyzed by measuring the area in the vertical and horizontal axis and obtaining the total area of the wound. Closure is then estimated by establishing the differences between the initial wound area day 0 and that of post treatment day 8 . The wound area on day 1 was 64 mm the corresponding size of the dermal punch. Calculations are made using the following formula Open area on day 8 Open area on day 1 Open area on day 1 Histology

Specimens are fixed in 10 buffered formalin and paraffin embedded blocks are sectioned perpendicular to the wound surface 5 mm and cut using an Olympus microtome. Routine hematoxylin eosin H E staining was performed on cross sections of bisected wounds. Histologic examination of the wounds allows assessment of whether the healing process and the morphologic appearance of the repaired skin was improved by treatment with VEGF 2. A calibrated lens micrometer was used by a blinded observer to determine the distance of the wound gap.

Four specific peptides designated SP 40 SP 41 SP 42 and SP 43 have been generated. These will be used to generate monoclonal antibodies to analyze VEGF 2 processing. The peptides are shown below 

The purpose of this experimental approach is to create an appropriate and consistent lymphedema model for testing the therapeutic effects of VEGF 2 in lymphangiogenesis and re establishment of the lymphatic circulatory system in the rat hind limb. Effectiveness is measured by swelling volume of the affected limb quantification of the amount of lymphatic vasculature total blood plasma protein and histopathology. Acute lymphedema is observed for 7 10 days. Perhaps more importantly the chronic progress of the edema is followed for up to 3 4 weeks.

Prior to beginning surgery blood sample was drawn for protein concentration analysis. Male rats weighing approximately 350 g are dosed with Pentobarbital. Subsequently the right legs were shaved from knee to hip. The shaved area is swabbed with gauze soaked in 70 EtOH. Blood is drawn for serum total protein testing. Circumference and volumetric measurements were made prior to injecting dye into paws after marking 2 measurement levels 0.5 cm above heel at mid pt of dorsal paw . The intradermal dorsum of both right and left paws are injected with 0.05 ml of 1 Evan s Blue. Circumference and volumetric measurements are then made following injection of dye into paws.

Using the knee joint as a landmark a mid leg inguinal incision is made circumferentially allowing the femoral vessels to be located. Forceps and hemostats are used to dissect and separate the skin flaps. After locating the femoral vessels the lymphatic vessel that runs along side and underneath the vessel s is located. The main lymphatic vessels in this area are then electrically coagulated or suture ligated.

Using a microscope muscles in back of the leg near the semitendinosis and adductors are bluntly dissected. The popliteal lymph node is then located.

The 2 proximal and 2 distal lymphatic vessels and distal blood supply of the popliteal node are then and ligated by suturing. The popliteal lymph node and any accompanying adipose tissue is then removed by cutting connective tissues.

Care was taken to control any mild bleeding resulting from this procedure. After lymphatics were occluded the skin flaps are sealed by using liquid skin Vetbond AJ Buck . The separated skin edges are sealed to the underlying muscle tissue while leaving a gap of 0.5 cm around the leg. Skin also may be anchored by suturing to underlying muscle when necessary.

To avoid infection animals are housed individually with mesh no bedding . Recovering animals were checked daily through the optimal edematous peak which typically occurred by day 5 7. The plateau edematous peak was then observed. To evaluate the intensity of the lymphedema we measured the circumference and volumes of 2 designated places on each paw before operation and daily for 7 days. The effect plasma proteins have on lymphedema and determined if protein analysis is a useful testing perimeter is also investigated. The weights of both control and edematous limbs are evaluated at 2 places. Analysis is performed in a blind manner.

Under brief gas anesthetic to prevent limb movement a cloth tape is used to measure limb circumference. Measurements are done at the ankle bone and dorsal paw by 2 different people then those 2 readings are averaged. Readings are taken from both control and edematous limbs.

On the day of surgery animals are anesthetized with Pentobarbital and are tested prior to surgery. For daily volumetrics animals are under brief halothane anesthetic rapid immobilization and quick recovery both legs are shaved and equally marked using waterproof marker on legs. Legs are first dipped in water then dipped into instrument to each marked level then measured by Buxco edema software Chen Victor . Data is recorded by one person while the other is dipping the limb to marked area.

Blood is drawn spun and serum separated prior to surgery and then at conclusion for total protein and Ca2 comparison.

After drawing blood the animal is prepared for tissue collection. The limbs were amputated using a quillitine then both experimental and control legs were cut at the ligature and weighed. A second weighing is done as the tibio cacaneal joint was disarticulated and the foot was weighed.

The transverse muscle located behind the knee popliteal area is dissected and arranged in a metal mold filled with freezeGel dipped into cold methylbutane placed into labeled sample bags at 80EC until sectioning. Upon sectioning the muscle was observed under fluorescent microscopy for lymphatics. Other immuno histological methods are currently being evaluated.

Another aspect of the present invention is using in vivo gene therapy methods to treat disorders diseases and conditions. The gene therapy method relates to the introduction of naked nucleic acid DNA RNA and antisense DNA or RNA comprising VEGF 2 operably linked to a promoter into an animal to increase the expression of VEGF 2. Such gene therapy and delivery techniques and methods are known in the art see for example WO 90 11092 WO 98 11779 U.S. Pat. Nos. 5 693 622 5 705 151 5 580 859 Tabata H. et al. 1997 35 3 470 479 Chao J et al. 1997 35 6 517 522 Wolff J. A. 1997 7 5 314 318 Schwartz B. et al. 1996 3 5 405 411 Tsurumi Y. et al. 1996 94 12 3281 3290 incorporated herein by reference .

The VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs may be delivered by any method that delivers injectable materials to the cells of an animal such as injection into the interstitial space of tissues heart muscle skin lung liver intestine and the like . The VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs may also be delivered directly into arteries. The VEGF 2 polynucleotide constructs can be delivered in a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid or aqueous carrier.

The term naked polynucleotide DNA or RNA refers to sequences that are free from any delivery vehicle that acts to assist promote or facilitate entry into the cell including viral sequences viral particles liposome formulations lipofectin or precipitating agents and the like. However the VEGF 2 polynucleotide may also be delivered in liposome formulations such as those taught in Felgner P. L. et al. 1995 772 126 139 and Abdallah B. et al. 1995 85 1 1 7 which can be prepared by methods well known to those skilled in the art.

The VEGF 2 vector constructs used in the gene therapy method are preferably constructs that will not integrate into the host genome nor will they contain sequences that allow for replication. Unlike other gene therapies techniques one major advantage of introducing naked nucleic acid sequences into target cells is the transitory nature of the polynucleotide synthesis in the cells. Studies have shown that non replicating DNA sequences can be introduced into cells to provide production of the desired polypeptide for periods of up to six months.

The VEGF 2 construct can be delivered to the interstitial space of tissues within the an animal including of muscle skin brain lung liver spleen bone marrow thymus heart lymph blood bone cartilage pancreas kidney gall bladder stomach intestine testis ovary uterus rectum nervous system eye gland and connective tissue. Interstitial space of the tissues comprises the intercellular fluid mucopolysaccharide matrix among the reticular fibers of organ tissues elastic fibers in the walls of vessels or chambers collagen fibers of fibrous tissues or that same matrix within connective tissue ensheathing muscle cells or in the lacunae of bone. It is similarly the space occupied by the plasma of the circulation and the lymph fluid of the lymphatic channels. They may be conveniently delivered by injection into the tissues comprising these cells. They are preferably delivered to and expressed in persistent non dividing cells which are differentiated although delivery and expression may be achieved in non differentiated or less completely differentiated cells such as for example stem cells of blood or skin fibroblasts. Preferably they are delivered by direct injection into the artery.

For the naked polynucleotide injection an effective dosage amount of DNA or RNA will be in the range of from about 0.05 g kg body weight to about 50 mg kg body weight. Preferably the dosage will be from about 0.005 mg kg to about 20 mg kg and more preferably from about 0.05 mg kg to about 5 mg kg. Of course as the artisan of ordinary skill will appreciate this dosage will vary according to the tissue site of injection. The appropriate and effective dosage of nucleic acid sequence can readily be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art and may depend on the condition being treated and the route of administration. The preferred route of administration is by the parenteral route of injection into the interstitial space of tissues or directly into arteries. However other parenteral routes may also be used such as inhalation of an aerosol formulation particularly for delivery to lungs or bronchial tissues throat or mucous membranes of the nose. In addition naked VEGF 2 constructs can be delivered to arteries during angioplasty by the catheter used in the procedure.

The dose response effects of injected VEGF 2 polynucleotide construct in arteries in vivo is determined as follows. Suitable template DNA for production of mRNA coding for VEGF 2 is prepared in accordance with a standard recombinant DNA methodology. The template DNA which may be either circular or linear is either used as naked DNA or complexed with liposomes. The arteries of rabbits are then injected with various amounts of the template DNA.

Hindlimb ischemia in rabbits is surgically induced as described in Example 18. Immediately following this five different sites in the adductor 2 sites medial large 2 sites and semimembranous muscles 1 site are injected directly with plasmid DNA encoding VEGF 2 using a 3 ml syringe and 2 gauge needle advanced through a small skin incision. The skin is then closed using 4.0 nylon.

The ability to rescue hindlimb ischemia is determined by measuring the number of capillaries in light microsopic sections taken from the treated hindlimbs compared to ischemic hindlimbs from untreated rabbits measurement of calf blood pressure and intra arterial Doppler guidewire measurement of flow velocity Takeshita et al. 93 662 670 1994 . The results of the above experimentation in rabbits can be use to extrapolate proper dosages and other treatment parameters in humans and other animals using VEGF 2 polynucleotide naked DNA.

One method of gene therapy transplants fibroblasts which are capable of expressing VEGF 2 polypeptides onto a patient. Generally fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in tissue culture medium and separated into small pieces. Small chunks of the tissue are placed on a wet surface of a tissue culture flask approximately ten pieces are placed in each flask. The flask is turned upside down closed tight and left at room temperature over night. After 24 hours at room temperature the flask is inverted and the chunks of tissue remain fixed to the bottom of the flask and fresh media e.g. Ham s F12 media with 10 FBS penicillin and streptomycin is added. The flasks are then incubated at 37 degree C. for approximately one week.

At this time fresh media is added and subsequently changed every several days. After an additional two weeks in culture a monolayer of fibroblasts emerge. The monolayer is trypsinized and scaled into larger flasks.

pMfV 7 Kirschmeier P. T. et al. DNA 7 219 25 1988 flanked by the long terminal repeats of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus is digested with EcoRI and HindIII and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The linear vector is fractionated on agarose gel and purified using glass beads.

The cDNA encoding VEGF 2 can be amplified using PCR primers which correspond to the 5 and 3 end sequences respectively as set forth in Example 1. Preferably the 5 primer contains an EcoRI site and the 3 primer includes a HindIII site. Equal quantities of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus linear backbone and the amplified EcoRI and HindIII fragment are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The ligation mixture is then used to transform bacteria HB101 which are then plated onto agar containing kanamycin for the purpose of confirming that the vector contains properly inserted VEGF 2.

The amphotropic pA317 or GP am12 packaging cells are grown in tissue culture to confluent density in Dulbecco s Modified Eagles Medium DMEM with 10 calf serum CS penicillin and streptomycin. The MSV vector containing the VEGF 2 gene is then added to the media and the packaging cells transduced with the vector. The packaging cells now produce infectious viral particles containing the VEGF 2 gene the packaging cells are now referred to as producer cells .

Fresh media is added to the transduced producer cells and subsequently the media is harvested from a 10 cm plate of confluent producer cells. The spent media containing the infectious viral particles is filtered through a millipore filter to remove detached producer cells and this media is then used to infect fibroblast cells. Media is removed from a sub confluent plate of fibroblasts and quickly replaced with the media from the producer cells. This media is removed and replaced with fresh media. If the titer of virus is high then virtually all fibroblasts will be infected and no selection is required. If the titer is very low then it is necessary to use a retroviral vector that has a selectable marker such as neo or his. Once the fibroblasts have been efficiently infected the fibroblasts are analyzed to determine whether VEGF 2 protein is produced.

The engineered fibroblasts are then transplanted onto the host either alone or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 3 microcarrier beads

Another method of gene therapy according to the present invention involves operably associating the endogenous VEGF 2 sequence with a promoter via homologous recombination as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 5 641 670 issued Jun. 24 1997 International Publication No. WO 96 29411 published Sep. 26 1996 International Publication No. WO 94 12650 published Aug. 4 1994 Koller et al. 86 8932 8935 1989 and Zijlstra et al. 342 435 438 1989 . This method involves the activation of a gene which is present in the target cells but which is not expressed in the cells or is expressed at a lower level than desired.

Polynucleotide constructs are made which contain a promoter and targeting sequences which are homologous to the 5 non coding sequence of endogenous VEGF 2 flanking the promoter. The targeting sequence will be sufficiently near the 5 end of VEGF 2 so the promoter will be operably linked to the endogenous sequence upon homologous recombination. The promoter and the targeting sequences can be amplified using PCR. Preferably the amplified promoter contains distinct restriction enzyme sites on the 5 and 3 ends. Preferably the 3 end of the first targeting sequence contains the same restriction enzyme site as the 5 end of the amplified promoter and the 5 end of the second targeting sequence contains the same restriction site as the 3 end of the amplified promoter.

The amplified promoter and the amplified targeting sequences are digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. The digested promoter and digested targeting sequences are added together in the presence of T4 DNA ligase. The resulting mixture is maintained under conditions appropriate for ligation of the two fragments. The construct is size fractionated on an agarose gel then purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation.

In this Example the polynucleotide constructs are administered as naked polynucleotides via electroporation. However the polynucleotide constructs may also be administered with transfection facilitating agents such as liposomes viral sequences viral particles precipitating agents etc. Such methods of delivery are known in the art.

Once the cells are transfected homologous recombination will take place which results in the promoter being operably linked to the endogenous VEGF 2 sequence. This results in the expression of VEGF 2 in the cell. Expression may be detected by immunological staining or any other method known in the art. Fibroblasts are obtained from a subject by skin biopsy. The resulting tissue is placed in DMEM 10 fetal calf serum. Exponentially growing or early stationary phase fibroblasts are trypsinized and rinsed from the plastic surface with nutrient medium. An aliquot of the cell suspension is removed for counting and the remaining cells are subjected to centrifugation. The supernatant is aspirated and the pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of electroporation buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 7.3 137 mM NaCl 5 mM KCl 0.7 mM NaHPQ 6 mM dextrose . The cells are recentrifuged the supernatant aspirated and the cells resuspended in electroporation buffer containing 1 mg ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. The final cell suspension contains approximately 3 10cells ml. Electroporation should be performed immediately following resuspension.

Plasmid DNA is prepared according to standard techniques. To construct a plasmid for targeting to the VEGF 2 locus plasmid pUC18 MBI Fermentas Amherst N.Y. is digested with HindIII. The CMV promoter is amplified by PCR with an XbaI site on the 5 end and a BamHI site on the 3 end. Two VEGF 2 non coding sequences are amplified via PCR one VEGF 2 non coding sequence VEGF 2 fragment 1 is amplified with a HindIII site at the 5 end and an Xba site at the 0.3 end the other VEGF 2 non coding sequence VEGF 2 fragment 2 is amplified with a BamHI site at the 5 end and a HindIII site at the 3 end. The CMV promoter and VEGF 2 fragments are digested with the appropriate enzymes CMV promoter XbaI and BamHI VEGF 2 fragment 1XbaI VEGF 2 fragment 2 BamHI and ligated together. The resulting ligation product is digested with HindIII and ligated with the HindIII digested pUC18 plasmid.

Plasmid DNA is added to a sterile cuvette with a 0.4 cm electrode gap Bio Rad . The final DNA concentration is generally at least 120 g ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension containing approximately 1.5 10cells is then added to the cuvette and the cell suspension and DNA solutions are gently mixed. Electroporation is performed with a Gene Pulser apparatus Bio Rad . Capacitance and voltage are set at 960 gF and 250 300 V respectively. As voltage increases cell survival decreases but the percentage of surviving cells that stably incorporate the introduced DNA into their genome increases dramatically. Given these parameters a pulse time of approximately 0.14 20 mSec should be observed.

Electroporated cells are maintained at room temperature for approximately 5 min and the contents of the cuvette are then gently removed with a sterile transfer pipette. The cells are added directly to 10 ml of prewarmed nutrient media DMEM with 15 calf serum in a 10 cm dish and incubated at 37EC. The following day the media is aspirated and replaced with 10 ml of fresh media and incubated for a further 16 24 hours.

The engineered fibroblasts are then injected into the host either aloie or after having been grown to confluence on cytodex 0.3 microcarrier beads. The fibroblasts now produce the protein product.

The VEGF 2 polypeptides can also be expressed in transgenic animals. Animals of any species including but not limited to mice rats rabbits hamsters guinea pigs pigs micro pigs goats sheep cows and non human primates e.g. baboons monkeys and chimpanzees may be used to generate transgenic animals. In a specific embodiment techniques described herein or otherwise known in the art are used to express polypeptides of the invention in humans as part of a gene therapy protocol.

Any technique known in the art may be used to introduce the transgene i.e. polynucleotides of the invention into animals to produce the founder lines of transgenic animals. Such techniques include but are not limited to pronuclear microinjection Paterson et al. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 40 691 698 1994 Carver et al. Biotechnology NY 11 1263 1270 1993 Wright et al.

Biol. 3 1803 1814 1983 introduction of the polynucleotides of the invention using a gene gun see e.g. Ulmer et al. Science 259 1745 1993 introducing nucleic acid constructs into embryonic pleuripotent stem cells and transferring the stem cells back into the blastocyst and sperm mediated gene transfer Lavitrano et al. Cell 57 717 723 1989 etc. For a review of such techniques see Gordon Transgenic Animals Intl. Rev. Cytol. 115 171 229 1989 which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Any technique known in the art may be used to produce transgenic clones containing polynucleotides of the invention for example nuclear transfer into enucleated oocytes of nuclei from cultured embryonic fetal or adult cells induced to quiescence Campell et al. Nature 380 64 66 1996 Wilmut et al. Nature 385 810 813 1997 . 

The present invention provides for transgenic animals that carry the transgene in all their cells as well as animals which carry the transgene in some but not all their cells i.e. mosaic animals or chimeric. The transgene may be integrated as a single transgene or as multiple copies such as in concatamers e.g. head to head tandems or head to tail tandems. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into and activated in a particular cell type by following for example the teaching of Lasko et al. Lasko et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89 6232 6236 1992 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific activation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art. When it is desired that the polynucleotide transgene be integrated into the chromosomal site of the endogenous gene gene targeting is preferred.

Briefly when such a technique is to be utilized vectors containing some nucleotide sequences homologous to the endogenous gene are designed for the purpose of integrating via homologous recombination with chromosomal sequences into and disrupting the function of the nucleotide sequence of the endogenous gene. The transgene may also be selectively introduced into a particular cell type thus inactivating the endogenous gene in only that cell type by following for example the teaching of Gu et al. Gu et al. Science 265 103 106 1994 . The regulatory sequences required for such a cell type specific inactivation will depend upon the particular cell type of interest and will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

Once transgenic animals have been generated the expression of the recombinant gene may be assayed utilizing standard techniques. Initial screening may be accomplished by Southern blot analysis or PCR techniques to analyze animal tissues to verify that integration of the transgene has taken place. The level of mRNA expression of the transgene in the tissues of the transgenic animals may also be assessed using techniques which include but are not limited to Northern blot analysis of tissue samples obtained from the animal in situ hybridization analysis and reverse transcriptase PCR rt PCR . Samples of transgenic gene expressing tissue may also be evaluated immunocytochemically or immunohistochemically using antibodies specific for the transgene product.

Once the founder animals are produced they may be bred inbred outbred or crossbred to produce colonies of the particular animal. Examples of such breeding strategies include but are not limited to outbreeding of founder animals with more than one integration site in order to establish separate lines inbreeding of separate lines in order to produce compound transgenics that express the transgene at higher levels because of the effects of additive expression of each transgene crossing of heterozygous transgenic animals to produce animals homozygous for a given integration site in order to both augment expression and eliminate the need for screening of animals by DNA analysis crossing of separate homozygous lines to produce compound heterozygous or homozygous lines and breeding to place the transgene on a distinct background that is appropriate for an experimental model of interest.

Transgenic animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of VEGF 2 polypeptides studying conditions and or disorders associated with aberrant VEGF 2 expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and or disorders.

Endogenous VEGF 2 gene expression can also be reduced by inactivating or knocking out the VEGF 2 gene and or its promoter using targeted homologous recombination. E.g. see Smithies et al. Nature 317 230 234 1985 Thomas Capecchi Cell 51 503 512 1987 Thompson et al. Cell 5 313 321 1989 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety . For example a mutant non functional polynucleotide of the invention or a completely unrelated DNA sequence flanked by DNA homologous to the endogenous polynucleotide sequence either the coding regions or regulatory regions of the gene can be used with or without a selectable marker and or a negative selectable marker to transfect cells that express polypeptides of the invention in vivo. In another embodiment techniques known in the art are used to generate knockouts in cells that contain but do not express the gene of interest. Insertion of the DNA construct via targeted homologous recombination results in inactivation of the targeted gene. Such approaches are particularly suited in research and agricultural fields where modifications to embryonic stem cells can be used to generate animal offspring with an inactive targeted gene. e.g. see Thomas Capecchi 1987 and Thompson 1989 supra . However this approach can be routinely adapted for use in humans provided the recombinant DNA constructs are directly administered or targeted to the required site in vivo using appropriate viral vectors that will be apparent to those of skill in the art.

In further embodiments of the invention cells that are genetically engineered to express the polypeptides of the invention or alternatively that are genetically engineered not to express the polypeptides of the invention e.g. knockouts are administered to a patient in vivo. Such cells may be obtained from the patient i.e. animal including human or an MHC compatible donor and can include but are not limited to fibroblasts bone marrow cells blood cells e.g lymphocytes adipocytes muscle cells endothelial cells etc. The cells are genetically engineered in vitro using recombinant DNA techniques to introduce the coding sequence of polypeptides of the invention into the cells or alternatively to disrupt the coding sequence and or endogenous regulatory sequence associated with the polypeptides of the invention e.g. by transduction using viral vectors and preferably vectors that integrate the transgene into the cell genome or transfection procedures including but not limited to the use of plasmids cosmids YACs naked DNA electroporation liposomes etc. The coding sequence of the polypeptides of the invention can be placed under the control of a strong constitutive or inducible promoter or promoter enhancer to achieve expression and preferably secretion of the VEGF 2 polypeptides. The engineered cells which express and preferably secrete the polypeptides of the invention can be introduced into the patient systemically e.g. in the circulation or intraperitoneally.

Alternatively the cells can be incorporated into a matrix and implanted in the body e.g genetically engineered fibroblasts can be implanted as part of a skin graft genetically engineered endothelial cells can be implanted as part of a lymphatic or vascular graft. See for example Anderson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5 399 349 and Mulligan Wilson U.S. Pat. No. 5 460 959 each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety .

When the cells to be administered are non autologous or non MHC compatible cells they can be administered using well known techniques which prevent the development of a host immune response against the introduced cells. For example the cells may be introduced in an encapsulated form which while allowing for an exchange of components with the immediate extracellular environment does not allow the introduced cells to be recognized by the host immune system.

Knock out animals of the invention have uses which include but are not limited to animal model systems useful in elaborating the biological function of VEGF 2 polypeptides studying conditions and or disorders associated with aberrant VEGF 2 expression and in screening for compounds effective in ameliorating such conditions and or disorders.

One method to identify and clone VH and VL domains from cell lines expressing a particular antibody is to perform PCR with VH and VL specific primers on cDNA made from the antibody expressing cell lines. Briefly RNA is isolated from the cell lines and used as a template for RT PCR designed to amplify the VH and VL domains of the antibodies expressed by the EBV cell lines. Cells may be lysed in the TRIzol reagent Life Technologies Rockville. MD and extracted with one fifth volume of chloroform. After addition of chloroform the solution is allowed to incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes and the centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant is collected and RNA is precipitated using an equal volume of isopropanol. Precipitated RNA is pelleted by centrifuging at 14 000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. in a tabletop centrifuge. Following centrifugation the supernatant is discarded and washed with 75 ethanol. Following washing the RNA is centrifuged again at 800 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C. The supernatant is discarded and the pellet allowed to air dry. RNA is the dissolved in DEPC water and heated to 60 C. for 10 minutes. Quantities of RNA can determined using optical density measurements.

cDNA may be synthesized according to methods well known in the art from 1.5 2.5 micrograms of RNA using reverse transciptase and random hexamer primers cDNA is then used as a template for PCR amplification of VH and VL domains. Primers used to amplify VH and VL genes are shown in Table 5. Typically a PCR reaction makes use of a single 5 primer and a single 3 primer. Sometimes when the amount of available RNA template is limiting or for greater efficiency groups of 5 and or 3 primers may be used. For example sometimes all five VH 5 primers and all JH3 primers are used in a single PCR reaction. The PCR reaction is carried out in a 50 microliter volume containing 1 PCR buffer 2 mM of each dNTP 0.7 units of High Fidelity Taq polymerse 5 primer mix 3 primer mix and 7.5 microliters of cDNA. The 5 and 3 primer mix of both VH and VL can be made by pooling together 22 pmole and 28 pmole respectively of each of the individual primers. PCR conditions are 96 C. for 5 minutes followed by 25 cycles of 94 C. for 1 minute 50 C. for 1 minute and 72 C. for 1 minute followed by an extension cycle of 72 C. for 10 minutes. After the reaction is completed sample tubes are stored 4 C.

PCR samples are then electrophoresed on a 1.3 agarose gel. DNA bands of the expected sizes 506 base pairs for VH domains and 344 base pairs for VL domains can be cut out of the gel and purified using methods well known in the art. Purified PCR products can be ligated into a PCR cloning vector TA vector from Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad Calif. . Individual cloned PCR products can be isolated after transfection of and blue white color selection. Cloned PCR products may then be sequenced using methods commohly known in the art.

The PCR bands containing the VH domain and the VL domains can also be used to create full length Ig expression vectors. VH and VL domains can be cloned into vectors containing the nucleotide sequences of a heavy e.g. human IgG1 or human IgG4 or light chain human kappa or human lambda constant regions such that a complete heavy or light chain molecule could be expressed from these vectors when transfected into an appropriate host cell. Further when cloned heavy and light chains are both expressed in one cell line from either one or two vectors they can assemble into a complete functional antibody molecule that is secreted into the cell culture medium. Methods using polynucleotides encoding VH and VL antibody domains to generate expression vectors that encode complete antibody molecules are well known within the art.

Binding of VEGF 2 antibodies to VEGF 2 for example can be analyzed by BIAcore analysis. Either VEGF 2 or other antigen to which one wants to know the affinity of a VEGF 2 antibody or VEGF 2 antibody can be covalently immobilized to a BIAcore sensor chip CM5 chip via amine groups using N ethyl N dimethylaminopropyl carboiimide N hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. Various dilutions of VEGF 2 antibodiess or VEGF 2 or other antigen to which one wants to know the affinity of a VEGF 2 antibody respectively are flowed over the derivatized CM5 chip in flow cells at 25 microlters min for a total volume of 50 microliters. The amount of bound protein is determined during washing of the flow cell with HBS buffer 10 mM HEPES pH7.4 150 mM NaCl 3 4 mM EDTA 0.005 surfactant p20 . Binding specificity for the protein of interest is determined by competition with soluble competitor in the presence the protein of interest.

The flow cell surface can be regenerated by displacing bound protein by washing with 20 microliters of 10 mM glycins HCl pH2.3. For kinetic analysis the flow cells are tested at different flow rates and different polypeptide densities on the CM5 chip. The on rates and off rates can be determined using the kinetic evaluation program in a BIAevaluation 3 software.

BIAcore technology may also be utilized for example to quantitatively determine the ability of an anti VEGF 2 antibody to inhibit the ability of VEGF 2 to bind to its receptor.

Characterization of the multiple aspects of microvascular physiology in transparent window systems in mice have provided valuable data on angiogenesis inflammation microvascular transport tissue rejection and tumor physiology Melder R. J et al. 69 2131 2138 1995 Fukumura D. et al 55 4824 4829 1995 Yamada S. et al. 86 3487 3492 1995 Yamada S. et al. 86 4707 4708 1995 Melder R. J. et al. 50 35 44 1995 Melder R. J. et al. 2 992 997 1996 Dellian M. et al. 149 59 71 1996 and Leunig M. et al. Cancer Res 52 6553 60 1992 . This assay may be used to test the hypothesis that VEGF 2 polypeptides administered directly to the interstitial compartment of the skin or pial surface will induce a change in the structure and function of the microvasculature. These studies will specifically characterize activities on existing vasculature within the observation window and neogenic vasculature developing in response to these proteins in implanted gels. The following observations will be made 

For this assay Swiss nu nu mice are used. The advantages of using Swiss nu nu mice are several fold including a reducing the possibility of immune response over the period of study b improving the optics of the system due to lack of pigmentation and hair in the skin c maintaining historical consistency with similar previous studies.

Each experimental and control group will have seven mice. Male mice are preferred since they are larger and will have more skin for surgical window implants. Samples for testing will include VEGF 2 polypeptides and recombinant protein controls. Each study examining protein activities on existing vascular beds will consist of five experimental groups 

Sterile protein solutions will be administered as a 10 l volume directly into the window preparation of mice with dorsal skin windows. Alternatively sterile collagen sucralfate disks containing protein concentrations as listed above will be placed into the window preparations for evaluation of the angiogenic potential. Sterile antibody solutions will be administered intravenously.

These experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that VEGF 2 polypeptides administered to the extravascular compartment of the skin will induce a change in the structure and function of the existing capillaries and postcapillary venules. Administration of polypeptides in collagen disks will examine their potential for modulating angiogenesis.

The surgical procedures are performed ii Swiss nude mice. For the surgical procedures animals 20 30 g are anesthetized with a sub cutaneous injection of a cocktail of 90 mg Ketamine and 9 mg Xylazine per kg body weight. All surgical procedures are performed under aseptic conditions in a horizontal laminar flow hood with all equipment being steam gas or chemically sterilized. Sterility of the bench are maintained by U.V. lights when not in use. During surgery the body temperature of the animals is kept constant by means of a heated work surface. All mice are housed individually in microisolator cages and all manipulations are done in laminar flow hoods. Following surgery animals are observed for any discomfort distress. The criteria for discomfort include but are not limited to loss of body weight. 20 inability to ambulate evidence of self mutilation or inability to eat or drink. Buprenorphine 0.1 mg kg q 12 h is used as an analgesic for 3 days post implantation. Any animal exhibiting the signs of discomfort for 3 days post surgery are euthanized with COinhalation.

Chambers are implanted as described in Leunig et al. 0.52 6553 0.6560 1992 . Briefly the chamber is positioned such that the chamber is positioned over a double layer of skin i.e. a pinch of skin that extends above the dorsal surface. The full thickness of one side of the dorsal skin flap is removed in a circular area 15 mm in diameter. The second side of the flap consisting of epidermis fascia and striated muscle is positioned on the frame of the chamber and the opening window is covered with a sterile glass coverslip. The chamber is held in place with suture silk 4 0 which is threaded through the extended skin and holes along the top of the chamber. Mice are allowed to recover 72 hours.

Following this recovery each mouse is positioned in a transparent polycarbonate tube 25 mm diameter for treatment. The coverslips are carefully removed followed by addition of treatment factor s . After addition of treatment factors a new sterile coverslip will then placed on the viewing surface. Measurements are made by morphometric analysis using a CCD and SIT camera S VHS videocasette recorder and direct digital image acquisition. Mice with implanted chambers are observed for 28 days as indicated in the flow charts.

Mice are anesthetized with s.c. injection of a cocktail of 90 mg Ketamine and 9 mg Xylazine per kg body weight then positioned on a sterile plastic stage assembly. Vascular maps of the window will then be made using transillumination dorsal skin window or following an injection of 100 l of BSA FITC 1 mg ml i.v. and epi illumination cranial window . Video recordings of vascular beds are made at a range of magnifications from 1 to 40 as well as digital frames for off line analysis. Images are quantified for vascular density blood flow velocity and vascular dimensions for shear rate analysis . In addition circulating leukocyte interactions are evaluated by injection with 101 of Rhodamine 6 G followed by video microscopy of the capillaries and postcapillary venules. Permeability measurements are made from off line analysis of images of BSA transport at 5 10 15 and 20 min. following BSA FITC injection. Capillary density determinations of normal and angiogenic vascular beds are made from offline analysis of video tapes. Five sets of observations of experimental and control mice are at seven day intervals total of 28 days .

The colon carcinoma LS174T produces secretes VEGF 2 polypeptide. It is therefore particularly interesting to test whether treatment with VEGF 2 antibodies slows or arrests LS174T tumor growth or even effects LS174T tumor regression. To test this hypothesis the dorsal chamber model described above may be adapted to study tumor growth and vascularization within the dorsal chamber.

Three days after a dorsal chamber is implanted 2 microliters of pelleted LS174T tumor cell suspension containing approximately 2 10cells is innoculated onto the striated muscle layer of the subcutaneous tissue in the chamber. The innoculated tumor is then left for a period of time to allow it to take and grow to a specified size e.g. 4 6 mm in diameter prior to beginning VEGF 2 treatment.

Mice are initially injected with 0.4 milligrams of VEGF 2 antibody followed by injections of 0.2 milligrams of VEGF 2 antibody given at five day intervals for 30 days. Injections may be given intraperitoneally i.p. or intravenously i.v. .

Parameters that may be measured to assess the effect of VEGF 2 treatment on tumor growth include tumor size and endothelial and lymphatic vascular density.

Additionally this assay may easily be modified to test the effect of VEGF 2 treatment on other tumors regardless of their production of endogenous VEGF 2 polypeptide.

The following assay may be used to test whether treatment with VEGF 2 antibodies slows or arrests MDA MB 231 tumor growth or effects MDA MB 231 tumor regression. While the following example outlines an experimental protocol involving MDA MB 231 cells one of skill in the art could easily modify this protocol to test the effect of treatment with VEGF 2 antibodies on other tumor types.

On day zero mice are injected in the mammary pads with one million MDA MB 231 cells. The implanted tumor is allowed to grow to a 2 mm 2 mm which usually takes about 5 days. After the tumor has reached the 2 2 mm2 size an animal is given an initial dose Of 04. Milligrams of VEGF 2 antibody. Thereafter 0.2 milligrams of VEGF 2 antibody is administered on the fifth and 10th days after the initial injection. Additionally animals in certain experimental groups ma also be treated with 5 mg kg of Taxol or other suitable dose of another chemotherapeutic agent daily.

Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and therefore within the scope of the appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described.
