title: Dual safety fuze for grenade
abstract: A hand grenade fuze includes a secondary safety feature in the form of a trigger pin inserted through the striker lever. One end of the trigger pin has an undercut portion. A slide bar is disposed in the fuze body and has a keyhole opening at one end for selectively engaging the undercut portion of the trigger pin. A trigger has one end connected to the slide bar and another end rotatably fixed to the fuze body. A spring biases the trigger away from the fuze body. When the trigger is depressed, the slide bar translates and releases the trigger pin, which releases the restraint on the striker lever.

The inventions described herein may be manufactured used and licensed by or for the United States Government.

The invention relates in general to hand grenades and in particular to the activation or arming of hand grenades.

A major concern in the field of munition fuzes is safety. Safety is improved by providing dual safety activation for fuzes. A known fuze design for grenades includes a fuze pull ring that secures a fuze lever to a fuze body or assembly. When the pull ring is detached from the fuze assembly the only way to prevent initiation of the grenade is for the user to hold down the fuze lever. When the fuze lever is released the grenade initiation process begins and the grenade will explode soon after.

It is possible that the fuze pull ring may be accidentally caught on an object and dislodge from the grenade. Such a possibility could be very hazardous to the user and others near the user.

One aspect of the invention is a grenade fuze having a fuze body and a striker lever rotatably mounted to the fuze body. A rotor assembly is rotatably mounted to the fuze body. A spring torsionally biases the rotor assembly. A pull ring having a pull pin is inserted through the striker lever to restrain rotation of the striker lever and the rotor assembly.

A trigger pin having a longitudinal axis is inserted through the striker lever to restrain rotation of the striker lever. One end of the trigger pin includes an undercut portion. A slide bar is disposed in the fuze body and has a keyhole opening at one end for selectively engaging the undercut portion of the trigger pin. A trigger has one end connected to the slide bar and another end rotatably fixed to the fuze body. A second spring biases the trigger away from the fuze body.

The keyhole opening includes a small opening and a large opening. Engagement of the undercut portion of the trigger pin with the small opening restrains translation of the trigger pin with respect to the slide bar in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the trigger pin.

Placement of the trigger pin in the large opening of the keyhole opening does not restrain translation of the trigger pin with respect to the slide bar in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the trigger pin.

In an unactuated position of the trigger the slide bar prevents translation of the trigger pin with respect to the slide bar in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the trigger pin.

When the trigger is depressed the slide bar does not prevent translation of the trigger pin with respect to the slide bar in the direction along the longitudinal axis of the trigger pin.

The invention will be better understood and further objects features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A novel grenade fuze includes dual safety features. The dual safety features include a fuze pull ring such as a conventional fuze pull ring and a secondary safety feature. The secondary safety feature operates in parallel with the pull ring to restrain the fuze lever in its safe position. The safe position of the fuze lever is the position of the fuze lever when the pull ring has not been removed and the secondary safety feature is engaged.

The trigger pin is inserted through the lever and the fuze body . As seen in one end of the trigger pin engages one end of a translatable slide bar . The other end of the slide bar engages one end of a trigger . Another end of trigger is rotatably fixed to fuze body by for example pivot pins . A spring is disposed between fuze body and trigger . Spring biases trigger away from fuze body . Trigger is preferably located on the side of fuze body opposite the side of strike lever so the user can grip the strike lever in the palm of the hand and simultaneously use a finger to operate trigger .

Slide bar includes a keyhole opening having a small opening and a large opening . End of trigger pin includes an undercut portion . Undercut portion has a diameter small enough to fit in small opening and the non undercut portion of trigger pin is too large to fit in small opening . When undercut portion is disposed in small opening translation of trigger pin with respect to the slide bar in the direction along the longitudinal axis A of the trigger pin is restrained. In a safe or unactuated position of the fuze assembly undercut portion is inserted in small opening . The safe position is maintained by the bias of spring on trigger .

When trigger is depressed against spring slide bar translates and trigger pin is positioned in large opening of slide bar . With trigger pin in large opening trigger pin is no longer locked to bar and is free to translate out of large opening and out of slide bar . Trigger may be depressed by a user s finger.

To arm the fuze assembly trigger is squeezed or depressed so that trigger pin is released from slide bar . Then pull ring is pulled. With trigger depressed and pull ring pulled the user may release lever by for example throwing the grenade. When lever is released lever and rotor assembly are free to rotate so that firing pin rotates and impacts primer . If the trigger is not depressed and pull ring is pulled the lever and rotor assembly cannot rotate because of the restraint of trigger pin . The trigger pin is a secondary safety feature for the fuze assembly .

While the invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments numerous changes alterations and modifications to the described embodiments are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and equivalents thereof.
