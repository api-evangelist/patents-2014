This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 e to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 806 298 titled SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR NETWORK PROVISIONING filed on Mar. 28 2013 the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

Aspects of the present disclosure relate to a system and process for providing an interface for provisioning voice switching elements in telecommunications networks.

To provide telecommunication services to a customer requires various telecommunication network resources to be provisioned. For example to add telephone service to a customer telephone numbers are assigned to the customer and network elements are configured to route calls to and from the customer among other things. Often the initiation of a service or some other action with a network such as a telecommunication system begins with a generalized information technology IT application that is not especially suited for or otherwise configured to provision the resources needed for whatever service or task that the application involves. Accordingly additional devices and processes are required to provision resources in order to perform some requested service initiated at an IT application.

It is with these and other issues in mind that various aspects of the present disclosure were developed.

According to one aspect a system and method is provided for performing network provisioning using an abstraction layer. The network provisioning abstraction layer receives network provisioning requests from one or more applications. A database is queried using the information provided by each network provisioning requests to determine provisioning instructions for carrying out the request. The provisioning instructions are placed in a queue according the priority of the network provisioning request. The highest priority provisioning instructions are de queued and are sent to the resource interface where the instructions are relayed to the appropriate network resources for fulfilling the network provisioning request.

Implementations of the present disclosure involve a system and method for provisioning telecommunications network resources and services. In particular the present disclosure provides for a network provisioning system that utilizes an abstraction layer as an interface between applications that request the use of network resources and the provisioning of the network resources to fulfill the requests. The network provisioning abstraction layer receives requests for network resources from the applications at an application interface generates provisioning instructions prioritizes the requests using a queuing system and communicates the provisioning instructions to one or more network resources in order to provision the necessary resources to fulfill the requests. The queuing system includes one or more prioritized queues and a queue manager for adding and forwarding provisioning instructions from the queues. From the queue or queues depending on the implementation the provisioning instructions are conveyed to the network resources in a manner and format to provision the resources. In some instances the instructions are provided to an interface that translates or otherwise generates properly formatted instructions to an associated network resource in order to provision the resource. The network abstraction layer also determines when a request involves the provisioning of multiple network resources determines each provisioning instruction required to carry out the original request and queues and relays all of the required provisioning instructions in the appropriate order for executing the original request while avoiding service outages.

Referring to an example network provisioning system is depicted. The network provisioning system includes a network provisioning abstraction layer that receives network provisioning requests from applications at an application interface . The network provisioning abstraction layer identifies the nature of each request including the request s priority and the provisioning instructions needed to complete the request and places the provisioning instructions in a queue . The provisioning instructions are removed from the queue and are formatted and sent to a network resource using a resource interface .

The applications may include any applications involved in providing a telecommunication service or other service and that involve provisioning a network resource or resources. In this example the applications include an operations application a billing application and a provisioning application . The applications are configured to make network provisioning requests which may for example include requests for the assignment of ports creation and modification of accounts adding or removing telephone numbers account and service related queries or any other type of network resource related request. Operations application includes any applications used for the operation of a telecommunications network. For example operations applications are involved with maintaining and monitoring the operation of a telecommunication network and adding and removing users and features from the network. Billing applications are applications configured for accounting for customer services generating invoices tracking payments and the like. Provisioning applications are applications adapted to identify and provision services according to customer criteria. It should be understood that the illustrated applications are used for example purposes and other applications either generic or specific to the telecommunications field may also be used. In one example discussed herein to illustrate features of the provided system the provisioning application relates to a least cost routing system that provisions routes and rates for the routes of a telecommunication system.

Each application may utilize a different method of communication and format the communication in various ways. Communication examples include an application programming interface API a command line interface CLI extensible markup language XML and common object request broker architecture CORBA . These example communications formats are used for illustrative purposes and it should be understood that other types of communication methods and or formatting may be used.

The application interface may include specialized adapters configured to communicate with the applications . For example in the case of applications that include an application programming interface API for communicating with the application the corresponding adapter is configured to receive requests and return statuses according to the application s API.

The network resources include any network resources including telecommunication resources such as real time growth switching platforms and soft switching platforms. In one example a network resource includes Collab mixing elements a network resource includes time division multiplexing TDM voice switching elements and a network resource includes Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP switching elements. The network resources may also include a switching platform that includes resources such as networking trunks switching equipment tables for allocating direct inward dial DID numbers as well as any other tools or systems for allocating telecommunications components and infrastructure. In order to perform certain functions one or more network resources are typically provisioned in order to fulfill a request.

The resource interface is configured for communications between the network provisioning abstraction layer and the network resources . Similar to the applications the network resources may each be configured to communicate using different communications formats. For example the network resource may communicate using plain text sent using a command line interface the network resource may communicate using a resource specific API and the network resource may communicate using a COBRA interface.

In one example each application operates on a computing device such as a personal computer smartphone tablet or other device that communicates to the network provisioning abstraction layer using a network such as a local area network LAN the Internet or any other network or combination thereof. The network provision abstraction layer may operate on a server or other computing device that is able to communicate with the network resources by a network or other form of communication.

Referring to an example method of network provisioning utilizing the system shown in or discussed below is depicted. In this example the applications are each configured to send network provisioning requests for carrying out a telecommunications operation to the network provisioning abstraction layer . During operation the applications make requests for a network resource to accomplish some task as specified by the application which may be managed by a user through a graphical user interface or otherwise. For example the least cost routing provisioning application may need to provision 10 DID telephone numbers. The least cost routing provisioning application therefore sends a request for 10 DIDs to the network provisioning abstraction layer using the communications method of the least cost routing provisioning application . For example the least cost routing provisioning application may communicate the request in a text format using a command line interface CLI . The request may include an application ID customer ID request type a number of DIDs requested request priority and location. In this case the request could be 3 1000 DID 10 3 111 W. Elm St Topeka Kans. USA. 

The network provisioning abstraction layer receives the requests for network resources from the least cost routing application at the application interface operation . The application interface includes an adapter suited to accommodate communications from the least cost routing application . In one example the application interface is configured to receive the text from the CLI interface and is configured to parse the text and place it in a common format that is useable by the network provisioning abstraction layer . For example the common format may include a data structure or object with the fields required for looking up the provisioning instructions for provisioning the appropriate network resources to fulfill the request.

In one example the network provisioning abstraction layer and the applications operate in a publish subscribe configuration. Anytime a new request is made by an application the application notifies the network provisioning abstraction layer of the new request. The network provisioning abstraction layer then queries the application to download the request. The publish subscribe model allows for the network provisioning abstraction layer to control when requests are received and to assist in throttling and prioritizing requests among other functions.

The network provisioning abstraction layer may also authenticate any application or application user making a network provisioning requests before processing the requests. For example an application user may be required to authenticate with the user s login credentials by using a username and password. In the case of an automated provisioning application the application may login by providing the network provisioning abstraction layer with an access token or use an alternative authentication method. The provisioning abstraction layer may also include multiple authorization levels limiting the types of requests each user can make. For example the least cost routing application may be authorized to make requests for new services such as the example request for 10 new DIDs. Conversely the least cost routing application may not be permitted to add and delete system administrators.

Each time the network provisioning abstraction layer receives a request the request the commonized format of the request or some other data based on the request is used to query an inventory service database to obtain the appropriate provisioning instructions for carrying out the request operation . The request is also validated to ensure the request included all of the information required to obtain the provisioning instructions for carrying out the request. For example each type of request may include required fields for searching the database for the provisioning instructions which may involve provisioning multiple network resources and an order to such provisioning. The network provisioning abstraction layer compares the type of request being made to what is needed for determining the provisioning instructions using the database . If a required element of data is not present the network provisioning abstraction layer rejects the request and sends a status indicating the rejection back to the requesting application including the reason for the rejection. As is discussed herein the request is also associated with a priority based on the type of the request being made or the application making the request.

The provisioning instructions for the request may also include instructions for provisioning additional resources that are needed for provisioning the requested network service. For example in order to provide a customer with 10 DIDs bandwidth through one or more telecommunications trunks needs to be allocated as well as bandwidth and access through switching resources such as through one or more media gateways and or session border controllers. In this example the provisioning instructions provided by the inventory service database include instructions for allocating the 10 DIDs instructions for allocating any necessary trunks and instructions for allocating any necessary switching resources.

In some examples the network provisioning abstraction layer is configured to automatically reject any invalid network provisioning requests. For example if the network provisioning request is for an impossible task such as a service that is not offered the application interface rejects the request. In another example the application interface may reject a request if the request includes a transaction rate that exceeds a published transaction rate. In these cases even though the request exceeds a published transaction rate the request may be queued indefinitely to be processed at a later time for example when the transaction rate drops.

Once the provisioning instructions have been determined the provisioning instructions are added to the priority queue according to the request s priority operation . In the example DID request the least cost routing application indicated that the request had a priority level of three which may correspond to a level priority less than a priority of one or two. The provisioning instructions are therefore added to the priority queue according to the provided priority level. The queue or queues may be managed in various ways. In one specific example discussed relative to a plurality of queues is provided each with a different priority level. The queue or queues may be implemented as buffers FIFO buffers or other memory structures.

Concurrent with the addition of provisioning instructions to the priority queue provisioning instructions are released from the priority queue for execution operation . Once released from the queue the network provisioning abstraction layer sends the provisioning instructions to the resource interface . As discussed herein the network resources also send and receive communications using their own communications formats. The resource interface is configured to use the provisioning instructions to send the appropriate provisioning instructions to each network resource required for performing the network provisioning request in parallel or in a required order. The resource interface is also configured to format the request to a network resource s communications format if necessary. The provisioning instructions are formatted and sent to the appropriate network resource operation .

The provisioning instructions for allocating the DIDs would therefore be sent to the network resource for allocating DIDs e.g. network resource the instructions for allocating the appropriate network trunk s would be sent to the network resource or resources capable of allocating the trunks e.g. network resource and the instructions for allocating switching resources would be sent to the network resource for allocating the switching resources e.g. network resource .

In one example the resource interface includes a throttling mechanism configured to ensure that tasks are not sent in a way that affects call processing features or elements for example. Additionally certain requests need to be completed before a following request can be made. The throttling mechanism may be set to different rates which may depend on the type of resource being provisioned. The resource interface may also receive any acknowledgements from the network resource being provisioned. For example the network resource may indicate when a provisioning operation has been completed and the resource interface may manage subsequent requests based on the completion of the preceding task if necessary . For example the throttling mechanism may cause the system to wait until a status for a previous request has been returned. Thus if the DIDs must be allocated before the trunks and switching are allocated the throttling mechanism holds the instructions for the trunks and switching until the request for the DIDs has been completed.

The network provisioning abstraction layer also logs each network provisioning request that is received and the instructions sent to each network resource in a request log operation . The request log may include the network provisioning request a timestamp of when the request was received the application that sent the request the instructions for executing the request and any other relevant information. The request log may operate as a database list or other data structure. The request log may also be used by the network provisioning abstraction layer to undo one or more transactions. For example the network provisioning abstraction layer may be configured with back out capabilities for when a single transaction triggered by an instruction out of multiple transactions required by a request fails because when a single transaction of a request fails the entire request has failed. The network provisioning abstraction layer may then roll back any completed transactions by issuing new instructions that nullify the previously completed instructions. The end result of the roll back is that the network resources behave as if the original network provisioning request was never made.

Once a network provisioning instruction has been executed and is either completed or has failed the network resource communicates the status of the instruction back to the resource interface . The resource interface may determine if the provisioning request has succeeded or failed and sends the status to the application interface for reporting back to the requesting application. The application interface formats the status at the appropriate adapter to the communications format of the requesting application and returns the status to the requesting application operation .

Referring to a second embodiment of a network provisioning system using a network provisioning abstraction layer is depicted. In this embodiment the network provisioning abstraction layer includes an inventory and service database an application interface a priority queue and a resource interface . The application interface includes adapters for communicating with one or more applications .

In many instances the network provisioning abstraction layer receives multiple requests at relatively the same time from a plurality of applications . For a variety of reasons the influx of requests cannot be immediately processed and sent to the network resources . Thus the network provisioning abstraction layer receives network provisioning requests determines the provisioning instructions for carrying out the request and places the provisioning instructions in one or more priority queues . For example the provisioning abstraction layer may be configured to add the provisioning instructions to the priority queue based on the original request s priority.

In this example the network provisioning abstraction layer includes a priority queuing system with a queue manager and a plurality of queues each with a designated priority. In one example queue 1 is used for priority level 1 requests queue 2 is used for priority level 2 requests queue 3 is used for priority level 3 requests and so on. Provisioning instructions for carrying are queued as discussed above relative to by the queue manager according to the requests priority. For example the above DID request had a priority of 3 and the corresponding provisioning instructions would therefore be placed with queue 3. A second network provisioning request for opening a new account may have a priority of 1 resulting in the corresponding provisioning instructions being queued in queue 1.

In one example specific high priority queues may be mapped to specific applications or adapters and lower priority queues may be mapped to other applications adapters. For example a billing application such as the billing application may perform network provisioning requests that return the status of a customer account for billing purposes. Billing requests may have a relatively low priority and may therefore be directed to a lower priority queue such as queue 4. Conversely the provisioning application discussed above may be providing customers with real time provisioning of network resources and is therefore mapped to a high priority queue such as queue 1. In another example certain types of requests may automatically be assigned a priority. For example every new account request may be assigned a high priority while every rerouting request may all be assigned a relatively lower priority.

The queuing manager is configured to de queue provisioning instructions from high priority queues before de queuing provisioning instructions from lower priority queues. For example if queue 1 is a higher priority queue and queue 2 is a lower priority queue the queue manager is configured to de queue all instructions from queue 1 before de queuing any instructions queued in queue 2. The queue manager may continuously check higher priority queues before de queuing any instructions from lower priority queues returning from de queuing the lower priority queues whenever a new higher priority request is received. In another example the queue manager may also be configured to spend relatively longer de queuing high priority queues relative to low priority queues. Alternatively the queue manager may have a de queuing cycle where relatively more time is spent de queuing from relatively higher priority queues relative to low priority queues.

De queued instructions are sent to the resource interface for transmission to the various network resources . In some cases a network resource may receive instructions in the same format utilized by the network provisioning abstraction layer . In these cases the provisioning instructions may be sent directly from the resource interface to the network resource without processing by an adapter . In other examples the adapters format each provisioning instruction to a format utilized by the network resource that the instructions are being sent to. In some cases the resource interface is not directly connected to each network resource but instead sends the provisioning instructions to a server configured to manage each network resource . In one example the servers may include element management servers EMS that are each specifically configured to manage requests for specific network resources. The EMSs may include their own first in first out FIFO queues for delivering provisioning instructions to the network resources . Provisioning instructions are therefore formatted for communications with the EMSs and provided in an appropriate order for execution of provisioning.

The system bus may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller a peripheral bus a switched fabric point to point connections and a local bus using any of a variety of bus architectures.
