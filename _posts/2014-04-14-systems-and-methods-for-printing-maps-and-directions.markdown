This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application No. 13 487 005 filed on Jun. 1 2012 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 700 331. U.S. patent application No. 13 487 005 claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 493 072 filed Jun. 3 2011. U.S. patent application No. 13 487 005 now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8 700 331 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 493 072 are incorporated herein by reference.

There are many different times when people must navigate to a particular location. For example a driver of a vehicle may need to navigate from a starting point to a destination. As another example a pedestrian may need directions to reach a particular point of interest or to meet a friend. A person can use different approaches to get the directions needed to reach a particular destination. For example a person may look at a map as the user is moving to determine which roads to take when to turn how far to go on each road or combinations of these. If the person cannot look at a map while traveling e.g. the person is driving or the person cannot take the map with him the person can instead look at a map before departing to plot a route and write down turns or other indications corresponding to the route on a piece of paper that the person can take with them for reference.

In some cases electronic devices may be available to plot a course to a particular location. For example a satellite navigation system or a device having access to a mapping application or service e.g. a device having circuitry for connecting to the Internet can be provided with starting and ending locations. The device can then define a path between the locations which can be presented to the user of the device. In some cases the device can determine its current location in real time to provide turn by turn directions from the current location to a destination. Electronic devices can therefore provide a simpler and easier approach for a person to get directions.

These devices however may not always be available or may sometimes not be able to access a mapping system e.g. a device may not be in cellular range to access the Internet . To ensure that directions are nevertheless available a user of the device can direct the device to print the directions generated by the device. The resulting printout can include a listing of turns a map overview and notes that a user may have wished to include in the printout. Printouts provided by existing devices however are often cluttered or poorly laid out and can be confusing. The pagination of many printouts often separate the graphical representation of the route from the list of turn by turn directions as shown for example in . shows two pages one showing the map and the other showing the turn by turn directions

In response to receiving an instruction from a user to print directions e.g. an instruction received from a mapping application provided on a mobile device a device can define a layout optimized for directions. The layout can include an overview of the entire route corresponding to the directions as well as listings of each step of the directions to provide turn by turn instructions. The map overview can include callouts that correspond to each step of the directions.

In some cases the layout can be optimized for landscape oriented paper. A first column of the layout can include a map overview of the entire route. The route may be highlighted on the map and may include several callouts. The callouts may be positioned and sequentially numbered to correspond to the different steps of the directions. A second column of the layout can include listings of steps of the directions. The listings can be displayed sequentially and each include information referencing a callout e.g. a step number a detailed map tile showing the particular step and a description.

If the route includes too many directions to fit on a single page the layout can include several pages where the map overview remains in the first column of every page and the specific listings change in the second column of each page. In some cases the electronic device can select the number of pages used to print out the directions such that similar numbers of listings are displayed on each page e.g. to provide a uniform and aesthetically pleasing printout .

In some embodiments the map overview on each page can focus on the particular steps printed on each page. Certain portions of a route e.g. the beginning and end may have interesting or more difficult steps than other steps of the route. Thus when the printed map is laid out the map overview may only show the callouts corresponding to steps that are listed on the page and not show the other callouts.

In some cases a device defined dedicated layout can be used to show points of interest on a map. A first column of a layout can be used to display a map overview in which different callouts identify points of interest. A second column of the layout can include listings providing information about each of the points of interest identified in the callouts. In some cases each listing can include a reference to a callout a map tile and a description. The points of interest can correspond for example to search results of user provided search criteria.

This is directed to systems methods and computer readable media for printing maps and directions. In particular this is directed to defining printing layouts for directions in a manner that is easily read and is aesthetically pleasing. In many situations a person may wish for printed out directions for guidance to a particular destination. To create such printouts a person must first get directions using an electronic device having appropriate capabilities.

Using electronic device a user can request and retrieve directions for navigating to a particular destination. For example a user can provide a destination using an input interface of the device e.g. enter an address or coordinates . In some cases a user can also provide a starting location though the current position of the device e.g. as determined from the positioning circuitry can be used. Once the electronic device has received starting and ending locations the device can determine directions for navigating from the starting location to the ending location using an appropriate algorithm. For example the electronic device can define a path between the starting and ending locations based on a network of paths each having particular characteristics or attributes.

As another example the electronic device can make use of a remote service for generating navigation directions. In particular the electronic device can transmit coordinates corresponding to the starting and ending locations to a remote source e.g. using communications circuitry operative to connect to the internet . The remote source can then using a database of routes and maps determine a particular path or route from the starting location to the ending location. Directions corresponding to the particular route can be transmitted to the device so that they may be provided to the user. In some cases the remote source can instead or in addition transmit map tiles that correspond to the particular route for display by the device.

Once a user has retrieved directions on the device the user may wish to print out the directions so that they may be available even when the device is not available or even if the device cannot retrieve map tiles corresponding to the directions e.g. if no network providing a connection to a remote source is available . To do so the user can direct the electronic device to print the directions on a tangible medium such as paper using a printer system.

Printer system can include any suitable device or apparatus operative to construct a physical representation of electronic information e.g. electronic data corresponding to a map that the user can use outside of the electronic device. In particular printer system can include for example a laser printer inkjet printer thermal printer dot matrix printer plotter facsimile machine copying machine or combinations of these. Printer system can provide an output in one or more colors including for example a monochromic output or an output combining ink of several colors e.g. cyan magenta yellow and black ink . The output can be provided on any suitable base or medium including for example paper of one or more colors wood plastic metal or any other surface on which ink or color can be overlaid. In some embodiments the output of printer system can be overlaid on previous outputs to form a three dimensional object e.g. distinct ink layers of the printer form overlaid layers of a three dimensional object .

Electronic device can provide the information to print to the printer system using any suitable approach. In some embodiments communications path can be established between electronic device and printer system . Communications path can include any suitable wired or wireless communications path or combinations of these and can transfer data encoded using any suitable protocol. In some embodiments communications path can include circuitry for encoding decoding or modifying the information transmitted between the electronic device and the printer system.

Communications path can connect to each of device and printer system using any suitable interface or connector. For example communications path can include a cable having connectors e.g. USB connectors or Ethernet connectors that connect to counterpart connector ports in each of the device and printer system. As another example electronic device and printer system can include communications circuitry for connecting to a communications network supporting the communications path such as for example communications circuitry supporting Wi Fi e.g. a 802.11 protocol Ethernet Bluetooth which is a trademark owned by Bluetooth Sig Inc. radio frequency systems cellular networks e.g. GSM AMPS GPRS CDMA EV DO EDGE 3GSM DECT IS 136 TDMA iDen LTE or any other suitable cellular network or protocol infrared TCP IP e.g. any of the protocols used in each of the TCP IP layers HTTP FTP RTP RTSP SSH Voice over IP VOIP any other communications protocol or any combination of these.

The electronic device can provide any suitable interface for printing directions. In some cases the interface can in part be provided by an application or remote service used to generate the directions. For example a mapping application on a mobile device can include an option for printing directions generated by the application. is a schematic view of an illustrative printing interface provided by a mapping application in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Display can include map depicting a particular region provided by a mapping application. Map can include path indicating a manner for a user to navigate from starting point to destination . In addition display can include listing of steps or directions for guiding the user along path .

Because a user may not be able to bring the device providing display with him as he follows path the user may wish to print the directions for reference. Display can provide print option in response to any suitable interaction with the device. In response to receiving a user selection of print option the device can transmit the directions and map to a printer.

To ensure that the directions are printed out in an aesthetically pleasing and useful manner the electronic device can automatically define a layout for the printed directions that differs from the layout of the map and directions shown in display . For example in response to determining that a print instruction was received from a map application the electronic device can transmit the content to be printed to the printer system using a pre defined layout associated with the map application. Different features of the layout will be discussed in more detail below.

In some cases an electronic device can generate a map and directions using an application other than a map application. For example a device can display a map in a web browser where the map and corresponding directions are retrieved from an appropriate web server. A user can direct the device to print the directions with an appropriate layout from a printing interface that includes options relating to printing directions or printing a map. is a schematic view of an illustrative display for defining print options in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. The electronic device can provide display at any suitable time including for example in response to receiving an instruction to print a map or directions. Display can include printing options displayed using any suitable approach. For example display can include dialog or menu having different options for defining a print request. In some cases display can instead or in addition provide the print options using other approaches including for example as a full display as part of a menu in an overlay or combinations of these.

Menu can include print options for defining any suitable print setting such as for example which printer to use paper orientation a selection of pages to print collation two sided printing the document layout pages per sheet or border color matching paper size paper feed the use of a cover page stapling margin shifts or combinations of these. In some cases menu can include one or more options specific to printing a map or directions. The options can be disposed in any suitable manner on menu . For example menu can include printer selection option presets option copies option pages option and option for expanding the available options in region . In some cases menu can display a preview of the content to be printed in preview window .

When maps or directions are to be printed a user can select a Map preset in preset option . In response to selecting the Map preset the electronic device can generate a layout optimized for printing out a map and directions. In some cases the user can customize the Map preset by selecting corresponding options in region of menu . The particular options of region can be related to menu selection option which can include a drop down menu defining several categories of printing sub options. Among the options of region menu can include option for defining the number of steps or directions to print on each sheet of paper. The user can define a particular number of steps using option or can allow the device to automatically determine an optimal number of steps e.g. as shown in . Once the user has selected the desired presets and customized the desired options the user can select print option to direct the device to print the map and directions. The map and directions can be provided as part of a pre defined layout to a printing system for printing.

Any suitable information related to directions requested by a user can be printed as part of the pre defined layout. is a schematic view of an illustrative printing layout of directions in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Page can include different information for navigating to a destination. In particular page can include region providing an overview of a route suggested to a user and region describing the steps required to follow the route. Regions and can be laid out in different columns such that centerline of page separates the regions. In this manner page can be folded in half along centerline without creasing or obscuring any of the information in either of regions and .

Region can include an overview of the route requested by the user. For example region can include a general description of the route describing the distance and time required for following the route. Region can also include map on which route extends from a starting location to an ending location selected by the user. Map can be provided at any suitable scale. For example the map tiles can be provided at a scale appropriate to show the entirety of route . The specific scale can be displayed for example as scale .

Because scale may only be provided in a small corner of map it may be difficult or cumbersome for a user to constantly refer back to scale when looking at a region of map that is away from scale . To provide the user with an additional indication of scale border of map can be discontinuous in a manner that reflects the scale of map . For example individual dashes or spaces between dashes can be sized in a manner that corresponds to scale . In particular each dash can have a length that matches a gradation of scale e.g. dash has a length corresponding to 0.5 miles shown in scale . The distribution of dashes as well as the size of the dashes or of the spaces between dashes can change based on the scale used to display map . For example a same length for a dash may correspond to different distances in two different maps displayed at different scales.

The electronic device can select dimensions of the border using any suitable approach. In some cases the electronic device can initially determine the scale at which map is displayed. The electronic device can also determine the dimensions of map e.g. the height and width . Based on the dimensions of map the electronic device can determine a range of possible dimensions for individual dashes and spaces. The range can be selected such that an appropriate number of dashes and spaces are displayed on each boundary of map while ensuring that each dash or space is sufficiently short or long to be useful to a user. The electronic device can then select a particular length in the determined range that corresponds to a length of a meaningful scaled distance of map e.g. the selected length corresponds to 100 feet 0.5 miles 10 miles or 50 miles based on the scale at which map is displayed . In some cases region can include an indication of the scale of the dashes and or spaces of border e.g. indication .

Region which can be located opposite region relative to centerline can include listings of steps that a user must follow to navigate from the starting location to the ending location. A step number a map tile and a description can serve to identify each step in listings . Step number can correspond to the number in a sequence of steps defining route .

Each step can include an instruction corresponding to a turn or road for the user to take. The particular driving instruction e.g. turn or go straight the distance to the next instruction the name of the road or other information detailing an instruction can be provided in description . The information can be formatted such that the same type of information is always provided in the same region of description . For example the description can include on a first line a distance to travel followed on a second line by a direction of travel and a street name.

Because some steps may be complex and difficult to follow using only written directions region can include map tiles corresponding to each step. Each map tile can include a detailed view of roads in the vicinity of a step with a highlighted arrow indicating the particular roads for the user to follow.

Each map tile can be provided at any suitable scale or zoom. In particular the scale for each tile can be selected based on any suitable criteria such as to ensure that a user has sufficient context to properly follow a direction. Different criteria can be used to determine an appropriate scale for each map tile . For example each tile can be scaled so that such each tile includes sufficient information for the user to make a decision while moving and follow the direction e.g. display sufficient information to allow the user three to five seconds to make a decision . The decision time can be determined from any suitable factor. For example the decision time can depend on one or more of the maneuver of the step e.g. a turn or straight or how much to turn the previous maneuver the next maneuver the speed at which the user is travelling was travelling likely will travel the mode of travel or transportation for the route e.g. driving or walking or combinations of these.

In some cases several steps may be so close to each other that the decision time required for a particular step may include portions of a previous step or of a next step. In such cases a single tile may serve to display several steps. For example as shown in display of step in listings can include information for three steps e.g. steps 7 8 and 9 as well as a tile that shows the route through each of the three steps.

Returning to region can include any suitable number of steps in listings . In some cases the particular number of steps displayed can be selected to provide a balanced layout on each printed page. For example it may be desirable for the number of steps displayed on each of several pages to be the same or at most different by one or two steps. The particular page number of a several page printout can be indicated for example by page number in a corner of region .

Any suitable factor can be used to determine the number of steps to display. In some cases the electronic device defining the layout for the directions can determine a number of steps to display on each page based on the total number of directions available paper sizes and the type of steps e.g. whether several steps can be combined into a single listing . For example the electronic device can define a layout in which the number of steps on each page is in the range of 4 to 8 with the final page having at least 3 steps e.g. to avoid having a final page with only one step . As another example the electronic device can define a layout such that no page has more than two or another number steps more or less than any other pages in the displayed listings.

To determine the specific number of steps to display on each page the electronic device can first determine the number of steps displayed in the listings of steps. In particular the device can determine which steps if any should be combined in the listings. Once the device has determined the number of steps to display in the listings the device can divide the number of steps by the desired steps to display per page e.g. divide by 5 or 6 and determine whether the remainder is less than a minimum threshold. In some cases the device can divide the number of steps by each of the range of desired steps to find the number of steps that provides a remainder of 0 or a remainder that is closest to the dividing number. Once the device has determined the optimal number of steps per page the device can define a layout in which each listing of steps has the optimal number of steps per page. In some cases different pages can have a different number of steps in their respective listings.

In some cases the desired number of steps to display per page can vary based on the dimensions of paper to print. For example listings on letter sized paper can preferably have 5 steps while listings on legal paper can preferably have 7 steps. As another example listings on A4 paper can preferably have 4 steps while listings on A3 paper can preferably have 8 steps.

The portion of the route displayed in each map tile can be oriented in any suitable manner. For example each map tile can be oriented such that north on the displayed map is towards the top of page . As another example each map tile can be oriented such that the user s direction of travel e.g. as indicated by arrow points towards the top of page .

To allow the user to relate each step in listings to map map can include callouts each having a number of a particular step. The map tile corresponding to each step can include a scaled view of a region of map near the corresponding callout . As discussed above the particular scale used for each map tile can differ though the scale of all of the map tiles may typically be larger than the scale of the corresponding portion of map identified by a callout .

In some embodiments the map overview on each page can focus on the particular steps printed on each page. Certain portions of a route e.g. the beginning and end may have interesting or more difficult steps than other steps of the route. Thus when the printed map is laid out the map overview may only show the callouts corresponding to steps that are listed on the page and not show the other callouts. For example referring to if map were to be displayed with focus on the steps in listing only callouts associated with the start step and steps 1 4 would be shown. Similarly referring to only callouts associated with steps 5 10 and End would be shown in a listing focused overview map.

In some cases particular points of interest can be included in the layout along with the route. For example map can include points of interest along the route. In some cases the particular points of interest displayed can be selected based on characteristics of the route. For example callouts or other information identifying gas stations can be displayed when the route exceeds a particular distance or duration e.g. when it is likely that a user will need to refuel to continue the route . As another example callouts for coffee shops can be displayed when the user prints directions in the morning or for a trip expected to be early or late at night.

In addition to printing directions an electronic device can be used to print out points of interest on a map. For example a user can use a map application to search for a particular type of point of interest. is a schematic view of an illustrative display of a map on which points of interest are displayed in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Display can include map of a particular area in which points of interest corresponding to a search entered in search bar are displayed. For example map can include callouts each identifying a particular point of interest. To print out map with the points of interest the user can provide a print instruction e.g. select print option . In some cases a map with points of interest near a destination can be printed along with direction to the destination e.g. automatically or in response to a user instruction .

In response to receiving an instruction to print a map with points of interest the electronic device can define a layout in which the map and the points of interest are provided. is a schematic view of an illustrative printing layout on which a map and points of interest are displayed in accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Page can include region and region which can have some or all of the features of corresponding regions of page described above . Region can include map on which roads and other information is displayed at a particular scale. Map can include callouts disposed in different areas of the map where each callout corresponds to the location of a particular point of interest e.g. points of interest corresponding to search terms .

In region for example in a column adjacent to a column of region page can include listings of points of interest. Each listing can include identifier corresponding to a particular callout. To assist the user in locating the point of interest of a listing each listing can include map tile providing a detailed view and position of the point of interest. Additional details describing the point of interest its address contact information hours of operation website or other such information can be provided in description .

Page can include any suitable number of callouts and listings. In some cases the number of callouts displayed on map can match the number of listings in listings . Alternatively listings of points of interest can be printed on several pages where map includes callouts for listings printed on different pages. The points of interest can be provided in any suitable order including for example based on distance from a particular location ratings popularity name availability relevance or any other such criteria.

If at step the electronic device instead determines that no steps can be combined into a single listing process can move to step . At step the device can determine whether the listings required to show the route can fit on a single page. For example the device can determine whether the total number of steps or the reduced number of listings is less than a maximum number of listings per page. If the electronic device determines that the listings can fit on a single page process can move to step at which the listings can be laid out on a single page. Process can then end at step .

If at step the electronic device instead determines that the steps cannot fit on a single page process can move to step . At step the optimal number of pages on which to print the listings can be determined. For example the electronic device can select a number of pages such that each page can include a number of listings that is within a predetermined range e.g. 4 to 7 listings . In some cases the electronic device can further select a number of pages such that no page includes substantially more or fewer listings than another page e.g. no page includes two more listings than any other page . At step the listings can be laid out on the determined number of pages. For example the electronic device can dispose listings such that each page includes substantially the same number of listings. Process can then end at step .

Various different map printing embodiments may be realized using an embodiment according to the principles of the invention. For example there may be times when the user is not viewing a particular route but rather is viewing the map. The user may zoom in to various locations on the displayed map and may want to print the map exactly as shown on the screen. Thus the user is able to print the map at the same zoom level he or she is viewing it on the screen. The printout reverse geocodes the center of the map to automatically display the location the user is viewing with no additional input from the user.

Although many of the embodiments of the present invention are described herein with respect to personal computing devices it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to personal computing applications but is generally applicable to other applications.

In some cases the device used for described embodiments may include touch I O device that can receive touch input for interacting with computing system via wired or wireless communication channel .

In some embodiments peripherals interface one or more processors and memory controller may be implemented on a single chip such as processing system . In some other embodiments they may be implemented on separate chips.

In some cases one or more Application Programming Interfaces APIs may be used in some embodiments. An API is an interface implemented by a program code component or hardware component hereinafter API implementing component that allows a different program code component or hardware component hereinafter API calling component to access and use one or more functions methods procedures data structures classes and or other services provided by the API implementing component. An API can define one or more parameters that are passed between the API calling component and the API implementing component.

An API allows a developer of an API calling component which may be a third party developer to leverage specified features provided by an API implementing component. There may be one API calling component or there may be more than one such component. An API can be a source code interface that a computer system or program library provides in order to support requests for services from an application. An operating system OS can have multiple APIs to allow applications running on the OS to call one or more of those APIs and a service such as a program library can have multiple APIs to allow an application that uses the service to call one or more of those APIs. An API can be specified in terms of a programming language that can be interpreted or compiled when an application is built.

In some embodiments the API implementing component may provide more than one API each providing a different view of or with different aspects that access different aspects of the functionality implemented by the API implementing component. For example one API of an API implementing component can provide a first set of functions and can be exposed to third party developers and another API of the API implementing component can be hidden not exposed and provide a subset of the first set of functions and also provide another set of functions such as testing or debugging functions which are not in the first set of functions. In other embodiments the API implementing component may itself call one or more other components via an underlying API and thus be both an API calling component and an API implementing component.

An API defines the language and parameters that API calling components use when accessing and using specified features of the API implementing component. For example an API calling component accesses the specified features of the API implementing component through one or more API calls or invocations embodied for example by function or method calls exposed by the API and passes data and control information using parameters via the API calls or invocations. The API implementing component may return a value through the API in response to an API call from an API calling component. While the API defines the syntax and result of an API call e.g. how to invoke the API call and what the API call does the API may not reveal how the API call accomplishes the function specified by the API call. Various API calls are transferred via the one or more application programming interfaces between the calling API calling component and an API implementing component. Transferring the API calls may include issuing initiating invoking calling receiving returning or responding to the function calls or messages in other words transferring can describe actions by either of the API calling component or the API implementing component. The function calls or other invocations of the API may send or receive one or more parameters through a parameter list or other structure. A parameter can be a constant key data structure object object class variable data type pointer array list or a pointer to a function or method or another way to reference a data or other item to be passed via the API.

Furthermore data types or classes may be provided by the API and implemented by the API implementing component. Thus the API calling component may declare variables use pointers to use or instantiate constant values of such types or classes by using definitions provided in the API.

Generally an API can be used to access a service or data provided by the API implementing component or to initiate performance of an operation or computation provided by the API implementing component. By way of example the API implementing component and the API calling component may each be any one of an operating system a library a device driver an API an application program or other module it should be understood that the API implementing component and the API calling component may be the same or different type of module from each other . API implementing components may in some cases be embodied at least in part in firmware microcode or other hardware logic. In some embodiments an API may allow a client program to use the services provided by a Software Development Kit SDK library. In other embodiments an application or other client program may use an API provided by an Application Framework. In these embodiments the application or client program may incorporate calls to functions or methods provided by the SDK and provided by the API or use data types or objects defined in the SDK and provided by the API. An Application Framework may in these embodiments provide a main event loop for a program that responds to various events defined by the Framework. The API allows the application to specify the events and the responses to the events using the Application Framework. In some implementations an API call can report to an application the capabilities or state of a hardware device including those related to aspects such as input capabilities and state output capabilities and state processing capability power state storage capacity and state communications capability etc. and the API may be implemented in part by firmware microcode or other low level logic that executes in part on the hardware component.

The API calling component may be a local component i.e. on the same data processing system as the API implementing component or a remote component i.e. on a different data processing system from the API implementing component that communicates with the API implementing component through the API over a network. It should be understood that an API implementing component may also act as an API calling component i.e. it may make API calls to an API exposed by a different API implementing component and an API calling component may also act as an API implementing component by implementing an API that is exposed to a different API calling component.

The API may allow multiple API calling components written in different programming languages to communicate with the API implementing component thus the API may include features for translating calls and returns between the API implementing component and the API calling component however the API may be implemented in terms of a specific programming language. An API calling component can in one embedment call APIs from different providers such as a set of APIs from an OS provider and another set of APIs from a plug in provider and another set of APIs from another provider e.g. the provider of a software library or creator of the another set of APIs.

It will be appreciated that the API implementing component may include additional functions methods classes data structures and or other features that are not specified through the API and are not available to the API calling component . It should be understood that the API calling component may be on the same system as the API implementing component or may be located remotely and accesses the API implementing component using the API over a network. While illustrates a single API calling component interacting with the API it should be understood that other API calling components which may be written in different languages or the same language than the API calling component may use the API .

The API implementing component the API and the API calling component may be stored in a machine readable medium which includes any mechanism for storing information in a form readable by a machine e.g. a computer or other data processing system . For example a machine readable medium includes magnetic disks optical disks random access memory read only memory flash memory devices etc.

In Software Stack an exemplary embodiment applications can make calls to Services A or B using several Service APIs and to Operating System OS using several OS APIs. Services A and B can make calls to OS using several OS APIs.

Note that the Service 2 has two APIs one of which Service 2 API 1 receives calls from and returns values to Application 1 and the other Service 2 API 2 receives calls from and returns values to Application 2. Service 1 which can be for example a software library makes calls to and receives returned values from OS API 1 and Service 2 which can be for example a software library makes calls to and receives returned values from both OS API 1 and OS API 2. Application 2 makes calls to and receives returned values from OS API 2.

The invention is preferably implemented by software but can also be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software. The invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer system. Examples of the computer readable medium include read only memory random access memory CD ROMs DVDs magnetic tape and optical data storage devices. The computer readable medium can also be distributed over network coupled computer systems so that the computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
