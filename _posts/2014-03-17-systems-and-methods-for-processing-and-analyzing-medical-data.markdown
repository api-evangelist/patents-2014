This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61 800 879 filed Mar. 15 2013 titled SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR PROCESSING AND ANALYZING MEDICAL DATA . This application is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.

The systems devices and methods described herein relate to the processing and analyzing of medical data.

Ambulatory electrocardiogram ECG monitoring can be useful to detect transient cardiac abnormalities or problems that are difficult to detect using a standard ECG recording device. One type of device used for ambulatory ECG monitoring is an event recorder which can be worn or carried by the user to record ECG data for typically a relatively short duration. The event recorder can continuously record ECG data while only storing the most recent ECG on a rolling basis and or the event recorder can be activated manually by the user to record ECG data. Conventionally the ECG data from the event recorders are sent to a receiving center or the user s physician where the ECG data can be interpreted by a specialist.

However the ease of use of such ambulatory ECG monitors as well as the widespread availability of such device for operation by patients themselves a tremendous amount of patient specific medical data is being generated. Although automated solutions to review and analysis of this data have been proposed and are being developed see e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14 076 076 filed Nov. 8 2013 and titled ELECTROCARDIOGRAM SIGNAL DETECTION such techniques are most valuable to pre screen or triage the medical information some or all of which may still have to be reviewed by trained medical technicians and or physicians.

Review of other medical data such as medical imaging data including x rays MRIs ultrasound CT scans PET scans and the like is traditionally interpreted by one of the patient s medical providers. Alternatively medical data is increasingly outsourced to specialists for interpretation. These outsourcing specialists can be located overseas and can belong to an outsourcing center that provides low cost medical data interpretation services. U.S. Pat. No. 7 657 479 to Henley Method and System for Provision and Acquisition of Medical Services and Products describes an online matching method and system for verifying medical service provides and allowing verified providers to bid on personal medical services. See also U.S. Pat. No. 8 150 750 to Ray titled Systems and Method for Managing Expert Content . U.S. Publication No. 2012 0123891 to Neilesh Patel titled Professionally Qualified Bidding System for a User Seeking Professional Services also describes a systems and method related to using auction systems to match medical providers with users seeking medical services.

However such systems as those provided above do not adequately pre sort or triage the information to be reviewed. Further such systems are adapted more for small discrete amounts of information e.g. single patient consultations etc. and do not work well at handling the large amounts of information that may be generated by ambulatory ECG systems and the like. What is needed are systems and methods capable of pre screening organizing and matching triaging such medical information and particularly ECG information before or as part of the auctioning process. Described herein are systems and methods related triaging and bundling medical information e.g. ECGs that may address the shortcomings of existing and proposed systems.

The systems devices and methods described herein relate to the processing and analyzing of medical data and in particular relate to crowdsourcing the medical data to qualified specialists for interpretation or analysis by presorting or categorizing the medical data e.g. electrocardiograms or ECGs into groups or bundles that share one or more common characteristics. Grouping otherwise similar data such as ECGs into groups based on one or more similar characteristics dramatically increases the efficiency and rate at which the medical data may be analyzed and also increases the appeal of the analysis process to potential reviewers. The sorted groups may be size limited e.g. to a predetermined number of ECG traces or a total time of ECG traces . Thus there may be groups that are identical in their shared characteristic s though they include different user data.

In particular with respect to ECG data the ECG traces included as part of the ECG data may be pre processed e.g. to filter annotate truncate or the like. For example an automated process of pre screening and or filtering the ECG signals may be performed. This process may be performed by the recording device e.g. locally and or by the processor receiving the data.

For example a method for analyzing ECG data may include receiving ECG data from a plurality of users in a server having a processor and memory categorizing using the processor the ECG data into groups based on extracted ECG features listing the categorized ECG groups by category on an online auction house receiving bids for the listed ECG groups from registered specialists determining using the processor which specialist won a bid for a group from the listed ECG groups and providing the specialist that won the bid for the group with access to the ECGs within the group. The method may also include receiving interpreted ECG data from the specialist for the ECGs within the group.

In general the ECG data may include ECG traces including raw ECG traces filtered ECG traces or a combination of the two. ECG traces may be truncated or annotated. ECG features may be extracted using the processor and or the processor may receive ECG data and extracted ECG features from the plurality of users.

Categorizing may include categorizing the ECG data into groups based on extracted ECG features. Any appropriate ECG features e.g. feature of the actual ECG trace and or feature of the manner time location or patent when the ECG was taken. For example ECG features may include location information about where the ECG was taken geographical location or the location on the body from where the ECG was taken chest etc. . Extracted ECG features may include user annotations including annotations indicating user status resting active user age gender etc. Such information is particularly useful in combination with other ECG features particularly quantitative features extracted from the ECG trace s . Extracted ECG features may also include one or more of amplitude polarity duration or shape of the P Q R S and T waves and QRS complex ratios and amplitude differences between P Q R S and T waves or QRS complex beat to beat variability between P Q R S and T waves or QRS complex P R interval QRS interval Q T interval S T interval P R segment S T segment and beat to beat frequency.

Any of the methods and apparatuses including software hardware and firmware described herein may also determine an accuracy rating for a particular medical specialist. If the medical specialist is below a predetermined accuracy threshold then the group analyzed by the medical specialist can be re introduced for analysis by another medial specialist. A predetermined threshold for accuracy may be based on a percentage accuracy. For example accuracy may be assessed by inserting at least one reference ECG e.g. a known already analyzed ECG in the ECG groups and comparing the analysis of the reference ECG by the medical specialist that reviews a particular group including the reference ECG with the known analysis of the reference ECG. The lower percent identity between the medical specialist that analyzed the group and the known analysis the more likely that the group will be placed back in for re bidding an re analysis e.g. less than 80 identical less than 70 identical less than 60 identical less than 50 identical less than 40 identical etc. . In some variations the comparison is yes no. For example if there is a match between the analysis by the medical specialist 100 match or if there is no match e.g. 0 match . For example at least one reference ECG may be inserted in some or all of the ECG groups. An accuracy may be determined for the received interpreted ECG data based on the specialists interpretation of the reference ECG. For example at least one reference ECG may be inserted in each ECG group and an accuracy of the received interpreted ECG data may be determined based on the specialists interpretation of the reference ECG if the accuracy is below a predetermined threshold the group of ECGs on the online auction house may be re listed. The accuracy of a medical specialist may also be examined by duplicating a user s ECG data between two or more groups and comparing the resulting analysis. By comparing the two analyses of the same ECG in different groups e.g. analyzed by two different medical specialists or the same medical specialist an estimate of the accuracy or at least consistency may be determined. If the two or more analysis do not match the two or more groups of ECGs may be re listed on the online auction house e.g. when the agreement between the interpreted ECG data for the duplicated ECG data is below a predetermined threshold .

Any of the methods or system may also be adapted to notify a user that the user s ECG data has been interpreted. In addition or alternatively the user may be provided with a list of local specialists based on location information provided with ECG data from the user. In method or system may also schedule an appointment for a user e.g. using the processor with a local specialist. In some variation scheduling may be provided particularly if the analysis reveals an anomaly or indicates further analysis or monitoring of the subject would be beneficial.

Apparatuses including devices having a processor that is configured e.g. by running software or the like to operate as described to analyze medical data. For example described herein are non transitory computer readable storage media storing instructions capable of being executed by a processor that when executed by the processor causes the processor to receive ECG data from a plurality of ECG recording devices categorize the ECG data into a plurality of groups based on extracted ECG features list the ECG groups by category on an online auction house receive bids for the listed ECG groups from registered specialists determine which specialist won a bid for a group from the listed ECG groups and provide the specialist that won the bid for the group with access to the ECGs within the group.

The set of instructions when executed by the processor may causes the processor perform any of the steps described. For example the set of instructions when executed by the processor may further cause the processor to determine an accuracy for the specialist.

Thus in general a method for analyzing ECG data is provided. The method may include recording ECG data from a plurality of users using ECG recording devices transmitting the ECG data to a server having a processor and memory extracting using the processor a plurality of ECG features from the ECG data categorizing using the processor the ECG data into at least two categories based on the extracted ECG features bundling using the processor the categorized ECG data into ECG bundles listing the ECG bundles on an online auction house receiving at the online auction house bids on the listed ECG bundles from registered specialists determining using the processor which bids are winning bids providing specialists with the winning bids online access to the ECG bundles and receiving at the server interpreted ECG data from the specialists.

The method may further include attaching location information to the ECG data. In some embodiments the location information is provided by a GPS transceiver. In some embodiments the location information is provided by the user. The method may include compiling using the processor a list of local specialists based on the attached location information and providing the user with the list. The method may further include scheduling an appointment using the processor with one of the local specialists provided to the user.

In general the method may include annotating e.g. attaching user notes to the ECG data wherein the user notes are taken contemporaneously with the recording of the ECG data. The user notes may comprise at least one of user symptoms and user activities.

As mentioned the method further includes notifying users that the ECG data has been interpreted. In any of these variations the methods or systems may also update the user s electronic health or medical record and or storing the both the ECG data and the interpreted ECG data in a database.

A system for acquiring and analyzing ECG data may include a plurality of ECG recording devices that generate ECG data and a server programmed to receive ECG data from the plurality of ECG recording devices extract a plurality of ECG features from the ECG data categorize the ECG data into at least two categories based on the extracted ECG features and bundle the categorized ECG data into ECG bundles list the ECG bundles on an online auction house receive bids on the listed ECG bundles from registered specialists determine which bids are winning bids provide specialists with the winning bids online access to the ECG bundles and receive interpreted ECG data from the specialists. The ECG recording device may include a smartphone. The ECG recording device may include a GPS transceiver.

In general the methods and systems described herein may provide for the use of bidding by medical specialists on groups of medical data and particularly ECG data. Such methods and systems may take advantage of crowd sourcing for ECG interpretation and management and may vet or select the medical specialist. Any of the methods described herein may include a method providing an interpretation of cardiac data of a user and may include some or all of the steps of receiving at a remote server cardiac data of a plurality of users and a plurality of bids from a plurality of medical specialists selecting with the remote server a medical specialist subgroup of the plurality of medical specialists providing the medical specialist subgroup access to the received cardiac data and receiving at the remote server an interpretation of the received cardiac data generated from the subset of the plurality of medical professionals. The presentation of the groups of medical data ECGs may be offered only to a sub set of the specialists.

Ultimately the selection of the medical specialist subgroup may be determined by winning bid from the received plurality of bids the winning bid being associated with the medical specialist subset. Pre screening of the set of medical specialists may include preselecting based on one or more of price availability location language fluency experience or certification. In some variations the selection among bids from medical specialists that have been provided a listing of groups of ECGs may be made by ranking all or a subset of price availability location language fluency experience response time prior accuracy or certification.

The measurement of the ECG information may require a prescription. Thus any of the methods described herein may include or be methods of providing an interpreted cardiac parameter to a subject that include one or more of the steps of receiving a cardiac parameter of a subject from a cardiac parameter sensing system prescribed to the subject by a prescribing physician providing a plurality of medical professionals access to the cardiac parameter and sending an interpretation of the sensed cardiac parameter to the subject wherein the interpretation is generated by one or more medical professionals of the plurality of medical professionals other than the prescribing physician.

In general the cardiac parameter sensing system may include a smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer and a sensor in communication with the smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer. Thus a cardiac parameter may be received from a smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer and the method or system may also include sending the interpretation to the smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer. The smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer may be configured to receive the sent interpretation and display the interpretation in response. For example displayed through a user interface of the smartphone tablet computer or wearable computer.

Any of the methods and systems described herein may include displaying the results of the communication with the remote server including displaying of results locally to the user. For example any of these methods or systems may include or be adapted to perform any of the steps including receiving at a remote server cardiac data of a user transmitted from a local computing device removably coupled to a protective case comprising a sensor configured for sensing the cardiac data and transmitting the sensed cardiac data to the local computing device providing a medical specialist access to the received cardiac data at the remote server receiving at the server a medical specialist interpretation of the accessed cardiac data and sending the received cardiac data interpretation from the remote server to the local computing device for display on a display of the local computing device. Thus for example received cardiac data of the user may include location information from the local computing device.

As mentioned above and of the methods described herein may also be adapted to integrate ECG and location data which may allow the methods and systems to customize feedback to the user based on local medical providers e.g. physicians . For example any of the methods or systems may include or be adapted to perform any of the steps including receiving from a user cardiac data and location data of the user and generating a list of medical specialists and medical specialist locations from a database of medical specialists and medical specialist locations wherein the list is generated in response to the received user cardiac and location data. The method or system may also include sorting the generated list in response to one or more of the received user cardiac data or received user location data. The sorted list may be sorted for example by one or more of proximity to the user availability experience patient rating score insurance accepted affiliation with a medical provider network or price of service.

As mentioned above the apparatuses and methods described herein can facilitate such remote professional or specialist interpretation by sorting medical data into groups or bundles and determining which medical data bundles are appropriate for interpretation for sub groups of professionals or specialists. For example a winning bid based on professional or specialist location specialty expertise experience and or price information can be determined and the medical professional or specialist sub group supplying the winning bid may be allowed to interpret a selected medical data bundle. While many current outsourcing professionals or specialists belong to individual outsourcing centers located at a central location the sub groups of medical professionals or specialists using the systems herein need not belong to an individual outsourcing center and individual medical professionals or specialists can be located in a variety of locations so long as a winning bid is placed and he or she has access to the medical data bundle. Bids can be placed through the Internet a cellular data network or other wide area network. In at least some cases only medical professionals or specialists who have gone through a certification or membership process by paying membership fees and going through a background check for example are allowed to place bids. This location and or outsourcing center independence can allow the remote interpretation and diagnosis of medical information to be scaled to support a large patient population e.g. millions to billions more easily than traditional more centralized medical data outsourcing centers.

The apparatuses and method described herein are generally helpful for interpretation of cardiac data of a user such as an electrocardiogram ECG . A remote server for example may receive cardiac data of a plurality of users and a plurality of bids from a plurality of medical specialists. The cardiac data and or the plurality of bids may be received from a plurality of mobile computing devices of the plurality of users. These mobile computing devices may comprise smartphones tablet computers wearable computing devices or the like. The remote server may select a medical specialist subgroup of the plurality of medical specialists. A plurality of bids may be received from the plurality of computing devices of the plurality of medical specialists. To select the medical specialist subgroup a winning bid associated with an individual medical professional or subgroup may be determined from the received plurality of bids. A cardiac data interpretation can comprise a diagnosis of the cardiac data.

The apparatuses and methods described may provide an interpreted cardiac parameter to a subject. In particular a cardiac parameter may be interpreted by a human e.g. by a technician a specialist a physician or the like . This interpretation may be in addition to e.g. following triage by interpretation or modification of the cardiac parameter e.g. ECG by a machine e.g. using an appropriate algorithm. The cardiac parameter of a subject may be received by a remote server for example from a cardiac parameter sensing system prescribed to the subject by a prescribing physician. A plurality of medical professionals may be provided access to the cardiac parameter received by the remote server. An interpretation of the sensed cardiac parameter may be sent to the subject for example back to the local computing device of the subject. The interpretation may be generated by one or more medical professionals of the plurality of medical professionals other than the prescribing physician. These medical professionals may provide the interpretations from a variety of locations remote from one another.

A cardiac parameter sensing system may comprise a local computing device such as a personal computer a laptop computer a palm top computer a smartphone e.g. an Apple iPhone a Samsung Galaxy S phone a Google Nexus phone or the like tablet computer e.g. an Apple iPad a Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet a Google Nexus tablet or the like or wearable computer e.g. a Google Glass and a sensor in communication with the local computing device such as those described in commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12 796 188 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 509 882 Ser. Nos. 13 108 738 13 420 520 now U.S. Pat. No. 8 301 232 Ser.

For example a first portion of the interpretation can be performed automatically and a second portion of the interpretation can be performed by a human. Alternatively or in combination the interpretation can be substantially e.g. fully automated.

The cardiac parameter sensing system may perform a plurality of the above mentioned cardiovascular diagnostic and or monitoring functions. In many embodiments the cardiac parameter sensing system may restrict a subset of such functions if those functions have not been prescribed for. Other functions may not require a prescription. For example the cardiac parameter sensing system may not need a prescription to generate a single lead electrocardiograph but may require a prescription to measure an ST segment of an electrocardiograph or detect arrhythmia and generate an alarm. The prescribing physician may prescribe the cardiac parameter sensing system to the user for the restricted function s and the prescription may be entered e.g. into the downloaded app of the local computing device into the cardiac parameter sensing system to unlock one or more of the restricted cardiovascular diagnostic and or monitoring functions. The unrestricted and restricted set of cardiovascular diagnostic and or monitoring functions may or may not overlap e.g. one or more features of the sets of features can be the same or the sets of features can be different . The unrestricted and restricted sets may or may not comprise the same cardiac parameter s .

A local computing device may be configured to receive the sent interpretation and display the interpretation for example on a display of the local computing device through a user interface which may be downloaded from the Internet e.g. provided on the software application or app or other wide area network such as a cellular data network. The user interface may be downloaded from an application distribution service or platform. The user interface may comprise a component of a mobile application or mobile app and the application distribution service may be an Internet accessible service such as Apple iTunes Google Play Amazon Appstore or the like. Generally the cardiac parameter comprises an electrocardiogram ECG and the interpretation comprises a diagnosis.

The apparatuses e.g. systems and methods described herein may also include apparatuses and methods for analyzing cardiac data of a user. A remote server for example receives cardiac data of a user transmitted from a local computing device removably coupled to a protective case. The protective case may comprise a sensor configured for sensing the cardiac data and transmitting the sensed cardiac data to the local computing device. The local computing device may comprise any of the local computing devices described herein. A medical specialist may be provided access to the received cardiac data at the remote server. The remote server may then receive a medical specialist interpretation of the accessed cardiac data. The remote server may then send the received cardiac data interpretation from the remote server to the local computing device for display on a display of the local computing device. The display may show a user interface of an application downloaded from an application distribution service or platform as described herein. The remote server may store one or more of the received cardiac data from the local computing device or the received medical specialist interpretation of the accessed cardiac data. Access may be provided from the local computing device to the stored medical specialist interpretation of the accessed cardiac data. Through the local computing device the user may be notified that the server has received the medical specialist interpretation.

As mentioned above cardiac data may include an electrocardiogram ECG measured by the sensor of the protective case and may further comprise user location data provided by the local computing device such as with a GPS transceiver. The remote server may compile a list of local medical specialists in response to the location information from the local computing device and further comprising providing the user with the list. This list may be sent to the local computing device for display and the local computing device may facilitate the scheduling of an appointment with one of the local medical specialists provided to the user. The cardiac data sent by the local computing device may also include notes input by the user data regarding user symptoms data regarding an activity level or the user and the like.

The apparatuses e.g. systems and a methods described herein may also include apparatuses and methods for managing cardiac data electrocardiogram ECG data for example of a user.

Embodiments of the invention include systems devices and methods for processing distributing and analyzing data. Embodiments of the invention also include systems devices and methods for processing and distributing tasks or jobs for completion by a qualified worker or specialist. In one embodiment crowdsourcing data to specialists for interpretation can be accomplished using an auction system to match the specialists with discrete portions of the data. The data can be bundled based on one or more categories or characteristics and then placed on an auction where the specialists can bid for each bundle by submitting a payment price. In some embodiments the data can be medical data such as ECG data imaging data and test data for example.

In some embodiments such systems devices and methods can be used to process distribute and analyze ECG data. The ECG data can be generated by a traditional ECG recording device or an ambulatory ECG recording device such as a Holter monitor or an event recorder. Event recorders include traditional event recorders as well as mobile i.e. smartphone based event recorders. The ECG data can be transmitted over phone lines the cellular network the mobile data network or through a Wi Fi network for example to a central processing center and or directed to a medical professional such as a physician. As more and more users adopt traditional and mobile event recorders more and more ECG data will be generated. In some embodiments the user can elect to have their ECG data interpreted by a specialist. In some embodiments the user can be prompted by the event recorder whether the user would like his or her ECG data interpreted by a specialist. In some embodiments the user can elect to send the ECG data to be interpreted by a specialist. In some embodiments before sending out the ECG data to the server or cloud the user or patient must confirm his or her consent to send out the ECG data. In some embodiments the user can input data regarding their condition or status at the time the ECG is taken that is associated to and sent with the ECG data. For example the user can input symptoms felt before and or during the ECG recording and can input the activities the user was engaged in preceding and or during the ECG recording. In some embodiments if the user can be charged a predetermined amount for an interpretation of his or her ECG data. In some embodiments the user can pay a monthly fee for the ability to have a predetermined number of ECGs interpreted by a specialist.

A physician with many patients may not have the ability bandwidth or desire to analyze all of their patients ECG data. Accordingly in some embodiments it may be desirable to process and distribute the ECG data to a group of qualified specialists. For example the ECG data can be distributed to cardiac technicians and or physicians such as cardiologists and electrophysiologists for interpretation. In some embodiments the cardiac technicians can be assigned to sort and triage individual ECGs into a plurality of groups such as normal ECGs and abnormal ECGs. In some embodiments the cardiac technicians or other specialists bid upon uncategorized ECG bundles as described below and winning bidder are assigned to triage the ECGs in the uncategorized bundle. In some embodiments the abnormal ECGs can be further subdivided into critical ECGs and non critical ECGs. The ECG groups can be ranked or prioritized such that abnormal ECGs and critical ECGs are given a higher priority for quicker processing than normal ECGs.

In some embodiments a computer system and method can be used to triage and categorize the ECGs. In some embodiments the algorithm can identify typical ECG abnormalities using a pattern recognition algorithm. For example the pattern recognition algorithm can identify abnormal P waves T waves or QRS complexes. In some embodiments the algorithm can be a beat classification algorithm. The computer system can include a server and a database for example. The server can have one or more processors for executing instructions and memory for storing the instructions. The instructions can be encoded in software and or hardware such as ASICs. The instructions can encompass any of the methods and steps described herein.

In some embodiments the specialists are certified. Appropriate certification for interpretation of ECGs include for example medical board certification for physicians in cardiology and or electrophysiology and certification for cardiovascular technology for cardiac technicians. In some embodiments the physicians can be board certified and the cardiac technicians do not have to be certified. Requiring only the physicians to be certified can make sense in embodiments where the cardiac technicians are sorting and triaging the ECGs for review by a physician.

In some embodiments each group of ECG data can be bundled into a predetermined number of ECGs. For example a bundle of ECG data can have between 5 to 100 ECGs in increments of five. In some embodiments a bundle of ECG data can have at least 5 to 100 ECGs in increments of five. In some embodiment a bundle of ECG data can have no more than 5 to 100 ECGs in increments of five. For example normal ECGs can be bundled into sets of 25 normal ECGs and abnormal ECGs can be bundled into sets of 25 abnormal ECGs. In some embodiments the number of abnormal ECGs bundled together is less than the number of normal ECGs bundled together. This may allow the abnormal ECGs to be distributed among a larger number of specialists and enable a quicker turnaround time for interpretation of the abnormal ECGs.

In some embodiments the bundled ECGs can be listed on an online auction house. Registered specialists can bid on the bundled ECGs by specifying an amount the specialist is willing to be paid in exchange for interpreting the ECGs. In some embodiments the online auction house can retain the difference between the amount charged to the users and the amount bid by the specialist that wins the auction. In some embodiments the ECG bundles can have a maximum bid amount which is a maximum amount that can be paid to a specialist for interpreting the bundle. In some embodiments an abnormal ECG bundle can have a higher maximum bid amount than a normal ECG bundle to provide additional incentives for specialists to bid on the abnormal ECG bundles.

In some embodiments the online auction house determines the winning bid by selecting the lowest bid amount as the winning bid. In other words the specialist that is willing to be paid the lowest amount for interpreting the ECG bundle wins the auction. In some embodiments the bids can also be sealed or concealed such that each bidder is unaware of the amounts bid by other bidders such as in a first price sealed bid auction. In some embodiments the auction can be conducted according to a second price sealed bid auction i.e. a Vickrey auction when the bids are sealed and the bidder submitting to lowest bid wins but is paid the amount bid by the second lowest bidder. In some embodiments the auction is conducted according to an open descending bid auction i.e. an English auction where the bidders are aware of the lowest bid and the bidding continues until only one bidder remains or the period for bidding expires. The lowest bidder that remains or the bidder with the lowest bid when the period for bidding expires wins the auction. In some embodiments the auction is conducted according to an open ascending bid auction i.e. a Dutch auction where the price starts at a predetermined floor level that can be based on the category of the ECG bundle and the size of the bundle among other factors. The price is progressively raised until a bidder accepts the price and submits a bid thereby winning the auction and getting paid at the bid price for interpreting the ECG bundle. In some embodiments the online auction house can run one or more different types of auctions. In some embodiments the auction can include a buyout price which is a price that wins the auction if bid by a specialist. In some embodiments the buyout price can be lower for normal ECG bundles and higher for abnormal ECG bundles.

In some embodiments the bidding is open for a relatively short period of time in order to keep turnaround time low. For example the bidding period can be set at less than 15 30 45 or 60 minutes or less than 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 or 24 hours. In some embodiments the user or patient can elect for a quicker turnaround time for interpreting his or her ECG such as having the ECG interpreted within 1 2 3 4 5 6 12 24 48 or 72 hours for example which provides some bounds for the bidding period and the time given to the specialists for interpretation. In the event that no bids are placed on an ECG bundle the ECG bundle can be sent to a contracted group of cardiac technicians and or physicians i.e. specialists for interpretation as a predetermined rate.

In some embodiments the ECGs can be additionally sorted by location of the user or patient such that an ECG bundle comprises ECGs from users or patients located in the same geographic location or area. In some embodiments the ECG data can be geotagged to include location data such as GPS data which can include latitude and longitude information which can be converted to a geographical location or area. For example smartphones and other devices with a GPS receiver can provide the GPS data and can be integrated or associated with the ECG recorder. In some embodiments the ECG data can be geotagged to include location data specified by the user. For example the user can set up a user profile that includes location data such as street city state zip code and the like which can be retrieved and associated with the ECG data before it is sent for bundling.

In some embodiments the online auction house can allow the specialists to sort the ECG bundles according one or more categories. These categories can include the type of ECGS included in the bundles i.e. normal or abnormal ECGs and the geographical location or area associated with the ECG bundle. In some embodiments the auction house by default lists and displays to the specialist ECG bundles that were acquired from users and patients in the same geographic location or area. Additionally the ECGs can be bundled and sorted in the auction house by the date and time the ECG data was acquired. In some embodiments to promote bidding on older ECG bundles incentives based on the acquisition date of the ECG data or the time the ECG bundles was posted on the auction house can be provided. For example a time based premium can be paid on top of the winning bid price to the specialist that wins the auction. In some embodiments the premium can be between 0 to 100 0 to 75 0 to 50 or 0 to 25 of the bid price. The premium can increase according to a predetermined schedule based on the time that the ECG bundle has been listed on the auction house or the length of time since the ECG data was acquired or a combination of the two for example.

The specialist that wins the auction for a particular ECG bundle can be sent or provided access to the ECG bundle. For example the specialist can be provided instructions for remotely logging into a secure and HIPAA compliant computer system or database for access and retrieval of the ECG bundle. In some embodiments the specialist is contracted to interpret the ECGs in the bundle within a predetermined amount of time. For example the specialist can be contracted to interpret the ECGs within 48 36 24 12 8 4 2 or 1 hours. As mentioned above ECG bundles containing ECGs categorized as abnormal or critical can be contracted to be interpreted within a relatively short period of time such as within 1 2 4 8 12 or 24 hours.

In some embodiments the specialists can provide an analysis of the ECGs as part of the interpretation. The ECG can be confirmed or determined to be normal or abnormal. If abnormal the portions of the ECG that appear to be abnormal can be indicated and or notated with an explanation of the abnormality. In some embodiments the specialist can provide a preliminary diagnosis regarding the potential cause of the abnormality. In some embodiments all the analysis notations and comments can be entered directly into the HIPAA compliant computer system or database by the specialist. In some embodiments after the specialist has finished interpreting the ECG the specialist can indicate to the computer system that the interpretation is complete by closing out the ECG and confirming completion. In some embodiments the patient can be immediately sent a notification that the interpretation is complete. In some embodiments the patient is not sent back the complete analysis or the annotated ECG but instead is sent a summary of the analysis. For example the summary can inform the patient whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and can provide the patient with a recommendation to seek further medical attention if the interpretation of the specialist indicates an abnormal or critical ECG. In some embodiments the patient can also be provided with the specialists analysis and or the annotated ECG. In some embodiments the patient can be prompted or have the option to forward the interpretation of the ECG including the complete analysis and annotated ECG to the patient s physician or to a physician recommended by the computer system as set forth above. In some embodiments the physician that is forwarded the patient s ECG is provided access the secure HIPAA compliant computer system where the physician can also access the interpreted ECG.

In some embodiments the patient s ECG data can be stored in a database or on the cloud. As the patient acquires more and more ECG data the patient s ECG data history can be compiled. In some embodiments the ECG data can be integrated or incorporated into the patient s electronic health or medical records. In some embodiments the interpreted ECG data in the database or cloud can be used to refine the triage algorithms. In particular ECGs that were assigned the wrong category by the triage algorithm can be analyzed to refine the triage algorithm. In some embodiments the interpreted ECG data can be compared with other ECG data in the database or cloud taking into account data input by the user regarding the condition and status of the user during and or before the ECG recording.

In some embodiments a quality control system and method can be implemented to monitor the performance of the specialists in ECG interpretation. In some embodiments one or more reference quality control QC ECGs can be included in each ECG bundle. The QC ECGs can include either normal ECGs or abnormal ECGs or both types. In some embodiments the system scores the interpretation of the QC ECGs by the specialists. In some embodiments each specialist can have a QC score that can be based on all the QC ECGs interpreted by the specialist or can be a score based on the last predetermined number of QC ECG interpretations such as the last 5 10 15 20 25 50 75 or 100 QC ECG interpretations. In some embodiments specialists must maintain a QC score above a minimum threshold such as above 75 95 for example in order to be allowed to participate in the auction house system. In some embodiments the QC system can send the same patient ECG to a plurality of specialists and the system can determine whether the interpretation of the different specialists is consistent. For example the QC system can send a patient ECG to 3 or more specialists and if one specialist or a minority of specialists disagrees with the majority those minority specialists can be identified. If a specialist is in the minority above a predetermined threshold frequency i.e. the specialist can be excluded from participating in the online auction house.

In some embodiments the patient can be referred to the local specialist that interpreted the patient s ECG data if the patient asks for a referral or if the patient s ECG is abnormal and requires medical attention or further evaluation. In some embodiments the patient can be prompted to see a health care professional for further evaluation or treatment depending on interpretation of the patient s ECG. In some embodiments the patient can be referred to any local specialist and not just the specialist that interpreted the patient s ECG from the pool of specialists that participates or is registered with the auction house system. In some embodiments the patient can be provided with a list of specialists that are local. The list can include the specialist that interpreted the patient s ECG and can further include other local specialists. The list of specialists can be sorted by the patient using a variety of criteria including proximity to the patient availability experience patient rating score insurance accepted affiliation with HMO hospital or other medical provider network price of services and the like. In some embodiments the patient can be referred to local hospitals emergency rooms or health clinics. In some embodiments the patient can be provided with contact information and location information of the health service provider and can be given the option and ability to schedule an appointment.

If the user accepts the option to have the ECG interpreted and provides consent to release the ECG to specialists the ECG can be sent to a server and database where the ECG can be triaged categorized and bundled according to predetermined criteria such as level of concern as illustrated in block . Levels of concern can include any combination of normal abnormal and critical for example. The ECGs can be categorized and triaged by an algorithm on the server or can alternatively be triaged and categorized by cardiac technicians in a preliminary review as shown in block . The user can also optionally enter notes to provide context to the ECG including symptoms circumstances and location information which can also be provided automatically through for example a GPS device in the ECG recorder as shown in block .

After the ECGS are bundled based according to the predetermined criteria the ECG bundles can be sent to an online auction house as shown in block . The auction can be conducted according to any number of auction types as described above. Bids for the bundles can be received from registered and certified specialists as shown in block . The server determines the winner of the auction for each bundle according the rules of the auction and can provide access to the bundle to the winning bidder as shown in block .

Specialists with winning bids can be given access to the bundles through a variety of ways such as being provided secured online access to the bundle. For example the specialist can log into his or her registered account using a secure username and password and access bundles in which the specialist was the winning bidder. The specialist can then interpret the ECGs and provide the interpreted ECGs back to the server with their notes and comments as shown in block . For example in one embodiment the specialist can review the ECGs in the bundle through an online interface which allows the server to receive real time interpretations from the specialist as each ECG is interpreted rather than only receiving the results after the entire bundle has been interpreted. In the event the specialist will not have continuous internet access or will only have intermittent internet access the specialist can be provided the option of downloading the ECG bundle to be reviewed offline. When the specialist logs back online the interpreted ECGs can be automatically uploaded to the server or manually uploaded to the server. After receiving the interpreted ECGs the server can then store the interpreted ECGs in a database as shown in block .

As the server receives interpreted ECGs the server can notify users of the results of their interpreted ECGs as shown in block . In some embodiments users may be provided with just a summary of the interpretation such as whether the ECG was normal abnormal or critical for example and provide the user with a recommendation base on the interpretation. In some embodiments the users may be additionally provided access to the complete interpretation provided by the specialist. The user can also be provided with a list of local specialists that can provide additional medical services if desired as shown in block . The server can determine the user s location based on one or more factors including a location specified in the user s registration profile or location data attached to the ECG by either the user or automatically through a GPS based device for example and then provide a list of local specialists based on the determined location or locations. The user can decline contacting a specialist from the list in which the server can optionally update the user s electronic health or medical record as shown in block . Alternatively the user can elect to schedule an appointment with one or more of the local specialists provided on the list as indicated in block . The server can automatically send the user s ECG to the selected local specialist or the selected local specialist can be provided online access to the user s ECG via for example the user s updated electronic health or medical record as shown in block .
