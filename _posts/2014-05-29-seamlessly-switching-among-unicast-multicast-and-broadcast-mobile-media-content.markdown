A consumption profile may represent an ability to automate optimize and tailor delivery of content over a network. In an embodiment a network may include a wireless network. A consumption profile may allow for characteristics such as device characteristics network characteristics and the like rules such as operator rules and the like user preferences and the like location characteristics and the like date time characteristics content restrictions and the like to be applied. A consumption profile may allow the platform to match up content with devices and users over the network. The consumption profile may take into account static and dynamic information as described herein. The consumption profile may be used to determine the manner in which content is presented and delivered to the end user including by impacting ingestion encoding transcoding delivery search recommendations and personalization including for content delivery targeted content including ads as well as permissions and the like. The consumption profile may interact with and be implemented within a distributed architecture.

In certain embodiments tagging may be used to enable the snacking behavior. The consumption profile may allow for optimization given limited screen real estate.

Referring to a mobile media platform may include a consumption profile which may include a device profile user profile network profile encoding profile and content profile each as described more fully herein. Referring to a mobile media platform may include a plurality of consumption profiles . As an embodiment a consumption profile may be pluralized. Many consumption profiles may be pre configured for a mobile media platform . A consumption profile may take the form of a number of combinations of rules that together form the presentment and best quality of service delivery to the user. Through awareness of the environment a consumption profile may be selected for use.

The consumption profile may encompass the encoding profile as described herein. The consumption profile may encompass the device profile as described herein. The consumption profile may take into account variations in input file types and supported file types. The consumption profile may encompass the network profile as described herein. The network profile may include information regarding network usage rules maximum bandwidth IP addresses and the like. The consumption profile may encompass a location profile including current and historical and future predicted location information and location intelligence . The consumption profile may encompass current and historical and future predicted date time and content restrictions profiles and or information.

The consumption profile may take into account and or impact the user interface. In an embodiment the consumption profile may impact the sliders menus polls and the like included in the user interface . The consumption profile may take into account location information as described herein. The consumption profile may also take into account user preferences as described herein. The consumption profile may aggregate and or take into account any of the characteristics factors and the like discussed herein.

A consumption profile may represent an ability to automate optimize and tailor content delivery and may be related to a device profile . A consumption profile may reference a device profile may include aspects of the device profile or may include a plurality of device profiles . A consumption profile may take into account device features that may be included in a device profile. Device features may be determined by looking at a device such as a device connected to a network. Device features may include without limitation screen resolution network support media format support delivery format e.g. streaming http and the like and any hardware or software aspect of the device e.g. memory size browser software version and the like . A device profile and device features may be determined from a device user agent profile xml document such as a profile that complies with UAProf as defined by the Open Mobile Alliance. Accessing a UAProf compliant user agent profile may include receiving from the device a URL identifying a network location of the profile. To facilitate creating and maintaining consumption profiles a registry of user agent profiles or device profiles may be established by the platform for each device. A user agent profile may be combined with a unique identifier for a specific device such as a device serial number to further facilitate establishing and maintaining consumption profiles .

The registry of device profiles such as a registry of UAProf may be structured to facilitate consumption profile generation and application. The structure may include rule sets decision trees relational databases and the like. The structure may provide support for application level configuring of the mobile media platform to conform to a consumption profile . In an example available content may require a minimum display size. The media platform may use the device profile registry rule set to quickly determine if the available content may be delivered to the device. A content provider may benefit from a structured registry of device profiles by identifying combinations of features that may facilitate the content provider preparing content that is readily delivered to the device. A device profile component of a consumption profile may be beneficial in that standardization of mobile devices may be lacking.

A consumption profile may be related to a network profile. A consumption profile may include one or more network profiles or aspects of one or more network profiles that may affect consumption by devices connected to the network. The platform may define network profile aspects that may be included in the consumption profile . Alternatively the platform may convert network provided profile aspects to a platform preferred format. Converting network provided profile aspects may allow the converted data to be used across a plurality of consumption profiles for devices on the network. Network profiles may be different for different wireless network technologies. Consumption profiles may need to reflect these differences to best utilize the network technologies. Each wireless network technology may provide different capabilities that may affect consumption by devices. Operators of networks may have preferences for which of the features and capabilities associated with a given network technology they enable through their network operations. Although a network technology may support a particular capability the network operator may not want to provide this particular capability or may restrict the capability to certain users such as users who pay a premium for the capability. In this regard a consumption profile may include network technologies and network operations rules as part of a network profile. Therefore a consumption profile may abide by or enable enforcement of network usage rules by including the network profile. In an example a consumption profile may include requiring bandwidth sharing if the network operator or carrier indicates any one user cannot use the entire network bandwidth capability. In another example network operators may identify maximum file size limits for files being delivered over the network. This limitation may result in a file size maximum identified in the consumption profile that is smaller than that which could be sent over the network technology and smaller than the connected device could support.

A network profile may communicate to a consumption profile other network operator or carrier rules preferences and guidelines such as network preferred display resolution. A single preferred resolution may be included in a network profile or a plurality of preferred resolutions may be communicated to the consumption profile . Bandwidth demand on a network may vary and therefore the consumption profile may include parameters by which the platform may determine what portion of the bandwidth to utilize. In an example network bandwidth available for advertisements during a peak period may be limited more than during non peak periods. The consumption profile may include network peak period constraints so that media content delivery may conform to the changing constraints. In an example a network operator may impose constraints on file size during peak periods and the platform may recognize the change in constraints from the consumption profile and therefore adjust delivery accordingly.

Other factors that may be included in network profiles may also be included in or impact the consumption profile . These other factors may guide the fulfillment of objectives of the platform and facilitate optimal utilization of the network capabilities. In an example cost of bandwidth may be another factor. Cost of bandwidth may be represented by cost per kilobyte of data delivered over the network. To achieve a cost objective of the platform such as the aggregate cost of bandwidth the platform may self limit bandwidth usage based on the cost of the bandwidth. In another example the factor may be IP address and IP addresses for certain locations may be subject to rules that differ from those applied to other areas. The consumption profile may also assist with selecting among various networks that may be available. In an embodiment the consumption profile may help with the selection among the following networks for consumption of media on a mobile device operator cellular based wireless broadband wireless narrowband short range limited bandwidth such as BLUETOOTH and the like.

The consumption profile may represent abilities of a mobile media platform that encompass various capabilities of networks and devices. The consumption profile may represent a union of mobile device features and limitations with network features and limitations. The consumption profile may represent an intersection of the mobile devices and the network. The consumption profile may alternatively include all devices features and all network features including device features not yet supported by the network and network features not yet supported by the device thereby creating a highest common feature denominator associated with platform. The highest common feature denominator may be established from a network profile a device profile or a combination such as a network profile and a plurality of device profiles.

A combination of a device and a network may be uniquely associated with a consumption profile . Such a unique combination could facilitate automatically setting the device determining an encoding scheme selecting or generating a consumption profile and the like. The unique combination of a device and a network may further facilitate identifying the features of the combination such that the features may be automatically applied to generate a consumption profile . In an example a uniquely identified device such as may be determined by querying the device on a network may support display features that can be associated with the network profile to enable delivery of high resolution content. A consumption profile may exist for this unique device network combination. To utilize the relevant consumption profile the device display features may be automatically enabled through the network and content may be managed to comply with the consumption profile thereby enabling the delivery of high resolution content to the device over the network.

Automatically setting or adapting a device may be facilitated by a comprehensive adaptor mechanism that may support a variety of configurations of devices networks content and the like that may be available now or in the future. A comprehensive adaptor mechanism may also identify a device on a network that may support content available for delivery such as by matching up the aspects of the available content with relevant aspects of the device profile. Based on the results of the match up the comprehensive adapter mechanism may signal the device such as through the network to adapt the phone settings to enable receiving the available content. In an example if content is available for delivery over a network in a specific encoding and a device on the network is identified to include features that support the encoding the comprehensive adapter mechanism may interact with the device to enable the features that support the encoding of the available content. A beneficial match up may be tagged as a rule that represents a content profile. The rule may be provided to a device and when the device re enters the network the relevant features can be activated to facilitate receiving delivery of the content. Alternatively the rule may be applied during content delivery rather than being embedded in the device. The comprehensive adapter mechanism may match up content with devices users locations time of day and the like.

A consumption profile may determine factors associated with delivery and presentation of content. The factors may be related to features of the mobile media platform such as ingestion. The impact of a consumption profile on ingestion may include affecting what content is ingested how the content is ingested ingestion frequency ingestion preferences ingesting the same content from multiple sources and the like. A content profile may be generated from the consumption profile that may be used as a template for content sourcing ingestion and creation.

A consumption profile may impact what content is ingested so that the platform may preferably ingest content that is compatible with the consumption profile . Because the platform may only ingest content that is compatible or can be adapted to be compatible with currently applied consumption profiles different content may begin being ingested when a suitable consumption profile is applied. A consumption profile may impact how content is ingested. In an example content ingestion may be adjusted based on the available resolution of a device associated with a consumption profile . If a high resolution device connects to a network being serviced by the platform the associated consumption profile may indicate to the platform to ingest high resolution content for delivery to the device. A consumption profile may impact how often content is ingested. Ingestion frequency may be based on aspects of the consumption profile such as how many concurrent devices are utilizing the consumption profile . Ingestion preferences may be impacted by a consumption profile . A consumption profile preference for small video clips may impact the ingestion preferences so that small video clips are ingested for delivery to devices to which the consumption profile is applied. Content may be available for ingestion from a plurality of sources and there may be differences among the sources that relate to consumption e.g. resolution . A consumption profile that supports high resolution may be applied when a high resolution device connects to a network serviced by the platform so content that is being ingested from a low resolution source may be complemented with the same content being ingested from a high resolution source. A consumption profile could interact with a content delivery network to instruct on the most ideal source location for delivery of the content.

Encoding and or transcoding may be impacted by a consumption profile . Encoding may target a consumption profile to facilitate delivery to devices to which the consumption profile applies. A consumption profile may manipulate the content via encoding so that encoded content conforms to the consumption profile content delivery requirements. A consumption profile may relate encoding with content availability so that content that is not available in an encoding compliant with the consumption profile may not be visible to the user. Such content may not appear in search results. Alternatively the content may be indicated as available but not viewable through the user device. The consumption profile may identify alternatives for presenting content that is not available in the applicable encoding. In an example the consumption profile may indicate that text from the content be delivered. In another example the consumption profile may indicate an alternate encoding such as a composite type that may be partially compatible so that at least some of the content may be presented to the user. The user may be presented with an option to move to another alternate encoding to view content that is incompatible with the encoding indicated by the consumption profile such as by transcoding the content. The user may not notice an automatic change defined by a quality of service level policy and the like. The user may be charged an additional fee for this option. The user profile that may be associated with the consumption profile may include preferences or restrictions associated with such an option. These restrictions or preferences may be related to parental controls blocking techniques fee limits monthly charge limits content rating and the like.

A content encoder such as an encoder of the mobile media platform may include the consumption profiles to facilitate providing encoded content that meets the consumption profile requirements. A method of getting an encoding ready for consumption may be impacted by the consumption profile . Encoding required by the consumption profile may require specific tools to be applied to the content to provide the encoded format. An identification of the required tools methods and the like may be included in a consumption profile so that an encoder may determine which tools to use.

Encoding prioritization may be impacted by consumption profiles in that encoded content may be stored and forwarded to network operators so the content may be readily available when needed to be delivered. Encoding may be performed on an on demand basis based on a consumption profile . The platform may determine encoding required at time of request based on conditions of the device network environment such as type and bandwidth decoder format available on device and the like.

A consumption profile may indicate support for real time delivery so a source that provides real time encoded content may be associated with the device to facilitate delivery of real time content.

The consumption profile may impact delivery. Delivery may be optimized for mobile consumption as may be determined from the consumption profile . Optimizing factors may be based on a consumption profile such as factors that vary for each individual application of a consumption profile . Each individual application of a consumption profile may represent an individual usage session with factors associated with it such as location user preferences time of day available network bandwidth and the like. Other factors associated with a consumption profile that affect delivery include device playback capabilities device content delivery mechanism support content digital rights management regime content characteristics and the like.

A consumption profile may contain device capabilities and the device capabilities may impact delivery optimization. Device audio and video playback capabilities may require specific CODECs to facilitate optimized delivery. To optimize delivery the consumption profile may identify device attributes that may vary from device to device such as screen size color depth memory CPU power content receiving methods network support bandwidth support and the like.

A consumption profile may identify one or more delivery methods supported by the network and device to which the consumption profile is being applied. Delivery methods such as streaming download progressive download MMS WAP push and the like may be associated with an application of a consumption profile and therefore may impact the method of delivery.

The consumption profile may have an impact on search and recommendations. Search may be impacted in that results returned from a search may be constrained to content that may be delivered in compliance with the consumption profile . One or more search terms may be automatically inserted in a user search query to automatically limit the search to compliant content. Alternatively search results may be post filtered or ordered based on the consumption profile . The consumption profile may impact search and or recommendations based on user preferences or other data that may be related to the user a user profile a device profile a network provider and the like. In an example a search for Orioles Cardinals and Blue Jays requested by a sports fan who may subscribe to sports content packages may be impacted by the consumption profile associated with the user so the search results are ordered and or filtered so that results related to sports teams e.g. BALTIMORE ORIOLES SAINT LOUIS CARDINALS TORONTO BLUE JAYS appear ahead of general results related to birds. The consumption profile may include the additional search terms. The consumption profile may include a redirection to a search engine that optimizes search results for the device and network associated with the consumption profile . Recommendations such as may be provided from a recommendation engine may be impacted by the consumption profile so that the recommendations adhere to any limitations included in the consumption profile . In an example a recommendation for viewing a presidential candidate debate may be different for a device with limited video display capability or bandwidth than for a device with high speed bandwidth. The consumption profile may include guidelines preferences and requirements that may be provided to a recommendation engine for making recommendations.

A consumption profile may be associated with tagging. Tagging may include tagging content keywords metadata and the like. A tag may include a reference to one or more consumption profiles to which the tagged content complies. A consumption profile may include one or more tag IDs that identify content supported by devices and networks to which the consumption profile applies. Tagging may be an alternate for identifying within a consumption profile each type of content that complies with the profile. A tag may combine content attributes such as encoding resolution and the like so that the tag can be examined to quickly determine if the content complies with the consumption profile . A consumption profile may include a list of valid tagging methods such as RSS.

The consumption profile may be used with tagging and to enable snacking behavior in which the end user consumes short audio and video clip content as well as consumption of long form content such as full length movies and the like. In certain embodiments tagging may be used to enable snacking behavior.

The consumption profile may be linked to level driven encoding based on quality of service and may be linked to the user s presence and availability and preferences relating to the user s presence and availability. Level driven encoding may involve adjusting and affecting the encoding process in order to achieve certain levels or values for certain parameters. In an embodiment a parameter may be frames per second and the resolution and sampling rate of the encoding may be varied to ensure a certain minimum frames per second even during periods of network congestion or across slower regions of the network.

The consumption profile may take into account file types such as types of files that may be delivered to a device. A consumption profile may include a list of supported file types that may meet one or more network or device profile requirements. Alternatively file types may be parameterized based on device profile features to facilitate easy cross reference of file types to device features. A list of supported file types may facilitate determining the applicability of a newly provided file by providing a readily accessible mechanism for comparing the file type of the new file to the list of supported file types. A new file type that includes parameters that match a minimum number of parameters of supported file types may be determined to be supported and may be added to the list. In an example a new file type that is encoded such that the encoding is not supported by networked devices associated with the consumption profile may only need to be transcoded to be included in the supported file type list. A file type that is not supported may require different ingestion parameters or processes to be supported by the consumption profile . A consumption profile supported file type list may include standard file types that may be identified by their extension such as .mp3 .wav .mov and the like. File types that may be supported may include without limitation 3GPP MPEG4 Level 0 Level 1 and H.263 video codecs with AMR NB AMR WB AAC audio codecs mobile video transport format AVI RAW MPEG1 2 4 and Huffman codecs Audio Video Interleave format WMV ASX WMA v.7 v.8 v.9 WINDOWS Media format M2A M2V M2T M2P M1A M1V MPEG1 2 streams format MOV Sorenson codec QUICKTIME video format WAV PCM 16 bit 8 bit 8 48 kHz Uncompressed audio files format AMR MP2 MP3 AAC AIFF OGG Compressed audio files format and BMP JPEG GIF PNG Image files format. By using standard extensions a consumption profile may be configured to support all .mp3 files. Delivery protocols may include HTTP RTSP RTP MMS and the like. In an alternative example a consumption profile may identify a .mp3 file as supported only when it is encoded with a preferred encoding bit rate. A consumption profile may impact a user interface of a device to which the consumption profile is being applied. The consumption profile may include user interface parameters that a device may apply to a user interface. When a consumption profile is being applied to a device the device may automatically adjust the user interface to comply with the user interface parameters of the consumption profile . Parameters may impact any aspect of the user interface such as sliders menus polls screen usage and the like.

A consumption profile may include rules associated with location information about a device connected to a mobile network. Location rules included in a consumption profile may facilitate taking broadcast rights into account. In an embodiment the consumption profile may enable blackout zones for a sporting event. For example mobile devices within 60 miles of an arena may be not be permitted to receive video from a sporting event occurring in the arena unless the event is sold out. The restriction may be enforced by the platform through transcoding so that video content or composite content that includes video of the event may be delivered without the video component. Location information in connection with a consumption profile may be associated with the pause and resume functionality of the platform. In another embodiment location information concerning another device may be used to impact the content delivered to the user s device. For example if a user is out with his wife near dinner time advertisements concerning nearby romantic restaurants may be delivered to the user s device. In another embodiment proximity information may be used to delivery ads or other content such as to promote local businesses. A consumption profile may include a user preference to deliver content associated with devices within a certain proximity to the user s device. In an example a user agreeing to meet someone for drinks may receive content such as from public information sources about the person when the devices are within a predetermined proximity A business may enforce consumption profiles for devices provided to employees so that confidential information is not presented to a device that is outside a security area of the business. The consumption profile may identify a plurality of security areas such as remote offices a home office a headquarters and the like.

Broadcast rights may be supported by a location based aspect of consumption profiles . A user within a broadcast area may receive content from a local source when the device is determined to be within a broadcast range of the local source. In an example a user may view a NEW YORK YANKEES game through a local affiliate in Portland Me. when the user is in the broadcast range of the affiliate. Likewise the same user may receive the NEW YORK YANKEES game through a San Francisco affiliate when the user is in broadcast range of that affiliate. In this way local broadcast rights may be maintained as availability of content expands.

Consumption profiles may be associated with device location based technology. A consumption profile associated with a user who uses a device with GPS compass based or cellular based location technology may take advantage of the technology. In an example a device with GPS based location technology may receive content based a direction of movement of the device. As a user with the device walks along a street the consumption profile may direct content gathering to acquire content related to places or people that the user may come upon located in the vicinity of the direction of the user.

Preferences such as user preferences may be included in a consumption profile and may facilitate the platform complying with the preferences. Applying a consumption profile may result in preferences that are defined in the profile being automatically applied. Preferences that may be included in a consumption profile may include user preferences cost caps content item fees monthly cost cap fee cap on bandwidth and the like. Preferences may be automatically enforced by the platform so that cost cap preferences are carefully monitored to ensure costs are not exceeded. In an example a user may specify preferences associated with media video quality. The user may prefer high quality videos and low quality advertisements high quality sports medium quality news and the like. In another example a user preference such as maximum download or transfer time may be configured in a consumption profile and when applied may determine delivery method selected. If a cellular network download would exceed the preferred maximum download time then the download may be performed through a wireless broadband connection. In an alternative embodiment the user may be prompted and offered the option of performing the download for an extra charge or as part of an upgraded subscription. User preferences may include favorite actors sports sports teams artists and the like.

A content profile may be derived from a consumption profile . A content profile may identify aspects of content that relate to delivering content to a device to which the consumption profile is being applied. Aspects of content that may be in a consumption profile that may be useful in identifying content may include content type including without limitation long form short form advertisements talking head sports and the like metadata content analysis content tag content ingestion process content encoding and the like. The profile of content may be determined from one or more of the aspects described above.

A consumption profile may be associated with use cases. Use cases associated with a consumption profile may include a user experience with a carrier an application a video service model providing content to a carrier delivering content in any network condition and the like. A user experience associated with a consumption profile may be related to a carrier so that a user experience that is tied to a carrier may be attributed to the consumption profile . Parameters associated with the carrier and included in or related to the consumption profile may determine aspects of the user experience such as user interface access to network capabilities content availability and the like. A user may experience unacceptable performance if a carrier has established bandwidth limitations for the user or the user s device type in a consumption profile being applied by the mobile media platform .

A consumption profile may be associated with an application. An application may require device features that may be specified in the consumption profile . Content such as interactive content may include one or more applications or may require one or more applications to be operating on a device to access certain features of the content. The consumption profile may be adapted to include appropriate reference to applications so that content that requires the applications may be sourced and delivered to the device. A consumption profile may identify applications that enable features of a device such as broadband access. Through identification of such applications the consumption profile may facilitate automatically configuring a device. In an example when a device first connects to a network the device may be queried to determine the most appropriate consumption profile . The carrier may automatically configure the device through the network to support the network and delivery features associated with the consumption profile to provide the best user experience while connected to the network. The carrier may apply a consumption profile that provides premium features at no charge to a new user on the network such as during a free trial period.

A consumption profile may be associated with a video delivery service. A video service may utilize consumption profiles to determine a video delivery model that would comply with the consumption profile . The video delivery service may utilize the consumption profile to increase market share by making their video delivery service available to all uses associated with the consumption profile . A consumption profile may include a directory of video services that deliver video content that complies with the profile so that a user of a device to which the consumption profile is being applied may utilize the directory to select one or more video delivery services. An advantage of such an approach is the device user does not have to review video service device and network requirements when searching for and selecting a service.

A consumption profile may be associated with providing content to a carrier. A carrier may need to balance user wants of always best quality and always being available. One approach to providing the best quality may be for the carrier to always apply the best consumption profile . To balance availability the carrier may apply an alternate consumption profile that may support adapting delivery based on network bandwidth constraints. In an example an alternate consumption profile may facilitate ensuring a video advertisement is delivered as a high resolution video when bandwidth is available as a low resolution video when bandwidth is limited or as a pop up banner advertisement instead of a video when network quality is low. A banner advertisement may include text a static image a dynamic image active content and the like. A consumption profile may be associated with viral sharing of content. In an embodiment a consumption profile and or user profile may include destinations and other users for sharing of content. The destinations and users may include portals communities friends families business connections and the like.

A consumption profile may be associated with primitives composites and marketing types. The platform may be adapted to facilitate delivery of each type of primitive which may be identified by the consumption profile. The consumption profile may also identify which composite form to deliver from a plurality of composite forms of content available. By determining primitive related aspects of the network and the device from the consumption profile the platform may self select content composite form generate or form the primitives and deliver them to a device in a manner that is no different than accessing the content on the web.

A consumption profile may be associated with tagging. Tagging may include tagging content keywords metadata and the like. A tag may include a reference to one or more consumption profiles to which the tagged content complies. A consumption profile may include one or more tag IDs that identify content supported by devices and networks to which the consumption profile applies. Tagging may be an alternate for identifying within a consumption profile each type of content that complies with the profile. A tag may combine content attributes such as encoding resolution and the like so that the tag can be examined to quickly determine if the content complies with the consumption profile. A consumption profile may include a list of valid tagging methods such as RSS.

A consumption profile may be associated with network switching. Network switching may be seamless may occur while delivering content may be required to deliver content may require minimum device features and the like. A consumption profile may include rules guidelines and conditions for how to deal with switching among networks. A consumption profile may include associations of networks to content types to facilitate determining which network to switch to for receiving delivered content. A consumption profile may indicate criteria for switching networks so that switching networks occurs seamlessly to the user. Switching from a mobile carrier network to a broadband mobile network to receive content may occur automatically based on the requirements identified in the consumption profile. The consumption profile may indicate to the mobile media platform the networks to which the device can be switched so that the platform may select the content source based on the network support. In an example a device that supports both cellular and Wi Fi networks may be served through a consumption profile that indicates the device can support both networks. The mobile media platform may determine to send content over the cellular or the Wi Fi network based on various conditions rules and the like. If the mobile media platform determines that the Wi Fi network is not acceptable due to cost availability and the like then content suitable for delivery over the cellular network may be sourced and delivered to the device.

A consumption profile may indicate user preferences associated with network switching. Network switching may result in charges being imposed on a user so a user may establish preferences in the consumption profile regarding network switching to adhere to a cost goal or budget. Because certain features e.g. VoIP may only be available by switching networks a consumption profile may indicate user preferences that impact access to the features and therefore impact network switching. A consumption profile may indicate a minimum level of service quality to be provided across the supported networks. Service providers may determine the network and equipment needed to provide the minimum level of service and thereby decide to support the consumption profile.

A consumption profile may indicate the network technologies supported by a device such as cellular GSM GPRS EDGE HSDPA UMTS CDMA CDMA 1X EVDO and the like Wi Fi WIMAX UWB BLUETOOTH MEDIAFLO DVB H DMB and the like.

The mobile media platform may enable include and or be associated with a mobile content provision service that combines an on demand unicast or multicast cellular mobile content service with a mobile broadcast content service. In an embodiment the content may be video and television. For example the content provided using unicast or multicast may be video content and the content provided using broadcast may be televisions resulting in the combination of broadcast and unicast MOBILE TV services. Throughout content may be discussed as video and or television possibly under the name MOBILE TV but is understood to be any of the content types from any of the content sources and with any of the content parameters discussed herein. In addition in certain embodiments unicast may be discussed however it is understood that unicast may be replaced with multicast or the like.

In this manner a user using a mobile device may be able to switch between unicast multicast content and broadcast content which in certain embodiments may correspond to switching between on demand content and broadcast television content. The broadcast content may be linear programming and or live programming Technologies for delivering content such as television to mobile devices via broadcast may include MEDIAFLO DVB H DMB ISDB T DVB T DVB SH a cellular broadcast over an upgraded network a separate wireless broadcast network and the like. Technologies for delivering content such as on demand video to mobile devices via unicast multicast include 3.5G cellular networks 4G cellular networks WIMAX HSDPA EVDO EVDO rev A CDMA WIBRO FLASH OFDM cellular unicast over an upgraded network a separate wireless broadband network and the like. Delivery of content may be accomplished by sideloading which may involve a user selecting and downloading content in a wired web session on their PC or similar device and then transferring the content to their mobile device. Delivery of content may be accomplished by downloading in off peak hours. In an embodiment long form content may be downloaded to a mobile device during off peak hours when network traffic may be sufficiently low to allow increased video traffic without voice service degradation. depicts a possible embodiment of this service. In this embodiment the application on the mobile device may be a MOBILE TV application and the service and application in combination may allow the user to switch between the content provided via broadcast and the content provided via unicast multicast.

Unicast multicast and broadcast methods among others may be used to enable mobile content delivery or MOBILE TV. MOBILE TV may include a service that delivers video to a mobile device. MOBILE TV may be unicast multicast and or broadcast. MOBILE TV may involve various user consumption methods such as on demand and linear programming. In an embodiment MOBILE TV content may be delivered via a unicast network whereby video is streamed over a cellular network in which there is a one to one relationship between the transmission source and the receiver. In an embodiment video content may be delivered via broadcast. In a broadcast service a single radio signal may be transmitted to a potentially infinite number of receivers. Viewers who are tuned in to a specific channel may see the same video program simultaneously.

In an embodiment content for an on demand service may be sourced in the form of pre recorded clips. In an on demand service a user may select the content and play of the content commences from the beginning of the clip. Both broadcast and unicast MOBILE TV services may provide the ability to select content on an on demand basis to a certain degree. In a linear programming service a user may tune in to a channel in progress and joins the program at the point at which the program on that channel is currently being played. Linear programming content is generally sourced from either live terrestrial TV channels and retransmitted intact over the MOBILE TV service as a simulcast or it may be constructed as a loop of a series of pre recorded clips concatenated together to form a longer duration set of content that is repeated over time. Both broadcast and unicast MOBILE TV services may deliver linear programming. In an embodiment linear content may be delivered as channels over a broadcast network and personalized timely on demand content may be delivered over a bi directional one to one unicast cellular network. In an embodiment the user may not notice any difference in how content is delivered. The user may have a single user interface such as an integrated TV client on a mobile device to access all content. A unicast network may provide access to a catalogue of long tail content and the one to one nature allows for delivery of personalized targeted content. Broadcast networks may be complementary to unicast networks they efficiently deliver the same signal to a large number of users simultaneously and therefore may be well suited to delivery of short head content both long format and short format. In an embodiment using a combination of unicast and broadcast networks can optimize network capacity and investments.

In a certain embodiment a user watching a mobile broadcast of a linear live sporting event program is provided with a link to view pre recorded 5 minute video clip of an interview with the player who just scored a goal. The video of the interview would be served up on demand over the cellular network when the user clicked the link. After viewing the clip the user could be provided other links to allow them to choose from a list of other content that is available on either the broadcast or cellular networks or the user could choose to resume viewing the original broadcast. In this way the short head broadcast content can be used as a driver for users to discover long tail on demand content and vice versa.

MOBILE TV may also provide and or be associated with browsing recommendation and search functionality for on demand pre recorded clips and broadcast TV to allow for discovery of current and upcoming broadcast programming. This functionality may also extend to any content including content that has been recorded on a home or network based PVR or the phone s PVR. The platform may include and or enable PVR like capabilities in which the broadcast content is buffered on the device so that the user can choose to resume viewing where they left off or go back to the program in progress. In an embodiment the service may allow picture in picture display where the on demand clip and the live game are on the screen at the same time and the user can switch between the two via a single click.

In an embodiment a user interface for MOBILE TV may be presented through a unified MOBILE TV client application on a mobile device. The client may be enabled by server side functionality provided by the platform. The user interface may include an EPG similar to the traditional grid of linear TV or it may be less linear and similar to a streaming content portal. The user interface would allow a user to seamlessly move between content via broadcast and via unicast without a noticeable change in the user experience. The user may be able to directly browse and select linear and on demand content.

In an embodiment the mobile content provision service may provide recommendations for other associated content that encompasses both the broadcast and unicast content universes. A user will be able to personalize their experience by setting preferences that include favorite linear channels and programs favorite on demand categories favorite genres areas of interest notification settings and the like. The service may deliver targeted ads to the user based on a number of factors including the consumption profile their demographic info their preferences their location location intelligence usage history operator and device type. In an embodiment ads may be delivered as clips for inclusion as interstitials. Delivery could be via unicast allowing very specific targeting or with less granularity via the clipcast datacast mechanism of broadcast networks.

In an embodiment the service may provide targeted links to allow the user to browse to sites related to the content being viewed. In embodiments the links may allow users to purchase related content or goods and services via operator or third party storefronts. In embodiments the service may include community interaction functionality such as recommend to a friend send to a friend user rating and the like. In embodiments the service may include content localization functionality to facilitate restriction of delivery of content to specific areas. For example local news and weather reports targeted ads based on location as well as for implementing content blackouts of broadcast programming Content search and discovery may span across unicast and broadcast content facilitated using metadata. In embodiments the service may also include protection controls which may control access to content. This functionality may grant or restrict access to certain services based on specified criteria. In an example a user may be granted access to a particular channel or category for a specified period of time based on the amount of content the user purchased. Content protection may also apply to usage rights that are applied after the content has been delivered and determine how a piece of content may be used according to specified conditions and constraints.

The platform may contain an application that combines on demand delivery of video over a cellular network with live television broadcast content that is delivered over a mobile broadcast technology such as DVB H DMB MEDIAFLO or the like together into a single user experience. In one embodiment a user watching a mobile broadcast of a sporting event may be provided a link to view a pre recorded video clip that covers the highlights of the game to that point. Clicking the link may result in the application switching video delivery sources from the mobile broadcast network to the cellular network and causing the highlighted video clip to be streamed on demand to the user via the cellular network. After viewing the clip the users could be provided other links to allow them to choose from a list of other content that is available on either the broadcast or cellular networks. In another embodiment the application may simultaneously source content from various networks and or external repositories and integrate the data from these various sources in order to provide the user with a high quality experience. Additionally the content sourced from various networks and or integrated repositories may be related to the interests whether accumulated or point in time of the user. This may reduce or remove a need to search on the mobile handset. This process may result in effectively increased bandwidth.

Advanced encoding and or transcoding may be based on architecture that facilitates supporting real time encoding and or transcoding of content while also supporting cost effective and space efficient encoding and cataloguing of content for later retrieval by a mobile device . A mobile media platform may be associated with advanced encoding and or transcoding by at least aspects of the encoding transcoding architecture. An advanced encoding and or transcoding architecture may include pipelining and parallel operation of certain features to reduce encoding latency. A pipeline operation may allow content to be serially loaded into a first encoding stage while each subsequent encoding stage may receive a first output of the first encoding stage while subsequent content is serially loaded into the first encoding stage. The process may be repeated for a third and a fourth encoding stage so that latency from when the first content is serially loaded into the first encoding stage to the first content being serially delivered out of the last encoding stage is minimized. An advanced encoding transcoding architecture may also support on the fly encoding wherein content is encoded using one or more encoders with different encoding schemes when it is either presented to the platform or when it is accessed within the platform for delivery to end user. Architecture techniques such as caching may also facilitate reduced latency and therefore may improve user perception of a mobile media platform .

The platform may be associated with an advanced encoding facility . The advanced encoding transcoding facility may include ingestion of external content. Ingestion may be automatic it may be self aware ingestion it may include encoding it may include tagging and it may include various combinations such as automatic ingestion and encoding .

An advanced encoding transcoding facility may manage content that has been ingested by a self aware ingestion module . The self aware ingestion module may perform ingestion automatically for any content type and for any content format. Self aware ingestion may bring content into the platform in a format that is useable by the platform such as QAR format or RSS feed format. The self aware ingestion module may be part of the advanced encoding transcoding facility or it may communicate with the advanced encoding transcoding facility to deliver content to be managed. Self aware ingestion may facilitate normalizing content so that content from any type and any format may be normalized such as through recoding and format conversion into a format useable by the platform and or the advanced encoding transcoding facility . Encoding recoding and transcoding may be performed by the self aware ingestion module . Alternatively the self aware ingestion capability may be an attachment to an encoding process of the platform so that ingestion and encoding may be operated under separate constraints.

A self aware ingestion process may function as a web service or may function analogously to a web service. It may include encoding and or publishing capabilities or may enable such capabilities in the platform based on the availability of content. In an example a self aware ingestion module may automatically act on new content when new content is available such as through a content feed search capability content posting and the like.

A self aware ingestion process may determine automatically how to act on any content. Self aware ingestion may be performed based on the content metadata associated with the content aspects of the content source encoding of the content format of the content attachments to the content and the like. Self aware ingestion may determine what encoding recoding transcoding format conversion filtering and the like is needed based on ingestion parameters associated with the advanced encoding transcoding facility and or the platform. In an example a self aware ingestion module may compare the encoding of newly presented content to a representation of encoding supported by the advanced encoding transcoding facility . If the newly presented content is in an encoding that is supported by the advanced encoding transcoding facility then no recoding may be performed. If the newly presented content is in an encoding that is not supported the self aware ingestion module may order recoding from an attached encoding facility before directing the content to the advanced encoding transcoding facility . In another example a self aware ingestion module may determine that a transcoding process exists to recode newly presented content from it s presented encoding to a preferred encoding. In such a situation the self aware ingestion module may perform the transcoding to present the content in the preferred encoding.

An advanced encoding transcoding facility may perform self aware ingestion based on a trigger such as content being deposited into a location known to the advanced encoding transcoding facility . A location may include a directory an FTP site an RSS feed indicating new content an email received with the content or with a link to the content an email with an attachment containing the content an address URL port and the like to which content is streamed an address URL port and the like to which a notice of content availability is sent an external scheduler that may be linked to a guide such as TV guide and the like. A location may be location external to the platform may be internal or may be a handoff between modules of the platform such as between the advanced encoding transcoding facility and the self aware ingestion module.

Self aware ingestion may be performed on externally supplied or discovered content or it may be performed on content already known and or managed by the advanced encoding transcoding facility . In an example the advanced encoding transcoding facility may manage content that is stored in an encoding that is not compatible with a device to which the advanced encoding transcoding facility desires to publish the content. The advanced encoding transcoding facility may signal the self aware ingestion module to retrieve the content and take any action necessary to prepare it for compatible publication to the device. The self aware ingestion process may determine what encoding is present what encoding is desired what transcoding is necessary and may perform or direct an encoding facility to perform the action.

Referring to advanced encoding transcoding may encompass an encoding architecture encoding formats encoding profiles dynamic encoding self aware ingestion . Advanced encoding transcoding may also relate to advertising location intelligence consumption profiles content discovery tags content profiles distribution and devices .

Self aware ingestion may use an encoding profile to determine what action to take on content that it is aware of. Actions associated with self aware ingestion may be based on device characteristics such as device players codecs device screen size display color depth pixel resolution device memory size device processing power and the like. Actions associated with self aware ingestion may be based on characteristics associated with a network through which the device and the platform communicate such as network type network speed network bandwidth available for delivery of the content and the like. Similarly self aware ingestion may be based on device operator characteristics that may include content use rules policies bandwidth restrictions content restrictions and the like. Content characteristics may at least partially determine what actions may be associated with ingesting content by a self aware ingestion module. An example of content characteristics that may impact self aware ingestion is content motion type. Ingestion of talking head type content may be performed by a self aware ingestion module very differently from ingestion of live action sports movies advertisements and the like. To perform ingestion of talking head content may require less processing power and therefore may reduce communication bandwidth. A self aware ingestion module may signal system resources accordingly such as to optimize system resource utilization.

Aspects of a delivery method associated with the content may also determine what actions and resources a self aware ingestion module requires for ingestion of the content. Delivery methods may be based on content type because delivery methods may be different for a live linear source than for a clip linear source. Additionally live linear delivery may be broadcast type delivery unicast type delivery multicast type delivery and the like. Clip linear delivery may be based on a unicast type delivery. If the intention is to store the content such as in a database associated with the platform and deliver the content at a future scheduled time the self aware ingestion module may take actions to ingest the content into storage at this time and take additional actions to retrieve the stored content and ingest it using other actions for delivery at the delivery time. In this way encoding profile factors that take into account static and dynamic factors may be used by enhanced encoding transcoding and self aware ingesting processes.

Enhanced encoding transcoding may also be associated with self aware encoding and or transcoding of content such as video content. Similarly to self aware ingestion self aware encoding transcoding may be automatic. Automatic self aware encoding transcoding may be based at least in part on a consumption profile as herein described. Automatic self aware encoding transcoding may be based on content availability aspects of the available content acquisition of the content mobile device acceptance and or support of tagging format tagging related to the content or metadata associated with the content and the like. A self aware encoding transcoding capability may impact content acquisition and detection. A content manager with self aware encoding transcoding capability may acquire or detect content in a wide variety of formats and types that may be readily transcoded by the self aware encoding transcoding module.

A selection of carrier rules may be impacted by self aware encoding transcoding . Similarly self aware encoding transcoding may be impacted by a selection of carrier rules.

Other benefits of self aware encoding transcoding include content links can be syndicated such as an RSS feed and content may be composite content. Based on attributes of the composite content a self aware encoding transcoding module may select one or more of encode transcode deliver and the like when presented with composite content.

Self aware encoding transcoding may transcode and deliver on demand removing the need to have storage of multiple encoded versions of a file saving on disk storage. Delivery formats may be based on what the requesting client supports.

Self aware encoding transcoding may provide benefits when used with time sensitive content and may be based on the time sensitivity of the content. In an example breaking news may be immediately encoded whereas other news reports may be encoded only when encoding bandwidth is available.

Self aware encoding transcoding may also facilitate optimization of ingestion . Encoding may be time shifted or prioritized to optimize aspects of ingestion such as bandwidth processing power detection acquisition and the like. Self aware encoding transcoding may also facilitate managing and or prioritizing actions over multiple CPUS. Such adjustments associated with self aware encoding transcoding may be performed automatically.

Self aware encoding transcoding may be based on a schedule. The schedule may be an ingestion schedule. In an example ingestion may be performed as content is available but encoding transcoding may be performed on the ingested content based on a schedule for encoding. A self aware encoding transcoding schedule may be based on resource utilization carrier demand and the like. The encoding transcoding may be scheduled across multiple CPUs.

Enhanced encoding transcoding associated with self aware encoding transcoding may also be associated with job management. Automatic actions which may be considered natural actions of a self aware encoding transcoding process may be based on content type. Through job management encoding transcoding may be scalable to support greater throughput faster response time higher complexity of content more sophisticated transcoding and the like. Job management may be combined with a scheduler to further improve encoding transcoding associated with a self aware encoder. Encoding job management may also provide benefits associated with distributed computing such as workflow processing. An encoding job may be managed so that various computing facilities may act on the content as it flows through a workflow associated with the job. Workflows may include various aspects of enhanced encoding transcoding including elements ranging from content creation through ingestion and distribution . Workflows may also be represented graphically such as with a process graph and may incorporate user specified parameters. Workflows may embody constraints associated with ingestion optimization resource utilization encoding preferences and the like that a self aware encoding transcoding module may access to process content through workflows.

Content profiles may also be used by a self aware encoding transcoding facility to determine a type of content and therefore determine what actions to take. Content profiles may identify aspects of content that a self aware encoding transcoding facility may analyze such as metadata content type e.g. talking head vs. live action content tags and the like.

Self aware encoding transcoding may also be characterized by taking consumption profile factors into account. Consumption profile factors such as network characteristics features and capabilities device characteristics features and capabilities and user preferences and the like may be considered. In an example user preferences associated with video quality may be considered such that encoding transcoding ensures that video is encoded to provide high quality rendering whereas advertisement may be encoded to only support low quality rendering. Sports may be encoded for high quality while movies may be encoded for medium quality to satisfy display requirements user preferences and balance network other resource requirements and the like.

Encoding actions associated with a self aware encoding transcoding facility may be directed toward the network. In embodiments encoding actions may be optimized for network and operator characteristics including network speed bandwidth and other factors described herein. In an embodiment content may be pre encoded for shifting between network speeds such as to EVDO and 1X and back. The mobile media platform may generally be associated with encoding and transcoding . In particular content ingestion may include various encoding and transcoding features and capabilities as herein described. The following is an overview of various aspects of encoding transcoding that are described in association with various other aspects of the invention elsewhere herein. Encoding may be performed for a distribution network type for a device type for a delivery method may support various encoding formats may be embodied variously and the like.

Encoding for a distribution network type may include optimizing for network and operator e.g. wireless service provider characteristics or requirements such as network speed and bandwidth e.g. dynamic based on time of day or pre encoding to facilitate shifting between various speed networks e.g. EVDO to 1x 1X to EVDO and the like that may be encountered throughout the distribution network.

Encoding actions associated with a self aware encoding transcoding facility may be directed toward the device. Encoding for device aspects may include consideration of screen size content type video quality such as corresponding to talking head sports music videos and the like audio capabilities such as corresponding to the human voice music and the like color depth audio video synchronization file type device memory CPU device processing power or type operating system and the like. In an example a device may be suited for human voice audio output e.g. a basic mobile phone so that audio encoding of high fidelity music may be adjusted to gain the best quality of sound from the device. Encoding for a device may include encoding based on a device attribute such as screen size color depth memory CPU operating system and the like. Device targeted encoding may be based on an association of content with the device type. Device encoding may be based on video type e.g. talking head sports music video advertisement document audio type e.g. human voice music device file type and the like.

Self aware encoding transcoding may be directed toward encoding for a delivery method. Delivery methods such as streaming download progressive download MMS WAP push and the like may each impact encoding in different ways. A self aware encoding facility may adjust encoding based on the delivery method.

Encoding and in particular self aware encoding transcoding may support a variety of encoding and content formats. A self aware encoding transcoding module may support one or more of these formats 3GPP MPEG4 Level 0 Level 1 and H.263 video codecs with AMRNB AMRWB AAC ACC audio codecs mobile video transport format H.264 AVI RAW MPEG1 2 4 and Huffman codecs Audio Video Interleave format WMV ASX WMA v.7 v.8 v.9 WINDOWS Media format M2A M2V M2T M2P M1A M1V MPEG1 2 streams format MOV Sorenson codec QUICKTIME video format WAV PCM 16 bit 8 bit 848 kHz Uncompressed audio files format AMR MP2 MP3 AAC AIFF OGG Compressed audio files format BMP JPEG GIF PNG Image files format and the like.

A self aware encoding transcoding facility may be embodied as a MEncoder an FFMPEG encoder an MP4Box encoder and the like.

Enhanced encoding transcoding may be associated with automated ingestion in combination with encoding. Automated ingestion and encoding may facilitate detecting and acquiring content from sources of various quality. Automated ingestion and encoding may facilitate acquiring tagging encoding and packaging any digital format content for distribution to any mobile device . Acquiring content may be done through polling third party sites for content. The various third party sites may contain widely varying content formats that may be readily supported by automated ingestion and encoding. Formats such as video audio images text and the like are examples of content that may be managed by automated ingestion and encoding methods. Content may be submitted or obtained for automatic ingestion and encoding via an interactive web portal an FTP upload push or pull a Web Service API and the like.

Encoding may be embodied in one or more encoding architectures such as a flexible content encoding system that provides identical but automated ingestion capability to the mobile media platform but is extensible and scalable for the future. It may be built upon a modular component system that leverages a tree like data structure and a normalized object model to provide consistent interfaces across many services such as collection encoding validation and publication.

Automated ingestion and encoding may be based on a scalable architecture that enables handling a broadening number of incoming content clips and producing an even broader number of uniquely encoded clips for delivery. Automated ingestion and encoding may reference device profiles network profiles consumption profiles content profiles and the like to identify and execute ingestion and encoding actions.

Encoding may be a part of ingestion or may be done separately. Encoding may be based on criteria that are unrelated to ingestion . Automated ingestion combined with automated encoding may open or create new standard acquisition methods. It may also facilitate repurposing non mobile ready content for mobile use thereby turning the non mobile content into a more valuable digital asset.

A mobile media platform associated with automatic ingestion and encoding may relate to existing standards such as RSS. Automatic ingestion and encoding may be compatible with existing standards. Methods and actions associated with or resulting from automatic ingestion and encoding may provide material that may be added to standards such as acquisition focused standards. Standards may facilitate content generation being acquisition friendly focused. However an automatic encoding transcoding process that supports diverse content formats and types may impose no new minimum constraints on content providers while offering opportunities to enhance standards related to content generation encoding delivery and use.

A mobile media platform associated with automatic ingestion and encoding may work beneficially with a standard such as RSS. The platform may provide methodologies and or tags for using RSS to feed content based on consumption profiles content profiles device profiles user profiles and the like. Consumption profiles and the like may be useful in defining content to be acquired. Attributes related to profiles may be added to content generation and delivery on top of any attributes or specifications associated with using RSS. Such attributes may enable content providers to direct content by making the generated content RSS feedable to mobile user.

RSS may also facilitate using tags to enable auto ingestion and encoding. RSS tags may be related to publishing. Tags may also be related to content lifecycle. Ingestion may consider tags related to content lifecycle to determine for example how long content has been available. Other actions associated with content lifecycle tags may include when to stalemate it when to publish it when it was published when to remove it when to delete it when to archive it and the like. Tags may be used during ingestion and encoding and or may be passed through ingestion and encoding to be used by downstream resources. In an example a tag associated with content lifecycle may be passed through ingestion and may be stored in association with the ingested content. At a subsequent encoding activity such as a scheduled encoding activity the content lifecycle tag may be used to determine what actions to take. If the content lifecycle tag indicates the content is no longer valid e.g. it may be past an expiration date time the content may not be encoded.

RSS may facilitate device profiling in association with automated ingestion and encoding. Using RSS features may allow the mobile media platform to facilitate directing content to specific device types . The mobile media platform may take advantage of existing content definition and may allow an expansion of RSS standards to apply to content primitives.

Automated ingestion and encoding may support composite content through enabling encoding directed toward each portion of the composite content. In an example news content may be a form of composite content in that it may include images text video audio all of which may be synchronized. Because news content may need to be delivered to a device that may have capabilities that affect each composite content type encoding for text may require an encoding process that delivers encoded text that is targeted to the device and may be different than the encoding that delivers video targeted to the device capabilities. A mobile media platform may be capable of expanding composite content support such as to support further composite attributes. In an example a mobile media platform may use primitives to extract more benefit from composite content types such as in the ingestion and encoding processes.

On demand encoding and transcoding may be associated with the mobile media platform . On demand encoding and transcoding may be used with live linear audio and video clips large content databases with small disproportionate usage and the like. Pre encoding content with small usage may not utilize the platform resources for storing encoded content efficiently or cost effectively so such content may be sourced and encoded transcoded on demand. ON demand encoding and or transcoding may be used to deliver the content to the user device as well as generate a pre encoded version to be stored for later access. On demand encoding may be useful for large content libraries and remote sources. Generally on demand may provide at least medium quality output using a single pass encoder. Generic encoding may efficiently performed by on demand encoding transcoding . A hardware architecture for on demand encoding may yield very high performance with minimal latency. Such an architecture may be readily scaled through a server based modular computing environment that may support a high degree of encoding concurrency. Low and moderate content access frequency or high and sporadic requests may be handled by on demand encoding.

ON demand encoding allows the platform to rely on the content source server to host the content. In an example a user may direct a request e.g. search for content to the mobile media platform that causes the platform to gather the content from the content host server storage ingest encode and deliver the content to the user device. Example of hosts may include AOL YOUTUBE news sites TV and broadcast cable sites and the like. Another example involves creating an application that directly interacts with a content provider s website e.g. AOL to present a mobile version of the content provider s site. A user would browse search and display details of the content provider s assets directly from the website but would request the content through the mobile media platform . The platform would obtain transcode and cache the requested content from the content provider site whilst feeding the mobile device through a live or cached stream.

On demand encoding may be used with raw content that is stored e.g. hosted on the mobile media platform e.g. encoding host instead of content stored on a content source host server. In another example a content provider such as AOL would bulk download content to establish a base of content that may be encoded on demand. Updates and additions to the available content would be downloaded as it becomes available. The mobile media platform may encode the downloaded content and host it locally making it available to all platform services e.g. search personalization and the like . An on demand encoding mechanism would further reduce the latency between the time new content is downloaded from AOL and the time it is available for distribution .

Pre encoding of content may be beneficially applied in a mobile media platform content serving environment. Content may be encoded into popular encodings such as encodings based on consumption profiles of users currently connected to the network or currently requesting various content to be encoded. Pre encoding facilitates easier and more rapid response to requests for content. However pre encoding usually entails several sequential steps. These steps may perform multi pass encoding that increases the quality substantially over single pass encoding. The time to encode may depend on the load quality processing requirements and the like but may be slower than needed to support real time encoding. In an embodiment of multi pass sequential encoding outputs of a previous encoder are daisy chained to the inputs of a next encoder resulting in a delay before the encoded file is available for consumption. To reduce latency associated with sequential encoding while achieving equivalently high quality successive encoding stages may be configured in a pipeline such that the output of a first encoder is fed to the input of a second so that encoding in each encoder is offset by a small amount of time allowing most of the encoding to is run in parallel. The total latency may then approximate the sum of the latencies of each encoder from the first block read in to the first block written out. The total latency may readily facilitate real time multi pass encoding. To yet further improve latency from content access to consumption a live linear encoding may be run in parallel with the multi pass encoding to allow the content to be available through the live linear encoder even before the entire content is pre encoded. Once the entire content is pre encoded subsequent requests for the content can be delivered from the higher quality pre encoded content. Pre encoding may consume greater computing resources than single pass live on demand encoding so the platform may queue up pre encoding jobs and allocate off peak time for executing the jobs thereby reserving computing power during peak time to on demand encoding.

Pre encoding may be used for small to moderate sized content libraries. Pre encoding may result in high quality and high resolution encoding using a multi pass encoding method. Although a hardware architecture can support pre encoding it may be efficiently performed by a general purpose processing environment using software encoding algorithms. Pre encoding may improve mobile media platform resource utilization for high demand content. A pre encoding method may scale through a model based on resource prioritization bulk encoding regular scheduled encoding and the like.

On demand encoding may further facilitate in stream ad insertion for live linear feeds. Delivery of encoded live linear feeds may be switched to advertisement feeds while the live linear feed continues to be ingested encoded and cached for delivery at the completion of the advertisement delivery. Encoding methods may be combined during a consumption session so that delivery may be separated from encoding method. In an example live linear content may be encoded on demand and pre encoded advertisements may be inserted in the delivery stream.

Advanced encoding transcoding may facilitate distribution of live linear content with targeted advertisements by distributing a plurality of streams each with its own advertisement sourcing criteria and instream ads to individual users in a unicast distribution or to groups of users in a multi cast distribution . A single live linear creative content feed may be replicated through encoding and transcoding into the plurality of delivery streams.

Live linear encoding may be beneficially applied to live content feeds such as live events news and the like. A hardware architecture may be well suited to deliver live linear encoding due to the high input rate. An architecture for live linear encoding may be server based and therefore may scale well through distributed and parallel processing. A single live feed may be ingested by a plurality of encoding facilities and each encoding facility may deliver encoded content through unicast and multicast distribution .

A mobile media platform may be associated with content related tagging as shown in . Content related tagging may include tagging of content A metadata tagging B associated with content content container tagging C profile tagging D such as consumption profiles E device profiles F user profiles G content profiles H and the like and may be associated with delivery of content to mobile communications facilities . Tagging of content may be performed by a mobile media platform such as by an advanced encoding transcoding facility a self aware ingestion facility a self aware encoding facility a distribution facility a delivery facility a content database and the like. Tagging may be automated. Tagging may facilitate using rules associated with ingestion to setup encoding and delivery . Tagging may be used to propagate information related to content from one aspect of a mobile media platform to another aspect of the platform to a device to a carrier to a network to a content storage facility to a delivery medium and the like. Tags may be provided through a syndication feed medium such as may be defined by RSS. In an example tags associated with the mobile media platform may be provided to a community through RSS. The tags and their associated definitions values interpretations and the like may be included in an RSS specification. Tags may be used by a mobile media platform to help define the end results of enhanced encoding transcoding and other content management functions. In an example a device or the mobile media platform may poll a source of content based on tags associated with the mobile media platform . If a source of content includes content with the polled tags then the content may be pulled down to the device or platform. The device may poll a mobile media facility and use tags provided by the mobile media platform to help select content for the device. The tags provided by the mobile media platform may include attributes associated with devices users and the like. Facilities of a mobile media platform may tag content A based on consumption profiles E user profiles G device profiles F and the like so that the content may be delivered through RSS to devices.

A function that may be associated with content ingestion may include tagging content to establish a uniform basis for identification of content describing content and normalizing content with standard formats and descriptors.

Content tagging A may include multiple levels of tagging which may include tags in a physical file such as source content encoded content downloaded content uploaded content database content content attached to an email message or other electronic communication and the like. A tag may be an explicit component of a file such as metadata a header an inter clip identifier and the like. A tag may be an implicit component of a file such as an image tag in a live linear feed. An image tag may be a placeholder for content insertion such as an advertisement.

Content tagging may be automatic. The mobile media platform may facilitate automated tagging tag recognition decoding interpretation utilization processing creation updating and the like for content sourced by and or distributed from the platform. All functions of the mobile media platform associated with tagging may be automated. Tags and tagged content A may be automatically processed by ingestion encoding advanced transcoding delivery mediation settlement pause and resume and other features functions and capabilities of the platform. In an example content may be tagged during ingestion based on relevancy to one or more mobile user requests for content. Automated tagging may be subject to and controlled by restrictions and or rules associated with the tags tagging functions tag standards and the like.

Tags may include a name of a content clip an artist a genre a content provider a publication date a file size and the like. Tags may be useful in allowing a content manager to compile an album of content. In an example digital music songs may be tagged with an album name and the mobile media platform may organize the digital music songs so that songs with matching album name tags may be combined. Alternatively a user may request that the content manager discover content with an album tag and deliver the content to a user s device as it is discovered. The tags could then be used by the device such as a digital music player e.g. MP3 player to organize a play list of the delivered tagged content A based on the album name tag . Attributes associated with tags may be logical representations of content or information related to content as herein described.

Composite content may include one or more tags that are associated with each type of content within the composite. Also composite content may not contain tags that are related to content types that are not included in the composite. In an example composite content that does not include audio type content may not include tags that represent audio related attributes. In another example when content includes composite content such as news content that includes audio video and text may include audio related tags associated with the audio type content.

Tagging may also help address content management challenges associated with composite content diverse content types various encoding methods device and delivery network differences and the like. Tags may facilitate a content management facility in defining content in a way that relates to delivery to mobile devices without enforcing strict content management methods. Tagging may allow a mobile media platform to work with generic content such as media documents and the like. Tagging may also allow for light content definitions while supporting a wide variety of content.

A mobile media platform may facilitate an extensible model of tagging such as by offering flexibility and allowing continuous evolution of descriptors associated with tags . Tag model flexibility may be supported by tags not being content but rather tags may characterize content in terms of aspects that are important to the platform or delivery. As an example tagging may describe image size color depth and the like within the image file itself. These tags may include descriptors that may be embedded by a camera acquiring the image and delivering it over a network. Tagging model flexibility may also support the addition of new tags . Tags may be newly defined as needed or desired to support content management and delivery . An example of a tag that may be newly defined may be a camera model number tag attached to image content. As content is moved from a source throughout a network instances of the content may be tagged to facilitate distributed sharing of content. In an example a portable media player may receive a local download from a user s personal computer of content that was delivered from the mobile media platform to the personal computer. A content manager on the portable media player may tag the content based on associations of the content to other content already on the device so that when the newly tagged content is uploaded to the user s personal computer it may include the new tags . If the newly tagged content were ingested by a mobile media platform content manager the new tags may be detected examined and be included in a knowledge base of tags associated with the media platform .

The platform may maintain tags of significant and representative words in a media clip. These tags could be used to locate time places and seek commands to return or search for timeline ranges to continue playback. Tagging may be used to associate advertising targets and provide better relevance of association.

Enhanced encoding transcoding may support tags provided within content such as a camera model number within an image taken by the camera. A flexible tag model associated with a mobile media platform may allow for such use. A tag may also include basic descriptors related to content such as is the image a photo line art rendering cut from a video and the like. In this way tags may define image content more precisely. A flexible mobile media platform may support tags that may add content to an item. Some examples may include a tag holding text for a thumbnail image a location of a full size image associated with a thumbnail image the source of a thumbnail and the like. For content that may not be directly analyzed such as binary content tags may be used to provide metadata. In this way tags become vehicles for providing support and management of content that otherwise may be encrypted or may include text in any language and the like.

A content management facility may utilize tagging to represent portions of content in different modes. An audio track may be analyzed the speech or lyrics may be extracted and converted to text and the resulting text may be added to a tag and attached to the audio content. Such an application may facilitate translating content providing subtitles supporting closed captioning and the like. Also text tags may be analyzed similarly to text content. By building up tags attached to content the content becomes more readily analyzed and therefore may be more valuable. In an example an advertiser may pay more to sponsor content that includes certain words such as a vendor name or sports team name. In this example local news content that includes a story about a national sports team may be sponsored by advertisers who desire for their advertisements to be associated with the national sports team. The advertising may be automatically associated with the local content so that the local news provider may reduce costs associated with separately promoting their news broadcasts to acquire sponsors.

In addition to attaching tags to content tags may be attached to content metadata B content wrappers C and the like. The mobile media platform may support tags associated with content A metadata B wrappers C enclosures C and any other aspect or element necessary or beneficial in content generation distribution delivery management use and the like. In an embodiment a tag may be geo location data relating to the location at which the content was created or to which the content relates. For example a tag may include the longitude and latitude at which a photograph was taken.

When contrasted with composite type content tagging may provide more detailed and more extensive descriptions of content than what just a composite type indicator may provide. Tags may further support a composite profiling process such as to enable transcoding based on information in the tag rather than just on the ingested content encoding format. Tagging may provide descriptions of content in a way that is similar to how a news announcer provides descriptions for the images video or other content provided to the user along with the news announcer audio. Tagging may provide the rough equivalent of commentary in a sports broadcast. Tagging may also including functional data such as URLs addresses contact information actions and the like. Tags may include cumulative information such as access counts or download counts.

It is envisioned that new tags may be created to facilitate using the mobile media platform . Tags that support the mobile media platform may include front end tags e.g. identify the content middle level tags e.g. functional tags that may direct actions within the platform and back end tags that may facilitate customized user experience. Tags may also link up with other information such as information associated with a user including demographics location psychographics and the like.

Tagging may provide benefits to content discovery by focusing on ways of discovering and acquiring the content. Seeking content based on a tag or a tag value may allow better indexing of content and therefore may facilitate locating content. In an example if a user is interested in receiving content that is certified by a regulatory agency the regulatory agency may tag content that it has certified and the user may direct the mobile media platform to seek out content with a certification tag from the regulatory agency. In this way the content may be handled by a secondary filter or targeting facility after it has been discovered through tag searching. The agency may also use the mobile media platform to seek out content that includes a tag requesting certification. In this way content may be considered to be finding its own way from a content provider to a destination.

A content management facility may use tags to classify content into more descriptors. The descriptors may be tagged with appropriate uses and actions to take with the content.

Tags may themselves contain the purpose of the tag so that tags do not need to be predetermined into a limited set of tag types. A publishing engine may tag content to determine the content destination and content routing or delivery systems may identify the destination tag and thereby make appropriate routing decisions to move the content to its destination.

Tagging may also facilitate building community through attaching community tags to community designated content. In an example a condominium association may publish various documents such as a master deed master insurance plan rules and regulations meeting minutes financial statements association news bylaws and the like that may be available to the public but is most beneficial to members of the association. The content may be generated with an association tag attached that allows interested members of the public to receive the content published by the association.

Mobile media platforms may beneficially utilize and support tags to facilitate things like producing text from a soundtrack accessing content descriptors without opening and analyzing the content targeting network operators determining aspects of a device on which a recorded content was recorded and the like. By utilizing tags for physically representing information relevant to the content the tags may provide descriptions about the content as well as about themselves. In an example a tag that identifies content encoding format may allow an automatic encoding transcoding module to self determine what is being encoded. Without tagging the encoding may require the content to be opened to examine the content or a header of the content to determine the encoding format of the content.

Tagging may be more broadly applied to facilitate use of user generated content and or codec. Certain applications or tools are required to handle certain file types e.g. Excel is required to handle files with .xls extension in the file name . Without knowing the file type it may be very difficult to determine which application or tool to use with a file. Tagging the file or tagging the content within the file may allow a content management system to identify the correct application or tool for each file provided. In an example a tagged file that is tagged with descriptors of the file e.g. file size frames per second bits per second encoding rate and the like may be more easily handled in a mobile media delivery environment than an untagged file. The untagged file may need to be opened and analyzed to determine the relevant elements for appropriate enhanced encoding transcoding delivery use and the like.

A mobile media platform may manage content including adjusting or changing content to facilitate delivery of content and use of content by mobile devices . When variables of the user the device and content related categorization are handled by the platform tagging becomes an attractive medium for robustly handling diverse and broad content related information. Operationally tagging also may facilitate matching content being requested to information about available content that is stored in tags associated with the available content.

Referring to the mobile media platform may include digital PVR type capability including pause and resume of content being ingested and or delivered to a mobile user. Such capability may support resuming a content stream at a point at which it was previously stopped. Pause and resume capability may also facilitate error recovery that may interrupt playback of content on a mobile handset. A pause and resume functionality may be network based thereby facilitating supporting any mobile device without requiring changes to the hardware or software running on the mobile device . Pause and resume may be user initiated system initiated and the like. Certain types of content such as long form content may benefit from pause and resume functionality in that users may be more likely to access long form content knowing that they can pause and or resume the content so that the entire content does not need to be viewed in one session. Pause and resume may support various e commerce methods that associate content playback with an event such as payment or advertisement viewing and the like.

Pause and resume may be user configurable such as with a user configuration facility and user activated. A user may specify conditions associated with pause and resume that may be associated with a user profile and or a consumption profile . A user may access a pause functionality during content playback through features associated with a mobile device . A user may access resume functionality when content is accessed through a mobile device or other compatible device. In an example a user may signal that content currently being presented on the user device is to be paused by pressing one or more function data or soft keys on a mobile handset. The keys may be fixed programmable or screen based. When a user accesses content the user may be presented with options associated with the playback of the content including resuming playback of the content based on a pause related action taken earlier by the user the mobile device the network a server a carrier and the like.

A device related action may cause a user initiated pause to require reestablishing a connection with the paused content to resume playing. Device related actions may include battery power being low a unit turning off due to battery power a loss of signal a pause timeout exceeding a device determined threshold and the like. A network related action may cause content being presented on a mobile device to pause without the user taking any action. A pause associated with a network may be based on network bandwidth limitations duration of a session signal quality and the like.

Pause and resume may be algorithm based . Algorithm based pause and resume may be associated with e commerce advertising and the like. Content may be provided to a user free of charge and may play free of charge for a trial duration such as 30 seconds. At the end of the trial duration the content may be paused and the user may be presented with options for resuming the content . A user may be presented with an option of accepting responsibility for a charge that may be applied to a form of payment or may be automatically included in their mobile device usage bill for example . A user may be presented with other alternatives as well including without limitation submitting a form of payment such as through a payment facility agreeing to perform an action e.g. viewing a commercial taking a survey and the like providing demographic information agreeing to receive additional content e.g. advertisements promotions and the like and other alternatives as may be beneficial to the user the content provider the network carrier the mobile media platform and the like. In an example a user may have available a certain amount of credit in a prepaid credit account that may be used toward playback of content . Content may be played back until the credit account has insufficient funds to continue playback at which point the playback is paused. The user may be presented with an option of topping off the credit account to resume playback. Because playback may not be dependent on the user device the user may top off the credit account at a later time and resume playback any time after the credit account has sufficient playback funds. The user may use a payment facility associated with a user interface to perform payment transactions.

Algorithm based pause and resume may be used to pause creative content playback so that an advertisement or other sponsored content may be presented. Because the algorithm may be based on aspects of the session the user the provider the advertiser the carrier or the creative content there may be no need to provide specific support for advertisements within the content as is typically done. In an example creative content may be sourced and it may not include any special tags markers intersession breaks and the like at which time an advertisement may be inserted. Instead an algorithm such as a duration of play time between advertisements may be used to determine when to pause the content and present an advertisement.

The mobile media platform may include content review or analysis functionality that may facilitate placement of advertisements in association with algorithm based pause and resume . In an example an algorithm may identify a change of scene in the content as an opportunity for pausing the creative content to present an advertisement. Image analysis methods may be employed to determine change of scene. An algorithm may further include factors such as a user profile carrier preferences creative content provider preferences advertisement placement demand associated with the creative content and the like to determine pause and resume of playback of creative content .

Pause and resume functionality associated with a mobile media platform may include location based factors . Pause of live content such as performances or competitions may occur based on a location of a mobile device displaying the live content . In an example a blackout area around a live event such as a sports competition may be established to promote attendance at the event. A mobile device that enters the blackout area during live playback of the event may be subjected to the blackout and the playback of the event may be paused automatically. Playback may remain paused so that playback does not resume while the mobile device remains within the blackout area. Upon exiting the blackout area the playback may resume. Alternatively playback within the blackout area may resume after a delay such as after the completion of the competition. Other types of location based pause may include a mobile device moving outside a secure zone such as the interior of a building or a secure property. Certain types of content may be paused based on location of the mobile device . In an example display of confidential information may be paused when a mobile device is determined to be located in a public area such as an airport. Playback may be paused based on proximity of the playback device to other devices. Device proximity pause may be useful to limit unauthorized sharing of content preventing unauthorized users from potentially viewing content such as private content and the like.

Pause and resume may require no client side dependency . The mobile media platform may include one or more network components such as a server a streaming protocol server and the like that may monitor content delivery to a user so that resuming playback of content may be requested by a user from another device. In an example a user may be viewing playback when the battery of the mobile device dies the device disconnects from the network and the playback stops. One or more of the network components may detect the mobile device disconnection and may effect pausing the playback so that the user can resume the playback at a later time. The user may turn to a friend or co worker and use their mobile device to access the paused content . When the user accesses the content the user may be able to select the paused content for playback starting at the point when the user s mobile device battery died. The paused content may be made available to the user through a secure login for example. For example a user may pause playback of a video on his in car device via WIMAX and resume viewing playback of the content on his PC or IPTV at home.

Pause and resume may also be used to facilitate managing content sourcing . Streaming content that is being sourced from a first content source may be paused and upon playback resumption the content may be sourced from an alternate source such as a preferred source. In this way a user may select content for playback and the platform may adjust content sourcing to manage bandwidth costs and the like. In an example a user may request content and to ensure delivery of the content to the user is not delayed the mobile media platform may begin streaming content from the first source detected containing the content . However the platform may determine that another source such as a file repository of the mobile device carrier contains the content and that using the carrier provided content would benefit one or more of the user the carrier the content provider the platform a sponsor and the like. Pause and resume functionality associated with the platform may briefly pause the playback and switch to the preferred source to resume playback. Alternatively the platform may not pause playback but instead pause ingestion and seamlessly switch delivery from the first identified source to the preferred source using the methods of resuming playback as herein described. This may be accomplished by the platform identifying a point in the content at which the ingestion is paused and requesting streaming of the content from the preferred source at the pause point and then seamlessly delivering the content from the preferred source in sequence with the pause point of the first source. Seamless transition from the first to the preferred source may be facilitated by pipelining content from the first source to establish a buffer of content that is accessed until the preferred source playback is available.

Pausing and resuming playback may be beneficially applied to short form content long form content live content on line games video audio e books multimedia content and any other type and composition of content as here in or otherwise disclosed. Live content may be buffered such as in temporary storage during a pause so that playback can be resumed immediately by the user. If the content is paused for an extended time the content may be transferred to more permanent storage to allow playback at a later time while reducing platform resources that otherwise may be used for delivering unpaused content .

Referring now additionally to pause and resume functionality may be supported by aspects of the mobile media platform such as a Real Time Streaming Protocol RTSP handler facility . A RTSP handler facility may include a client RTSP request handler that accepts RTSP requests from a client. The client RTSP request handler may decode the RTSP into a request that a streaming server will understand. The client RTSP request handler component may also keep track of intended start time per request as well as information about the user. It may also translate the response from the streaming server. A server side RTSP IO handler may handle basic input output operations related to the streaming server. A session tracker monitor may maintain an in memory map of the active client connections the RTSP handler is handling. An RTP packet monitor logs the number of bytes transferred per stream per session. An embedded Derby is the repository where the RTP packet monitor logs and persists information. In an example when RTP data packets are transmitted to a destination e.g. a mobile device the RTSP handler may record the number of bytes transferred per track. On termination of a session the RTSP handler can transmit the total number of bytes transferred. A message driven bean MDB associated with the mobile media platform may receive this byte count and may calculate the position at which the client stopped viewing the clip. Alternatively the functionality of calculating stop and resume position may be performed by other aspects of the platform including the RTSP handler an RTSP proxy and the like. An RTSP proxy may be an open source proxy server that works with the RTSP in multimedia streaming reproduction. Its purpose may be to establish the conditions of an audio video streaming session. This protocol may allow a client to remotely control a streaming media server issuing VCR like commands such as play and pause and allowing time based access to files live broadcasts on a server. The streaming data may then be sent over other channels using other protocol such as RTP Real Time Protocol and the like.

Pause resume functionality may use a Multipurpose Infrastructure for Network Applications MINA framework to help users develop high performance and high scalability network applications easily. MINA provides various event driven and asynchronous APIs. MINA may support various transports such as TCP IP UDP IP via Java NIO and the like. MINA presents advantages over raw NIO protocol by separating Networking Code Protocol Codec and Business Logic . MINA may be used to form an API over which an RTSP proxy may be written. The RTSP proxy may be capable of accepting requests from RTSP clients translating forwarding them to a streaming server keep track of bytes transferred per session and the like.

The RTSP facility may be associated with a consumption profile a user profile a device profile and the like to enhance pause and resume functionality associated with the mobile media platform .

Referring to methods and systems of mediation and settlement are herein described. A mobile media platform may be associated with mediation and settlement .

Content providers such as creative content owners are continuing to look for new and broader methods of distributing their content and for opportunities to further monetize content . In addition the number of content providers dealers affiliates and the like are continually increasing. To facilitate distribution of content such as creative content sponsored content promotional content and the like an increasing number of content distributors are offering opportunities for marketing content to end users. Likewise mobile device service carrier continue to offer expanded networks capabilities services and support a widening array of device types and features. Content types continue to diversify essentially increasing the number of different types of content that must be handled by the distributors the carriers the devices and the users.

Within this expanding mobile content service environment a mobile media platform may facilitate a radical change in how content is sourced encoded combined distributed tracked mediated financially settled reported and the like. The user may benefit from the mobile media platform in that the user may receive more satisfying content at ever lowering costs. Carrier may benefit from the mobile media platform by gaining financial control over the extraordinary reach of their networks while facilitating a more open mobile content distribution and access environment. Creative content owners may benefit from a mobile media platform by better accounting of the uses of their content and near universal access by all mobile users to their content . Content sponsors such as advertisers may benefit from a mobile media platform by increased flexibility in ad serving without compromising ad reach or increasing expense for distributed but unviewed ads. The methods and systems of mediation and settlement describe herein may provide these and other benefits.

A mobile media platform may support a very large quantity of an increasing array of content types that are provided by an increasing number of creative and sponsored content owners to carriers that continue to diversify their offerings to end users. Mediation and settlement may facilitate normalizing the diversities created by the content owners content types carrier requirements and device functionality so that content view accounting tracking and therefore business methods associated therewith may be substantially improved. Normalization associated with mediation and settlement may include establishing and maintaining a media data record that may be associated with one or more media data events transactions interactions user activity automated content selection and serving and the like. Through the use of a media data record mediation and settlement may allow the business methods to accurately indicate content distribution related revenue that is shared by each partner for any transaction event for any application service at any given time and based at least in part on an understanding of the revenue sharing partners at the time of the event and each partner s quota in revenue sharing at the time of an event represented by the media data record.

A media data record may include information associated with a mobile content event or events wherein the information may be sourced from a wide array of record keeping and accounting systems. The media data record may be a normalization of the various data sources. Media data record sources may include different streaming servers such as different streaming logs that have varying formats content order recording methods and the like. In an example a media data record may content streaming data that is normalized from data from one streaming server that records a count of packets streamed and average time duration of each packet and from data from another streaming server that records a start time an end time and a count of packets. Both streaming server data records can be normalized in a media data record to allow mediation and settlement using the one and the other streaming server data. A media data record may include a wide variety of information associated with distributing and playback of content such as mobile content . A media data record may include content based information e.g. owner sourcing server sponsor length genre type encoding origination date modification date and the like carrier based information e.g. carrier name geographic region served network features used service plan and the like user based information e.g. demographics user ID preferences and the like device based information e.g. device type device capabilities and features status of battery power and the like ad based information e.g. ad server URL ad cost ad payment options genre target user ad type and the like and other information as may benefit mediation and settlement of mobile content distribution.

A media data record may include or may be used to determine viewing of portions of content associated with the media data record . Streaming content delivers content to a user device desktop or interface so that the user is presented the content as it is streamed to the device. A media data record may facilitate determining on a packet by packet basis which portion of the content was streamed to the user device and therefore presented to or viewed by the user. Therefore even if a user terminates a request for streaming content after only a portion of the content is streamed the mediation and settlement functionality of the mobile media platform may determine what portion of the content was viewed and associate the viewed portion with participants e.g. content owners advertisers and the like represented in the viewed portion to ensure accurate accounting for payment and or invoicing the participants. Referring to in an example a user may request to view content that is thirty minutes long such as in the logical step . However the user stops viewing after only ten minutes such as in logical step by canceling the stream such as by pressing stop selecting another function turning off the mobile device or closing the top of a two piece mobile device . The mediation and settlement functionality may access the mobile media data record and determine the owner or owners of the content streamed in the first ten minutes such as in logical step and take an appropriate action such as determine a share of revenue from the viewed segment such as in logical step determine payment for viewing of an advertisement in the viewed segment such as in logical step and the like. Mediation and settlement may also make note of content advertisements and the like associated with the unviewed portion of the content such as in logical step and make this information available to participants for purposes such as marketing research accounting reconciliation and the like. Revenue share may be allocated across many different participants and may be based on each participant s complex share agreement. In an example revenue share settled through mediation and settlement may result in 10 for each ad that is stitched with streamed content 30 for the carrier 30 for the creative content provider 10 for an external reference search affiliate and the like and 20 for an operator or owner of the mobile media platform .

Advertisements may be streamed to a user device in coordination with creative content . Advertisements may be served from a third party ad server and may be served directly to the user device without being distributed by the mobile media platform . In this situation the mobile media platform may have determined based on examining the content packets being streamed to the user device that an advertisement was served yet the source of the ad and the owner of the ad may not be directly known by the platform. To facilitate completion of the media data record either the ad server may notify the mobile media platform of the request service of the advertisement or the mobile device may report back to the platform which ad was served. Alternatively the information associated with the ad request and serving may be logged by the ad server so that the log is available to the mobile media platform . The information from either the ad server or the device may be near real time may be posted at a scheduled time or may be aggregated and made available to the platform based on an aggregation threshold being reached e.g. a number of ads served a cost of ads served and the like . Ad serving may be facilitated by using content that includes metadata as defined by the SMIL standard. SMIL is an example of ad aware playlisting technology that may allow the mobile media server or the user device player to reach out to an advertisement server to pull an advertisement to be presented to the user. A data collection agent may be associated with or operated in association with the media server .

The mobile media platform may include a Real Time Streaming Protocol RTSP handler such as an RTSP proxy that may analyze each packet sent to the user device so that an accurate determination of what content was delivered to the user. The RTSP proxy may also analyze the content to determine if the content is creative content advertising public domain privately owned licensed and the like to further facilitate generating an accurate media data record .

Mediation and settlement may be beneficial to carriers efforts to monetize their networks while opening them to additional sources of content . Mobile network carrier typically maintain content traffic tracking systems for network management to manage spikes and the like . Mobile network carriers tracking systems may not include application logic or content analysis capabilities that facilitate mediation and settlement of content value and network feature utilization with content providers. As carriers move from substantially closed networks in which they control all of the content provided on their networks to open access networks the mobile media platform may allow the carrier to measure network utilization and allocate costs to content providers as well as sharing in revenue associated with sponsoring advertisements of the content . Carrier may create new business models new billing plans and the like that may be based around accurate measurement of content value advertisement value and the like based on viewership of the content . In an example a carrier may sanction MTV to openly deliver videos over the carrier network. Although the carrier may not control the content being provided presumably MTV controls the content the carrier can receive compensation for the use of their network based on data in a media data record . In an example MTV streams a trailer of a new movie to users on a mobile carrier network. The mobile media platform may determine through mediation and settlement that the trailer is viewed by a minimum number of users and the carrier is notified by the platform so that the carrier may debit a planned amount from the promoter of the trailer. Content that utilizes a network carrier high bandwidth capability may be charged differently by the carrier than content that is served using a low bandwidth network. The media data record and therefore mediation and settlement may take factors such as bandwidth utilization into account when determining an allocation of revenues or charges associated with content distribution. Similarly mediation and settlement may be beneficial to a third party participant of the platform in facilitating settling their portion of the revenue share or costs associated with content distribution. Mediation and settlement may also enable third parties to make adjustments in their business such as if they were paying too much not paying enough and the like.

A media data record may be associated with a mobile content transaction such as a usage event an ad pull streaming of creative content requests for content and the like. A mobile media event may occur substantially within a media player. To facilitate capturing mobile device based media events media players may be directed to provide input to the mobile media platform based on the content provided and the media event. By accepting a stream of privately owned content a user may also agree to allow the media player to report mobile media events such as replay fast forward and other events associated with the stream.

Participants may access information associated with mediation and settlement through a self care interface such as a graphical user interface a program interface e.g. an API and the like. A self care interface may make information available so that participants may react to information as it is gathered and normalized in one or more of real time daily weekly based on a threshold associated with mediation and settlement and the like.

Media such as a video may first be supplied to the media platform through a feed and content drop off . Ingestion of the content into the media platform may include a collection agent that parses RSS feed and content to collect physical files including content and advertisements. As a result the collection agent may be able to provide updates for advertisements and content information to the consumption data store . The reception of new content may then initiate video encoding to start. The video encoder after completing encoding may upload encoded advertisements and video to the streaming server .

In embodiments user consumption of the content may include a web application for looking up content and advertisements by identification number generating playlists and configuration files for streaming and initiating streaming execution. In addition reports may be generated in association with the content consumption. Other components within the media platform may include a content advertisement and consumption data storage a file system an SFTP drop off server application server and the like. In addition third party components may include an ad server database a user profile database a WAP deck for interfacing with user handsets and the like. In embodiments the user interface may be directed from the media platform or made through third party environments.

In embodiments ingestion may use a collection agent and involve the ingesting of advertisements and video. The preconditions for the use of the collection agent may include the successful placement of content in the drop off folder where the collection agent may then pick up the feed update content and advertisement data store for mapping parse the feed pass video to encoder and the like. The encoder may then be initiated for the start of encoding where raw videos may use specified encoding profiles. When encoding is complete the encoder may place new video in a folder for publishing on the streaming server . At this point in the process the content and advertisements may be available for viewing and streaming to users handsets .

In embodiments a user may request a playlist for content consumption through a third party where an action code subscriber ID content list and the like may be submitted via HTTP. The process may include a plurality of steps such as checking the content database to look up a content file name by ID checking the streaming folder to determine if requested contents are available generating playlist files from a request determining which port to use for streaming generating configuration executing a command to create streaming insertion of consumption records including playlist and subscriber ID returning success or failure response back the third party and the like.

The media platform may be multi capability componentized and provide many essential services for wireless applications such as for content ingestion from users content consumption by users and usage reporting. provides a high level block diagram for the media platform where a content API servlet may interface with content management and ingestion services providing data access components that may further interface with an open video database . In turn the file system may interface with the streaming server the encoder and the collection agent and interface back with the data access components . In embodiments the collection agent may represent the demarcation point between the media platform and the third party environments where a specific collection agent may serve many content categories and advertisements such as for news fun sport music USC advertising contents and the like.

In embodiments the encoding process may include a content duration extraction. In this case the encoder may be required to analyze the duration of the sources content. A new set of instructions may need to be executed before the encoding process begins. In addition a new tag may be added to support the duration extraction. In embodiments the encoding process may include various encoding profiles and the encoder may be capable of supporting additional profiles where new profiles may be added manually to the configuration file video converter when required. An encoding profile may be a set of instructions that may need to be executed in order to encode a raw media file source to an encoded media file destination . An encoding profile may have a tag where each profile may contain a name network type and encoding configuration settings. Tags may contain actual commands that run through the operating system command line. Every parameter tag may contain an ID attribute which may be a sequence number the command is run in. Commands may be enclosed since they may contain characters that have corrupt XML syntax. In addition tokens may be used and replaced with actual values at runtime.

In embodiments the media platform may include a servlet . With the servlet the client may use multiple action codes to request information from the server side. The content consumption servlet may take in action codes while capturing the transaction method that is getting a file or posting a file and a success or failure response may also be sent back to the client. In embodiments the servlet may include content management. There may be content managers interfaces with their corresponding implementation classes used to manage content in the database i.e. store delete and modify content and content browsers again interfaces with their corresponding implementation classes used to retrieve content stored in the database. In embodiments content browsers may mostly be used by the servlet to hand data over to third party components. Client requests may come in URL format with parameters tagged to the base URL of the Servlet as name value pairs. Data may be sent by the content servlet to the client in a format with the URL where the action IDs used in the requests may be static values agreed upon between the client and the server and representative of the application operations.

In embodiments action types may use and may include playlist requests content availability checks and the like. Playlist requests may list the ID for advertisements or content to be played in the requested order and the subscriber ID and playlist information may be stored in data store for reporting. A content availability check may be an advertisement or content being checked for being ingested in the system. A content Consumption API may respond by using HTTP response status codes with a body message. Standard HTTP response codes may be used with the addition of media platform response codes. Examples of response codes may include success content not found invalid request parameter service unavailable internal server error consumption record cannot be generated database connection problem playlist cannot be generated SDP cannot be generated and the like.

In embodiments the media platform may include reporting of customer and content consumptions for streaming. The report may include a customer ID which may be from the third party playlist date time duration of viewing time and the like. To fulfill the requirements data may be captured from steaming log files and consumption records which may have generated when the request came from the third party. An example of a log file may be 

In embodiments the media platform may also contain consumption records. Consumption records may be database records that may be generated during content consumption. A consumption record may include a playlist ID subscriber id a list of guidance Ids and the like.
